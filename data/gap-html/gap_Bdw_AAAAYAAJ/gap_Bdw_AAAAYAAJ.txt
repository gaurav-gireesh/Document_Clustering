TO MR CADELL IN THE STRAND 1797 fttff IDG 2 01 Y PREFACE TITUS LFVIUS the illuftrious Author of the Roman Hiftory defcended from a noble family in Rome and was born at Pata vium now called Padua in Italy in the 694th year of Rome fifty eight years before the com mencement of the Chriftian aera Like many other literary men his life waÂ contemplative rather than adiive very few particulars therefore concerning him have come down to us He refided at Rome for a confiderable time where he was much noticed and highly honoured by Auguftus to whom he was previoufly known it is faid by fome writings which he had dedicated to him Seneca however is fllent upon the fubject of this fuppofed dedication though he mentions the work itfelf which he fays confifted of moral and philofophical dialogues He appears to have conceived the project of writing his hiftory immediately upon his fettling at Rome or perhaps he came thither for the purpofe of collecting the neceflary ma terials for that great work Auguftus appointed him preceptor to his grandion Claudius afterwards emperor But he feems not much to have attended to the advantages which might have refulted from fo A a advan ir PREFACE advantageous a connexion and to have occu pied himfclf entirely in the compofition of his hiftory parts of which as they were finiflied he read to Auguftus and Mecaenas Diftracled with the tumult and difgufted it may be with the intrigues and cabals of Rome he fought retirement and tranquillity in the beautiful country and delightful climate of Naples Here enjoying uninterrupted literary eafe and quiet he continued his labour and rinifhed his work comprifing in an hundred and forty two books the hiftory of Rome from the foundation of that city to the death of Drufus containing a period of feven hun dred and forty three years ending nine years before the birth of our Saviour Having com pleted this great work he returned to fpend the remainder of his days in his native country where he died A D 17 at the age of feventy five years What family he left behind him is not known Quintilian however mentions that he had a fon for whofe inftruction he drew up fome excellent obfervations on rhetoric and there is alfo reafon to fuppofe that he had a daughter married to Lucius Magius an orator who is advantageoufly fpoken of by Seneca How highly his works were eftemed and himfelf perfonally honoured and refpe ed may be gathered from the manner in which he is mentioned by many ancient authors Tacitus tells us that  T Livius that admirable hifto rian not more diitinguifhed by his eloquence  Anna ir 34 than PREFACE  than by his fidelity was fo lavim in his praife of Pompey that Auguftus called him the Pom peian and yet his friendfhip for him was un alterable The younger Pliny informs us  that  a certain inhabitant of the city of Cadiz was fo ftruck with the illuftrious character of Livy that he travelled to Rome on purpofe to fee that great genius and as foon as he had fatisfied his curiofity returned home Of the hundred and forty two books of which the hiftory of Rome originally confifteoy thirty five only have come down to us The contents of the whole the hundred and thirty feventh and eighth excepted have been pre ferved compiled as fome without any good reafon have fuppofed by Livy himfelf while others with equal improbability have afferted them to be the work of Lucius Florus an au thor of a portion of Roman hiftory Whoever may have been the compiler a fact as ufelefs as it is now impoffible to afcertain they are highly curious and although they contain but a faint outline yet they ferve to convey fome idea of the original and greatly excite regret at the lofs of fo large a portion of this valuable work The parts of this hiftory which we now pof fefs are the firft decade for it appears from his having prefixed feparate prefatory introduc tions to each portion that the author had di vided his work into diftinÂ t parts confuting each of ten books The firft decade commences with the foundation of the city of Rome and ra pidly runs over the affairs of four hundred and â Ep II 3 A 3 fixty Â t PREFACE fixty years The fecond decade is loft it com prifed a period of feventy five years the prin cipal occurrence in it was the firft Punic war in which the Romans after a long and arduous ftruggle were finally victorious The third decade is extant it contains a particular and well detailed account of the fecond Punic war the longeft as our author himfelf obferves and the moft hazardous war the Romans had ever been engaged in in the courfe of which they gained fo many advantages and acquired fo much military experience that no nation was ever able afterwards to withftand them The fourth decade contains the Macedonian war againft Philip and the Afiatic againft An tiochus Thefe are related at confiderable length infomuch that the ten books comprife a fpace of twenty three years only Of the fifth decade the five firft books only remain and thefe very imperfect They give an account of the war with Perfeus king of Macedonia who gains feveral advantages againft the Romans but is at length fubdued and his kingdom reduced to the form of a Roman province of the cor ruption of feveral Roman governors in the ad miniftration of the provinces and their punifh ment and of the third Punic war which lafteJ only five years Of the remaining books it has been already faid that the contents only have been preferv cd and they ferve to ihew us the greatnefs of our lofs the greateft literary lofs perhaps owing to the ravages of the time Livy had employed forty live books in the hiftory of PREFACE fii of fix centuries but fo many fo various and fo interefting were the events which he had before him for felettion in the latter period of the Republic that it took him above dou ble that number to relate the occurrences of little more than an hundred and twenty years From the admirable manner in which he has written the former part of his Hiftory we may Judge of what muft have been the merit of this latter part whichfails us unfortunately at a moft remarkable period when rational curiofity is raifed to the higheft pitch Nor can we doubt the excellence of its execution when we con fider how much better and how much more copious his materials muft have been for be fides what he could draw from his own per fonal knowledge having lived among and converfed familiarly with the moft coniider able men in the empire who were themfelves principal actors in the important tranfactions which he relates he had accefs to the beft pof fible written materials to the memoirs of Sylla Casfar Labienus Pollio Auguftus and many others which were then extant What would we not give for the picture fmifhed by fo able a hand from the fketches of fuch mafters What delight would it not afford us to fee the â whole progrefs of a free Government from li berty to fervitude the whole feries of caufes and effects apparent and real public and pri vate thofe which all men faw and all good men oppofed and lamented at the time and thofe which were fo difguifed to the prejudices to the partialities of a divided people and even  to PREFACE to the corruption of mankind that many did not and that many could pretend they did not difcern them till it was too late to refift them I own fays a noble Author  I fhould be glad to exchange what we have of this Hiftory for what we have not  Much as our Hiftorian was admired and highly as he was refpe ed yet he was not without his detractors He was charged with Patavinity in his writings The firft perfon who brought this charge againft him feems to have been Afinius Pollio a polite and elegant writer and a diftinguiihed ornament of the age of Auguftusf â In what this Pativinity confided no ancient author having defined it it is not now eafy to fay and accordingly it is a matter which has been much difputed Some will have it that it was a political term and that it fignified an attachment to the Pompeian party others con tend that it meant a hatred to the Gauls that it was fymbolical of ibme blameable particu larity they know not what The more pro bable opinion however feems from the term itfelf to be that it fignified fome provincial peculiarity of dialed Ancient Italy like mo dern Italy had its differences not of idiom merely but of language in every different province In proportion as their language va ries at this day from the purity of the Tufcan dialect they become almoft unintelligible to each other with difficulty can a Venetian and a Neopolitan co nverfe together that is the  Bolingbroke f QuintU Inftit i 5 viil i people PREFACE ix people for the well educated in every coun try learn to fpeak and write the dialed of the metropolis although if brought up in their own provinces however nearly their language may approach the purity of that of the capital yet it will ever retain fome tindture of pro vinciality If this fuppofition of the meaning of the word Patavinity be right the fact upon fuch authority as that of Pollio muft be admitted although in what precifely it confuted it is not at prefent perhaps poflible to determine Much has been written upon the fubject which in reality feems now to be an idle inquiry and as a difiertation upon this matter could afford neither inftru ion nor entertainment to the mere Englifh reader for whofe ufe the fol lowing Tranflation is principally intended we fhall difmifs the fubjeft with obferving that what Quintilian has not told us no modern Scholar will ever have penetration enough to difcover and we may be alto allowed to fup pbfe that whatever thefe peculiarities may have been as that great Critic has not thought them worth pointing out they cannot have been either very numerous or of very material con fequence  Nor will perhaps another objection made by modern crities be deemed of much greater weight They diflike it feems the plan of his Hiftory and they found that diflike chiefly on the fpeeches which he fo frequently introduces which they contend it is not probable could have been fpcken upon the oacafions alleged j and x PREFACE and therefore they pronounce them to be viola tions of truth That many of them were not fpoken by the perfons to whom they are afcribed nor upon the occafions alleged muft be admitted but they do not upon that ac count violate the truth of hiftory Nobody can fuppofe that our author ever meant to im pofe upon his readers and to make them be lieve that what he has given us as faid by the different perfons whom he introduces was really faid by them the fuppofition is abfurd He could only mean to vary his ftyle and to enliven and embellim matter which if con tinued in the even and unvaried tone of nar ration would be fometimes heavy and tedious and this he often does in a very pleafmg man ner making thele fuppofed fpecches a vehicle for conveying and that in a very lively man ner the arguments for and againft a propofed meafure and he often brings into them a re lation of facts chiefly facts of remoter times in a much more agreeable manner than he could have interwoven them into his narrative which fhould always be progreflive Modern hifto rians it is true have rejected this plan but Livy is not therefore reprehenfible becaufe he does not conform himfelf to their ideas of hiftoric ftructure but chofe rather to conform himfelf to a cuftom which prevailed very ge nerally before his time and which fucceeding writers of great tafte and judgment have ap proved and adopted The conduct of Livy in this refpect if necefiary might be juftified by the example of Herodotus Xenophon Polybius Salluft PREFACE xi Salluft Tacitus and others whofe hiftories abound with ipeechcs Thefe fpeeches fre quently give a more perfect idea of the cha racter of the fuppofed fpeaker than could eafily have been done by mere defcription and it muft be acknowledged that the facts which they fometimes contain and the arguments they urge would if thrown into formal narrative and as they muft often be or they could not be introduced into epifodes and digreffions lofe much of their animation and force and with them much of their grace and beauty When we confider the ufe thus made of them we hall not perhaps feel inclined to give them up although obliged to confider many of them as mere fictions contrived however with much ingenuity and for the laudable purpofe of con veying ufeful refledlions and falutary admoni tions But though it be admitted that many of them are fictitious yet it may be contended that they are not all fo Many of thofe de livered in the fenate in popular aflemblies in Conventions of ambaflkdors and other the like occafions are moft probably genuine and if they are fo they furnifh us with very curious fpecimens of ancient eloquence Many public fpeakers among the Romans were in the habit of publifhing their fpeeches upon particular occafions and others delivered upon import ant occurrences would doubtlefs be noted down and circulated by thofe who were curious about and probably interefted in the pccafions of them We know that in our own times Jill PREFACE times the fubftance of fpeeches in the Britifti parliament and other aflemblies has often been accurately collected and carefully preferved and we may therefore reafonably fuppofe that fpeeches in the Roman fenate upon fubjects in which the whole community were deeply interefted would be heard with equal attention and preferved with equal care A charge of a very heavy nature has been brought againft our Author which were it well founded would utterly difqualify him from writing a credible hiftory He is accufed of fuperftitious credulity That he was of a fe rious and religious turn of mind is fufficiently apparent from many paflages in his Hiftory in which he feverely reprehends the licendoufnefs and profligacy of the times he lived in and ap plauds the fimplicity of conduct and fanctity of manners of ancient times when that dif regard of the gods which prevails in the pre  fent age had not taken place nor did every one by his own interpretations accommodate oaths and the laws to his particular views but rather adapted his practice to them Again fpeaking of Spurius Papirius he defcribes him as a  youth born in an age when that fort of learning which inculcates contempt of the gods was yet unknown Numberlefs paflages to this effect might be cited fuffice it how ever to obferve that he omits no opportunity of applauding good and pious actions and of reprehending with ftrong indignation the pro fane the impious and the immoral  B iii 46 f B x 40 But PREFACE But to be religious is one thing to be fu perftitious is another He has certainly re corded many and monftrous prodigies to enumerate which would be both tedious and difgHfting As however they were not merely the fubjecT of popular tales and vulgar con verfation but the objects of public attention noticed always by the magiftrates and often by the fenate whom we frequently find order ing expiations of them it was his duty as an hiftorian to relate them fince they thus made a part of the public tranfactions of the times And this he does with particular caution ap parently anxious left he fhould be fuppofed to believe in fuch abfurdities and protefting as it were againft the imputation of fuperftition Thus upon an occafion where he relates more and more extraordinary prodigies than in any other part of his Hiftory he introduces his ac count of them by faying  Numerous pro digies were reported to have happened this year and the more they were credited by fimple and fuperftidous people the more fuch ftories multiplied  He generally introduces the mention of them with a referve as to his own belief of them Many prodigies were reported f  It was believed that crows had not only torn with their beaks fome gold in the Capitol but had even eaten it And again Fires from heaven breaking out in various  places had as was faid c Â Nor is he at all fcrupulous in declaring thefe numerous â B xx iv 10 f B xxvii

mention of one  prodigy was as ufual followed by reports of  others f From this caufe arofe abundance  of fuperftitious notions and the minds of the people became difpofed both to believe and to propagate accounts of prodigies of which a c very great number were reported The confuls expiated feveral prodigies which had c been reported Â Several deceptions of the eyes and ears were credited  One is almoft tempted to think that thofe who charge our Author with credulity had never read him otherwife how could they overlook fuch paf fages as thefe and efpecially the following in which he feems aware that fuch a charge might be brought againft him and labours to obviate jt In proportion as the war was protracted  to a greater length and fuccefles and difap pointments produced various alterations not  only in the fituations but in the fentiments  of men fuperftitious obfervances and thefe  moftly introduced from abroad gained fuch  ground among the people in general that it  feemed as if either mankind or the deities  had undergone fome fudden changed From the paiTages here adduced and very many others to the fame purport might be quoted it may be confidently pronounced that our Author was not the dupe of thofe Â B xxvii ij f Ib 37  B xxix i Â B xxiv 44 i ibid Â i Â v i vulgar PREFACE iv vulgar rumours thofe  deceptions of the eyes  and ears which yet he has thought it his duty to record And in truth it feems as if the people themfelves at leaft the more enlightened of them were equally inclined if eftablifhed cuftom would have allowed to difregard them They grew weary we are told  not only of the thing itfelf but of the religious rites en joined in confequence for neither could the fenate be convened nor the bufinefs of the public be tranfacted the confuls were fo con ftantlyemployed infacrifices and expiations And accordingly with a view to diminifh the reports of thefe miracles and the troublefeme ceremonies confequent thereupon the confuls â by direction of the fenate publifhed an edict that when  on any day public worfhip fhould be ordered in confequence of the report of an  earthquake no perfon ihould report another earthquake on that day f Indeed how very little faith the fenate really had in omens pro digies and aufpices we may learn from a re markable order made by them upon receiving from a conful the report of the appearance of unfavourable omens in no lefs than three vic tims fucceffively facrificed they ordered him fays the Hiftorian  to continue facri ficing the larger victims until the omens fhould prove favourable  It may be afked if Livy himfelf the fenate and very many perhaps the greater number of the people difbelieved thefe omens and pro digies why relate them He anfwers the quef  B xx rfr 55 f Ibid J B xli 15 TOL i a tion xvi PREFACE lion himfelf  I am well aware he fay that through the fame difregard to religion which l has led men into the prefent prevailing opi nion of the gods never giving portents of any future events no prodigies arc now either re ported to government or recorded in hifto  ries But for my part while I am writing the tranfa ions of ancient times my fen timents I know not how become antique and I feel a kind of religious awe which  compels me to confider that events which  the men of thofe times renowned for wifdom judged deferving of the attention of govern  ment and of public expiation muft certainly  be worthy of a place in my Hiftory And in truth it muft be allowed that an account of the religious ceremonies and the fuper ftitious obfervances of different nations at dif ferent peripds forms not the leaft curious chap ter in the hiftory of the human mind A ftill heavier charge hath been brought againft our Author indeed the heavieft that can be alleged againft an hiftorian namely the violation of the firft great law of hiftory which is not to dare to aflert any thing falfe and not to fupprefs any truthf He who could not be warped by views of private intereft has yet been fuppofed from an excels of zeal for the honour and glory of his country in fome inftances to have gone beyond the truth in others to have fuppreflcd it It has been already mentioned how highly he was efteemed by Auguftus and that he had â 8 xlii 13 f Cic de Oral even P fcEFACE vii even received no inconfiderable marks of fa vour from him Yet he does not feem to have cdurted this efteerri or thofe favours by any particular attention on his part nor to have endeavoured to repay them by the only return whkh authors can make the loading their pa trons with undeferved praifes Although at the time when he wrote his Hiftory Auguftus was in complete pofleflion of the Roman em pire yet he names him but three times and then but in a flight and curfory manner not availing himfelf of the opportunity to heap adulation upon him but fimply giving him that praife to which he was unqueftionably en titled On occafion of fhutting the temple of Janus he takes the opportunity of mentioning that it had been but twice fhut fmcc the reign of Numa the firft time in the confulfhip of Titus Manlius on the termination of the firft Punic war and that the happinefs of feeing it  fhut the fecond time the gods granted to our  own times when after the battle of Actium the emperor Caefar Auguftus eftablifhed uni verfal peace on land and fea  As Auguftus was highly vain of this circumftance had our Author s difpofition led him to flatter this ma fter of the world it would have afforded him an excellent opportunity as would another occafion wjiere fpeaking of fpolia opima de pofited by Coflus in one of the temples he appeals to the teftimony of Auguftus Caefar whom he ftyles  the founder or reftorer of all our templesf But above all he might have  B i 19 t B iv 20 a 2 found xviii PREFACE found a niche for him as well as others of his family when he mentions the diftinguifhed victory gained by Livius and Nero over HaÂ drubal He relates the affair itfelf in very fplendid terms and beftows the moft exalted praifes on the admirable conduct of thofe vic torious generals He who was thus rigidly tenacious when private motives friendfhip or intereft might have fwayfid him is never thelefs accufed from national vanity of hav ing written with partiality and of having fometimes exaggerated and fometimes con cealed the truth It muft be acknowledged that when the grandeur of the Roman empire prefents itfelf to his mind he is not always fufficiently re ferved in the terms which he ufes Thus fpeaking of Cincinnatusf fo early as the 296th year of Rome he calls him the fole hope of the empire of Rome at a time whenwe know that this thus pompoufly announced empire extended not more than twenty miles beyond the city And again not many years after  â he introduces Canuleius boafting of its  eter nal duration and immenfe magnitude Â When we find him applying fuch magnificent terms to the Roman ftate then in its infancy we muft fuppofe him to have forgot the period of which he was writing and to have had prefent to his mind the fplendor and extent to which it had attained at the time when he himfelf lived and wrote He even puts the fame language into â B xxvii 47 8 9 t B Hi 26 t Y R JIO Â B iv 4 the PREFACE xix the mouths of foreigners and of enemies he makes Hannibal call Rome the capital of the  world at a time whenthe Romans had not even the whole of Italy in fubjecYion and no pofleffions whatever out of Italy except a part of Sicily and Sardinia In the fame vain glorious boafting ftrain he tells us f that the Romans  were never worfted by the enemy s cavalry never by their infantry never in open fight never on equal ground He feems here not to have recolledted what he afterwards ac knowledges f that in the firft battle with Han nibal it manifeftly appeared that the Car thaginian was fuperior in cavalry and confe quently that open plains fuch as thofe be tween the Po and the Alps were unfavourable to the Romans Although he thus aflerts in unqualified terms that the Romans were never worfted in the open field yet he gives very juft and candid accounts not only of this bat tle with Hannibal but of another alfo againft the fame commander and of that of the Allia againft the Gauls in every one of which the Romans were completely overthrown â But thefe it is probable mould rather be confidered as inadvertencies than falfehoods and however inclined we may be to overlook or excufe them we fhall not perhaps find it fo eafy to juftify fome other omiflions or changes which he has made in his narrative refpedting fafts which if fairly and fully related would do no honour to his country or would tend in fome degree to tarnifh the luftre of thofe cele B zxi 30 f B ix 19 t B xxi 47 a 3 brated xx PREFACE brated characters which he holds up to our ad miration Polybius is allowed to be an author of con fummate judgment indefatigable induftry and ftrict veracity Livy himfelf admits that he is entitled to entire credit He takes extraordi nary pains to inveftigate the caufes of the fe cond Punic war and to determine which of the two nations had incurred the guilt of breach of treaty He difcufles th e matter at confiderable length ftating accurately and carefully ex amining the facts and arguments urged on both fides and at length brings the matter to this iflue that if the war is to be conlidered as taking its rile from the Heftruction of Sagun tum the Carthaginians were in the wrong but by no means fo if the matter be taken up fomewhat higher and the taking of Sardinia by the Romans and the impofmg a tribute upon that ifland be included in the account for that then the Carthaginians did no more than take occafion to avenge an injury done them Now how ftands the account of this affair according to Livyf From this difquifition of Polybius he carefully felects and ftrongly ftates every thing which tends to favour the caufe of the Romans but pafles over in filence every fact and every argument urged by the Greek hiftorian in favour of the Carthaginians and thps he makes the worfe appear the better caufe   Lib x j B xxi 19 it PREFACE f It has been urged in defence of Livy that in his twentieth book he gave the account of the affair of Sardinia and that if that book had not been loft it might from thence have appeared that the conduct of the Romans in that tranfa ion was perfectly juftifiable and that coniequently what he has fupprefled of Polybius s argument he has omitted not fomucb to favour the caufe of his own countrymen as becaufe he knew the allegations therein to be talfe It muft howver be obferved that Poly bius was neither a Roman nor a Carthaginian that he has always been held to be an hiftorian of the higheft credit and the ftricteft impartia lity that he lived nearer the times he writes of than Livy and was a moft diligent inquirer into the truth of the facts which he relates in his hiftory that he was by no means un friendly to the Romans but the contrary tak ing all opportunities to fpeak of them with the higheft praife It is not meant here to detract from the meri of Livy as an hiftorian by the mention of fuch particulars as thefe It may be aflumed as a maxim that no hiftorian of his own country can be ftrictly fpeaking impar tial he may intend to be fo but the mind will be under an involuntary bias influenced by fome fecret inclination of which he himfclf may be unconfcious he may believe what he aflerts and yet it may not be true Another inftance of his partiality to his countrymen may be found in his account of a 4 the xxii PREFACE the murder of Brachyllas  who he tells us was made Boeotarch or chief magiftrate of the Boeotians  for no other reafon than becaufe â he had been commander of the Boeotians lerv ing in the army of Philip paffing by Zeuxip pus Pififtratus and the others who had prc moted the alliance with Rome That thefe men offended at prefent and alarmed about future confequences refolved to take off Bra chyllas and accordingly procured fix affaflins who put him to death In thefe and other circumftances our Author perfectly agrees with Polybius whofe account or this whole affair he feems to have almoft literally copied with the omiflion however out of tendernefs for the character of Quintius of a very material cii cumftance which is that the project of mur dering Brachyllas was firft opened in a con ference between Zeuxis Prfiftratus and Quin tius who told them that he would not himfelf do any thing to promote it but that if they were difpofed to the execution of fuch a plan he would do nothing to obftrudt it and he adds that he directed them to confer upon the matter with Alexamenes the Etolian who was the perfon he fays that procured the aflaflins Another and a very remarkable inftance of partiality to the character of his countrymen we have in his celebrated account of Scipio Africanus who feems above all others men tioned in his Hiftory to have engaged his fondeft and as he himfelf admits his partial attention for when he firft introduces Â B xxiii 17 8 7 him PREFACE xxiii  him he does it in the moft advantageous man ner as a youth who had fcarcely attained to manhood refcuinghis father who was wounded in a battle with Hannibal This fays he is the fame youth who is hereafter to enjoy the renown of terminating this war and to receive the title of Africanus on account of his glorious victory over Hannibal and the Carthaginians He then in a manner avows his partiality for he tells us that Coelius attributes the honour of faving the Gonful to a Have by nation a Ligurian But I rather with the account to be true which gives it to his fon and fo the fact is reprefented by  moft authors and generally believed That Scipio was a moft accomplifhed cha racter eminently diftinguifhed by his military talents valour coolnefs patience under dif ficulties and moderation in victory of moft gentle manners and a moft generous temper never has been nor ever will be denied But if other writers knew the truth and have fpoken it he was not that model of abfolute perfection which Livy paints him and per haps had he been the cold and unimpafiloned ftoic which he defcribes him to have been he had deferved lefs praile than is undoubtedly due to him when confidered as other authors reprefent him of a very different temperament That he generoufly reftored the beautiful cap tive to her parents and to her intended fpoufe Livy and Polybius are agreed but they differ jfpjnewhat in the aceount of that affair Poly  B xxxi 4 j bins xxiv PREFACE bius tells us that a party of Roman youth ha ving taken captive a damfel of exquifue beauty brought her to Scipio whom they knew to be much attached to the fex and he makes Scipio fay to them that  a more acceptable gift could not have been prefented to him were he in a private ftation but that in his fituation of general he could by iio means accept of it Livy fupprefles entirely the circumftance of his favourite s amorous difpofition and yet what he reprefents him as faying to Allucius bears fo ftrong a refemblance to his anfwer recorded by Polybius though he gives it a different turn to accommodate it to his purpofe that we can r not doubt his having had this paflage in his eye  If my thoughts were not totally employed by the affairs of the public and if I were at  liberty to indulge in the pleafurable purfuits adapted to my time of life f c That Scipio with all his perfections was not that mirror of chaftity which Livy is defirous of reprefenting him we learn alfo from an anecdote related by Valerius Maximus f who highly praifes the amiable temper and patient forbearance of his wife Emilia who he tells us  knew of his attachment to a female flave and yet concealed the fact that there might be no ftain upon fo illuftrious a character Such are the principal facts alleged to prove our Hiftorian s neglect of veracity in his nar ration rigorous and it may be invidious fcrutiny has noted fome few more but they are of little importance and as it is not im â Lib x â â â 8 xxzvi 50  Lib vi 7 pro PREFACE probable fo it is not unfair to fuppofe that the want of more cotemporary hiftorians may have induced thofe who were alfo predifpofed to believe that to be falfe which fuller information might perhaps have proved to be true Why may we not believe that he had better oppor tunities of knowing the truth than the Greek hiftorian He admits Polybius to be an au thor of credit and yet he differs from him with out fcruple he cannot then furely be thought to mean more than that he was a writer of in tegrity who compiled his hiftory with fidelity according to the beft information he was able to obtain that he did not wilfully falfify any faÂ t rather than that every faÂ t he relates is ftrictly and abfolutely true He acknowledges him for his mafter but does not conceive him felf bound to fwear to his words Befides it is but doing juftice to our Author to obferve that if in fome few and thofe not very material inftances he may have deviated from the truth if he has done fo it is never with an ill defign if he palliates a fault or fupprefles a fact it is not fo much for the pur t pofe of leffening the reputation or tarnifhing the glory of others whether nations or indivi duals as to aggrandize the chara er of his own nation He allows himfelf in a practice which fome of his countrymen have fince his time carried to a much greater as well as a more blameable extent and which has received the name of pious fraud But whatever may be the cafe whether our Author muft lie under the reproach of foften ins xxvi PREFACE ing fads in fome inftances or even of fup prefling them ia others yet will his genius and talents as an hiftorian ever be refpeÂ ted He cannot be denied the merit of having fur nifhed us with a perfect model of hiftorical compofition in the pureft and moft elegant ftyle more remarkable for perfpicuity of nar ration and neatnefs of expreflion than for depth of reafoning or pomp of di ion Al though he ieldom digrefles and but rarely in dulges in moral obfervations or philoibphical reflections yet he never lofes fight of what he himfelf lays down in his Preface as the

deceived by felf love and the partiality of a few friends who have taken the trouble of looking into it it will be found not altogether unworthy of public accept ance The PREFACE xxvii The Tranflator

others j the lateft writers always fuppofing them felves capable either of throwing fome new light on the fubject or by the fuperiority of their talents for composition of excelling the more inelegant writers who preceded them However that may be I mall at all events derive no fmall fatisfac tion from the reflection that my beft endeavours nave been exerted in tranfmitting to pofterity the atchievments of the greateft people in the world and if amidft fuch a multitude of writers my name fbould not emerge from nbfcurity I fhall confole myfelf by confidering the diftinguimed reputation and eminent merit of thofe who ftand in my way in the purfuit of fame It may be farther obferved tha fuch a fubjecr muft require a work of immenie ex tent as our refearches muft be carried back through a fpace of more than feven hundred years j that the ftate has from very fmall beginnings gradually in crcafed to fuch a magnitude that it is now diftreffed by its own bulk and befides that there is every reafon to apprehend that the generality or readers will receive but little pleafure from the accounts of its firft origin or of the times immediately fucceeding but will be impatient to arrive at thefe modern times in which the powers of this overgrown ftate have been long employed in working their own deftruction On the other hand I fhall efteem this as fome reward of my labour that fo long at leaf t as I fhall luve my thoughts totally occupied in inveftigating the tranfac lions of fuch diftant times without being cmbarrafied by any of thofe unpleafing confidera tions which though they might not have power to warp a writer s mind from the truth would yet be flifficient to create uneafinefs I fhall withdraw my fe lf from the light of the many evils to which our cyes in this age have been fo long accuftomed â As OF ROME As to the relations which have been handed down of events prior to the founding of the city or to thofc tranfactions that gave occafion to its being founded and which bear the femblance rather of poetic fic tions than of authentic records of hiftoryâ thefe I have no intention either to maintain or refute An tiquity is always indulged with the privilege of ren dering the origin of cities more venerable by inter mixing divine with human agency and if any nation may claim the privilege of being allowed to confider its original as facred and to attribute it to the opera tions of the Gods furely the Roman people who rank fo high in military fame may well expect that while they choofe to reprefent Mars as their own parent and that of their founder the other nations of the world may acquiefce in this with the fame deference with which they acknowledge their fove reignty But what degree of attention or credit may be given to thefe and fuch like matters I mall not confider as very material To the following con fiderations I wifh every one ferioufly and earneftly to apply his thoughts by what kind of men and by what fort of conduct

opulence has introduced a greedinefs for gain and the boundlefs variety of difiblute pleafures has â created in many a paflion for ruining themfelves and all around them in courfes of intemperance and debauchery But let us in the firft ftage at leaft of fo great an undertaking avoid gloomy reflections which when perhaps unavoidable will not even then be agreeable If it were cuftomary with us as it

and Antenor towards whom they excrcifed none of the rights of conqueft This lenity they owed partly to ap old connection of hofpitality and partly to their having been all along inclined to peace and to the reftoration of Helen Thefe chiefs experienced afterwards great varieties of fortune Antenor being joined by a multitude of the Henetians who had been driven out of Paph lagonia in a civil war

Trojan canton alfo has its name the nation in general were called Venetians  JEncas driven from home by the fame calamity but conduced by the fates to an eftablifhment of more importance came firft to Macedonia thence in fearch of a fettlement he failed to Sicily and from Sicily proceeded with his fleet to the country of the Laurentians  Here alfo to the fpot where they landed was given the name of Troy j Here the Trojans difembarked and as after wandering about for a great length of time they had nothing now left befide their fhips and arms they began to make prey of whatever they found in the country On this king Latinus and the Aborigines who were then in pofiefiion of thole lands affembled haftily from the city and country in order to repel the violence of the ftrangers 1 Of what followed there are two different accounts â ž Some writers fay that Latinus being overcome in battle contracted an alliance and afterwards an af finity with tineas others that when the armies were drawn up in order of battle before the fignal was given Latinus advancing in the front invited the leader of the ftrangers to a conference then in quired who they were whence they came what had induced them to leave their home and with what defign they had landed on the Laurentian coaft and that when he was informed that the leader was Eneas the fon of Anchifes by Venus and his followers Tro

the prefence of his houfehold gods added a domeftic alliance to their public one giving him his daughter in marriage This event fully confirmed the hopes of the Trojans that here at laft they were to

Mezentius who held his court at Caere at that rime an opulent city He had been from the beginning not at all pleafed at the foundation of the new city and now began to think that the Trojan power was increafing to a de gree inconfiftent with the fafety of the neighbouring ftates and therefore without reluctance concluded an alliance and joined his forces with thofe of the Rutulians JEne s with the view of conciliating the affection of the Aborigines that he might be the O F R O M E the better able to oppofe fitch formidable enemies B OjO K gave to both the nations under his government the name of Latines that all fhould not only be govern ed by the fame laws but have one common name From thenceforth the Aborigines yielded not to the Trojans in zeal and fidelity towards their king Eneas This

the fame of its prowefs not only the land but the fea alfo through the whole length of Italy from the Alps to the Sicilian Streight and although he might have remained within his fortifications fecure

country in a hoftile manner I In confequence of this Remus was given up to Numitor to be punifhed  From the very beginning Fauftulus had entertained hopes that the children whom he educated would prove to be defcended of the royal Hood for he knew that the infants had been expofed by order of the king and that the time when he had taken them up corresponded exactly with that event but he had refolved to avoid any hafty difcovery unlefs fome favourable conjuncture or neceffity mould require it JThe neceffity happened firft I wherefore conftrained by his apprehenfions he difclofed the affair to Ro mulus It happened alfo that Numitor while he had Remus in his cuftody heard that the brothers were twins and when he combined with this cir cumftance their age and their turn of mind which gave no indication of a iervile condition he was ftruck with the idea of their being his grandchil dren and all his inquiries leading to the fame conclufion he was upon the point of acknowledging Remus In confequence a plot againft the king was concerted between all the parties Romulus not going at the head of a band of youths for he was not equal to an open attempt but ordering the lhepherds to come at a certain hour by different roads to the palace forced his way to the king and was fupported by Remus with another party procured ii THE HISTORY BOOK procured from the houfe

Remus were feized with a defire of building a city in the place where they had been ex pofed and educated TThere were great numbers of Albans and Latines who could be fpared for the purpofe and thefe were joined by a multitude of fhepherds fo that all together they formed fuch a numerous body as gave grounds to hope that Alba and Lavinium would be but fmall in comparifon with the city which they were about to build TThefe views were interrupted by an evil hereditary in their family ambition for rule Hence arofe a fhameful conteft though they had in the beginning refted their difpute on this

would direct the owner s fearch he dragged the cattle backward by the tails into the cave picking out thole that were the moft remarkable for their beau ty Hercules awaking at the dawn of day took a view of his herd and miffing fome of his number went directly to the next cave examining whether the tracks led thither j and when he obferved that they all pointed outward and yet did not lead to any other quarter perplexed and not knowing how to proceed he began to drive forward his herd from that unlucky place Some of the cows as they were driven off miffing thofe that were left behind began as was natural to low after them and the found being returned from the cave by thofe that were fhut up in it brought Hercules back Cacus endeavouring by force to prevent his approach to the cave and invoking in vain the affiftance of the fhepherds received a blow of hi club which put an end to his life At that time Evander a native of Peloponnefus who had re moved hither governed that part of the country rather through an influence acquired by his merit than any power of fovereignty vefted in him He was highly revered oh account of his having intro duced the wonderful knowledge of letters a matter quite new to thefe men who were ignorant of all the arts and ftill more fo on account of the fup pofed divinity of his mother Carmenta whoje pro phetic powers had been an object of admiration

filled with more dignity and majefty than belonged to a human being he inquired who he was and being told his name that of his father and his country he addreffed him in thefe words Hail Hercules fon of Jove my mother the in fallible interpreter of the gods foretold to me that you were deftined to increafe the number of the celeftials and that an altar would be dedicated to you in this place which a nation hereafter the moft powerful in the world fhould diftinguifh by the name of The Greateft  and would offer thereon facrifices to your honour Hercules giving his right hand replied that  he embraced the omen and would fulfil the decree of the fates by building and dedicating an altar in the place There then for the firft time was performed a facrifice to Hercules of a chofen heifer taken out of the herd and the Pojitii and Pinarii the moft dif tinguifhed families in the neighbourhood at the time were invited to afTift in the ceremonies and fhare the entertainment It happened by ibme accident that the Potitii attending in time and the entrails having been fervcd up to them the Pinarii came in for the reft of the feaft after the entrails were eaten hence it continued a rule as long as the Pinarian fa mily exifted that they fhould not eat of the entrails The Potitii inftrutfted by Evander were directors of that foJemnity for many ages until the folemn office of the family was

him VIII AFTER paying due worfhip to the gods he fummoned tlie multitude to an afiembly and knowing that they could never be brought to incor porate as one people by any other means than by having their conduct directed by certain rules he gave them a body of laws j and judging that if he added to the dignity of his own appearance by af luming the enfigns of fovereignty it would help to procure refpect to thofe laws among a rude unin formed people he adopted a more majeftic ftyle of appearance both with regard to his other appoint ments and particularly in being attended by twelve licctors Some think that he was led to fix on that number by the number of birds in the augury that had portended the kingdom to him I am rather in clined to be of their opinion who fuppofe that all the officers attendant on magiftrates and among t the reft thefe were borrowed from their neighbours the Etrurians from whom the curule chair and the gown edged with purple were taken their number alfo being the fame feems to me to confirm this opi nion the Etrurians ufed that number becaufe their king being elected by the fuffrages of twelve ftates each ftate gave him one lictor Meanwhile the city increafed in buildings which were carried on from one place to another to an extent proportioned ra ther to the number of inhabitants they hoped for in future than to what they had at the time f Then that the fize of the city might not be without ufe in order to augment his numbers he had recourfe to an old idea among founders of cities who when they had collected about them a multitude of mean and obfcure people ufed to feign that inhabitants â Without doubt he framed the government and the laws nearly OK the model of thole eitablifhed at Alba f About jooo tuot and 300 hoifemen for OF ROME is for their cities fprung out of the earth He opened B O O K a fanctuary in the place where the indofure now is on the road down from the Capitol called The Pafs of the Two Groves Hither fled from the neigh bouring ftates crowds of alt forts without diftinc tion whether freemen or flaves led by a fondnefs for novelty and this was the firft thing that gave folid ftrength to the growing greatnefs of the city  Having reafon now to be pretty well fatisfied with his ftrength he next made provifion that this ftrength fhould be regulated by wifdom and for that pur pofe he created an hundred fenators  either be caufe that number was fufficient or becaufe there were no more than an hundred citizens who could prove their defcent from refpecctable fathers They were certainly ftyled Fathers from their honourable office and their defendants Patricians IX THE Roman ftate had now attained fuch  degree of power that it was a match in arms for any of the neighbouring nations but by reafon of the Scarcity of women its greatnefs was not likely to aft longer than one age of man as they had neither hopes of offspring among themfelves nor had yet contracted any intermarriages with their neighbours Romulus therefore by advice of the fenate lent ambafladors round to all the adjoining ftates fo Jiciting their alliance and permiflion for his new fubjects to marry among them he intimated to them that  cities like every thing elfe rife from low beginnings that in time thofe which are fupported by their own merit and the favour of the gods procure to themfelves great power and a great name and that he had full aflurance  This expreflion muft be under flood in a qualified fenfe in the fame manner as when a magidi ire prefiding at an election is faitl to el Â l fuch and fuch perfons

thefe perfuafions was added the foothing behaviour of their hufbands who urged in extenuation of the violence they had been tempted to commit the excefs of paffion and the force of love arguments than

citadel As foon as they gained admittance they put her to death by throwing their armour in a heap upon her either becaufe they wifhed that the citadel fhould rather appear to have been taken by ftorm or for the fake of eftablifhing a precedent that faith was not to be kept with a traitor The ftory is told in another manner that as the Sabines generally carried on their left arms bracelets of great

Sabines the united peo ple were called Quirites from the town of Cures To perpetuate the remembrance of that battle the place where his horfe emerging from die deep of the lake firft brought Curtius to a fhallow was called the Curtian lake  This happy re eftablifhment of peace after a war fo diftreffing rendered the Sabine women ftill dearer both to their hufbands and pa rents and above all to Romulus himfelf fo that when he divided the people into thirty Curias f he gave thefe the names of the women But as the number of the women was undoubtedly greater than this whether thofe who were to give their names to the Curias were felected on account of their age or their own dignity or that of their huf bands or by lot we are not informed At the fame time alfo three centuries of knights were en dolled the Ramnenfes fo called from Romulus the Tiuenfes frpm Titus Tatius and the Luceres the reafon of whofe name and origin is unknown Thenceforward the two kings reigned together not only with equal power but with concord XIV SEVERAL years after fome relations of king Tatius offered violence to the ambaffadors of the Laurentians for which violation of the law of nations the latter demanded

the curia feaftfd together The centuries of knights were named alter the tribes out of which they were taken paid OF ROME paid more regard to the intereft and importunities of his relations and thereby drew upon himfelf the punifhment due to them For he was flain after wards at Lavinium in a tumult raifed on his going thither to an anniverfary facrifice It is faid that Romulus fhewed lefs refentment of this proceeding than became him either becaufe there had been no fincere cordiality between them while aflbciated in the government or becaufe he thought that the other deferved the death which he met He avoid ed therefore entering into a war on the occafion j but to make fome atonement for the ill treatment of the ambafladors and the murder of the king the league between the cities of Rome and Lavinium was renewed Thus beyond their expectations the Romans enjoyed peace on that fide but a war broke out from another quarter much nearer home and almoft at their gates The Fidenatians look ing with jealoufy on the great increafe of power in a neighbour fo very near them determined to make war on them early before they mould arrive at that degree of ftrength which it was evident they would in time acquire and lent a body of young men in arms who laid wafte the whole tract between Fiderras and the city Then turning to the left hand becaufe the Tiber confined them on the right and continuing their depredations they threw the country people into the utmpft confirmation and the fudden alarm fpreading from the country into the city made known what had happened Romulus inftantly led out his forces for a war fo near home admitted no delay and pitched his camp at the diftance of a mile from Fidenae Leaving there a fmall guard and marching out with all the reft of his troops he ordered a party to lie in am bufh in a place of concealment among bumes that grew there in abundance then advancing with the other more numerous body of infantry and all the cavalry by riding up almoft to the gates And  i9 T H E H I S T O R Y BOOK and offering battle in an irregular and infultingmart ner he drew the enemy out of the town which was the point that he aimed at The cavalry acting in this manner anfwered allb another purpofe as it afforded a more fpecious pretext for the retreat which he was to counterfeit and when the foot too began to retire while the horfe feemed irrefolute whether to fight or fly the enemy rufhirrg fudden ly out of the gates in crouds eager to purfue and prefs on the Roman army in its retreat were drawn to the place of the ambufcade and then the Ro mans rifing fuddenly attacked their line in flank at the fame time the enfigns of thofe who had been left to guard the camp advancing from thence added to their fears Difmayed at fuch a number of dangers the Fidenatians turned their backs be fore Romulus and the horfemen with him dould well turn their horfes about to purfue them T hus they who had lately purfued an enemy who only pre tended to fly now fied themfclves in earneft with much greater hafte back to the city but they could not get clear of the enemy the Romans fticking clofe to their rear broke in along with them as if in one body before the gates could be fhut againft them XV THE contagion of the Fidenatian war in fected the Veientisns j who led by the relationfhip fubfifting between them and the Fidenatians for thefe alfo were Etrurians and urged on befide by the confideration of vicinity of fituation in cafe the Roman arms were to be turned againft all their neighbours made an excurfion into the Roman ter ritories in the manner of a predatory rather than of a regular war and thus without encamping or waiting the approach of the enemy s army they re turned to Veii carrying home the fpoil colkcted in the country On the other fide the Roman com mander not finding the enemy in the country and oung OF R O M E 29 being prepared for and determmed on a decifive ROOK action erofled over the Tiber The Veientians hearing that he was forming a camp and that he in tended to advance to their city tnarched out to meet him for they chofe rather to engage in the open field than to remain fhut up and fight from the walls and houfes There by dint of ftrength unafiifted by any ftratagem the Roman king through the mere force of his veteran troops obtained the victory and purfued the routed enemy to their walls The city was fo ftrong and fo well fecured both by works and by its fituation that he did not choofe to attempt it but led home his troops and in his way ravaged the enemy s country for the fake of revenge rather than of booty Thefe de yaftations having diftrefied the Veientians no lefs than the lofs of the battle they fent deputies to Rome to fue for peace A part of their lands was taken from them and a truce granted for an hun dred years Thefe were the principal tranfactions in peace and war during the reign of Romulus and none of them was unfuitable to the belief of his divine origin or to the rank of a divinity which after his death he wap fuppofed to have obtained The fame may be faid of the fpirit which he mewed in recovering the kingdom for his grandfather as well as of his wife conduct in founding the city and eftablifhing its power by the arts both of war and peace for by the ftrength which it acquired under his management it became fo refpectable that during forty years after it enjoyed profound peace and fecurity He ftood however much higher in the favour of the people than he did in that of the fenate and was yet more beloved by his army He eftablifhed a body

plain on the borders of the lake of Capra for the purpofe of reviewing his army a fudden ftorm arofe accompanied with violent thunder and light ning the king was enveloped in a thick cloud â which hid him from the eyes of the aflembly and was never more feen upon earth The Roman youth were at length eafed of their apprehenfions by the return of calm and ferene weather after fuch a turbulent day but when they faw the royal feat empty though they readily believed the fepators who had ftood neareft to him that he had been carried up on high by the ftorm yet they were ftruck with tbch dread at being thus left in a manner fatherlefs that for fome time they remained in mournful filence At laft fome few letting the example the whole multitude falnted Romulus as a deity the fon of a deity the king and parent of the city of Rome and implored his favour with prayers that he would be pleafed always propitioufly to watch over the fafcty of his own offspring Some I believe even at that time harboured filent fufpicions that the king had been torn in pieces by the hands of the fenators Such a report was fpread abroad but it was little credited both on account of the high admiration entertained of the man and becaufe the prefent confternation caufrd the other account to be more generally received It is farther mentioned that a contrivance of one particular man procured additional credit to this re prefcntation of the matter for Proculus Julius a g n of the appellation although it muft be admitted to be by nq means certain that they were not fo called as fome allege from t hc

and vanifhed from my fight It was wonderful how readily this ftory told by that man was credited and how much the grief of the people and of the army was alTuaged iby their being fatisfied of his immor tality XVII MEANWHILE the mmds of the fenators were agitated by ambition and contention for the yacant throne Factions had not yet taken their rife from the interefts of individuals for among a new people no one yet pofiefled any eminent fuperiority over the reft The conteft lay between the differ ent bodies of which the ftate was compofed thofe of Sabine defcent were anxious that a king

en titled to equal privileges on the other hand the original Romans fpurned the thought of a foreigner being placed on the throne Notwithftanding this diverfity 3A THE HISTORY B O o K diverfity in their views yet all concurred in wifhing i r __ for a king for they had not yet rafted the fweets of liberty The fenate now began to fear left as the fen1 timents of many of the neighbouring ftates were very unfriendly towards them feme foreign power might attack them while the ftate was cieftitute of a go vernment and the army deftitute of a commander Every one therefore was defirous that there fhould be fome head but no one party could be brought to think of giving way to another In this difficulty the fenators fhared the government among them felves forming out of their number which con Cfted of an hundred ten decades with one prefi dent in each who were to have the direction of public affairs Each ten governed jointly the pre fident alone had the Li ors and other badges of fbvereignty The time of each holding the go vernment was limited to five days and the admi niftration went to them all in rotation In this manner a year paffed without a king and that in Y R terval from this circumftance was called an Inter file regnum which term is ftill applied to fimilar 714 interruptions of the regular government By this time the commons began to murmur alleging thap flavery was multiplied on them that they had an hundred mafters fet over them inftead of one and it became evident that they would no longer be i itisfi Â d without a king or without one chofen by them â felves The fenators perceiving that fuch fchemes were in agitation judged it prudent to make a volun tary offer of what they could not much longer retain yet while they gratified the people in furrendering to them the fovereign power they took care not to give up a larger fhare of privilege than they ftill kept in their own hands for they pafft d a decree that when the people fhould elec t a king that election fhould be valid provided the iVnate ap proved their choice And to this day the fame right is claimed with refpect to the enacting of laws and O F R O M E 33 and the appointing of magiftrates j though the cffi BOOK cacy of it has been quite taken away at prefent before the people begin to vote the fenate pre vioufly declare their approbation of the proceedings of the afiembly and that even before they are yet refolved upon The Interrex then having called an afiembly faid  Romans be the event prof perous fortunate and happy elect a king the fathers have thought proper to decree that it fhould be fo If ye choofe a perfon worthy to be â efteemed a fit fucceflbr to Romulus the fathers will join their approbation This proceeding was fo pleafing to the people that left they might appear to be outdone in gencrofity they voted and ordered nothing more than that the fenate mould determine by their decree who fhould be king of Rome XVIII THERE was at that time a perfon named Numa Pompilius  who was univerfally celebrated for juftice and piety he lived at Cures in the coun try of the Sabines and was as eminently fkilled as any one in that age could be in all laws human and divine he was fuppofed to have been inftructed by Pythagoras of Samos for which fuppofitton there is no other foundation than its not being known from what other quarter he derived his knowledge cer tain it is that more than an hundred years after this period in the reign of Servius Tullius Pythagoras afiembled the youtli of the remoter parts of Italy about Metapontum Heracla and Croton and had them inftructed under his own diredlion From places fo remote even if he had lived in rkÂ rir of Numa how could fuch a character of him n ve reached the Sabines as fhould have infpired

Sabines than whom no race of men were lefs corrupted by refinements On hearing the name of Numa Pom pilius although the Roman fathers faw that the ba lance of power would incline to the Sabines if the king were chofen from among them yet no one prefumingto prefer himfelf or any other of his own party or in fhort any one of the fathers or ci tizens to him they all to a man concurred in voting that the kingdom fhould be conferred on Y R Numa Pompilius When he arrived in conlc B39c quence of their invitation he ordered that as Ro 7 13 mulus on the founding of the city had obtained the  fpvereign power by an augury fo the gods fhould be confulted in like manner concerning himfelf Accordingly being conducted into the citadel by an augur to which profefEon was annexed for ever after by public authority the honour of perform ing that folemn office he fat down on a ftone with his face turned towards the South the augur took his feat at his left hand with his head covered hold ing in his

miracle he made them believe that he had nightly meetings with the goddefs Egeria and that by her direction he in ftituted the facred rites moft acceptable to the gods and appointed proper pricfts for

attend conftantly on the duties of that priefthood and decorated him with a fplendid lrefs and a royal curule chair He created like wife two other flamens one of Mars the other of Quirinus He alfo felected virgins for the fervice of Vefta an order of priefthood derived from Alba and therefore related in fome fort to the family of the founder of the city For thefe he fixed a fti pend to be paid out of the public treafury that they might without interruption attend to the bufi iiefs of the temple and by enjoining virginity and other religious cbferyances gave them a fanctity of character thatattract ed veneration He elected alfo twelve priefts called falii for Mars Gradiyus and gave them as an ornament of diftinftion a flowered tunic and over the tunic a brazen covering for the breath He ordered rhefe to carry the celeftial ar mour called Ancilia and to go in proceffion through rhe city finging hymns with leaping and lolemn dancing He then chofe out of the fenators a pontiff named Numa Marcius fon of Marcus and gave him a written and fealed copy of the infti tutions refpecting all the facred rites together with directions with what victims on what days in what temples each

of the fentiments of the deities refpecting thefe matters he dedicated an altar on the Aventine to Jupiter Elicius j and conlulted the god by auguries concerning the prodigies that were to be expiated XXI THE attention of the whole community being diverted from violence and arms to the con fideringand ad j lift ing of thefe matters their thoughts found employment enough to prevent idlenefs and then

manners after the example of the king as the moft perfect model the neighbouring ftates who had formei ly looked upon Rome not as a city but as a camp pitched in tlie midft of them for the pur pofe of

lie main tained through the whole courfe of his reign with no lefs care than he employed in fecuring his own authority Thus two kings in fuccefnon by differ ent methods one by warlike the other by

Hoftilius grandfon to 67 that Hoftilius who diftinguifhed himfelf in the battle with the Sabines at the foot of the citadel and the fenate gave their approbation He was not only of a temper very

Thinking therefore that the D 4 ftrength 40 THE HISTORY BOOK ftrength of the ftate was growing languid through n_ J inactivity he fought on all fides for an opportunity of ftirring up a war It happened that fome Roman and Alban peafants committed mutual depredations on each other s lands at this time C Cluilius held the government of Alba Ambafladors were fent from both fides at nearly the fame time to demand reftitution Tullus gave orders to his that they fhould attend to nothing elfe until they executed their commiflion he well knew that the Alban would give a refufal and then war might be pro claimed without incurring the charge of impirty The Albans proceeded with lefs difpatch being courteoufly and liberally entertained by Tullus in his palace they cheerfully enjoyed the pjeafures of the king s table Meanwhile the Romans had made the firft demand of reftitution and on the Alban s refufal had declared war to commence on the thir tieth day after and returned to Tullus with an ac count of their proceedings He then gave the am bafladors an opportunity of propofins the bufinefs of their embafly they entirely ignorant of wh i had parted fpent fome time at firft in making apo logies that  it was very difagreeable to them tu fay any thing that would not be pleafing to Tul lus but that they were compelled by their in ftruclions they came to demand reftitution and if that were not granted had orders to declare war To this Tullus anfwered  Tell your king that the king of Rome appeals to the gods to judge which of the two ftates firft dii mifled with a refufal

riving their defcent frpm Troy for Lavinium owed its origin to Troy from Lavinium fprung Alba and from the race of the Alban kings the Romans were defcended The ifliie of the war however was fuch as rendered the difpute lefs grievous than might have been apprehended j for without a gene ral engagement and without any farther damage than the demolition of the houfes of one of the cities the two ftates were incorporated into one The Albans firft with very numerous forces made an irruption into the Roman territories and at the diftance of no more than five miles from the city fortified their camp with a trench which from the name of their leader was afterwards called the Clu jlian Trench and retained the name for feveral ages until the occafion being in time forgotten the name too fell into difufe In this camp Cluilius the Al ban king died on which the Albans created Met tius Fuftctius their dictator Tullus now impatient foraction efpecially after the death of the king af fured his men that the fupreme power of the gods winch had already begun with the head would in flict upon the whole body of the Albans the pe nalty incurred by their having occafioned this im pious war and marching paf t the enemy s camp in the night he advanced with his army ready for action into the Alban territories This procedure drew out Mettius from the camp where he lay he led his troops by the fhorteft road towards the enemy fending forward an ambaflador to tell Tul lus that  it was highly expedient that they mould confer together before they came to an engage ment that if he would give him a meeting he  was confident that what he had to propofe to his â confederation would appear to concern the intereft of Rome no lefs than that of Alba Tullus not thmking it proper to decline the propofal though he fa v no probability of any good confequence  ar ifing 4 THE HISTORY o o K arifing from it led out his troops into the field the  Albans likewife marched out to meet him When both parties were drawn up in order of battle the leaders attended by a few of the principal officers advanced into the middle fps cc where the Alban began thus I urukrftood from our king Clu  ilius that on our part injuries fuftained and a re fufal of fatisfadlon when demanded were the  caufes of the prelent war j and I doubt not that you Tullus allege op your part the lame grounds of quarrel but if inftead of plaufible profcffions Â I may be allowed to declare the truth it is a third â for dominion that ftimulates two nations con nected by their fituation and by confanguinity to take up arms againft each other Nor do I examine whether the meafures purfued are juf tifiable or not the determination of that point  was the bufinefs of him who commenced the war for my parr it was for the purpofe of carrying it on that the Albans conftituted me their leader Of this however Tulius I wifh to svarn you what a formidable power the Etrurians pofiefs both in our neighbourhood and more efpecially in yours you as being nearer to them know bet ter than we On land they are very powerful on the fea exceedingly fo Now confider that when you fhall give the fignal for battle they will enjoy the fight of thefe two armies engaged  as they would a fhow and will not fail to attack both the victor and the van quilhed together when they fee them fatigued and their ftrength exhaufted Wherefore fince we are not content with the certain enjoyment of liberty but are go ing to hazard an uncertain caft for dominion or fhvery let us in the name of the gods purfue  fome method whereby without great lofs with out much blood of either nation it may be de cided which fhall have dominion over the other This propofal was not unpleafmg to Tullus though both from his natural difpofuion and from confidence 13 of O F R O M E 43 of fuccefs he was rather inclined to violent meafures B O O K Both of them then turning their thoughts to devife fome glan they adopted one for which accident had already laid the foundation XXIV IT happened that in each of the armies there were three twin brothers between whom there was no difparity in point of age or of ftrength That their names were Hbratius and Curiatius we have fufficient certainty for no occurrence of anti quity has ever been more univerfally noticed ye t notwithftanding that the fact is fo well afcertained there ftill remains a doubt refpecting the names to which nation the Horatii belonged and to which the Curiatii authors are divided on the point finding however that the greater number concur in calling the Horatii Romans I am inclined to follow them To thefe three brothers on each fide the kings propofed that they fliould fupport by their arms the honour of their refpective countries in forming them that the fovereignty was to be en joyed by that nation whofe champions mould prove victorious in the combat No reluctance was hewn on their parts and time and place were appointed Previous to the fight a league was made between the Romans and Albans on thefe conditions that whichever of the two nations fhould by its charrt pions obtain victory in the combat that nation fliould without furthet difpute pofiefs fovereign dominion over the other Various treaties â are formed on different terms but the mode of ratifica tion is the fame in all The following is the man ner in which as we are told they proceeded on that occafion j and we have no record of any more antient treaty The herald afked the king in thefe words Doft thou O king order me to ftrike a league with the Pater Patratus  of the Alban â The duty of the Pater Patratuj was to attend the making of the treaty and to ratify it by oath nation THE HISTORY  nation r Having received the king s order he feid O king I demand vervain from thee the king anfwered  Take it pure The herald brought clean ftalks of that herb from the citadel He afterwards afked the king in thefe words Doft thou O king conftitute me the royal dele gate of the Roman people the Quirites in eluding in my privileges my attendants and implements The king replied  Be it with out detriment to me and to the Roman people the Quirites I do conftitute thee The herald was Marcus Valerius and he made Spurius Fufius Pater Patratus by touching his head and hair with the vervain The Pater Patratus is made  ad jusjurandum patrandum tliat is to ratify the league and this he does in a great many words which being exprefied in a long fet form I may be excufed from repeating Then after reciting the conditions he faid  Hear thotf O Jupiter hear thou Pater Patratus of the Alban nation heap ye people of Alba as thofe conditions from ftrft to laft have been recited openly from thofe tab lets or that wax without fraud or deceit in fuch  fenfe as they are moft clearly underftood here this day from thofe conditions the Roman people will not firft depart if they mall at any time firft depart from them under authority of the ftate through any fraud or deceit do thou O Jupiter on that day ftrike the Roman people in like man ner as I fhall here this day ftrike this fwine and ftrike them thou with greater fe verity in pro portion as thy power and ability are greater So faying he ftruck down the fwine with a flint ftone The Albans likewife by their dictator and rhcir priefts repeated their form of ratification ar d their oath XXV THE league being concliuled the three brothers on each lid purfuint to the agreement took OF ROME took arms the friends of each putting them in mind that  the gods of their country their country it felf the whole of their countrymen whether at home or in the army refted on their prowefs the decifion of their fate Naturally bold and couragemis and highly animated befides by fuch exhortations they advanced into the midft bctweer the two armies The two armies fat down before their refpective camps free from all apprehenfions of immediate danger to themfelves out not from deep anxiety no lefs than fovereign power being at ftake and depending on the bravery and fuccefs of fo fmall a number With all the eagernefs therefore of anxious lufpenfe they fixed their attention on an exhibition which was far indeed from being a matter of mere amufement The fignal being given the three youths who had been drawn up on each fide as in battle array their breafts animated with the magnanimous fpirits of whole armies rufhed for ward to the fight intent on mutual Slaughter utter ly thoughtlefs of their own perfonal peril and re flecting that on the event of the conteft depended the future fate and

hopes being as yet equally balanced their voice was lupprefied and even their breath was fufpended Afterwards in the progrefs of the com bat during which not only the activity of the young men s limbs and the rapid motions of their arms offenfive and defenfive but wounds alfo and blood were exhibited to view the three Albans were wounded and two of the Romans fell lifelefs one over the other On their fall the Alban army fet up a fhout of joy while the Roman legions were in a ftate of the moft painful anxiety alinoft bereft of hope and reduced to a ftate or defpair by the fituation of their champion who was nuw furround cd  45 T H E H I S T O R Y B o o K cd by the three Curiatii It happened that he was unhurt fo that though fingly he was by no means a match for them all together yet was he confident of fucceis againft each of them feparately In order therefore to avoid their joint attack he betook himfelf to flight judging that they would purfue with fuch different degrees of fpeed as their wounds would allow He had now fled to fome diftance from the place where they had fought when look ing back he perceived that there were large inter vals between the purluers and that one was at no great diftance from him againft him he turned back with great fury and while the Alban army called out to the Curiatii to fuccour their brother Horatius having in the mean rime flain his anta gonift proceeded victorious to attack the fecond The Romans then cheered their champion with Ihouts of applaufe fuch as naturally burft forth on occafions of unexpected joy on his part he delay ed not to put an end to the combat for before the third who was at no great diftance could come up to the relief of his brother he difpatched the fecond Curiatius And now they were brought to an equa lity in point of number only one on each fide furviving but were far from an equality either in hopes or in ftfength the one unhurt and fiufhed with two victories advanced with confidence to the third conteft the other enfeebled by a wound fatigued with running and difpirited befides by the fete of his brethren already flain met the victori ous enemy What followed could not be called a fight the Roman exulting cried out Two of you have I offered to the fhades of my brothers the third I will offer to the caufe in which we are engaged that the Roman may rule over the Al ban and whilft the other could fcarcely fup port the weight of his armour he plunged his fword downward into his throat then as he lay proftrate he defpoiled him of his arms The Ro mans OF ROME 41 roans received Horatiys with triumphant congratu B O O K lacions and a degree of joy proportioned to the greatnefs of the danger that had threatened their caufe Both parties then applied themfelves to the burying of their dead with very different difpofitions of mind the one being elated with the acquifition of empire the other deprefied under a foreign ju rifdiction The lepulchres ftill remain in the feve ral fpots where the combatants fell thofe of the two Romans in one place nearer to Alba thofe of the three Albans on the fide next to Rome but in different places as they fought XXVI BEFORE the armies feparatcd Mettius in conformity to the terms of the treaty defired to know from Tullus vvhat commands he would give and was ordered to keep the young men in readi nefe under arms as he intended to employ them in cafe of a war breaking out with the Veientians The two parties then retired to their refpective homes Horatius advanced at the head of the Ro mans bearing in triumph the fpoils of the three brothers near the gate Capena he was met by his fifter a maiden who had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii obferving on her brother s moulder the military robe of her lover made by her own hands me tore her hair and wiiji loud and mourn ful outcries called on the name of her deceafed fpoufe his fifter s lamentations in the midft of his own triumph and of fo great public joy irritated the fierce youth to fuch a degree that drawing his fword he plunged it into her breaft at the fame time upbraiding her in thefe words  Begone to thy fpoufe with thy unfcafonable love fince thou  couldft forget what is due to the memory of thy deceafed brothers to him who ftill furvives and to thy native country fo perifh every daughter of Rome that fhall mourn for its enemy Both the ftnate and geople were

commiffioners to pafs judgment on Horatius for murder according to the law The law was of dreadful import Let two com â miflioners pafs judgment for murder if the ac cufed appeal from the commiffioners let the ap f peal be tried if their fentence be confirmed cover his head hang him by a rope on the gal lows let him be fcourged either within the Po maerium or without the Pomaerium The two commifiloners appointed conformably to this law were of opinion that according to that law they were not authorifed to acquit him however fmall his guilt might be and after they had found him guilty one of them pronounced judgment in thefe words Publius Horatius I fentence thee to punifhment as a murderer go Lictor bind his hands The I ictor had come up to him and was fixing the cord when Horatius by the advice of Tullus who wifhed to give the mildeft interpre tation to the law faid I appeal fo the trial on the appeal came before the commons During this trial people s feelings were very deeply affected cfpecially by the behaviour of Publius Horatius the father who declared that  in his judgment his daughter was defervedly put to death had it not been fo he would by his own authority as a fa ther have inflicted punifhment on his fon He then befought them that  they would not leave him childlefs whom they had beheld but a few hours ago furrounded by children of uncommon

to make atonement for his fon at the public cxpence After performing expiatory facrifices which continued afterwards to be celebrated by the Horatian family he laid a beam acrofs the ftreet and

the power and fortune of the ftatc having been hazarded on three champions pervert ed the unfteady mind of the dictator and as his defigns though honourable had not been crowned with fuccefs he endeavoured by others of a differ ent kind to recover the efteem of his countrymen With this view therefore as formerly in time of war he had fought peace fo now when peace was efta blifhed he as ardently wifhed for war but perceiv ing that his own ftate pofiefied more courage than ftrength he perfuaded other nations to make war openly by order of their governments referving to his own people the part of effecting their purpofes by treachery under the mafk of allies The Fide natians a Roman colony being aflured of the con currence of the Veientians and receiving from the Albans a pofitive engagement to defert to their fide were prevailed on to take arms and declare war Fidenae having thus openly revolted Tullus after fummoning Mettius and his army from Alba march ed againft the enemy and pafling the Anio pitched his camp at the conflux of the rivers Between that place and Fidenae the Veientians had crofied the Tiber and in the line of battle they compofed the right wing near the river the Fidenatians being poft ed on the left towards the mountains Tullus drew up his own men facing the Veientians and pofted the Albans oppofite to the troops of the Fidenati ans The Alban had not more refolution than fide lity fo that not daring either to keep his ground or openly to defert he filed off flowly toward the mountains When he thought he had proceeded to a fufficient diftance he ordered the whole line to halt and being ftill irrefolute in order to wafte time he employed himfelf in forming the ranks his fcheme was to join his forces to whichever of the parties fortune fhould favour with vidlory At firft the O F R O M E ji the Romans who ftood neareft were aftonimed at  O O K finding their flank left uncovered by the departure of i their allies and in a fhort time a horfeman at full fpeed brought an account to the king that the Al bans were retreating Tullus in this perilous junc ture vowed to inftinite twelve new Salian priefts and alfo to build temples to Palenefs and Terror then rebuking the horfeman with a loud voice that the enemy might hear he ordered him to return to the fight telling him that  there was no occafion for any uneafinefs that it was by his order the Alban army was wheeling round in order to fall upon the unprotected rear of the Fidenatians He commanded him alfo to order the cavalry to raife their fpears aloft and this being performed intercepted from a great part of the infantry the view of the Alban army retreating thofe who did fee them believing what the king had faid fought with the greater fpirit The fright was now tranf ferred to the enemy for they had heard what the king had fpoken aloud and many of the Fidenatians underftood the Latine tongue as having been inter mixed with Romans in the colony Wherefore â dreading left the Albans might run down fuddenly from the hills and cut off their retreat to the town they betook themfelves to flight Tullus prefied them clofe and after routing this wing compofed of

 _â who had been fpectators of the engagement march ed down into the plain and Mettius congratulated Tullus on his victory over the enemy Tullus an fwered him without mewing any fign of difplea fure and gave orders that the Albans fhduld with the favour of fortune join their camp wlth that of the Romans and appointed a facrifke of purifica tion to be performed next day As foon as it was light all things being prepared in the ufual manner he commanded both armies to be fummoned to an affembly The heralds beginning at the outfide fummoned the Albans firft and they ftruck with the novelty of the affair and wifhing to hear the Roman king delivering a fpeech took their places neareft to hirri the Roman troops under arms purfuant to directions previoufly given formed a circle round them and a charge was given to the Centurions to execute without delay fuch orders as they mould receive Then Tullus began in this manner  If ever Romans there has hitherto oc curred at any time or in any war an occafion that called on you to return thanks firft to the immortal gods and next to your own valour it was the battle of yefterday for ye had to ftrug gle not only with your enemies but what is a more difficult and dangerous ftruggle with the treachery and perfidy of your allies for I will  now undeceive you it was not by my order that the Albans withdrew to the mountains nor was â what ye heard me fay the iffuing of orders but a ftratagem and a pretext of having given orders to the end that while ye were kept in ignorance of your being delerted your attention might not be drawn away from the fight and that at the  fame time the enemy believing themfelves to be furrounded on the rear might be ftruck with ter ror and difmay but the guilt which I am expofing  to you extends not to all the Albans they fol lowed OF ROME 53 lowed their leader as ye would have done had I B o o K chofen that the army mould make any movement from the ground which it occupied Mettius there was the leader of that march the fame Met tius was the fchemer of this war Mettius it was who broke the league between the Romans and Albans May others dare to commit like crimes if I do not now make him a confpicuous example to all mankind On this the Centurions in arms gathered round Mettius and the king proceed ed in his difcourfe Albans be the meafure prof perous fortunate and happy to the Roman people to me and to you it is my intention to remove the entire people of Alba to Rome to give to the commons the privileges of citizens and to enroll the principal inhabitants among the fathers to form of the

to depart and the cram of the houfes which the troops were de molifhing in the outer parts of the city aflailed their ears and the duft raifed in diftant places had filled all parts enveloping them as with a cloud each of them haftily fnatching up whatever he could and leaving behind his guardian deity his houfehold gods and the houfe wherein he had been born and educated they began their departure and foon filled the roads with one continued troop of emigrants the fight of each other continually renewing their tears through the mutual commiferation which it excited in every breaft and their ears being availed with OF ROME S5 â with bitter lamentations efpecially from the women B O O K while they were pafling by the temples which they   _f had been ufed to revere now filled with armed fol diers and were leaving their gods as it were in cap  tivity When the Albans had evacuated the city the Romans levelled to the ground all the buildings in every part of it both public and private and in one hour ruined and deftroyed the work of four hundred years during which Alba had ftood The temples of the gods however they left untouched for fo the king had commanded XXX MEANWHILE from this deftruction of Alba Rome received a confiderable augmentation The number of citizens was doubled The CEE lian mount was added to the city and in order to induce others to fix their habitations there Tullus chofe that fituation for his palace where from thenceforth he refided The perfons of chief note among the Albans the Tulii Servilii Quintii Geganii Curiatii Clcelii he enrolled among the fenators that this part of the ftate alfo might receive an addition and as a confecrated place of meeting for this body thus augmented he built a ienate houfe which retained the name of Hoftilia even within the memory of our fathers And that every order in the ftate might receive an acce Tiort of ftrength from this new people he chofe from among the Albans ten troops of horfemen From among them alfo he drew recruits with which he both filled up the old and formed fome new legions Encouraged by this formidable ftate of his y R forces he declared war againft the Sabincs a ico nation the moft powerful of that age next to the  c Etrurians both in point of numbers and of fkill in arms Injuries had been offered on both fides and fatisfaction demanded in vain Tullus com plained that fome Roman traders had been leized in an open fair at the temple of Feronia The E 4 Sabines 56 THE HISTORY if o o K Sabines that prior to this fome of their people had fled into the Afylum and were detained at Rome Thefe were the reafons afilgned for the war The Sabines reflecting that a great part of their original ftrength had been fixed at Rome by Tatius and that the Roman power had been allb lately increafed by the accefiion of the people of Alba took care on their part to look round for foreign aid Etruria lay in their neighbourhood and the ftate of the Etrurians neareft to them was that of the Veientians From among thefe they procured a number of volunteers who were in duced to take part againft the Romans principally by the refentment which they ftill retained on account of their former quarrels Several alfo of the populace who were indigent and unprovided of a fettlement were allured by pay From the government they received no afiiftance and the Veientians for it was lefs furprifing in others ad hered to the terms of the truce ftipulated with Ro mulus Vigorous preparations being made on both fides and it being evident that whichever party fhould firft commence hoftilities would have con fiderably the advantage Tullus feized the oppor tunity of making an jncurfion into the lands of the Sabines A furious battle enfued at the wood Called Malitiofa in which the Romans obtained the vicctory and for this they were indebted not only to the firm ftrength of their infantry but chiefly to the cavalry which had been lately aug mented For by a fudden charge of this body the ranks of the Sabines were thrown into fucli diforder that they were neither able to continue the fight nor to make good their retreat without great flaughter XXXI AFTg the defeat of the Sabines the government of Tullus and the Roman ftate in general pbffcffed a large degree of pow er and of fame O F R O M E 57 fame At this time an account was brought to the BOOK king and the fenate that a fhower of ftones had v fallen on the Alban mount This appearing fcarcely credible and fome perfons being fent to examine into the prodigy there fell from the air in their fight a vaft quantity of ftones juft as when the wind drives down hail compacted into lumps They imagined alfo that they heard a loud voice from the grove on the fummit of the hill ordering that the Albans fhould perform religious rites according to the practice of their native country Thefe the Albans had entirely configned to oblivion as if with their country they had alfo abandoned its deities and had adopted the Roman practice or perhaps incenfed againft fortune had renounced the worfhip of the gods On account of the fame prodigy the Romans alfo inftituted for themfelves by order of government a feftival of nine days either in obedience to a voice from heaven uttered on the Alban mount for that likewife is mentioned or to the directions of the arufpices the practice certainly continued that whenever an account was received of the fame prodigy happening a feftival for nine days was celebrated In a fhort time after the country was afflicted with a peftilence and though this neceflarily rendered men averfe to military fervice yet the king in himfelf fond of war and perfuaded that young men enjoyed better health while employed abroad than when loitering at home gave them no reft from arms until he was feized by a tedious diforder Then together with the ftrength of his body the fiercenefs of his fpirit was reduced to fuch a degree that he who lately thought nothing lefs becoming a king than to bufy his thoughts in matters of religion became at once a flave to every kind of fuperftition in cafes either of great or of trifling import and even filled the minds of the people alfo with fuperftitious notions The generality comparing the prefent ftate of their affairs 5 THE HISTORY B o o K affairs with that which they had enjoyed underNuma L __ became pofiefied of an opinion that the only prof pect left them of being relieved from the ficknefs was in obtaining pardon and favour from the gods It is faid that the king himfclf turning over the com mentaries of Numa and difcovering there that cer tain fecret folemn facrifices had been performed to Jupiter Elicius fhut himfelf up and fet about the performance of this foltmnity but not having un dertaken or conducted the rites in due form he not only failed of obtaining any notification from the gods but through the refentment of Jupiter for being addrefied in an improper manner was ftruck with lightning and reduced to afhes together with his houfe Tullus reigned thirty two years highly renowned for his military atchievements Y R XXXII ON the death of Tullus the direction jVc Of affa rs according to the mode adopted from the 6s beginning fell into the hands of the fenate they nominated an interrex who prefided at the election when the people created Ancus Marcius king and the fenate approved of their choice Ancus Mar cius was the grandfon of Numa Pompilius by his daughter As foon as he was in pofieffion of the throne reflecting on the glory which his grandfa ther had acquired and confidering that the late ireign though highly honourable in other refpecl s yet in one particular had been very deficient the affairs of religion having been either quite neglecl ed or improperly managed he judged it to be a matter of the utmoft confequence to provide that the public â worfhip fhould be performed in the manner infti tuted by Numa and ordered the pontiff to make a tranfcript of every particular r Ite from the com mentaries of that king on white tables and to ex pofe it to the view of the public From thefe pro  ceedings not only his fubjeccts whofe wifhes tended to peace but the neighbouring ftates alfo conceived 6 hopes O P R O M E 59 hopes that the king would conform himfelf to the BOOK manners and inftitutions of his grandfather In con fequence of which the Latines with whom a treaty had been concluded in the reign of Tullus aflTumed new courage and made an incurfion into the Ro man territories and when the Romans demanded fatisfa ion returned a haughty anfwer imagining the Roman king fo averfe to action that he would fpend his reign among the chapels and altars The genius of Ancus was of a middle kind between Numa s and that of Romulus partaking of both and he was fenfible not only that peace had been more neceflary in the reign of his grandfather to a people who were but lately incorporated and ftill uncivilized but alfo that the tranquillity which had obtained at that time could not now be pre ferved without a tame fubmiffion to injuries that they were making trial of his patience and having tried would come to defpife it in fhort that the times required a king like Tullus rather than one like Numa However being defirous that as Nu ma had inftituted the religious rites to be obferved in time of peace fothe ceremonies to be obferved in war fhould have himfelf for their founder and that wars mould not only be waged but be pro claimed likewife according to a certain eftablifhed mode he borrowed from the antient race of the Equicolae that form of demanding fatisfaction which is ftill ufed by the heralds The ambaflador when he comes to the frontiers of the ftate from whom fatisfaction is demanded having his head co vered with a fillet of wool fays O Jupiter hear me hear ye frontiers of whatever ftate they belong to naming it  let juftice hear I am a public mefienger of the Roman people I come an ambaflador duly authorized according w to the forms of juftice and religion let my words therefore meet with credir He then repeats his demands and afterwards appeals to Jupiter  If I demand THE HISTORY  demand thatthofe perfons and thofe effects mould be given up to me the meffenger of the Roman people contrary to juftice and the laws of the nations then fuffer me not to enjoy my native country Thefe words he repeats when he pafies over the boundaries the fame to the firft perfon that he meets again when he enters the gate j and laftly when he enters the Forum only making the neceffary change of a few words in the form of the declaration and of the oath If the per fons whom he demands are not given up then on the expiration of thirty three days that being the number enjoined by the rule he declares war in this manner  O Jupiter hear me and thou Juno Quirinus and all ye gods of heaven and ye of the earth and ye of the infernal regions hear I call you to witnefs that that people naming them whoever they are  are unjuft and do not perform what equity requires But concerning thofe affairs we will confult the elders in our own country by what means we may obtain our right After this the meffenger returned to Rome in order that the opinion of the government might be taken The king immediately confulted the fenate nearly in thefe words Concerning thofe matters controverfies and arguments which  were adjufted between the Pater Patratus of the Roman people the Quirites and the Pater Patra tus of the antient Latines and the antient Latine people which matters ought to have been grant ed performed and difcharged and which mat ters they have neither granted performed nor difcharged declare faid he to the perfon whofe vote he firft afked  what is your opinion The other then faid  I am of opinion that the per formance of them ought to be exacted in juft and regular war wherefore I confent to and vote for it The reft were then afked in order and the majority of thofe prefent agreeing in the fame opi O F R O M E ft hibn a vote pafied for war It was a cuftomary BOOK pra ice for the heralds to carry a fpear pointed with fteel or burnt at the point and dipped in blood to the frontiers and there in the prefence of at leaft three grown up perfons to fay  For as much as the ftates of the antient Latines and the antient Latine people have acted againft arhi behaved unjuftly towards the Roman people the Qmrites for as much as the Roman people the Quirites have ordered that there mould be war with the antient Latines and the fenateof the Roman peo ple the Quirites have given their opinion con fented and voted that war mould be made with the antient Latines therefore I and the Roman people do declare and make war againft the ftates of the antient Latines and the antient La tine people and faying this he threw the fpear within their boundaries In this manner was fatif faction demanded from the Latines at that time and war declared fucceeding generations adopted the fame method XXXIII ANGUS having committed the care of religious affairs to the ffamens and other priefts af fembled a new army fet out to the war and took Politorium a city of the Latines by ftorm Then purfuing the practice of former kings who had aug mented the power of the Roman ftate by receiving enemies into the number of their citizens he re moved the whole multitude to Rome and as the original Romans entirely occupied the ground round the Palatium the Sabines the Capitol with the cita del and the Albans the Caelian Mount the Averi tine was afligned to this body of new citizens and in a little time after on the reduction of Tellena and Ficana an additional number of inhabitants were fettled in the fame place Politorium was foon after attacked a feconJ time by the Roman forces the antient Latines having taken poffeflion of 52 THEHI8TORY B o o K of jf when left without inhabitants and this induced j the Romans to demolifh that city that it might not always ferve for a receptacle to the enemy At length the whole force of the Latine war was col lected about Medullia and the conteft was carried on there with various fuccefs for the city was not only well defended by works and fecured by a ftrong garriTon but the army of the Latines having pitched their camp in the open country fought the Romans feveral times in clofe engagement At laft Ancus making a vigorous effort with all his force firft defeated them in the field and then made him felf mafter of the city from whence he returned with immenfe booty to Rome On this occafion too many thoufands of the Latines being admitted into the number of citizens had ground allotted to them near the temple of Murcia in order to unite the Aventine to the Palatine hill The Janiculum alfo was taken in not for want of room but to pre vent its ferving at any time as a place of ftrength to an enemy and it was determined that this mould be joined to the city not only by a wall but like wife for the convenience of paffage by a wooden bridge which was then firft built over the Tiber The Quiritian trench alfo no inconfiderable defence to thofe parts which from their low fituation arc of eafy accefs is a work of king Ancus In confe quence of thefe vaft accefiions to the ftate and the numbers of people becoming fo very large many difregarding the diftinctions between right and wrong committed various crimes and efcaped dif covery In order to fupprefs by terror the boldnefs which the vicious aflumed from hence and which gained ground continually a prifon was built in the middle of the city adjoining the Forum and not only the city but the territory alfo and boundaries of the ftate were extended by this king The Mae lian fore ft was taken away from the Veientians the Roman dominion extended as far as the fea and the city OF ROME 63 city of Oftia built at the mouth of the Tiber near BOOK which falt pits were formed and in confequence of    the glorious fucceft obtained in war the temple of Jupiter Feretrius was enlarged XXXIV DURING the reign of Ancus a perfon Y R named Lucumo of an enterprizing fpirit and pof 1 fefied of great wealth came and fettled at Rome  led principally by ambition and hopes of attaining higher honours than he could expect at Tarquinii where alfo he was confidered as an alien He was the fon of Demaratusa Corinthian who having left his native country in confequence of fome inteftine commotions happened to fix his refidence at Tar quinii and marrying there had two fons Their names were Lucumo and Aruns Lucumo furvived his father and inherited all his property Aruns died before the father leaving a wife pregnant The father did not long furvive his fon and as not knowing that his daughter in law was with child he died without taking any notice of a grandfon in his will the boy who was born after his grandfather s deceafe not being entitled to any fhare of his pro perty was called from the poverty of his fituation Egerius Lucumo on the other hand inheriting the entire property was by his riches infpired with high notions and thefe were elevated to a ftill higher pitch by his marriage with Tanaquil a wo man of the higheft diftinction who could not en dure with patience that the rank of the man whom he had married mould remain inferior to that of the family which gave her birth As the Etrurians looked with contempt on Lucumo the defcendant of a foreign exile fhe could not fupport the indig nity but difregarding her natural attachment to her coup try in companion with the pleafure of feeing her hufband raifed to an honourable rank formed the defign of removing from Tarquinii Rome ap peared beft fuited to her purpofe In a new ftate where 64 THE HISTORY BOOK where all nobility was of late date and acquired by merit fhe thought there would be room for a mart of fpirit and induftry She confidered that Tathjs a Sabine had enjoyed the throne that Numa had been called to the crown from Cures and that An cus was of a Sabine family by his father and could fhew only the fingle image of Numa to entitle him to nobility She found it eafy to perfuade her huf band who was ambitious of honours and had no natural attachment to Tarquinii except through his mother Wherefore carrying their effects along with them they fet out together for Rome They happened to come through the Janiculum there as he fat in the chariot with his wife an eagle fuf pending herfelf on her wings ftooped gently and took off his cap and after hovering for fome time over the chariot with loud fcreams replaced it in its proper pofition on his head as if fhe had been fent by fome deity to perform that office and then fly ing up into the air difappeared It is faid that this augury was received with great joy by Tanaquil who was well fkilled in celeftial prodigies as the Etrurians generally are Embracing her hufband fhe defired him to cherifh hopes of high and magnificent fortune for that fuch a bird from fuch a quarter of the heaven the mefienger of fuch a deity portended no lefs that it had exhibited the omen on the moft elevated part of the human body and had lifted up the ornament placed on the head of man in order to replace it on the fame part by direction of the gods Full of thefe thoughts and expectations they advanced into the city and having purchafed a houfe there they gave out his name as Lucius Tarquinius The circum ftance of his being a ftranger and his wealth foon attracted the general notice of the Romans nor was he wanting on his part in aiding the efforts of for tune in his favour he conciliated the friend fhip of all to the utmoft of his power by his courteous ad drefs hofpitable entertainments and generous acts i at O F R O M E 6S at laft his character reached even the palace Hav BOOK ing thus procured an introduction there he foon improved it to fuch a degree by his politenefs and dexterity in paying his court that he was admitted to the privileges of familiar friendfhip and was con fulted in all affairs both public and private foreign and dorheftic and having acquitted lumfelf to fatif faction in all was at length by the king s will ap pointed guardian to his children Ancus reigned twenty four years equal in renown and in the arts both of peace and war to any of the former kings XXXV THE fons of Ancus had now nearly reached the age of manhood for which reafon Tarquinius the more earneftly prefied that an afiem bly might be convened as fpcedy as poflible for the election of a king The proclamation for this pur pofe being iflued when the time approached he fent the youths to a diftance on a hunting party He is laid to have afforded the firft inftance of making way to the crown by paying court to the people and to have made a fpeech compofed forj the purpofe of gaining the affections of the populace telling them that  It was no new favour which he iblicited for he was not the firft foreigner if that were the cafe people might indeed be difpleafed and fur prized but the third who aimed at the govern i ment of Rome â that Tatius from being not only a foreigner but even an enemy was made king and Numa entirely unacquainted with the city and not propofing himfelf as a candidate c had been from their own choice invited to ac cept the crown â that he as foon as he became his own mafter had removed to Rome with his wife and all his fubftance â that he had fpent the greater part of that time of life which men ge nerally employ in public bufinefs at Rome than in his former refidence â that both in civil and military employments he had learned the Roman VOL K F laws 66 THE HISTORY  o o K laws an Roman cuftoms under fuch a mafter as v  t ought to be wifhed for king Ancus himfelf â that in duty and obedience to the king he had vied with all men in kindnefs towards others with the king himfelf As thefe affertions were no more than the truth the people unanimoufly con y R fented that he mould be elected king And this ijÂ was the reafon that this man of extraordinary merit S6 c in other refpects retained through the whole courfe  of his reign the fame affectation of popularity which he had ufed in fuing for the crown For the pur pofe of ftrengthening his own authority as well as of increafing the power of the commonwealth he added an hundred to the number of the fenate who afterwards were entitled minorum gentium  e of the younger families and neceflarily confti tuted a party in favour of the king by whofe kind nefs they had been brought into the fenate His firft war was with the Latines from whom he took the city Appiolae by ftorm and having brought from thence a greater quantity of booty than had been expected from a war of lo little confequence he exhibited games in a more expenfive and  fplendid manner than any of the former kings On that occafion the ground was firft marked out for the Circus which is now called  maximus the principal in which certain divifions were let apart for the fenators and knights where each were to build feats for themfelves which were called Fori benches They fat during the exhibition on feats fupported by pieces of timber twelve feet high from the ground the games conGfted of horfe races and the performances of wreftlers collected moftly from Etruria From that time thefe games continued to be celebrated annually being termed the Roman and fometimes the great games By the fame king lots for building were afljgned to private perfons round the Forum where porti coes and fhops were erected â  XXXVI HE Ot ROME 67 XXXVI HB intended alfo to have furrounded B o o K the city with a ftone wall but a war with the Sa 1 _ _ bines interrupted his defigns And fo fuddenly did this break out that the enemy pafied the Anio be fore the Roman troops could march out to me et them and flop their progrefs This produced a great alarm at Rome and in the firft engagement the victory remained undecided after great flaugh ter on both fides The enemy afterwards having retired to their camp and allowed the Romans time to prepare for the war anew Tarquinius obferving that the principal defect of his army was the want of cavalry refolved to add other centuries to the Ramnenfes Titienfes and Luceres inftituted by Romulus and to leave them diftinguifhed by his own name As Romulus when he firft formed this inftitution had made ufe of augury Accius Naevius a celebrated augur at that time infifted that no alte ration or addition could be made to it without the fanction of the birds The king was highly dif pleafed at this and in ridicule of the art faid as we are told  Come you diviner difcover by your augury whether what I am now thinking of can be accomplifhed The other having tried the matter according to the rules of augury and declared that it could be accomplifhed  Well faid he  what I was thinking of was whether you could cut a whetftone in two with a razor Take thefe then and perform what your birds portend to be prac C ticable On which as the ftory goes he with out any difficulty cut the whetftone There was a ftatue of Accius with a fillet on his head in the place where the transaction happened in the Comi tium or place of afiembly juft on the fteps at the left hand fide of the fenate houfe It is alfo faid that the whetftone was

peace was undertaken without confulting the birds meetings of the people embodying of ar mies the moft important concerns of the ftate were poftponed when the birds did not allow them Nor did Tarquinius then make any change in the number of the centuries of the knights but doubled the number in each fo that there were one thoufand eight hundred men in the three centuries The ad ditional men were only diftinguifhed by the appella tion of the younger prefixed to the original names of their centuries and thefe at prefent for they have been fince doubled are called the Six Cen turies XXXVII HAVING augmented this part of his army he came to a fecond engagement with the Sabines And here befides that the Roman army had an addition of ftrength a ftratagem alfo was made ufe of which

the blazing timber moft of which was placed on rafts being driven againft the piers where it ftuck faft burned down the bridge This event not only ftruck terror into the Sabines during the fight but prevented their retreating when they betook themfelves to flight fo that great numbers who had efcaped the enemy perifhed in the river And their arms being known at the city as they floated in the Tiber gave certain alFurance of the victory fooner almoft than any mefienger could ar rive In that battle the cavalry gained extraordinary honour We are told that being pofted on both wings when the line of their infantry which formed the centre was obliged to give ground they made fo furious a charge on the flanks of the enemy that they O F R O M E they not only checked the Sabine legions who were vigoroufly prefling the troops which gave way but quickly put them to the rout The Sabines fled precipitately toward the mountains which but few of them reached The greateft part as has been mentioned were driven by the cavalry into the river Tarquinius judging it proper to purfue the enemy clofely before they mould recover from their difmay as foon as he had fent off the booty and prifoners to Rome and burned the fpoils of the enemy collected together in a great heap accord ing to a vow which he had made to Vulcan pro ceeded to lead his army forward into the Sabine territories On the other hand the Sabines though they had met with a defeat and had no reafon to hope that they mould be able to retrieve it yet their circumftances not allowing time for deliberation ad vanced to meet him with fuch troops as they had haftily levied and being routed a fecond time and reduced almoft to ruin they fued for peace XXXVIII COLLATIA and all the land around that city was taken from the Sabines and Egerius fon to the king s brother was left there with a gar rifon This was the manner as I underftand in which the people of Collatia came under the doÂ minion of the Romans and this was

this he made war on the ancient Latines during which there happened no ge eral engagement By leading about his army to the feveral to yns he reduced the whole Latine ra ce to fubjection Corniculum old Ficulnea Ca meria Cruftumerium Ameriola Medullia Nomen tum allthefe towns which either belonged to the ancient Latines or had revolted to them were taken and foon after peace was re eftablifhed He then applied himfelf to works of peace with a degree of fpirit which even exceeded the efforts that he had made in war fo that the people enjoyed not more reft at home than they had during the campaigns  for he fet about furrounding with a wall of ftone thofe parts of the city which he had not already for tified which work had been interrupted at the beginning by the war of the Sabines And the lower parts of the city about the Forum and the other hollows that lay between the hills from whence it was difficult to discharge the water by reafon of their fituation he drained by means of fewers drawn on a Hope down to the Tiber He alfo marked out and laid the foundations for inclofing a court round the temple of Jupiter in the Capitol which he had vowed during the Sabine war his mind already prefaging the future magnificence of the place XXXIX ABOUT that time a prodigy was feen in the palace wonderful both in the appearance and in the event They relate that whilft a boy whofe name was Servius Tullius lay afleep his head blazed with fire in the fight of many people that by the loud cries of aftonifhment occafioned by luch a miraculous appearance the king and queen were  This is

Tarquinius Servius Tullius ftood in the higheft degree of eftimation not only with the king but with the fenate and the commons At this time the two tons of Ancus although they had before this always confidered it as the higheft indignity that they mould be expelled from the throne of their father by the perfidy of their guardian and that the fovereignty of Rome mould be enjoyed by a ftranger whofe family fo far from being natives of the city were not even natives of Italy yet now felt their indignation rife to a higher pitch of vio lence at the probability that the crown was not to revert to them even after Tarquinius but was to continue to fink one ftep after another until it fell on the head of a flave fo that within the fpace of a little more than an hundred years from the time when Romulus defcended from a deity and himfelf a deity had during his abode on earth held the government a flave the fon of a lave fhould now get poficifion of it They looked on it as a difgrace to the Roman name in general and particularly to their own houfe if while there was male iflue of king Ancus furviving the government of Rome fhould be proftituted not only to ftrangers but to flaves They determined therefore to prevent this dif honour by the fword But refentment for the in jury which they had fuffered ftimulated them ftrong ly to attack Tarquinius himfelf rather than Servius and alib the conrideration that the king if he furT vived would be able to take levcrer vengeance for the murder than a private perfon could and tjhat befides were Servius put to death whatever other fon in

aloud and each furioufly abufed the other until being rebuked by a Hctor and ordered to fpeak in their turns they defifted from railing Then as they had concerted one began to explain the affair j and

eftablifhment war was undertaken againft the Veientians the truce with them having expired and againft the other EtrOrians In that war both the valour and the good fortune of Tullius were very confpicuous And after vanquifhing a powerful army of the ene my he returned to Rome no longer confidering his authority as precarious whether it were to de pend on the difpofition of the Patricians

the wor fhip of the gods fo pofterity fhould celebrate Servi us as the author of every diftin ion between the members of the ftate and of that fubordination of ranks by means of which the limits between the feveral degrees of dignity and fortune are exactly afcertained 76 THE HISTORY Â o o K afcertained For he inftituted the Cenfus an ordi L T nance of the moft falutary confequence in an empire that was to rife to fuch a pitch of greatnefs j ac Y R cording to which the feveral fervices requifite in 3 C war and peace were to be difcharged not by every 555 perfon indifcriminatcly as formerly but according to the proportion of their feveral properties He then according to the Cenfus formed the plan of the Clafies and Centuries and the arrangement which fubfifts at prefent calculated to prelerve re gularity and propriety in all tranfactions either of peace or war XLIII OF thofe who pofiefied a hundred thou fand afes  or more he formed eighty Centuries forty elder and the fame number of younger f The collective body of thefe was denominated the firft clafs The bufinefs of the elder was to guard the city that of the younger to carry on war abroad T ie arms which they were ordered to pro vide were a helmet mield greaves coat of mail all of brafs thefe for the defence of the body Their weapons of offence were a fpear and a fword TO this clafs were added two Centuries of artificers who were to ferve without arms The fervice al lotted to them was to attend the machines in war The fortune fixed for the fccond clafs was from a hundred down to feventy five thoufandafes J  Of thefe elder and younger were formed twenty Cen turies The arms which they were ordered to pro vide were a buckler inftead of a fhield and all the reft except the coat of mail the fame with the former The fortune of the third clafs he fixed at fifty thoufand afes Â  The number of Centuries was â 311 i8s 4d according to Dr Arbuthnot s calculation f The elder confifted of thofe

they were allowed none but a fpear and a buckler The fifth clafs was larger it contained thirty Centuries thefe carried flings and Hones which they were to throw A mong thde the cxtraordinaries trumpeters and fifers were diltributed into three Centuries This clafs was rated at eleven thoufand afesf The reft of the populace were comprehended under an eftimate lower than this and of them was

their defcend ing beyond this fo as to come to the loweft clafies Nor ought it to be wondered at that the arrange ment which fubfifts at prefent after the tribes had been increafed to thirty five and the number of them almoft doubled does not agree in the number of Centuries younger and elder with the amount of thofe inftituted by Servius Tullius for the city be ing laid out into four divifions according to the fe veral quarters and hills the parts that were inhabit ed thefe were what he called Tribes I fuppofe from the tribute for the mode of the people s paying their fbares of this in an

place into repute He furrounded the city vviih a ram part trenches and a wall and thus extended the Pomcerium Thofe who confider merely the ety mology of the word explain Pomcerium as denoting a fpace

called Pomcerium not becaufe it was on the outfide of the wall any more than becaufe the wall was on the outfide of it and always on occa fion of an addition being made to the city as far as they intended that the walls mould advance out ward fo far thefe facred limits were extended XLV HAVING increafed the power of the ftate by this enlargement of the city and made every in ternal regulation that appeared beft adapted to the exigencies both of war and peace the king who wifhed that the acquifition of power mould not al ways depend on the mere force of arms laid a fcheme for extending his dominion by the wifdom of his counfels and railing at the fame time a con â fpicuous ornament to the city The temple of Dia na atEphefus was at that time univerfally celebrated  â 10 and THÂ HISTORY  and it was commonly believed that it had bee n built by a general contribution from the feveral ftates of Afia Servius in converfation with the chief men of the Latines with whom he had taken pains to form connections of hofpitality and friendfhip both in his public and private capacity ufed frequently in the ftrongeft terms to recommend concord artd a focial union between their feveral gods and by often repeating the fame fentimen s prevailed fo far at laft that the Latine ftates agreed to build in conjunction with the Roman people a temple to Diana at Rome This was an acknowledgment that Rome was the fovereign head of both nations a point which had been fo often difputed in arms But though the Latines finding all their efforts in war ineffectual fcemed now to have thrown afide all concern with regard to that matter yet ampng the Sabines one particular perfon did not neglect an opportunity which feemed to be thrown in his way by fortune of recovering independence by the exe cution of a fcheme which he planned himfelf It is re lated that a certain head of a family among the Sa bines had a heifer calf of wonderful fize and beauty produced by one of his cows her horns which re mained for many ages fixed in the porch of the temple of Diana were a monument of this wonder The matter was confidered in the light of a prodigy as it defcrved and the ibothfayers declared that fove reignty would refide in that ftate whofe fubject mould facrifice this heifer to Diana and this prediction had reached the ears of the prieft who had the charge of Diana s temple The Sabine as foon as he had fixed on a proper day for the facrifice drove the heifer to Rome brought her to the te tiple of Diana and placed her before the altar the prieft lufpecting the truth from the fize of the victim of which he had heard fo much and remembering the predic tion addrefles the Sabine thus  Stranger what are you preparing to do To perform facrifice to Diana OF ROME Â i  Diana without having purified

in due order that the event might anfwer to the prodigy went down from the temple to the Tiber In the mean time the Roman facrificed the heifer to Diana a circum ftance which gave great pleafure to the king and to the whole ftate XLVI SERVIUS though long poflcfllon had now rendered his title to the crown indifputable yet having heard that young Tarquinius fometimes threw out infinuations that he held the government without the order of the people firft ingratiated himfelf with the commons by making a general diftribution among them of the lands taken from the enemy and then ventured to propofe the queftion to the people whether they chofe and ordered that he mould be king Whereupon he was de clared king with greater unanimity than had ever before appeared on any fimilar occafion Nor did the event lefien the hopes which Tarquinius had conceived of being able to feat himfelf on the throne on the contrary having obferved that the proceedings relative to the lands for the commons were highly difagreeable to the Patricians he em braced the more eagerly the opportunity which this afforded him of arraigning the condiict of Servius before the Patricians and of increafing his own influence in the fenate For the young man was naturally of a fiery temper and his reftlels fpirit was continually ftimulated at home by his wife Tullia and even the palace at Rome was to exhibit a fcene of tragical villainy that difgufted at kings the people might become more ripe for the averting of their liberty and that a reign founded in wicked nefs mould prove the laft Whether this Lucius

happened luckily that the two violent difpofitions were not united in wed lock owing I prefume to the good fortune of the Koman people that the reign of Servius being lengthened the manners of the

phrenzy infufed into him by this woman went round among the Patricians particu larly thofe of the younger families and folicrted their intereft put them in mind of his father s kindnefs to them and demanded a requital of it enticed the young men by preients and endeavoured to increafe liis confequence on every oecafion both by magni ficent promifes on his part and by heavy charges of naifconduct againft the king At length judging the feafon ripe for the accomplifhment of his pur pofe he rufhed fuddenly into the Forum attended by a band of armed men and while all were ftruck motionlefs with terror proceeded through it and then feati ng himfelf in the king s throne in the fe nate houfe ordered the fenators to be fummoned by a herald into the fenate houfe to attend their kjng Tarquinius They aiTembled inftantly Ibme having been prepared before for the oecafion others dreading ill confequences to themfelves in cafe they did not attend for they were filled with amazement at the novelty and ftrangenefs of the proceeding and thought the cafe of Servius utterly defperate Then Tarquinius beginning his invectives with re ftWHons on the king s immediate anceftors repre fcnted him as a  flave the fon of a flave who after the untimely death of his parent without an interregnum being appointed as ufual without an election being held had taken pofieflion of the throne not in confequence of a vote of the peo pie or of the approbation of the fenate but as  the O F R O M E Sj  the gift of a woman Being thus defcended and BOOK 11 thus created king ever favouring the loweft clafs of people to which he himfelf belonged he had through an antipathy to the honourable defcent of others taken away the lands from the chief  men in the ftate and diftributed them among the very meaneft All the burthens which heretofore had been born in common he had thrown on thofe of higheft rank He had inftituted the  Cenfus in order that the fortunes of the more wealthy might be the more confpicuoufly cxpofed tÂ envy and might become a ready fund out of which he might when he chofe give bribes to the Â rnoft needy XLVIII IN the midft of this harangue Servius having been alarmed by an account of the diftprb ance entered and immediately from the porch of the fenate houfe called out with a loud voice What is the matter here Tarquinius How dare you prefume while I am alive to convene the fenate or to fit on my throne To this the other in a determined tone replied That the feat which he held was the feat of his own father that as the king s fon he was much better en titled to inherit the throne than a flave and that he had been fuffered long enough to infuk his mafters with arbitrary infolencc A cla morous difpute immediately began between the par tizans of each the people ran together in crouds into the fenate houfe and it became evidefu that the pofieflion of the throne depended on the i Tue of this conteft On this Tarquinius compelled now by neceflity to proceed to the laft extremity having greatly the advantage in point of age and ftrength caught Servius by the middle and carrying him out of the lenate houfe threw him down from the top to the bottom of the ftairs and then returned to keep the enators together The king s officers c and S THEHISTORT BOOK and attendants fled immediately He himfelf being L defperately hurt with his royal retinue who were terrified almoft to death attempted to retire to his houfe and had arrived at the head of the Cyprian ftreet when he was flain by fome who had been fent thither for that purpofe by Tarquinius and had overtaken him in his flight It is believed other inftances of her wickednefs rendering it cre dible that this was done by the advice of Tullia It is certain for there is fufficient proof of the fact that fhe drove into the Forum in her chariot and without being abafhed at fuch a multitude of men called out her hufband from the fenate houfe and was the firft who faluted him king She was then ordered by him to withdraw from fuch a tumult and when in her return home fhe arrived at the head of the Cyprian ftreet where the enclofure of Diana lately ftood as the chariot turned to the right towards the Virbian hill in order to drive up to the Efquilian mount the perfon who drove the horfes ftruck with horror ftopped and drew in the reins and fhewed his miftrefs the murdered Servius lying on the ground The barbarity of her behaviour on this occafion is reprefented as in human and fhocking and the place bears teftimo ny to it being thence called the wicked ftreet where Tullia divefted of all feeling agitated by the Furies the avengers of her fifter and hufband is laid to have driven her chariot over her father s corpfe and to have carried on her bloody vehicle part of the body and the blood of her father with which flie herfelf was alfo fprinkled and ftained to the houfehold gods of her and her hufband s family through whofe refentment followed fhortly after a train of events fuited to the iniquitous commence ment of this reign Servius Tullius reigned forty four years during which his conduct was fuch that even a good and moderate fuccefibr would have found it difficult to lupport a competition with him This O F R O M E 8 This circumftance alfo ftill farther enhanced his BOOK fame that together with him perifhed all regular and legal government Mild and moderate as his adminiftration was yet becaufe the government was lodged in the hands of a fingle perfon fome au thors tell us he intended to have refigned it had not the wickednefs of his family broken off the defigns which he meditated for eftabliming the liberty of his country XLIX THUS began the reign of Lucius Tar Y R quinius who from his fubfequent behaviour got the g1 furname of the proud for this unworthy fon in law s j1 prohibited the burial of his father in law alleging that Romulus likewife had remained unburied The principal fenators whom he fufpe ed of fa vouring the intereft of Servius he put to death and foon becoming apprehenfive that the prece dent of acquiring the crown by wicked means might be adopted from his own practice againft himfclf he kept an armed band about him for the fecurity of his perfon for he had no kind of title to the crown but that of force holding it neither by the order of the people nor with the approba tion of the fenate And befides this as he could place no reliance on the affection of his fubjects he was obliged to raife in their fears a fence to his authority In order to diffufe thefe the more ex tenfively he took entirely into his own hands the cognizance of capital offences which he determi ned without confulting with any perfon whatever by which means he could put to death banim or impofe fines not only on thofe whom he fufpected or difliked but on perfons with refpecl to whornj he could have no other view than that of plunder Having by thefe means diminifhed the number of the fenate againft whom his proceedings were chiefly levelled he determined not to fill up the va cancies j hoping that the fmallnefs of their number o would 88 THEHISTORY B o o K would expofe that body to the greater contempt and that they would fhew the lefs refentment at their not being confulted on any bufinefs for he was the firft of the kings who difcontinued the prac tice of his predeceffbrs of confulting the fenate upon every occafion In the adminiftration of public affairs he advifed with none but his own private family War peace treaties alliances he of himfelf with fuch advifers as he chofe declared contracted and diffolved without any order ei ther of the people or of the fenate He took par ticular pain s to attach the nation of the Latines to his intereft availing himfelf of foreign aid the more effectually to enfurc his fafety at home and he formed with their chiefs not only connections of hofpitality but affinities to Octavius Mamilius of Tufculum he gave his daughter in marriage Ma milius was of the moft illuftrious family by far of any among the Latines being defcended if we may give credit to fame from Ulyffes and the goddefs Circe By this match he engaged the fup port of his numerous friends and

treaty by which under Tullus the whole Alban nation together with their colonies were fubjeccted to the domi nion of the Romans However for the fake of the general advantage of all parties he rather wifhed that that treaty mould be renewed and that the Latines fhould as partners enjoy the good fortune of the Roman people rather than live always under the apprehenfion or endurance  of the demolition of their cities and the devafta tion of their lands to which they had during the â  reign of Ancus firft and afterwards in that of jf A j hts fajther been continually expofed â He found no difficulty in perfuading the Latines though in that treaty the advantage lay on the fide of the Romans they faw however that the chiefs of the Latine na tion in their behaviour and fentiments concurred with the king and Turnus was a recent inftance of the danger to be apprehended by any one who fhould attempt oppofition The treaty was there fore renewed and orders were given to the young  â ž men of the Latines that they ihould on a certain day according to the treaty attend in a body under arms at the grove of Ferentina And when in obedience to the edict of the Roman king they had affembled there from all the feveral ftates in order that they fhould not have a general of their own nor a feparate command or their own colours he mixed the Romans and Latines together in companies by dividing every company into two parts and then forming two of thefe divifions one of each nation into one company and having by this means doubled the number of the companies he appointed cen turions to command them â LIII INIQJJITOUS as he was in his conduct as king his behaviour at the head of an army was not equally reprehenfible in that capacity indeed he O F R O M Â he would have

hundred years after his death and took Suefla Pometia from them by ftorm from the fale of the plunder of which place having amafied filver and gold to the value of forty talents  he conceived a defign

heJJel apart the money which arole from the fpoils Jrle was foon after engaged in a war which gave him employment longer than he ex pected during which having in vain attempted by ftorm to make himfelf mafter of Gabii a town in his neighbourhood and feeing no reafon to hope for fuccefs from a blockade after he had been repulfed from the walls he at length refolved to purlue the attack not in a method becoming a Roman but by fraud and ftratagem Accordingly whilft he pretend ed to have laid alide all thoughts of proceeding in the war and to have his attention entirely engaged in laying the foundation of the temple and the con ftruction of other works in the city his fon Sextus the youngeft of three purfuant to a plan concerted fled as a defcrter to Gabii making grievous com plaints of his father s intolerable feverity towards him faying that  he now made his own family feel the effects of his pride which hitherto had fallen only on ftrangers and was uneafy at feeing a number even

go from them full of re fcntment to fome other place received him with every mark of kindnefs told him he ought not to be furprifed that his father s behaviour to wards his children now was no better

took every opportunity of recom mending O F R O M E  mending war in refpect of which he affumed to himfelf a fuperiour degree of judgment becaufe he was well acquainted with the refources of both nations and knew how utterly deteftable to his fub jects the king s pride had become which even his own children could not endure Whilft he thus by degrees worked up the minds of the Gabian chiefs to a renewal of the war he ufed to go out himfelf with the boldeft of the youth on expedi tions and plundering parties and as all his words and actions were framed to the purpofe of carrying on the deceit their ill grounded confidence in him increafed to fuch a degree that at length he was chofen commander in chief of the army In this capacity the multitude all the while remaining ig norant of his defign he fought feveral flight engage ments between Rome and Gabii in which the peo ple of the latter generally got the advantage the Gabians from the higheft to the loweft then began to confider

commenced by the Tarquinii that event however did not take place fo loon as was ex pedted But what they entertained no apprehenfion of liberty was very near being loft by fecret machi nations and

Men being liable to fo many miftakes to have no other fecurity but innocence is a hazardous fituation While their minds were in this difcontented ftate ambafiadors arrived from the Tarquinii who with out any mention of their reftoiration demanded only their effects the fenate having granted them an audience continued their deliberations on the fub ject for feveral days being apprehenfive that a re

effects of the princes and all this time they fpent in confutations with the confpirators and had by preffing inftances prevailed upon them to give them letters for the Tarquinii for without thefe how could they be fo fully aflured as an affair of that high importance required that this report of the ambafladors was not groundlefs Thefe let ters given as a pledge of their fincerity proved the means

Scaevola or the left handed from the lofs of his  _j right hand being thus difmified was followed to Y R 146 Rome by ambaffadors from Porfena He had been BiCi iÂ s fo deeply affeded by the danger to which he had been expofed in the firft attempt from which no thing had protedled him but the miftake of the af failant and by the confideration that he was to un dergo the fame hazard as many times as the number of the other confpirators amounted to that he thought proper of his own accord to offer terms of accom modation to the Romans During the negotiation mention was made to no purpofe of the reftoration of the Tarquinian family to the throne  and this propofal he made rather becaufe he had not been â able to refufe it to the Tarquinii than from enter taining the flighteft expectation of its being accepted by the Romans He carried the point refpecting the giving up of the lands taken from the Veientians and compelled the Romans to fubmit to give hoft ages if they wifhed to fee his forces withdrawn from the Janiculum Peace being concluded on thefe terms Porfena withdrew his troops from the Jani culum and retired out of the Roman territories To Caius Mucius as a reward of his valour the fe nate gave a tradT of ground on the other fide of the Tiber which was afterwards called the Mucian meadows and fuch honour being paid to courage excited even the other fexto merit public diftinctions A young lady called Clcelia one of the hoftages the camp of the Etrurians happening to be pitched at a fmall diftance from the banks of the Tiber evaded the vigilance of the guards and at the head of a band of young ladies fwam acrofs the Tiber through a mower of darts difcharged at them by the enemy and reftored them all in fafety to their friends at Rome When the king was informed of this be ing at firft highly incenfed he fent envoys to Rome  to infift on the reftoration of the hoftage Clcelia as VOL i K to THE HISTORY B o o K to the refl l e fhewed little concern But his paflion

he would confider the treaty as broken off fo iffhe fhould be furren dered he would fend her back to her friends in fafe ty Both parties behaved with honour the Ro mans on their fide returned the pledge of peace agreeably to the treaty and with the Etrurian king merit found not fecurity only but honours After beftowing high compliments on the lady he told her that he made her a prefent of half of the hof tages with full liberty to choofe fuch as fhe liked When they were all drawn out before her fhe is faid to have chofen the very young boys which was not only confonant to maiden delicacy but in the uni verfal opinion of the hoftages themfelves highly rea fonable that thofe who were of fuch an age as was moft liable to injury fhould in preference be deli vered out of the hands of enemies Peace being thus re eftablifhed the Romans rewarded this in ftance of intrepidity fo uncommon in the female fex with a mark of honour as uncommon and an equef trian ftatue erected at the h ad of the facred ftreet where the lady was reprefented fitting on an horfe XIV VERY inconfiftent with this peaceful man ner in which the Etrurian king retired from the city is the practice handed down

the Romans had been deprived by the treaty at the Janiculum Tar quinius finding all hopes of his reftoration cut off retired for refuge to Tufculum to his father in law Mamilius Octavius Thus peace

reducing the pow er of the enemy by wafting their lands and after wards in battle to fuch a degree that there was no room to apprehend a renewal of hoftilities in that quarter for a long time to come returned in tri Y R 151 umph to Rome In the enfuing year when Agrippa ipl Menenius and Publius Poflumius were confuls died Publius Valerius a man univerfally allowed to have excelled all others in

people a very numerous army with which they boldly attempted to oppofe the confuls who were entering their borders was entirely routed and the Auruncians compelled to make their laft Hand at Pometia

having through wantonnefs ufed violence to fome courtezans at Rpme during the ce lebration of the public games and a mob affembling a fcuffle enfued which might almoft be called a bat tle and from this trifling caufe matters feemed to have taken a tendency towards a renewal of hof tilities Befides the apprehenfion of a war with the Sabines there was another affair which created much uneafineft

Lartius and that Spurius Caffius was appointed mafter of the horfe They chofe men of confglar dignity as ordered by the law enacted concerning the creating of a dictator For this reafon I am the more induced to believe that Lartius who was of confular dignity rather than Manius Valerius fon of Marcus and grandfon of Volefus who had not yet been conful was placed over the confuls as their director and mafter as even if it had been thought proper that the dictator fhould be chofen out of that particular family they would much rather have elected the father Marcus Valerius a man of approved merit and of confular dignity On this firft creation of a dictator at Rome the populace feeing the axes carried before him were ftruck with fuch terror as made them more attentive to obedience of orders for they could not now as under confuls who were equal in authority hope for protection from one of them againft the other neither was there any appeal nor any other means whatever of impunity but prompt obedience Even the Sabines were alarmed at the appointment of a dictator by the Romans the more fo becaufe they fuppofed that it was to act againft fhem that he had been appointed they therefore fene ambafladors to treat of an accommodation who requefting of the dictator and fcnate that they would pardon the mifconduct of thoughtlefs young men were anfwered that pardon might be granted to young

would be both the fafer and the cafier method to bend than to break them To add to thefe perplexities they were threatened with greater danger from another quarter XXIV SOME Latine horfemen arrived in the ut rnoft hafte with the alarming intelligence that the Volfcians with an army in hoftile array were com ing to attack the city which news fo entirely op pofite were the views of the different parties into which the ftate was fplit by difcord affected the patricians and the commons in a very different man ner the commons exulted with joy faid the gods were coming to take vengeance for the

patricians ferve as foldiers let the patricians take arms that tho fe who reap the advantages of war may alfo un â dergo the dangers of it On the other hand the fenate dejected and confounded on finding them fclves thus encompaflcd by dangers from their country 0 F R O M E  â tountrymen on one fide and from the enemy onB O the other bcfought the conful Servilius whofe tem  T per was adapted to conciliate the regard of the peo Y R ple that he would find means to extricate the com BiÂ monwealth from the dreadful apprehenfions with which it was befet whereupon the conful difmiff ing the fenate went forth to the afiembly of the peo ple there he aflured them that the fenators were folicitous that care mould be taken of the intereft of the commons but that their  fears for the fafety of the commonwealth in general had interrupted their deliberations concerning that part of the ftate which though it muft be allowed to be the largeft was ftill but a part nor could they while the enemy was juft at the gates allow any bufi nefs to take place of the neceflary provifions for the war nor even if they were allowed a little refpite would it be either for the honour of the commons to have refufed to take arms in defence of their country unlefs on condition of firft re ceiving hire for it nor could it fail of injuring the reputation of the fenators themfelves if they mould appear to have now applied their attention to the good of their countrymen through fear rather than afterwards through inclination He gave proof of his fincerity in this difcourfe by an edicct whereby he ordained that  no perfon mould hold any Roman citizen in bonds or confinement fo as to prevent his giving in his name to the confuls that no perfon mould take pofieflion or make fale of the goods of a foldier while upon fervice nor detain in cuftody either his children or grandchildren On the publication of this edict fuch debtors under arreft as were prefent in ftantly gave in their names and crowds of others in every part of the city rufliing out of their con finement when the creditors had no longer a right to detain them ran together to the Forum to take the military oath thele compofed a Jarge body of t a troops 148 THE fc lSTORY BOOK troops and none during the Volfcian war difplayed  J l  a greater fhare of bravery and activity The conful y R 159 led out his army againft the enemy and pitched his B C 493 camp at a fmall diftance from theirs XXV THE following night the Volfcians ex â â jfccting great advantages from the difientions of the Romans approached their camp in hopes that during the night fome might defert or betray their pofts They were perceived by the centinels the troops were called up and the fignal being given they ran to arms and by thefe means fruftrated the attempt of the Volfcians the remainder of the night was dedicated to repofe by both parties Next day at the firft dawn the Volfcians having filled up the trenches aflaulted the rampart and were proceed ing to demolim the fortifications on every fide when the conful having delayed for fome time in order to try the temper of his men though called on from all fides and particularly by the debtors to give the fignal at length on finding their ardour fo great gave the fignal for fallying and fent forth his troops eager for the fight at the firft onfet the enemy were immediately routed and their rear ha raffed in their retreat as far as the infantry were able to purfue and the cavalry not fufiering them to recover from their confirmation drove them all the Way to their camp in a little time the camp itfelf was furrounded by the legions and the Volfcians not having courage enough left to make a fland there ic was taken and plundered Next day the legions were led to Suefla Pometia whither the enemy had retreated and in a few days the town was taken and given up to the troops to be plun dered by thefe means the needy foldiers were in forrft meafure relieved The conful having ac quired great glory led back his victorious army to Rome As he was preparing for his departure ambafiadors came to him from the Volfcians of 6 Ecetra O F R O M E  149 Ecetra who after the

the Sabines alfo caufed an alarm at Rome but it was in facct a tu mult rather than a war An account was brought â by night to the city that a Sabine army were plun dering the country and had advanced as far as the river Anio and that they were ravaging and burn ing all the farms in that neighbourhood Aulus Poftumius who had been dictator in the Latine â war was inftantly difpatched thither with all the ca valry and the conful Servilius followed with a cho fen body of foot the greater part of the ftragglers were cut off by the cavalry nor was the main body of the Sabines capable of refifting the infantry on their approach fatigued both by their march and by collecting booty in the night a great number of them in the country houfes overcharged with meat and wine had fcarcely ftrength fufficient to enable them to fly Thus was this Sabine war finifhed within the fame night in which the firft account of it had been â received The next day while fan guine hopes were entertained that peace with all their neighbours was now fecurely eftablifhed am bafladors came to the lenate from the Auruncians denouncing war unlefs the troops were withdrawn from the territories of the Volfcians the army of the Auruncians had fet out from home at the fame time with the ambafladors and intelligence arriv ing that it had been feen not far from Aricia it excited fuch an alarm among the Romans that nei ther could the fenate be confulted in a regular man ner nor could they while bufy themfdves in taking up arms give a peaceable anfwer to thofe who were advancing in arms againft them The troops marched againft the enemy to Aricia and not far i 3 from 50 THEHISTORY BOOK from thence came to a general engagement which  __ __ without farther conteft put an end to the war Y R 1J9 B C 49J XXVII WHEN the Auruncians were defeated the Romans having vanquifhed fo many different enemies within the fpace of a few days expected the fulfilment of the promifes made them by the confuls and confirmed by the engagements of the fenate j but Appius inftigated both by his own na tural haughtinefs and a defire to undermine the cre dit of his colleague ifiued his decrees on fuits between debtor and creditor with the utmoft pofilble feveri ty j in confequence of which both thofe who had  formerly been in confinement were delivered up to their creditors and others alfo were taken into cuf tody When this happened to be the cafe of any of the foldiers he appealed to the other confulj a crowd gathered about Servilius reminded him of his promifes upbraided him with their fervices in war and the fears which they had received infifted that he fhould lay the affair before the fenate and that as conful he mould fupport his countrymen as ge neral his foldiers The conful was affected by thefe remonftrances but circumftances obliged him to decline interfering not only his colleague but the â whole faction of the nobles having gone fo violently into oppofite meafures by thus acting a middle part he neither avoided the hatred of the commons nor procured the efteem of the patricians The latter confidering him as deftitute of the firmnefs becoming his office and as too fond of popular ap plaufe while the former looked upon him as a de ceiver and it fhortly appeared that he was become no lefs odious than Appius A conteft happened between the confuls tyhich of them fhould dedicate the temple of Mercury the fenate refufed to decide the matter and referred it to the people pafling a vote that to whichever of them the dedication fhould be granted by the people the me fhould prefide over O F R O M E over the markets fhould inftirute a college of mer BOOK chants and join the pontiff in the performance of w _r the ceremonies ufual on fuch occafions The people Y R 159 gave the honour of the dedication to Marcus Laeto â c rius a centurion of the firft rank fhewing plainly that they acted thus not merely out of refpedr to the perfon on whom they conferred an office of higher dignity than became his ftation but with de fign to affront the coniuls This threw the patrici ans and one of the conluls particularly into a rage but the commons had now affumed a greater degree of courage and began to prolecute theirmeafuresin a very different method from that in which they had fet out having given up all hopes of protection from the confuls and the fenate whenever they faw a debtor led to the court they flew together from all quarters fo that neither could the fentence of the conful be heard amidft their noife and clamours nor when it was pronounced did any one obey it all was managed by force and the whole dread and danger with refpefr to their freedom was transferred from the debtors to the creditors who ftanding fmgle were abufed by the multitude under the very eye of the conful To add to the perplexity of the fenate the alarm was fpread of an attack being in tended by the Sabines and orders being iffued for levying troops not a man gave in his name mean while Appius in a rage inveighed bitterly againft the criminal lenity of his colleague that by his popular filence he was betraying the commonwealth and that befides refufing to enforce the laws with refpecl to creditors he neglected alfo to execute the decree of the fenate for levying troops He declared that the intereft of the commonwealth was not yet en tirely deferted nor the confular office yet ftripped of its authority that he himfelf would ftand forth fingly and vindicate his own dignity and that of the fenate Though furrounded by the multi tude which aflembled daily and were of a temper  4 tOO THE HISTORY BOOK too violent to be controlled he ordered one of the y _ 1 _ principal ringleaders of the mob to be apprehended Y R I59 when the lictors laid hold of him he appealed but J C 493 the conliils would not have allowed the appeal there being no doubt what the fentence of the people â would be had not his obftinacy been with difficulty overcome by the advice and influence of the nobili ty father than by the clamours of the people fo firmly did he withftand the indignation of the multi tude From this time the evil daily gained ground Shewing itfelf not only in open expreflions of difcon tent but what was much more pernicious in fecret meetings and private cabals At length thele con ftils fo odious to the people went out of office Appius in high favour with the patricians Servilius with neither party V R i6o XXVIII NEXT entered on the confulfhip Aulus 3 C 49I virginins and Titus Vetufius The people now not being able to judge what fort of coniuls they â were to have took care to form nightly meetings forne on the Elquiline others on the Aventine mount in order that their proceedings might not be confufed by their being obliged to adopt mea fures haftily in the Forum and to act on every oc cafion at random and without a plan The confuls confidering this as a very dangerous proceeding â which it really was propofed it to the confideration of the fenate but were not allowed after propofing it to take the votes regularly fuch a tumult arofe on the mention of it among the fenators who ex â claimed and exprefied the higheft indignation at the confuls attempting to throw on the fenate the odium â of an affair which ought to have been quelled by the â confular authority They told them that if there â really had been magiftrates in the commonwealth

the fenate the confuls mounted the tribunal and cited the younger citizens by their name No man anfwering to his name the multitude which ftood round like a general afiembly declared that  the commons could be no longer deceived that not a fingle foldier mould be raifed until the pub c lie engagements were fulfilled That every man  muft have his liberty reftored before arms were put into his hands that the people might be con vinced they were to fight for their country and fellow citizens not for their mafters The con fuls faw clearly enough what the fenate expected from them but of thofe who fpoke with the greateft vehemence within the walls of the fenate houfe not one was prefent to mare the odium of the proceed ing and every thing threatened a defperate conteft with the commons they refolved therefore before they fhould proceed to extremities to confult the fenate again the confequence of which was that all the younger fenators rufhed up haftily to the feats of the confuls defiring them to abdicate the conful Jhip and lay down a command which they wanted fpirit to fupport XXIX HAVING made fufficient trial of the dif pofitions of both fides the confuls at length fpoke

attended the confuls ex claiming againft the infolence of fuch behaviour flew down from the tribunal to affift the lictor the populace then quitting the lictor to whom they had offered no other violence than that of hindering him from making the feifure directed their force againft the fenators but the confuls interpofing quickly put an end to the fcuffle in which as nei ther ftones nor

inquiry into the affair the moft violent of them endeavouring to carry their point by clamour and noife rather than by vote at length when their rage had fomewhat fubfided the confuls reproaching them with being equally difor derly in the fenate houfe as in the Forum began to colled the votes in order There were three differ ent opinions Publius Virginius thought that  the cafe did not extend to the whole body of the com mons and that thofe only were to be confidered who relying on the promifes of the conful Publi us Servilius had feryed in the Volfcian Auruncian c and O F R O M E 155 and Sabine wars Titus Largius was of opinion BOOK that  the prefent juncture required fomething more  _ __ than the making a return for fervices performed j Y R Z6o that the whole body of the commons were over B c whelmed with debt nor could the progrefs of the evil be ftopped unlefs the advantages of the whole were attended to On the contrary if diftinctions were made this would add fuel to the difienfions inftead ofextinguifhingthem Appius Claudius whofe temper naturally harm was roufed to a de gree of ferocity by his hatred to the commons on the one hand and the applaufe of the patricians on the other affirmed that all thefe difturbances were excited not by the people s fufferings but their licentioufnefs and that the commons were actuated by a fpirit of wantonnefs rather than by refentment of injuries this was the confequence of giving them a right to appeal for all that a conful could do was to threaten he could not command when people are allowed to appeal to thofe who have been accomplices in their tranf greflions Come faid he let us create a dicta tor from whom there is no appeal this madnefs which has fet the whole ftate in a flame will quickly fink into filence Let me then fee who will ftrike a lidtor when he knows that the very perfon whofe dignity he infults has the fole and  entire difpofal of his perlbn and of his life XXX To many the expedient recommended by Appius appeared too rough and violent and juft ly fo j on the other hand the propofitions of Vir ginius and Largius were confidered as tending to eftablifh a bad precedent particularly that of Lar gius which was utterly fubverfive of all credit The advice of Virginius was deemed to be the fartheft from excefs on either fide and a juft medi um between the other two But through the fpirit of faction and men s regard to their private inte refts 56 THE HISTORY BOOK refts things which ever did and ever will impede L  the public councils Appius prevailed and was him Y R 16o felf very near being created diflator which pro B c 49i ceeding beyond any other would have highly dif gufted the commons at a very critical juncture when the Voifcians the JEquans and the Sabines happened to be all in arms at the fame time But the confuls and the elder part of the fenate took care that a command in itfdf uncontrolable fhould be intrufted to a perfon of a mild difpofhicn and ac cordingly they chofe for dictator Manius Valerius ion of Volefus Although the commons faw that the dictator was created in oppofition to them yet as by his brother s law they enjoyed the privilege of appeal they dreaded nothing harih or overbearing from that family Their hopes were farther encou raged by an edict which the dictator publifhed of the iame tenor in general with the edict of the conful Servilius but as they thought that they had now fe curer grounds of confidence both in the man himfelf and in the power with which he was invefted they â defifted from the conteft and gave in their names Ten legions were completed a force greater than had ever been raifed before ofthefe three were affigned to each of the confuls the other four were commanded by the dictator War could now be up longer deferred the JEquans had invaded the territories of the Latines and thefe by their ambaf fadors petitioned the fenate that they would either fend troops to protect them or permit them to take arms themfelves to defend their frontiers it was judged the lafer method to defend the Latines with out their own afliftance than to allow them to handle arms again the conful Vetrifius was fent thither and he put an end to the depredations The quans retired from the plains and provided for their fafety on the tops of the mountains relying more on the iituation than on their arms The other conful who

considerably the advantage in point of numbers they therefore advanced to the fight in a carelefs manner as if they defpifed their enemy the Roman conful did not fuffer his troops to move nor to return the fhout but ordered them to ftand ftill with their javelins fixed in the ground and as foon as the enemy fhould come within reach then to exert at once their utmoft efforts and decide the

not fufficiently ftrengthened by a proper depth of files before they could recover from this confufion the infantry fell upon them and continued their attack without intermiJTion until they made themfelves mafters of their camp and put a conclufion to the war Since the battle at the lake Regillus there had not been obtained in thofe times a more glorious victory than this the dictator entered the city in triumph and befides the accuftomed honours there â was a place in the circus affigned to him and his pofterity for a feat and a curule chair fixed in it From the vanquifhed Volfcians the

from the oath but be ing afterwards informed that no religious obligation could be diffolved by an adt of wickednefs by the advice of a perfon called Sicinus they retired with out waiting for orders from the confuls to the facred mount beyond the river Anio about three miles from the city This account is more generally cre dited than that given by Pifo who fays the feÂ ceflion was made to the

the patricians Marcius Coriolanus particularly an avowed enemy of the power of the tribunes faid If they wifh to have provifions at the ufual price let them reftore to the patricians their former

Fabius the mod ancient writer by far I find that he lived even to old age he mentions poutively that when he be came far advanced in years he ufed frequently to utter this remark that  the evils of exile bore much heavier on the aged The men of Rome were not fparing in beftowing on the women the ho nours which they had merited fo diftant were the manners of that age from the practice of detracting from the merits of others they even erected and dedicated a temple to Female Fortune as a lafting monument of their meritorious conduct The Vol fcians afterwards in conjunction with the Equans made another inroad into the Roman territories but the Equans foon became diflatisfied at being com manded by Attius Tullus and in confequence of the difpute whether the Volfcians or the Equans

though poffcfied by private perfons many of the C 484 patricians who were themfelves in pofieflion of the land were hereby alarmed for the fafety of their property and befides that body in general was feized with anxiety for the fafety of the public ob ferving that the conful by thefe donatives was forming an influence dangerous to liberty This was the firft propofal of the agrarian law which from that time to the prefent age has never been agitated without the moft violent commotions in the flate The other conful oppofed the donations and in this he was liipported by the patricians nor did all the commons join the oppofite party at firft they began to defpife a gift which was not confined to themfelves but extended to the allies in common with the citizens then they were ac cuftomed to hear the conful Virginius in the aflem blies frequently as it were prophefying that  the donatives of his colleagues were full of infectious poifon that thofe lands would bring flavery on luch as mould receive them that he was paving the way to arbitrary power for why mould the allies and the Latine nation be thus included What was the intent of reftoring a third part of the lands taken in war to the Hernicians who fb lately were enemies only that thefe nations might let Caffius at their head as a leader inftead of Coriolanus Whoever argued and protefted againft the agrarian law was now fure of popularity and1 from that time both the confuls vied with each other in humouring the commons Virginius de clared that he would allow the lands to be affigned provided they were not afligned to any

fufpicions of his ambition that they fpurned at all his prefents as if they were in a ftate of affluence and no fooner did he go out of office than he was condemned and executedt as we are informed by undoubted authority Some fay that it was his father who inflicted this punifhment on him that having at home held an inquiry into his conduct he fcourged him and put him to death and confecrated the allowance fettled on his fon to Ceres that out of this a ftatue was erected with this infcription  Given from the Caffian family I find in ibme writers and it is the more credible ac count that he was profecuted for treafon by the quaeftors Caeio Fabius and Lucius Valerius j that he was condemned on a trial before the people and his houie razed by a public decree it ftodd on the fpot which is now the area before the temple of Tellus However whether the trial was private or public he was condemned in the confulate of Ser g â Â â 1 â vius Cornelius and Quintus Fabius XLIL THE anger which the

itfelf might perhaps fbften their refentment and bring them back to a right way of thinking This encouraged their enemies the Veientians and Etrurians to act with greater precipitation at firft they endeavoured to provoke the foe to fight by riding up to the camp and offering challenges and at length finding that this had no effect by reviling both the confuls themfelves and the army telling them that the pretence of difienfions amorig themfelves was an artifice contrived to cover t their cowardice that the confuls were more dif fident of the courage of their troops than of their difpofuion to

when they underftood that the legions were withdrawn they made incurfions into the Country fhifting alternately from war to quiet and from quiet to war For this reafon that bufinefs could neither be

there was any other part in the ftate but the c commons alone let him place before his eyes the banifhment of Caius Marcius and the condemna c tion and death of Menenius By fuch difcourfes the patricians were fired with indignation and from that time they no longer held their confultations publicly but in private and fuffered but few to be privy to them and here however they might differ in other points in this they were unanimous that the accufed fhould be refcued from danger by any means poffible whether right or wrong and the tnoti violent method propofrd was the moft accept able Nor were they at a lofs for an actor to per petrate any the moft atrocious deed on the day of trial therefore when the people ftanding in the Forum in eager expectation firft began to wonder that the tribune did not come down then begin ning from his delay to fufpect fomething amifs they fuppofed that he had b een terrified from attend ing OF ROME ing by the nobles and complained that the caufe of

had fpread through the afiembly they every one feparated different ways juft as an army difperfes on the fall of its leader The tribunes particularly were feized with the greateft terror warned by the death of their colleague how very little fecurity the devoting laws afforded them The patricians on the other fide exulted with too little moderation and fo far were they from feeling any compunction for the crime that even thofe who were clear of the guilt wifhed to be confidered as the perpetrators of the deed  and they declared openly that the tribunitian power muft be fubdued by feverity LV SOON after this victory had been obtained by means which furnifhed a precedent of the worft tendency a proclamation was ifiued for a levy of fol diers and the tribunes being awed into fubmiflion the confuls accomplifhed the bufinefs without any in terruption The commons on this were highly en raged more on account of the acquiefcence of the tribunes than of the execution of the orders of the confuls they declared that  there was an end of their liberty that they were reduced again to their old condition for the tribunitian power had expired with and was buried in the grave of Genucius Other means muft be devifed and pracctifed to put a ftop to the tyranny of the pa  tricians There remained now only one method to be purfued which was that the commons fince they were deftitute of every other protection fliould undertake their own defence The retinue  of the confuls confifted of twenty four lictors and  even thefe were plebeians no force could be f more contemptible or lefs

they thus M C 47i fpurred on each other with fuch difcourfes as thefe it happened that a lidlor was fent by the con ful to a plebeian of the name of Volero Publilrus who had infifted that having been a centurion he could not be compelled to enlift as a common fol dier Volero appealed to the tribunes but none of them fupporting him the confuls ordered the man ta be ftripped and the rods to be got

your faction The more vehemently he ex claimed the more violently did the lictor proceed in tearing off his clothes and ftripping him Then Volero who was a man of great bodily ftrength and aided alfo by thofe who took part with him drove away the lictor and retired into the thickeft part of the crowd where he heard the loudeft ex preflions of indignation at the treatment which he received at the fame time crying aloud I appeal and implore the protection of the commons Support me citizens fupport me fellow ibldiers  You have nothing to expect from the tribunes who themfelves ftand in need of

either to public or private rights The confuis having un dertaken to face this violent ftorm quickly experi enced that dignity unfupported by ttrength is not exempt from danger Their lictors were

many harm methods of proceeding were propofed the opinion of the elder members prevailed j who recommended to the fenate not to let their con duet be as ftrongly marked by paflionate refent ment as that of the commons was by inconfiderate violence LVI THE commons intereftingthemfelves warm ly in favour of Volero chofe him at the next elec tion tribune for the year the confuls being Lucius Y R

preceding year poftponing his own refentment to the public intereft without uttering even a word to offend the confuls he propofed a law to the people that ple beian magiftrates mould be elected in affemblies where the votes were given by tribes This though covered under an appearance which at firft view mewed no evil tendency was confidered as a matter of no trivial confequence as it would entirely de prive the patricians of the power of electing fuch tribunes as they liked by means of the votes of their dependents To prevent this propofition which was highly pleafing to the commons from pafling into a law the patricians ftrained every nerve and though neither the influence of the confuls nor of the principal patricians could prevail on any one of the college of tribunes to proteft againft it that being the only power that could effectually ftifle itj yet as it was in itfelf an affair of great weight and required long and laborious exertions the obfta cles thrown in its way were fufficient to delay it until the following year The commons re eledted Vo lero THÂ HISTORY BOOK lero to the tribunefhip and the patricians judging J l  that tliis bufinefs would not end

he joined in it later fo was he the more eager in promoting it his renown in war infpired him with confidence for there was no one of that age poffefied of more pcrfonal prow efs Volero contented himfelf with arguing in fa vour of the law and avoided all abufe againft the confuls but Laetorius began with fevere invectives againft Appius and his family charging them with having always fhewn a difpofition in the higheft de gree overbearing and cruel towards the commons afierting that the patricians had elected him not for a conful but an executioner to torment and torture the plebeians being however a rough foldier un fkilled in the art of ipeaking he was at a lofs for expreffions fuited to the unreftrained freedom and boldnels of his thoughts and finding himlelf unable to proceed in his difcourfe he faid  Citizens fincc I cannot fpeak with the fame readinefs with which I can perform what I have fpoken I requeft your c attendance to morrow Fither I will lofe my life here in your prefence or I will carrv the law Next day the tribunes took pofieflion of the tem ple and the confuls and nobles placed themfelves among the crowd in order to oppofe the law  Lae torius ordered all perfons to retire except thofe who â were to vote but the younger nobility kept their places and paid no regard to the officer on which Laetorius ordered fomÂ of them to be taken into cuftody The conful Appius infifted that  a tri  bune had no authority over any but the plebei c ansj O P R 0 M E aoj c an for he was not a magiftrate of the people at B O O K large but of the commons that even he himfelf  _  could not conformably to ancient ufage of his Y R 18 own authority compel people to withdraw the B c 91 words in ufe being If ye think proper Romans retire It was eafy for him to difconcert Laeto rius in arguing even thus contemptuoufly about his authority the tribune therefore inflamed with an ger lent one of his officers to the conful and the conful fent a lictor to the tribune calling out that he was but a private perfon without command and with out magiftracy nor would the tribune have efcaped ill treatment had not the whole afiembly joined with great warmth in

force if they could not do it other wife now foothed the enraged plebeians with intreaties then begged of the tribunes to difmifs the afiembly to give time for their anger to cool telling them that  delay would not diminifh aught of their power but would afford them the advan tage of uniting prudence with that power j that the patricians would ftill be under the direction of the people and the conful under that of the patricians LVII WITH great difficulty the commons were pacified by Quintius and with much greater was the other conlul quieted by the patricians and the afiembly of the people being at length difmified the confuls convened the fenate There fear and an ger prevailing by turns produced for fome time a variety of opinions but having gained time for re s 3  flection Sofi THE

between the feveral parts of the ftate j for whilft the tribune and confuls violently drew all power each to their own fide there was none left in the other members of the community The objecl of the difpute was not the fafety of the commonwealth but who mould have the difpofal of it mangled and torn as it was On the other hand Appius appealed to gods and men that  the ftate was betrayed and deferted through coward ice that the conful was not wanting to fupport the fenate but the fenate to fupport the conful and that they were fubmitting to more grievous laws than thofe which were impofed at the facred mount Yielding however to the unanimous judgment of the fenate he defifted and the law was carried through without farther oppofition LVIII THEN for the firft time were the tri bunes elected in an afiembly of the people voting by tribes Pifo relates alfo that there were three added to their number having before been but two He even names the tribunes Caius Sicinius Lu cius Numitorius Marcus Duilius Spurius Icilius Lucius Mecilius During the diflenfion at Rome war commenced with the iquans and Volfcians who had committed depredations on the Roman lands with defign that

Claudius was fent againft the Volfcians die JEquaiis fell to Quintius as OF ROME lof as his province The fame harfh fe verity which BOOK Appius had fhewn at home he practifed at the head f of the army

ther he confidered himfelfas vanquifhed by theinj and that when he had been fet up as the only perfon who in the character of conful was qualified to oppofe the tribunitian power that law had been car ried which the former confuls had been able to pre vent though they made not fuch ftrenuous exer tions nor did the patricians expect fo much from them The anger and indignation hereby excited inftigated his refentful temper to wreak on the army every kind of feverity which the command put irt his power but no degree of violence was able to fubdue the temper of the troops fuch an uncon querable fpirit of oppofition had they imbibed In tvery part of their bufinefs they hewed indolence and carelefsnefs negligence and ftubbornnefs nei ther fhame nor fear had any effect on them if he

affected with difagreeable emotions Af ter trying every kind of harfh treatment without ef fect he renounced all intercourfe with the foldiers declaring that the army was corrupted by the cen turions whom in a gibing manner he fometimes called plebeian tribunes and Volcroes LIX NOT one of theie circumftances was m known to the Volfciana who fur that rcafbn preffed  forward io8 TfcE HISTORY BOOK forward their operations more vigoroufly in hopes  n  that the Roman army would be animated with the Y R 1 3 fame fpirit of oppofition againft Appius which they B C 469 had formerly displayed againft Fabius when con ful and in fact in Appius s cafe it mewed itfelf with a much greater degree of inveteracy than in that of Fabius for they were not only unwilling to conquer like Fabius s troops but even chofe to be conquered When led out to the field they fled fhamefully to their camp nor made a halt until they faw the Volfcians advancing to the rampart and committing great flaughter on the rear of the army The neceffity of repelling the victorious enemy from the rampart then prevailed on them to fight which however they did in fuch a manner as made it evident that they acted only becaufe Roman fol diers would not luffer their camp to be taken in other refpects they rejoiced at their own lofies and difgrace All this had fo little effect towards foften ing the ftubborn fiercenefs of Appius that he re folved to exhibit farther examples of feverity but when he had fummoned an afiembly for the purpofe the lieutenant generals and tribunes gathered haftily about him and cautioned him  not to hazard a trial of the extent of an authority whofe whole efficacy depended on the will of thofe who were to obey it informed him that the foldiers in ge neral declared that they would not attend the af fembly and that in every quarter they were heard loudly demanding that the camp mould be removed out of the Volician territories j they re minded him that the victorious army had juft now approached almoft dole to the gates and to the rampart and that if he perfifted there was not only reafon to apprehend but every certain indication before their eyes of a moft grievous calamity enfuing At length yielding to per fuafion as nothing but a delay of punifhment could be the confequence he prorogued the ail embly gave OF ROME  gave orders that the troops mould be in readinefs to B O Â K march next day and at the firft dawn gave by  found of trumpet the fignal for fetting out When Y R the troops had fcarcely got clear of the camp and while they were juft forming in order of march the Volfcians as if they had been fummoned by the fame fignal made an attack on their rear and the alarm fpreading from thence to the van caufed fuch confternation as threw both the battalions and ranks into confufion fo that neither could orders be heard nor a line formed no one now thought of any thing but flight and in fuch precipitation did they make their way through fcattered bodies and arms that the enemy ceafed to purfue fooner than the Romans to fly In vain did the conful follow his men calling on them to halt but when he had at length collected them together after their hafty dif perfion he encamped in a peaceful part of the coun try and there having fummoned an afiembly after uttering fevere and juft reproaches againft the army as betrayers of military difcipline and deferters from their ftandards afking each where were their ftand ards where were their arms he beat with rods and beheaded the foldiers who had thrown away their arms the ftandard bearers who had loft their ftandards and alfo fuch of the centurions and of the privates entitled to double allowance as had quitted their ranks of the reft of the multitude every tenth man was drawn by lot and punifhed LX IN a very different manner were matters conduced in the country of the Jiquans There feemed a mutual conteft carried on between the conful and his troops who mould exceed the other In civility and good offices Quintius was naturally of a milder difpofition and befides the ill confe quenccs attending the harfh feverity of his colleague made him feel the greater fatisfaction in

every part of the country and in no former war B C 69 was a greater abundance of booty carried off from thence all which was diftributed among the foldiers Their behaviour was alfo rewarded with praifes in which the minds of foldiers find as much delight as in gain The troops returned from thence in better temper towards their general and on the general s account towards the patricians alfo declaring that the fenate had given to them a parent to the other army a mafter This year during which they ex perienced a variety of fortune in their military ope rations and furious difienfions both at home and abroad was particularly diftinguimed by the affem blies of the people voting by tribes a matter which derived its feeming importance rather from the ho nour of the victory obtained by one party over the other than from any real advantage accruing from it For the mare of power which was either gained by the commons or taken from the patricians was trifling in proportion to the great degree of dignity of which the afiemblies themfelves were deprived by the exclufion of the patricians y R 184 LXI THE following year the confnlate of Lu B c 468 ciu3 Valerius and Tiberius F milius was difturbed by more violent commotions both in confequence of the ftruggles between the different orders of the ftate concerning the agrarian law and alfo of the trial of Appius Claudius who having taken a moft active part in oppofition to the law and fupportcd the caufe of thole who were in pofiefiion of the pub lic lands as if he were a third conful and thought it his duty had a criminal

Y R feeing this champion of the fenate the afiertor ofB c its dignity their bulwark againft all the outrageous attempts both of tribunes and commons expofed to the rage of the populace only for having in the conteft exceeded in fome degree the bounds of mo deration Appius Claudius himfelf was the only one among the patricians who looked with fcorn on the tribunes and commons and even on his own trial Neither the threats of the commons nor the intreaties of the fenate could ever prevail on him either to change his garb  or ufe a fuppliant ad drefs or even to foften and relax in any degree the ufual harfhnefs of his language when he was to plead his caufe before the people He ftill pre ierved the fame expreffion of countenance the fame ftubborn fiercenefs in his looks and the lame ve hemence in his difcourfe fo that a great many of the commons felt no lefs dread of Appius while he ftood a culprit at their bar than they had done when he was conful He pleaded once in his de fence and that with all the haughtinefs which he could fhew if he were the accufer juft as liÂ ufed to behave on every other occafton j and by his in trepidity fo aftonifhed the tribunes and commons that of their own choice they adjourned the trial to another day and afterwards fuffered the bufinefs to cool The day of adjournment was not very dif tant yet before it arrived he was fcized with a diforder and died The tribunes endeavoured to prevent his being honoured with a funeral panegy ric but the commons would not allow that che laft day of fo great a man mould be defrauded of the ufual honours

marched with an army againft the iquans and finding it impracticable to entice them to an engage ment made an afiault on their camp A defperatc ftorm of thunder and hail falling obliged him to de fift and people s furprize was increaied when as toon as the fignal for retreat had been given the weather became again perfectly calm and clear fo that they were deterred by a religious fcruple from again attacking a camp which had been defended by an evident interpofition of fome divinity and vented all their fury in devaluations on the enemy s lands The other conful Emilius conducted the war in the country of the Sabines and there alfo the enemy keeping within their walls the lands were laid wafte at length by the burning not only of the country houfes but of the villages which in that populous country were very numerous the Sabines were pro voked to give battle to the troops employed in the depredations and being obliged to retreat without having gained any advantage removed their camp next day to a place of greater fafety This ap peared to the conful a fufficient reafon to confider the enemy as vanquifhed and to ceafe any farther operations he accordingly withdrew his troops without having made any progrefs in the war V R 185 LXIII WHILE thefe wars ftill raged abroad and 4 7 party divifions at home Titus Numicius Prifcus and Aulus Virginlus were elected confuls There was every reafon to believe that the commons would not endure any farther delay with refpect to the agra rian law and every degree of violence was ready to break out when it was difcovered by the fmoke from O ROME 213 from the burning of the country houfes and by the B O O K inhabitants flying to the city that the Volfcians were   at hand this incident reprefied the fedition when Y R juft ripe and on the point of breaking forth The B confuls were inftantly obliged by the fenate to lead out the youth from the city againft the enemy j and this made the reft of the commons lefs turbulent On the other fide the enemy without performing any thing farther than alarming the Romans with needleis apprehenfions retired with great precipita tion Numicius marched to Antium againft the Volfcians Virginius againft the vEquans Here the army falling into an ambufcade and being in the utmoft danger of a total overthrow was refcued by the bravery of the foldiers from the imminent peril to which the carelefihefs of the conful hadex pofed them The operations againft the Volfcians were better conducted in the firft engagement the enemy were routed and compelled to fly into i tium which confidering thofe times was a city of great ftrength the conful therefore not choofing to venture to attack it took from the Antians another town called Ceno which was not near fo ftrong Whilft the fltquans and Volfcians gave employment to the Roman armies the Sabines carried depreda tion to the very gates of the city however they themfelves in a few days after fuffered from the two Roman armies greater lofies than any which they had occafioned both the confuls provoked at their proceedings having marched into their ter ritories LXIV TOWARDS the clofe of the year there was fome interval of peace but difturbed as was always the cafe by ftruggles between the patricians and plebeians The latter were fo incenfed that they refufed to attend the afiembly held for the elec tion of confuls fo that by the votes of the patri cians and their dependents Titus Qnintius and p 3 Quintus THE HISTORY BOOK Quintus Servilius were appointed to the confulfhip  _ 1  Thefe experienced a year fimilar to the preceding Y R ss the beginning of it filled with civil broils which B C 466 were afterwards repretfed by tKe breaking out of foreign wars The Sabines marching acrofs the plains of Cruftuminum with great rapidity carried fire and fword through all the country on the banks of the Anio and though afterwards when they had advanced almoft to the Colline gate and the walls of the city they met with a repulfe yet they car ried off a vaft booty both of men and cattle The conful Servilius marched in purfuit of them with defign to bring them to an engagement but not being able to overtake their main body in the champaign country he fprcad devaluation to fuch an extent as to leave nothing unmolefted any where and returned with a quantity of fpoil exceeding by many degrees what the enemy had carried off In the campaign againft the Volfcians alfo the arms of the ftate were remarkably fuccefsful through the condudt both of the general and of the foldiers firft they fought a pitched battle on equal ground with great lofs of blood on both fides and the Ro mans whofe fmall number made them feel the lofs more fenfibly would have quitted the field had not the conful by a happy feint re animated the troops calling out that the enemy were flying on the other wing they then returned to the charge and the opinion that victory was on their fide was the means of their obtaining it in reality The conful fearing left if he preffed the enemy too far he might have the battle to fight over again gave the fignal for retreat After this an interval of fome few days palTed during which both parties repofed as if they had tacitly agreed to a fufpenfion of arms and in the mean time vaft multitudes from every ftate of the Volfcians and Equans flocked into their camp not doubting but that the Romans when informed of their numbers would make their retreat by nighr About OF ROME  About the third watch therefore they came to at tack the camp Quintius after appeafing the tu _ mult which the fudden alarm had excited ordering Y R 186 the foldiers to ftay quiet in their tents led out a2 cohort of Hernicians to form an advanced guard mounted the trumpeters and other inftrumental per formers on horfes and ordered them to found their inftruments before the rampart and keep the ene my in fufpenfe until day light During the re mainder of the night every thing was fo quiet in the camp that the Romans were not even prevented from fleeping The Volfcians on the other hand expecting every inftant an attack from the enemy were kept in a ftate of earneft attention by the ap pearance of armed infantry whom they believed to be Romans and alfo to be more numerous and by the buftle and neighing of the horfes which being under the management of riders with whom they  were unacquainted and having their ears continually teazed with the found of the inftruments were in conftant agitation LXV WHEN day appeared the Romans march ing into the field in full vigour after being tho roughly refrefhed with fleep at the firft onfet over powered the Volfcians fatigued with Handing and want of reft However the enemy might be faid to retire rather than to be routed for fome hills which lay behind them afforded a fafe retreat to all the troops that were ftajioned to the rear of the firft line whofe ranks were ftill unbroken On coming to this place where the advantage of the ground was againft him the conful ordered his men to halt it was with great difficulty that they could be re ftrained they called out and infifted on being al lowed to purfue the advantage which they had gained the horfemen collected round the general were ftill more ungovernable loudly declaring that they would advance before the front line While P 4 the 21 5 THE HISTORY e BOOK the conful hefitated between the confidence which he knew he might place in the valour of his men Y R a86 and the difficulty of the ground all cried out with B c 466 one voicC that they would proceed and they in ftantly put their words in execution fticking their fpears in the ground that they might be lighter to climb the fteeps they ran forward in full fpeed The Volfcians having at the firft onfet difcharged their miffive weapons began to pour down on them as they approached the ftones which lay among their feet and by inceflant blows from the higher ground ib galled and difordered the Romans that their left ving was by this means almoft overborne when the conful juft as they were beginning to give way reproaching them with their ramnefs and at the fame time with want of ipirit made their fears give place to fhame At firft they ftood their ground with determined firmnefs then as they recovered ltrength to renew the attack in fpite of the difad vantage of fituation they ventured to advance and raifing the mout anew moved forward in a body Then rufhing on again in full career they forced their way and got over the difficult part of the ground when they had reached almoft to the fum mit of the hill the enemy

troops and the confuls were directed to divide the management of the war be tween them fo that one fhould have the Volfcians as his province the other the Eqiuins The tri bunes exclaimed loudly to their faces in the Forum that  this Volfcian war was but a concerted farce that the Hernicians had been inftructed how to aft their part in it that now the Roman peo ple were not deprived of liberty by manly efforts but cheated out of it by cunning That becaufe it was incredible that the Volfcians and Equans who were almoft exterminated could of them felves commence hoftilities new enemies had

the levy thither the tribunes haftened and drew the afiembly with them A few were cited by way of experiment and immediately outrages commenc ed Whenever a lirtor by the conful s command laid hold of any perfon a tribune ordered him to be fet at liberty Nor did either party confine them felves within the limits of that authority to which their office entitled them j every ftep taken was to be fupported by force and ftrength of hands The fame line of conduct which the tribunes had obferv ed in obftructing the levy was followed by the confuls in their oppofition to the law which was brought forward on every day whereon an afiembly could be held The riot was begun by the patricians refufing to withdraw after the tribunes had ordered the people to proceed to the place of voting The elder citizens hardly ever attended the proceedings on this affair becaufo they were not to be regulated by prudence but abandoned to the direction of rafh nefs and violence and the confuls generally kept out of the way left in fuch general confufion they fhould expoie their dignity to infult There was a young man called Cjcib Quintius full of prefump tion on account both of the nobility of his defcent and his peribnal fize and ftrength to thefe qualifica tions beftowed by the gods he had added many war like accomplifhments and a confiderable degree of eloquence in the Forum infomuch that no perfon in the ftate was deemed to poffefs greater abilities ei ther for acting or fpeaking this man having placed himfelf in the midft of the body of the patricians confpicuous in ftature above the reft and

otherwife feverely handled fo that every one faw that if he were allowed to proceed in this man ner it would be impoflible to carry the law At this juncture when the other tribunes were almoft reduced to defpair Aulus Virginius one of their college inftituted a criminal profecution on a capi tal charge againft Caefo But by this proceeding he rather irritated than reprefied his impetuous temper he thence became the more vehement in his oppofition to the law perfecuted the commons and harafied the tribunes in a manner with open hoftilities The profecutor fuffered the accufed to run headlong to ruin and to draw down on himfelf fuch a degree of public difpleafure as would ferve for fuel to inflame the charges which he had brought againft him and in the mean time frequently intro duced the law not fo much in hope of carrying it through as with defign to provoke the rafhnefs of Caefo Many inconfiderate expreflions and actions which often pafied on thefe occafions among the young men were all through the general prejudice againft him imputed to Caefo s violent tempen The law however was ftill oppofed and Aulus Vir ginius frequently obferved to the people  Do ye not perceive Romans that it

approached and it was manifeft that the people in general had conceiv ed an opinion that the exiftence of their liberty de pended upon the condemnation of Caefo Then at length he was compelled though not without indig nation to folicit the favour of each he was follow ed by his relations who were the principal perfons in the ftate Titus Quintius Capitolinus who had been thrice conful after recounting many honoura ble atchievements of his own and of his family affirmed that  there never had appeared either in the Quintian family or in the Roman ftatc any perfon poffefled of luch a

order of  Quintius Capitolinus come to his relief when in a dangerous fituation and that there was no one perfon to whom he thought the public fo much indebted for the reftoration of their affairs to a ftate of fafety Lucius Lucretius conful the preceding year in the full fplendour of frefh glorr attributed to Caefo a lhare of his own merits enu merated the battles he had been in related extraor

the diforder received from Casfo a blow of his h ft which felled him to the ground that he was carried home from thence in people s arms and that he believed this was the caufe of his death but that he was prevented from profecut ing him for fuch an atrocious fact by the confuls of the preceding years By the loud aflevera tions of Volfcius to this purport the people were fo  A part of the town fo

the Roman people might have it in their power to punifh the perfon who had been c guilty of murder The other tribunes being ap pealed to refolved on a middle courfe and thereby avoided every impeachment of their right to give protection they forbade his being put in confine ment and declared it as their determination that the accufed mould give bail for his appearance and that a fum of money mould be fecured to the peo ple in cafe of his failing to appear The fum in which it was reafonable that the fureties mould be bound came then to be difcuffed it was referred to the determination of the fenate and until the fena lors fhould corne to a refolution the accufed was de tained in the public aflembly It was determined that he fhould find fureties and that each furety fhould be bound to the amount of three thoufand afes  the number of fureties to be furnifhed was left to the decifion of the tribunes they fixed it at ten and on that number of fureties being given the profaSutor confented that the accufed fhould be admitted to bail He was the firft who gave bail in this manner where the penalty was to be applied to the ufe of the public Being difmiffed from the Forum he went the night following into exile among the Etrurians On the day appointed for his trial although it was pleaded in his favour â 9 1js td VOL i R that THEHISTORY  BOOK that he had quitted

feverity that all his property being fold he Jived for a long time in an obfcure cottage beyond the Tiber as if banifhed from his country This trial and the proceedings about the law gave full employment to the ftate There was no difturbance from foreign enemies XIV WHILE the tribunes flumed with this fuccefs imagined from the difmay into which the patricians had been thrown by the exile of Caefo that the patting of the law was almoft certain and the elder patricians for their part had in fact relin quifhed the adminiftration of affairs the younger part of them efpecially thofe who were Caefo s friends inftead of fuffering their fpirits to droop aflumed a higher degree of vehemence in their rage againft the commons But in one particular they improved their plan exceedingly tempering the vio lence of their exertions with a degree of moderation The firft time after Caefo s banishment that the law began to be agitated having prepared themfclves for the occafion and formed in a body with a great bund of their dependents as foon as the tribunes af forded them a pretext by ordering them to retire they attacked them furioufly and all exerted them felves with activity fo equal that no one of them carried home a greater fhare than another either of honour or of ill will the commons complained that a thoufand Caefbs had ftarted up in the room of one During the intermediate days in which the tribunes brought forward no proceedings refpecting the law nothing could be more mild and peaceable than thefe lame perfons they faluted the plebeians kmdly entered into converfation with

without interruption fhewing no kind of Y R i9V rudenefs to any either in public or private except B C 419 when the bufinefs of the law began to be agitated On other occafions the behaviour of the young pa tricians was popular and the tribunes not only exe cuted the reft of their bufinefs without difturbance but were even re elected for the following year with out one offenfive expreffion much lefs any violence being ufed By thus foothing and managing the commons they rendered them by degrees more tractable and by thefe methods the palfing of the law was evaded during that whole year XV THE fucceeding confuls Caius Claudius Y R ig fon of Appius and Publius Valerius received theB c s8 commonwealth in a ftate of great tranquillity The new year had brought no change in affairs The thoughts of every member of the ftate were occu pied either in wifhes for the pafiing of the law or in apprehenfions of being obliged to fubmit to it The more the younger patricians endeavoured to infinu ate themfelves into the favour of the commons the more earneftly did the tribunes ftrive to counteract them exciting by injurious fuggeftions fufpicions to their prejudice in the minds of the populace averting that there was a confpiracy formed that Caefo was at Rome that plans had been concerted for putting the tribunes to death and maflacring the commons that the elder patricians had engaged the younger to abolifh the office of tribune out of the commonwealth and to reduce the ftate to the fame form which had fubfifted before the feceffion to the facred mount While fears were entertained of an attack from the Volfcians and ffiquans which had now become a ftated matter and occurred regularly almoft every year a new danger which had never been thought of made its appearance nearer home R a

knowing what this danger was â which had fo fuddenly aflailed the city whether it was occafioned by foreign or domeftic forces whe ther by the difafft ftion of the commons or the trea chery of the flaves They exerted themfelves to quiet the tumults and not unfrequently their very endeavours to quiet them ferved but to exafperate them the more for it was impoffible in fuch a ftate of terror and confirmation to make the populace obey command They gave them arms notwith ftanding but not to all without diflinction only to fuch as they could fafely rely on in all emergencies not yet knowing with

amidft the crowd of dan gers which ftarted up on every fide no one enter tained any fears from the turbulence of the tribunes or the commons that was deemed an evil of a milder nature which as it

aggravation of their diftrefs for fuch madnefs pofiefied the tribunes that they infifted that they were not enemies but people un der the counterfeit appearance of enemies who had feized on the

fhould have been taken and deftroyed had not thefe La tines of their own accord taken arms Is this tribunes affording protection to the commons to expofe them unarmed to be flaughtered by the enemy

execution of the plan claimed to himfclf a fhare of the confular duties The tribunes then mocking the conful s declarations as imprac ticable proceeded to afk  by what means the con fuls would be enabled to lead out an army when no one would fuffer them to make a levy To this Quintius replied  We have no occafion for a levy becaufe when Publius Valerius gave arms to the commons for the recovery of the Capitol they all took an oath to him that they would af femble on an order from the conful and would not depart without his permiffion We therefore publifh our orders that every one of you who have taken the oath attend to morrow under arms OF ROME 753 t  arms at the lake Regillus The tribunes then BOOK began to cavil and alleged that  the people were  r â abfolved of that obligation becaufe Quintius was Y R 194 in a private ftation at the time when the oath B c 45 â was taken But that difregard of the gods which prevails in the prefent age had not then taken place nor did every one by his own inter pretations accommodate oaths and the laws to his particular views but rather adapted his practice to them The tribunes therefore nnding no hope of fucceeding in their oppofition on that ground en deavoured to delay the marching of the troops and in this they were the more earneft becaufe a report had fpread that orders had been given for the au gurs alfo to attend at the lake Regillus and that a place mould be coniecrated by augury in which the people might tranfact buQnefs with the benefit of aufpices in order that any meafures enacted at Rome through means of the violence of the tribunes might be repealed in an affembly held there Eve ry one it was faid would vote there juft as the confuls chofe for at any greater diftance from the city than that of a mile there was no appeal and even mould the tribunes come thither they would among thÂ crowd of the other citizens be fubject to the con fular authority This alarmed them But what dif turbed their minds with the ftrongeft apprehenfions was that Quintius ufed frequently to ay jhat  he would not hold an election of confuls that the c diftemper of the ftate was not fuch as could be ftopped by the ufual remedies that the common wealth ftood in need of a dictator in order that any perfon who mould ftir one ftep towards raifing disturbances in the Hate might feel that the power of that magiftrate was

implored the protection ___ I__ time of the confuls at another of the fenate yet Y R 194 they could not prevail on the conful to recede from B C 45 his refolution until the tribunes promifed that they would be directed by the fenate The conful then laid before the fenate the demand of the tribunes and commons and it was decreed that  the tribunes fhould not introduce the law during that year and that on the other hand the confuls fhould not lead out the troops from the city For the time to come it was the judgment of the fenate that re electing the fame magiftrates and re ap pointing the fame tribunes was injurious to the intereft of the commonwealth The confuls conformed to the decifions of the fenate but the tribunes notwithftanding the remonftrances of the conliils were re appointed The

The ufual method of proceeding was this the plaintiff either named the judge before whom he rummoned the defendant to appear which was termed ferre judicem or he left the nomination to the defendant

five horfemen were difpatched who mak ing their way between the enemy s pofts brought intelligence to Rome that the conful and his army were befieged Nothing could have happened fo unexpected or fo

to the contentions and fsnce it was difagree able to them that laws fnould be propofed by plebeians would permit lawgivers to be chofen in common out of the plebeians and out of the patricians who fhould propofe fuch laws as would be advantageous to both parties and tend to eftablifh liberty on an equal foot ing This propofal the fenate did not difap prove of but declared that no one except a

ftates of Greece XXXII THIS year parted undifturbed by any fo V R jot reign Wars And the year following in which Pub lius Curiatius and Sextus Quintilius were confuls was Hill more quiet the tribunes obferving uninter rupted filence which was owing at firit to their waiting for the arrival of the ambaffadors who had gone to Athens for copies of the laws of that ftatc and OF ROME 271  and afterwards to two heavy calamities which fell BOOK on them at once famine and peftilence making _ J  dreadful havock among both men and cattle The Y R 301 country was defolated the city exhaufted by a

Veturius with the greater fatisfaction becaufe he had been condemned by the commons The conful Quinti lius died and four tribunes of the people Such a multiplicity of loffes made it a melancholy year but there was no difturbance from any enemy The Y R 3Â next confuls were Caius Menenius and Publius Sef C 45Â tins Capitolinus Neither during this year was there any foreign war at home however fome commo tions arofe The ambafladors had now returned with the Athenian laws and the tribunes therefore prefied more earneftly that the bufinefs of com piling the laws might at laft be begun It was re iblved that ten magiftrates to be called decemvirs fhoukl be created from whom no appeal mould lie and that there mould be no pther magiftrates during that year It was difputed for fome time whether plebeians mould be admitted among them At laft that point was given up to the patricians provided that the Icilian law concerning the Aventine and others called the devoting laws mould not be re pealed XXXIII IN the three hundredand firft year from the building of Rome the form of the government underwent a fecond change the fupreme power being transferred from confuls to decemvirs as it had formerly been from kings to confuls This new form was lefs remarkable becaufe it was not of long dura tion for the happy beginnings of that government ter minated in extravagant licentioufnefs which

being con fuls elect for that year this honour was conferred on them as a compeniation for the other and on Seftius one of the confuls of the former year becaufe he had propofed this bufinefs to the

fame time it was fup pofed that they having acquired a knowledge of the laws of foreign countries would be ufeful in digeft ing the new propofed regulations The others filled up the number It is faid that in choofing thefe laft they pitched upon perfons far advanced in years with intent that there mould be the lefs warmth in any oppofition which they might give to the deter minations of the others The direction of the whole bufinefs of government was lodged in the hands of Appius Claudius through the favour of the com mons for he had alTumed a demeanor fo entirely new that from a harm and fevere profccutor of the commons he became on a fudden a zealous pro moter of their interefts and an eager candidate for  popular applaufe Each of them adminiftered juftice to the people one day in

of the magiftracy he might add in proportion to the liberty of the people XXXIV WHILST the higheft and the loweft alike met from them this prompt execution of juf tice impartial as if dictated by an oracle they at the fame time employed themfelves afiiduoufly in framing the laws and at length after people s ex  pectations had been raifed to the higheft pitch they exhibited for public infpeclion ten tables and then fummoning an afiembly of the people after praying that  it might prove fortunate and advantageous and happy to the commonwealth to themfelves and to their pofterity ordered them

rumour was afterwards fpread that there were two tables wanting and that by the addition of thefe a body as it were of the whole Roman law might be completed The expectation of this when the day of

fometimes more like a perfon petitioning for than one who was in veftcd O F R O M E 275 vtfted with the office he afperfed the characters of B o o K the candidates of high rank and extolled the moft

even his col leagues who to that time had been entirely attached to him looked on him with amazement wondering  what his intentions could be They were convinced that there was no fincerity in his profeflions that fuch affability in one of fuch a haughty mind could not be without fome interefted views that his low ering himfelf to the common level in this extraordi nary manner and mixing on an equal footing with the private citizens did not look like hafte to quit the office but rather like feeking for means to be continued in it not daring however openly to op pofe his wifhes they endeavoured to baffle his ef forts by a feeming defire to gratify him and agreed among themfelves to appoint him as the youngeft of their body to the office of prefiding at the elec tion This was an artifice to prevent his returning himfelf which no one had ever done except in the  cafe of tribunes of the people and even there it was deemed a moft pernicious precedent How ever he declared that with the good favour of for tune he would prefide at the election and he laid hold of the intended obftruction to his defign as the lucky means of effecting its accomplifhment and having by means of a coalition which he formed foiled the pretenfions of the two Quiptii Capitolinus and Cincinnati of his own uncle Cains Claudius a moft fteady fupporter of the caufe of the nobility and of other

live according to his natural difpofition and to form his new colleagues early to his own plan of proceeding before they fhould enter on the adminiftration of their office They held daily cabals remote from witnefies wherein being furnifhed with plans of tyranny di gefted among themfelves without the knowledge of any they no longer difiembled their arrogance be came difficult of accefs morofe to fuch as addreffed Y R 304 them and continued this behaviour until the ides of B c 448 May The ides of May were then the ufual time for entering on office At the very beginning then of their magiftracy they diftinguifhed the firft day of their adminiftration by an exhibition which excited the greateft alarm for whereas the former decem virs had obferved a rule that only one fhould have the fafces and that this emblem of royalty fhould go in rotation through them all to each in his turn they unexpectedly made their appearance attended each by twelve fafces One hundred and twenty lictors filled the Forum and carried axes bound up with the fafces The decemvirs alleging that as by the terms of their appointment there lay no appeal from them there could be no reafon why the axe fhould be taken away They difplayed an appearance of ten kings and thus multiplied terrors not only among the loweft clafs but among the principal patricians every one being perfuaded that they wanted only a pretext to begin the work of death fo that fhould anyone either in the fenate or in a meeting of the people utter an expreffion favourable to liberty the rods and axes would inftantly be got ready to ftrike terror into the reft For bcfides that there was no hope OF ROME 377 hope of protection from the people an appeal to B o o K them having been prohibited they had by agree _i ment alfo prohibited themfelves from interfering Y R with each other s decrees whereas the former de B c cemvirs had allowed their decrees to be amended by an appeal to a colleague and had referred to the decifion of the people feveral matters which might fecm to belong to their own jurifdiction For fome time the danger feemed to threaten equally all ranks of men but began by degrees to be directed entire ly againft the commons They avoided giving of fence to the patricians while they treated people of the lower ranks with arbitrary cruelty Intoreft having ufurped in their breafts the place of juftice they on every occafion regarded the perfon not the caufe Their decifions they adjufted privately at home and afterwards pronounced them in the Fo rum If a perfon appealed from any of them to one of his colleagues the treatment he met from the one to whom he appealed was always fuch as made him repent his not having abided by the fen tence of the former An opinion had alfo gone abroad though without known authority that they had confpired in this fcheme of iniquity not merely for the prefent year but that a clandeftine league had been ftruck among them and ratified by an oath that they would not call an afiembly for elec  tions but perpetuating the decemvirate keep a lafting hold of the power which they had now in their hands XXXVII THE plebeians now began to watch the countenances of the patricians and though they had been accuftomed to dread being enflaved by them and influenced by that dread had brought the commonwealth into its prefent fituationj yet they now anxioufly looked to them for fome ray of hope which might guide them to liberty The p rincipal patricians while they hated the decemvirs j 3 bore TH t HISTORY  bore no lefs hatred toward the commons and though they did not approve the proceedings of ths Y R 304 former thought the latter fuffered no more than they B C 448 haddefervedj and they had no inclination to a flift men who through their intemperate eagernefs in purfuit of liberty had fallen into flavery On the contrary they heaped injuries on them in hopes that being thoroughly difgufted with the prefent they might come to long for the reftoration of the former ftate of affairs and the government of two confuls The greater part of the year was now paft and the two tables of laws had been added to the ten of the former year nor was there any other circum ftance if thefe laws were once ratified in afiembly of the centuries which could make the prefent form of government neceffary to the commonwealth People were in continual expectation of an afiembly being called for the election of confuls and the thoughts of the commons were folely employed in devifing a reftoration of that bulwark of liberty the tribunitian office which had been laid afide fo long While in the mean time not the leaft mention was made of an election and the decemvirs who at firft had exhibited themfclves to the commons for the purpofe of gaining their favour furrounded by men who had been tribunes now collected about them crowds of young patricians Troops of thefe encompafied every tribunal they feized and drove about at will the commons and

made their appearance as decemvirs retaining ftill the fame fpirit to enforce their authority and the fame emblems of dignity to fupport the fplendor of their office This appeared arbitrary government beyond difpute and men deplored the lofs of liberty as irre coverable No one champion ftood forth in its caufe nor was there a profpect of any fuch appear ing and they not only funk into defpondence but began to be defpifed by the neighbouring nations who thought it would reflect fhame on themfelves if a ftate which had forfeited its own liberty mould be allowed to retain its dominion over others The Sabines with a numerous army made an irruption into the Roman territories and having fpread de vaftation through a great part of the country and collected without lofs a greae booty qf men and cattle they recalled their troops from the various parts in which they were difperfed and pitched their camp at Eretum grounding their hopes on the dif fenfions at Rome which they trufted would prevent the raifing of troops Befides the couriers that ar rived the country people flying into the city caufed a general alarm The decemvirs held a confuta tion on the meafures neceflary to be taken and while they were left dettitute of fupport on every fide being equally detefted by the patricians and the commons another circumftance occurred which ag gravated their fears by prefenting an additional danger to their view the Equans on the oppofite fide had encamped in the diitrict of Algidum and ambalTadors who came from Tulculum to requeit afiiftance brought accounts that their lands wt re ra vaged by detachments from thence The ucccjivirs T  were 28o THE HISTORY BOOK were fo thoroughly frightened on finding the city t _ _ _ furrounded by two enemies at once that they deter Y R 3oj mined to have recourle to the advice of the fenate B c 447 accordingly they ordered the fenators to be fuminon ed to a meeting though they well knew what a ftorm of public refentment threatened to break up on themfelves that all men would heap on their heads the blame of the devaftations of the country and of all the dangers by which they were encom paffed and that on thefe grounds attempts would  be made to deprive them of their office it they did not firmly unite in the fupport of their caufe and by enforcing their authority with feverity on a few  of the moft intractable tempers reprefs the forward nefs of others When the voice of the crier was heard in the Forum fmnmoning the fenators to at tend the decemvirs in the fenate houfe it excited the wonder of the people no lefs than if it were a matter entirely new  what could have happened now the people faid  that thofe who had for a long time paft laid afide the cuftom of confult ing the fenate mould now revive a practice fo long difuled They might thank the war and their enemies for any thing being done that was cuftomary in a free ftate They looked about  the Forum for fenators and could hardly any where difcover one they then turned their eyes to the fenate houfe and the folitude which appeared round the decemvirs who on their part attributed the non attendance of the fenators to the general detefta tion of their government while the commons found a reafon for it in the want of authority in private perfons to convene the fenate and obferved thac now a head was formed for thofe who wifhed for the recovery of liberty if the commons would let their endeavours accompany thofe of the fenate and if as the fathers when fummoned refufed to alterable in fenate the commons mould in like manner refufe to enlift Sugh were the general topics of difcourfe among O F R O M E 281 among the commons of the fenators there was BOOK hardly one in the Forum very few in the city  T _f Difgufted with the times they had retired to their Y R 3o5 country feats and being deprived of their fhare in B c 4 7 the adminiftration of the public bufinefs attended folely to their private affairs thinking that by re moving to a diftance from the meeting and converle of their tyrannic mafters they had got fo far out of the reach of ill treatment On their not meeting according to fummons apparitors were difpatched to all their houfes to levy the penalties and at the fame time to difcover whether their non attendance was owing to defign and thefe brought back an ac count that the members of the fenate were in the _ country This gave lefs pain to the decemvirs than if they had heard that they were in town and refufed to obey their commands They then gave orders that every one of them fhould be fummoned and proclaimed a meeting of the fenate on the day fol lowing when the members affembled in much greater numbers than they themfelves had hoped This raifed a fufpicion in the minds of the com mons that the fenators had deferted the caufe of li berty fince they had paid obedience as to a legal fummons to the order of men whofe office had ex pired and who except fo far as force prevailed were nothing more than private citizens i XXXIX BUT by all accounts they fhewed more obedience in coming to the houfe than fervi lity in delivering their opinions It is related that after Appius Claudius had propofed the bufinefs to be confidered before the opinions were demanded in order Lucius Valerius Potitus occafioned a great ferment by infifting on being allowed to fpeak on the ftate of the commonwealth and when the de cemvirs endeavoured to prevent him declaring that he would go out and apply to the commons and that Marcus Horatius Barbatus entered the lifts with no s82 T H E H I S T O R Y B o o K no lefs boldnefs calling them  ten Tarquinii and    putting them in mind that the Valerii and Horatii Y R 305 were among the fortmoft in effecting the expulfion B C 447 tt of t ie kings Nor was it the title merely which  had then given people fo much offence for ic was one which was properly applied to Jupiter  one which had been applied to Romulus the founder of the city and to the princes his fuc ccffors and which was ftill retained in the reli gious inftitutions and even confidered as material to the performance of the facred rites It was the haughtinefs the violence of the king which then filled them with abhorrence and if thefe were not to be borne in a perfon who was at the time a king and the fon of a king who would bear them in fo many private citizens Let them take care left by forbidding men to Jpeak with freedom in the fenate houfe they might oblige them to utter  their fentiments in another place Nor did he fee  how he in his private capacity had lefs right to call the people to an aflembly than they to con vene the fenate Let them try whenever they chofe how much more forcibly a fenfe of injuries f would operate in vindication of liberty than am c bition in retaining illegal authority They had propofed the Sabine war as the bufinefs to be confidcred as if the Roman people had any more important war on their hands than againft thofe who having been created for the purpofe of framing laws had left no law remaining in the ftate who had abolifhed elections abolifhed an nual magiftrates abolifhed the regular changing of the chief magiftrate the only means of prc ferving the balance of liberty who ftanding in the rank of private citizens kept poffeffipn of the fafces and of regal fovereignty After the expul fion of the kings there were patrician magiftrates afterwards

not allowed to fpeak of the ftate of the com monwealrh Let them not rely too much on the timidity of others for men feel more fenfibly the C weight of prefent fufFerings than of fuch as exift only in apprehenfion XL WHILE Horatius was exclaiming in this manner and the decemvirs knew not how either to gratify their anger or to pafs over the provocation nor could judge hpw the bufinefs would end Caius Claudius uncle to Appius the decemvir addrefied him in a fpeech fraught with intreaties rather than reproaches j befought him by the fhade of his own brother the other s father  to pay more regard to the rights of that civil fociety in which he was born than to a confederacy formed with his col  leagues on the moft flagitious principles This he requefted more earneftly on his account than even on that of the commonwealth for the com monwealth would doubtlefs be abundantly able  to afiert its own rights in fpite of any refiftancc which they could make but that as great con tefts generally excited great animofities he could not without horror think of what might be the confequence Although the decemvirs had re fufed liberty to fpeak on any fubject but the buiinefit which they had propoled yet fuch was their refpect for Claudius that they did not interrupt him he proceeded therefore in his difcourfe which he con cluded with moving a refolution that no decree of the fenate fhould be pafied This was confider ed by every one as importing that in the judgment pf Claudius they were but private citizens and many 2B4 T H E H I S T O R Y BOOK many of the confulars exprefied their approbation i_ _ _j Another meafure was propofed more harfh in ap Y R 305 pearance but much lefs efficacious it was to order B C 447 the patricians to afiemble and appoint an interrex for the patting of any refolution would be an ac knowledgment that the perfons who convened the fenate were invefted with fome offices whereas the member who recommended that no refolution mould pafs meant thereby to declare them private citizens When the caufe of the decemvirs was thus finking into ruin Lucius Cornelius Maluginenfis brother to Marcus Cornelius the decemvir having been pur pofely refcrved from among the confulars to clofc the debate under the pretence of anxiety about the war fupported his brother and his colleagues He wondered he faid  by what fatality it hap pened that thofe who had been themfelves can didates for the decemvirate were the perfons who either as fecondaries or principals waged this attack on the decemvirs j and why they fhould now at this particular time when the enemy were juft at the gates take fuch pains to fow clifTenfion among the citizens whereas during fo many months wherein the attention of the ftate had been difengaged no one ever made it a mat ter of difpute whether thofe who held the admi niftration of the government were legal ma  giftrates or not unlefs it were becaufe they fuppofed that in a ftate of confufion their con dudt would not be fo eafily feen through How  ever it was highly improper in any one to attempt to prejudge a caufe of that magnitude while men s minds were occupied by more urgent concerns it was his opinion that the plea urged by Valeri us and Horatius that the office of decemvirs had expired on the ides of May mould be taken into  confederation and difcufled by the fenate when the wars with which they were then threatened  fhould be brought to a conclufion and tranquil Â lity O F R O M E 285  lity reftored to the ftate that Appius ClaudiusB oo K fhould confider himfelf as having now received _ _ j fufficient notice that he muft be ready to give an Y R 305 account of the proceedings of the allembly in B  â which he in quality of decemvir had prefided and in which the decemvirs were elected whe  ther they were appointed for one year or until the laws then wanting fhould be ratified It was alfo his opinion that for the prefent every other bufinefs except the war fhould be laid afide  and that if they imagined that the reports concerning it were propagated without founda tion and that not only the couriers but the Tuf culan ambafladors had conveyed falfe intelligence then that fcouts mould be difpatched to procure more certain information but that if they gave credit to the couriers and the ambafladors then troops fhould be levied without delay and the decemvirs fhould lead armies to whatever places each fhould think proper j and that no other bufinei s fhould take place before this was dif pofed of XLI THIS refolution was carried on a divifion by means of the young patricians Valerius and Horatius then with greater vehemence renewed their efforts and loudly demanded permiflion to fpeak on the ftate of the commonwealth declaring that  if by a faction they were prevented in the fenate they would fpeak before the people for private men had no right to hinder them either in the fenate houfe or in a general afiembly nor would they give way to thofe men s imaginary fafces Appius then thinking the juncture fo critical that either their authority muft be overpow cd or the violence of thole men muft be refifled with an equal degree of boldnefs called out that whoever uttered a fentence except on the bufi nefc prppofed fhould have caufe to repent and ii on j86 T H E H I S T O R Y  on Valerius infifting that he would not be filenced by _ a private citizen ordered a lictor to advance to him Y R 305 Valerius from the door of the fenate houfe implored  â 447 the protection of the citizens Lucius Cornelius embracing Appius through concern for an objecc t different from what he pretended put a flop to the conteft and procured Valerius permifTion to fay what he chofe this producing nothing beyond words in favour of liberty the decemvirs carried their point and even the confulars and elder patri cians from inveterate hatred to the tribunitian of fice which they fuppofed the commons longed for with much more eagernefs than for the confular government would have been rather better pleafcd that the decemvirs themfelves fhculd at fome future time voluntarily refign their office than that through means of the indignation of the public agair ft them the commons fhould rife again to confequence j hoping that if by gentle management the govern ment fhould be brought back to confuls without the turbulent interpofition of the populace they might either by the intervention of wars or by tne mode ration of the confuls in the exercife of their authority bring the commons to forget their tribunes No objection being made by the patricians a levy was proclaimed and the young men there beuig no appeal from the prefent government anfwered to their names When the legions were filled up the decemvirs fettled among themfelves who mould go out with the troops and who command the feveral armies The leading men among the decemvirs were Quintus Fabius and Appius Claudius It was evident that the re would be a greater war at home than abroad The violence of Appius was thought better calculated for fupprefiing commotions in the city and the difpofuion of Fabius was confidered as rather inconftant in good purfuits than ftrermous in bad for this man hitherto highly diftinguifhcd both in civil and military conduct was fo entirely changed by OF ROME 287 by his office of decemvir and the example of his col BOOK leagues that he now chofe rather to be

management of affairs in the city where they fhould have full authority as if all the decemvirs were prefent XLII THE affairs of the public were conducted with no better fuccefs in war than at home In this the leaders were no farther to blame than for having rendered themfelves o li us to their country men in other refpects the fault lay entirely in the foldiery who rather than any enterprize mould fucceed under the conduct and aufpices of the de cemvirs fuffcred themfelves to be overcome to the difgracc of both The armies were routed both by the Sabines at Eretum and by the quans in the country of Algidum From liretum the troops made a retreat in the dead of the night and fortified a camp nearer to the city on a high ground be tween Fidenae and Cruftumeria and being purfued by the enemy would not rifk a battle on equal ground but provided farther fcfcty by the nature of the place and a rampart not by valour and arms In the country of Algidum greater dilgrace and greater lofs were

ene my the decemvirs added two moft flagitious decc s1  one at home and the other in the army In the army which acted againft the Sabines a perfon called Lucius Siccius taking advantage of the ge  neral averfion to the decemvirs and having fre quently in private converfation with the common foldiers made mention of a feceffion and of elect ing tribunes they fent him on a party of obferva â tion to choofe ground for a camp and gave in ftructions to the foldiers whom they fent to attend him on the expedition that they fhould fall upon him in fome convenient place and put him to death He did not fall unrevenged For though fur rounded on all fides he ftood on his defence and being pofiefied of extraordinary perfonal ftrength and of fpirit equal to his ftrength he flew feveral of the aflaflins The reft gave our in the camp that they had fallen into an ambufh and that Siccius was loft after fighting with great bravery and fome of the foldiers with him At firft this ftory was be lieved but afterwards a cohort which went with permiffion of the decemvirs to bury thole who had fallen obferving that none of the bodies there were ftripped j that Siccius with his arms lay in the

retreated from thence they brought _ back the body with an account that he was evi Y R 305 dently flain by his own men The camp was now 8 0 447 filled with indignation and it was refolved that Siccius mould be carried directly to Rome which would have been put in execution had not the de cemvirs as fpeedily as poffible buried him with military honours at the public expence His fu neral was attended with great grief of the foldieryi and a general belief of the blackeft guilt in the de cemvirs XLIV THERE followed in the city another atrocious proceeding which took its rife from luft and was not Id s tragical in its confequences than that which through the injured chaftity and violent death of Lucretia had occafioned the expulfion of the Tarquinii from the throne and the city that the government of the decemvirs might not only end in the fame manner as that of the kings but be loft through the fame caufe Appius Claudius was in flamed with a defire of overcorni ig the chaftity of a young woman of plebeian rank the father of this young woman Lucius Virginius held an honourable â rank among the centurions in the camp near Al gidum a man of exemplary good conduct both as a foldier and a citizen and by the fame principles were the behaviour of his wife and the education of his family regulated He h ad betrothed his daugh ter to Lucius Icilius who had been tribune a man of fpirit and of approved zeal in the caufe of the commons This maiden in the bloom of youth and of extraordinary beauty Appius burning with ipaflion had attempted to feduce by bribes and pro mifes but finding every avenue to his hopes barred by modefly he refolved to have recourfe to cruel and arbitrary violence He gave inftructions to Mar cus Claudius one of his dependents that he fhould VOL i u claim THE

damfel s father left the  fltteft opportunity for the injury which he meditated As the young woman came into the Forum for the fchools of learning were held there in fheds this minifler of the decemvir s luft laid his hand on her and affirming that  fhe was a flave and born of a woman who was his flave ordered her to follow him threatening if fhe refufed to drag her away by force While the girl ftood motionlefs through fright and aftonifhment a crowd was collected by the cries of her nurfe who implored the protection of the citizens The popular names of her father Virginius and her fpoufe Icilius were heard on every fide Their acquaintances were engaged in favour of the maiden by their regard for them and the multitude in general by the heinoufnefs of the â proceeding She was now fecured from force when the claimant faid there was no occafion for raifing a mob he was proceeding by law not by force and fummoned the maiden to a court of juftice She being advifed by thofe who appeared in her favoury to follow him they arrived at the tribunal of Ap pius The claimant rehearfed the concerted farce before the judge who was well acquainted with it having been himlelf the contriver of the plot alleged that  the girl was born in his houfe and had beea clandeftinely removed from thence to the houfe of Virginius who pretended to be her father   that of this he had fufficient evidence and would prove it even to the latisfaction of Virgin ius himff If the principat fufterer in the cafe and it was reafonable he added  that in the mean time the lervant fhould remain in the cufhody of her inafter The advocates for the young wo man pleading that Virginius was abfent on bufinefs of the ftate and would attend in two days time if 1 he OF ROME 491 toe got notice and that it was unreafonable that a B oO K fuit concerning his child fhould proceed in his ab   _f fence demanded that Appius fhould adjourn all pro Y R 305 ceedings in the caufe until the father s arrival that B c 7 in conformity to the law which he himfelf had framed he fhould leave her in the meantime in the enjoy ment of her liberty and not fuffer a young woman of ripe age to encounter the hazard of her reputation before the cafe of her freedom was determined XLV APPIUS prefaced his decree with obferv ing that  the very law which Virginius s friends  held out as the foundation of their demand was a proof how much he was inclined to favour liberty c however that law could afford no firm fecurity to  liberty if it were not invariable in the tenor of its operation without regard either to caufes or perfons  In the cafe of thofe who from fervitude claimed c a right to freedom the privilege mentioned was  allowed becaufe any citizen can adt in their be half j but in the cafe of her who was in the hands c of her father there was no other perfon to whom c the owner mould yield the cuftody of her It was therefore his determination that the father c fhould be fent for that in the meantime the claimant fhould fuffer no lofs of his right but fhould take the maiden into his cuftody and give fecurity for her appearance on the arrival of the perfon who was alleged to be her father Whilft all murmured againft the injuftice of this decree but not one had courage to oppofe it Publius Numi torius the maiden s uncle and Icilius her betrothed fpoufe arrived at the fpot The crowd having readily made way for them becaufe the multitude were of opinion that if any thing could ftop the proceedings of Appius it would be the interference of Icilius the lictor called out that  fentehce was pa Ted and on Icilius making loud remon ftrances ordered him to retire Even a cool tem v 2 per 9 THfi HISTORY BOOK per would have been inflamed by fuch grofs ill s _ _  treatment Icilius

effect while we have life to prevent it I _ charge you Appius confide r again and again to what lengths you are proceeding let Virginius when he comes determine what meafures he will purlue in regard to his daughter only of this I would have him allured that if he fubmits to this c man s claim of obtaining the cuftody of her he muft feek another match for his daughter as for  me in vindication of the liberty of my fpoufe I will forfeit my life fooner than my honour XLVI THE pafilons of the multitude were now raifed and there was every fign of a violent conteft cnfuing The lictors had gathered round Icilius but proceeded however no farther than threats when Appius faid  that the defence of Virginia was not  the motive which actuated Icilius but turbulent by O F R O M E 293 by nature and breathing at that inftant the fpirit 9 O O  of the tribunefhip he was feeking an occafion of â L j fedition he would not however for that day Y R 305 give him matter to work on but in order to B convince him at once that this indulgence was granted not to his petulance but to the abfent Virginius to the name of father and to liberty he would not on that day decide the caufe nor interpofe any decree he would even requeft of Marcus Claudius to depart fomewhat from his right and fuffer the maiden to be bailed until the next day But if on the next day the father did not attend he now gave notice to Icilius and to perfons like Icilius that as its founder he would not fail to fupport his own law nor as decemvir to fhew a proper degree of refolution nor mould call together the lictors of his colleagues to check the efforts of the fomenters of fedition he would be content with his own lictors The execution of his iniquitous defign being thus deferred the ad vocates of the girl having retired by themfelves re folved firft of all that the brother of Icilius and the fon of Numitorius active young men fhould fet off from thence directly to the gate and with all poffible hafte call home Virginius from the camp acquainting him that  the fafety of the maiden de pended on his being prefent in time next day to c protect her from injury They fet out the in ftant they received their directions and with all the ipeed their horfes could make carried the account to her father IR the meantime the claimant of the maiden urged Icilius to profefs himfelf a defendant in the caufe and to produce fureties and Icilius who delayed on purpofe in order that the mefien gers difpatched to the camp might gain the longer time for their journey telling him that he was pre paring to do fo the whole multitude on this held up their hands and every one fhewed himfelf ready to be furety for Icilius To them he replied tears at u 3  th 294 THE HISTORY BOOK the fame time filling his eyes  I am

Appius after remaining there for a fhort time left he fhould feem to have fat merely for the fake of that bufinefs and finding that no one applied to him people s anxiety about that particular affair hindering them to attend to others retired to his houfe and wrote to his colleagues to the camp not to give leave of abfence to Virginius and even to keep him in confinement This wicked fcheme as it deferved was too late to fucceed for Virginius having already got leave of abfence had fet out at the firft watch fo that the letter about detaining him which was delivered in the morning produced no effect XLVII IN the city the whole multitude of the â citizens were afiembled in the Forum at the firft light full of anxious expectation Virginius clad in mourning and accompanied by a vaft number of advocates led his daughter into the Forum habited in weeds denoting her diftrefs and attended by a number of matrons There he began to folicit each man s favour and not only requefted their aid as a boon granted to his prayers but demanded it as his dvie reminding them that  he ftood daily in the field of battle in defence of their wives and children nor was there any man who had given mere proof of valour and intrepidity in a6Hon than t he had done Yet what did this avail if while  the city was feeure from danger their children  were expofed to calamities as grievous as could be dreaded if it were taken by an enemy With â fuch difcourfes uttered in a manner as if he were addrefling a public afiembly he applied to each of the people Icilius addrefied them with like argu ments and the female attendants by thsir filent tears OF ROME 295 tears affected them more deeply than any words B o o K could do Appius whofe mind was hardened againft  T f all fuch occurrences violent madnefs rather than Â 305 love having perverted his underftanding afcended B c 447 the tribunal and when the claimant had juft begun to urge that  through partiality he had refuted  yefterday to pronounce judgment in the caufe Appius without allowing him to proceed in ftating fris claim or giving Virginius an opportunity of an fwering delivered his fentence The dif courfe with which he introduced his decree fome antient writers have fet down perhaps with truth but as I no where find any one that feems likely to have been oifed on occafion of fuch an iniquitous decifion I think it beft to reprefent the plain fadTr of which there is no doubt he decreed that fhe mould be held in bondage until the final decifion At firft all were ftruck motionlefs with aftonifhment and fur prife at fuch an atrocious proceeding Silence then prevailed for forne time afterwards when Marcus Claudius went to ferze the maiden where fhe ftood in the midft of the matrons and was oppofed by the women with lamentable cries of grief Virginius  ftretching forth his hands in a menacing attitude towards Appius faid Appius I betrothed my f daughter to Icilius not to thee and I have edu cated her for a wife not for a harlot Do you  intend that men mall indulge their luft promifcu oufly like cattle and wild beads Whether thefe â men here will endure fuch things I know noti but thofe who carry arms I hope never will The claimant of the maiden being forced back by the crowd of women and advocates who ftood round filence was commanded by the crier XLVIII THE decemvir whofe mind was warped by his ungovernable luft declared that  not only from the abufive language of Icilius yefterday and the violence of Virginius of which the whole u 4 Roman 296 THE HISTORY  op K Roman people were witnefies but alfo from ccr t_j r_ tain proofs he had learned that during the whole Y R 305 night cabals had been held for the purpofe of B C 447 i ftirring up fedition Wherefore being aware of c the difputes likely to enfue he had come down with a band of men in arms not with a defign of c injuring any perfon who fhould demean himfelf  but of quietly punifhing in a manner fuited to the ffiajefty of government fuch as fhould prefume to difturb the tranquillity of the ftate It will there  fore faid he be your better way to remain quiet Go lictor remove the crowd and make way for the owner to feize his tlave When burtt ing with paflion he had thundered out thefe words the multitude of themfelves voluntarily feparated and the maiden ftood forfaken a prey to injuftice Virginius then feeing no profpect of afliftance from any quarter faid Appius I entreat you firft to make allowance for a father s grief if I have f made ufe of too harfh expreflions towards you and next to allow me here in the prefence of the maiden to inquire of her nurfe the truth of this affair j that if I have been falfely called her father I may depart hence with the more refigna tion Permiffion being granted he drew the jnaiden and her nurfe afide to the fheds near the temple of Cloacina now called the new fheds and there fnatching a knife from a butcher plunged it into his daughter s breaft with thefe words  In f this manner my child the only one in my power do I fecure your liberty Then looking back on Appius  With this blood Appius faid he  I devote thee and thine head to perdition Ap pius alarmed by the cry raifed at fuch a horrid deed ordered Virginius to be feized But he clearing a paffage with the weapon wherever he went â and protected alfo by a multitude of young men who efcorted him made his way to the gate Icilius and Numitorius raifed up the lifclcls body and ex 6 poledf O F R O M E 297 pofed it to the view of the people deploring the B o o K villainy of Appius the fatal beauty of the maiden  f t __ j and the neceffity which had urged the father The y R joj matrons who followed joined their exclamations  B C 4 47 Were thefe the confequences of rearing children were thefe the rewards of chaftity with other mournful reflections fuch as are fuggefted by grief to women and which from the greater fenfibility of their tender minds are always the moft affe ing The difcourfe of the men and particularly of Icilius turned entirely on their being deprived of the pro tection of tribunes and appeals to the people and on the indignities thrown upon the public XLIX THE paffions of the multitude were ftrongly excited partly by the atrocioufnefs of the villainy partly By their hopes that the occafion might be improved to the recovery of liberty Ap pius now ordered Icilius to be called before him j then on his refufing to attend to be feized at laft when the beadles were not fuffered to come near him he himfelf with a band of young patricians pufhing through the crowd ordered him to be taken into confinement By this time there had collected round Icilius not only the multitude but perfons fit to head that multitude Lucius Valerius and Mar cus Horatius who driving back his lictor told Appius that  if he meant to proceed in a legal v ay they would be fecurity for Icilius againft any charge which he as a private citizen mould bring If he fhould attempt to make ufe of force in that point too they would not be his inferiors A furious fcuffle enfued The decemvir s lictor at tacked Valerius and Horatius The fafces were broken by the multitude Appius then mounted the tribunal whither he was followed by Horatius and Valerius To them the aflfembly paid attention but drowned the decemvir s voice with noife Va lerius now aflumed authority to order the lictors to depart  THE HISTORY BOOK depart from one who was but a private citizen j and â t w  then Appius bereft of courage and dreading for Y R 105 his life covered his head and unobferved by his B c 447 adverfaries made his efcape into a houfe near the Forum Spurius Oppius rufhing Into the Forum from the other fide in order to affift his colleague Jaw their authority overpowered by force After revolving feveral expedients confufed by liftening to a multitude of advifers on every fide he at laft commanded the fenate to be fummoned This ftep calmed the minds of the multitude by giving them hopes that as the condudt of the decemvirs teemed difpleafing to the greater part of the patricians their government would be abolimed through the means of the fenate The fenate gave their opinion that the commons mould not be farther exafperated and that above all things care fhould be taken to pre vent commotions being excited in the camp on the Arrival of Virginius L ACCORDINGLY fome of the younger patricians were fent to the camp which at that time was on mount Vecilius to caution the decemvirs to ufe their utmoft efforts for preventing a mutiny among the foldiers Here Virginius excited greater com motions than he had left in the city for befides the notice which he attracted by coming attended by a band of near four hundred men who incenfed at the fcandalous injuftice done him had accompanied him from the city the unmeathed weapon and him felf being b efrneared with blood engaged the atten tion of the whole camp And the gowns  being obferved in many different parts of the camp made the number of people from the city appear much larger than it was Being afked the reafon of all this grief for a long time prevented him from ut tering a word At length when after the hurry â The citizens drefs different frcm that of the military Of O F R O M E  C of their running together the crowd grew ftill and filence took place he related every circumftance in _ order as it pafied Then raifing his hands towards Y R 305 heaven befought his fellow foldiers  not to impute to him the guilt which belonged to Appius Claudi us nor to abhor him as the murderer of his child Declaring that the life of his daughter was dearer to him than his own could fhe have lived with honour and in liberty When he faw her dragged  as a flave to violation he thought it better that his child fhould be loft by death than by difho nour Actuated by companion he had fallen under the appearance of cruelty nor would he have furvived his daughter had he not looked to the aid of his fellow foldiers with hopes of re venging her death for they alfo had daughters fifters wives and the luft of Appius Claudius was not extinguiftied by the death of his daughter but would be encouraged by impunity to rage with lefs reftraint They had now warning given them in the calamity of another to guard them felves againft the like injury As to what con cerned himfelf his wife had been torn from him by fate his daughter bccaufe fhe could not c longer preferve her chaftity had fallen by an un fortunate but honourable death There was now  in his houfe no object forAppius s luftj and from any other kind of violence which he could offer  he would defend his own perfon with the fame fpirit with which he had refcued that of hisdaugh ter Let others take care of themfelves and of their children To thefe reprefentations uttered by Virginius in a loud voice the multitude replied â with fhouts that they would not be backward in vindicating either his grief or their own liberty At the fame time the gown men intermixed with the crowd of foldiers relating with forrow the fame cir cumftances and obferving how much more fhock r ng they appeared to the fight than on hearing ac quainting 30Â THE HISTORY BOOK quainting them alfo that the affairs of the decemvirs y i  at Rome were defperate and fome who came later Y R 305 faying that Appius having hardly efcaped with life 447 was gone into exile all this had fuch an effect on the foldiery that they cried out To arms fnatched up the ftandards and marched towards Rome The decemvirs exceedingly alarmed both by the tranf actions which they few and by thofe which they heard had pafied at Rome ran to different parts of the camp in order to quell the commotion While they acted with mildnefs they received no anfwer If any of them offered to exert authority he was anfwered That they were men and befides had arms They proceeded in a body to the city and pofted themfelves on the Aventine exhorting the commons whenever they met any of them to re aflume their liberty and create plebeian tribunes No other violent expreffion was heard Spurius Oppius held the meeting of the fenate when it was refolved that no harfh meafures fhould be ufed becaufe they themfelves had given occafion to the infurrection Three conlulars were fent as deputies Spurius Tarpeius Caius Julius and Servius Sulpi cius to aflc in the name of the fenate by whofe orders they had quitted their camp or what was their intention in pofting themfelves in arms on the Aventine in changing the direction of their hoftile operations from the enemy and fcizing by force on their native country The others were at no lofs what to anlwer j but they were at a lofs for a peifon to vgive the anfwer having not yet ap pointed any particular leader and individuals not being very forward to take on themfelves the invi dious office The multitude only called out toge ther that they mould fend Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius and to them they would give their anfwer LI WHE J O F R O M E LI WHEN the deputies were difmified Virginius BOOK reminded the foldiers  how much they had been __ _L_ f embarraffed juft now in a cafe of no extraordinary Y R 305 difficulty in confequence of their being a multi B c 4 â

city will in no degree prevent it They accord ingly elected ten military tribunes Nor was the army in the country of the Sabines inactive There alfo at the inftance of Icilius and Numitorius a fe

the chaftity of Virginia When Icilius heard that tri bunes of the foldiers had been elected on the Aven tine fearing left the affembly of election in the city might follow the lead of the military afiembly and elect the fame perfons tribunes of the commons being well verfed in popular intrigues and aiming himfelf at that office he took care that before they proceeded to the city the fame number

but they refufed to go on any other terms than thole of the decemvirs refigning the badges of that office their title to which had expired a year before The decemvirs remonftrating againft the

had aflured them that the fenate would never attend ferioufiy to the bufi nefs until they faw the city deferted that the facred mount would remind them of the firmnefs of the commons and that they would then dif cover that the re eftablifhment of concord was impracticable without the reftoration of the tri bunitian office Marching along the Nomentan road then called the Ficulr ean they encamped

pri vilege of appeal All this was tranfacted in an af fembly of the commons in the Flaminian meadows now called the Flaminian circus LV AFTER this under the direction of an inter J Â Â 5 rex confuls were elected Thefe were Lucius Va   lerius and Marcus Horatius who entered immedi  ately upon the exercife of their office Their con fulate was popular and though unattended by any actual ill treatment of the patricians yet incurred their difpleafure for they imagined that every fecu rity added to the liberty of the commons was a diminution of their own power Firft of all as if it were a point in controverfy whether the pa tricians were bound by regulations enacted in an aÂ fembly of the commons they pafied a law in an af fembly of the centuries  that whatever was ordered by the commons collectively fhould bind the whole people A law which gave the keeneft edge to fuch propofitions as might be introduced by the tribunes Another law introduced by a conful con cerning the right of appeal a fingular fecurity to li x 2 berty 3o8 THEHISTORY BOOK berty which had been fubverted by the power _ â granted to the decemvirs they not only revived but y R 3o6 guarded for the time to

to put fuch perfon to dead and the killing of him mould not be accounted a capital offence And when they had provided fufficient barriers for the commons by the right of appeal on one fide and the aid of the tribunes on the other they renewed to the tribunes themfclves the privilege of being deemed facred and inviolable a matter which now had been almoft forgotten re viving for the purpole certain ceremonies which had been long difufed And they not only rendered them inviolable by this religious inftitution but by a law enacting that  whoever mould offer injury to the tribunes of the commons the aediles or the judges his perfon mould be devoted to Jupiter and his property confifcated at the temple of CeresÂ Liber and Libera Lawyers deny that by this law any one is rendered facred and inviolable but jay that the perfon who offers injury to any of thofe is deemed to be devoted Accordingly an aedile is fometimes feized and put in confinement by fupe rior magiftrates which though it is not a legal pro ceeding as offering injury to a perfon exempted by this law is yet a proof j that an a dile is not deemed  facred and inviolable The tribunes they allege be came facred and inviolable in conlequence of the old oath taken by the commons when they firft created that ofTice Some expofitors have fuppofed that by this lloratian law the fame exemptions were ex tended to the confuls alfo the confuls being termed judges and to the prattors as being elected under the fame aufpices with the confuls But that ekpo fition is refuted by this argument that in thofe times it was not the cuftom as it has been fmce to call aeon OF ROME 309 a con fill judge but praetor Thefe were the laws B O O K propofed by the confuls A regulation was alib    made by the fame confuls that the

Marcus Duilius plebeian tribune after wards propofed to the commons and the commons enacted that whoever fliould caufe the commons 10 be left without tribunes or any magiftrate to be elected from whom there was no appeal fhould be punifhed with ftripes and beheaded All theic tranfadftions though highly difagreeable to the patricians pafied without oppofition from them becaufe no feverity was yet aimed at any particular perfon LVI THE tribunitian office and the liberty of the commons being thus fixed on a folid foundation the tribunes judging it now feafonable and fafe to at tack individuals fingled out Virginius as the firft profecutor and Appius defendant Virginius hav ing preferred a charge againft Appius and the latter coming to the Forum attended by a crowd of young patricians the

rights  and he who had fo lately doomed a free perfon to flavery was himfelf refufed the privilege of liberty ancj dragged to prifon Amidft thefe murmurs of the anembly Appius s voice was alfo heard

of obtaining equitable laws he refigned the conlulfhip to the high difpleafure of the patrici ans mentioning his own laws and that while they yet remained in force the framer of them was dragged to prifon But the peculiar advantages or diladvantages attending his particular cafe he would then endeavour to fet in a proper light when he fhould be allowed to make his defence At prefent by the common right of every mem ber of the ftate he a Roman citizen accufed of an offence demanded liberty of fpeaking in his f own defence and the benefit of a trial before the Roman people That his

that privi lege was refufed to a perfon on whom no fentence was pafied and who had not been heard in his de fence What plebeian or perfon in a low ftation could expect to find protection in the laws

prayers of the Claudian family who feemed to  think they had a natural right to tyrannize over the commons but to thofe of the near relations of Virginia their three tribunes who having been elected for the protection of the commons now in their own caufe implored from the com  mons favour and protection The tears of the latter feemed better entitled to pity Wherefore Appius precluded from all hope voluntarily put an end to hrs life before the day arrived to which the trial had been adjourned Immediately after Pub lius Numitorius arraigned Spurius Oppius who ftood next in the way of the public indignation as having been prefent in the city when the unjuft fen tence was pronounced by his colleague However an act of injuftice committed by himfelf drew on Oppius greater weight of public

cruel treatment towards him Oppius was thrown into prifon and be fore the day of trial put an end to his life The tribunes confifcated the property of Appius and Op pius Their colleagues went out of

after having roamed through fo many houfes in queft of vengeance refted at length in peace none of the guilty being left un punifhed  LIX THE patricians were filled with dreadful ap prehenfions for the tribunes feemed now to wear the fame countenance which had formerly marked the decemvirs when Marcus Duilius tribune of the commons impofed a falutary reftraint on their pow cr now tending to excefs telling them We have proceeded to a fufficient length both in afferting c our liberty and in punifhing our enemies Where fore during the remainder of this year I will not fuffer any perfon either to be brought to trial or to be put in confinement For I think it highly improper that old crimes now buried in  oblivion mould be again dragged forth to notice after recent ones have been expiated by the pu nifliment of the decemvirs and we have fuffici fc ent fecurity in the unremitting attention ever f fhewn by both our confuls to the interefts of li  berty â 3t6 THE HISTORY HOOK  berty that no inftance of mifconduct will hence  j forth occur which can require the interpolation of V R 306  the tribunitian power This moderation of the Â â 446 tribune firft diffipated the fears of the patricians and at the fame time increaled their ill will towards the conluls for they had been fo entirely devoted to the intereft of the commons that even a plebeian magiftrate had fhewn more readinefs to confult the liberty and fafety of the patricians than they who â were themfelves patricians and their enemies were weary of inflicting punifhments on them before the confuls fhewed any intention of oppofing the vio lence of their meafures and many faid that the fenate had betrayed a want of firmnefs in giving their approbation to the laws which they propofed in fact there was not a doubt but in this troubled itate of the public affairs they had yielded to the times LX AFTER all bufinefs in the city was adjufled and the rights of the commons Hrmly eftablifhed the confuls departed

I know not whether the conteft would not have coft him a heavy lofs Pitching his camp at the diftance of a mile from the enemy he kept his men quiet The enemy filled the middle fpace between the two camps with their troops in order of battle and gave feveral challenges to fight to which no Roman returned an anfwer Fatigued at length with Handing and waiting in vain for an en gagement the quans and Volfpians confidering this as almoft equivalent to an acknowledgment of the OF ROME 317 the victory in their favour detached feveral parties BOOK to make depredations fome againft the Hernicians n others againft the Latines leaving rather a guard to Y R the camp than fuch a force as could contend with B c the enemy which as foon as the conful underftood he retorted on them the menaces which they had ufed to him before and drawing up his troops advanced to provoke the enemy to battle and when con fidering what a great part of their force was abfent they declined the fight the Romans inftantly aflumed frem courage and looked upon thofe troops as al ready vanquifhed who through fear kept within their rampart After ftanding the whole day in rea dinefs for action they retired at the approach of night The Romans on their part full of confi dence employed the night in refrefhing themfelves The enemy very differently affected difpatched mefiengers in the utmoft hurry to every quarter to call in the plundering parties fuch as were in the neareft places returned with fpeed thofe who had gone to a greater diftance could not be found As foon as day appeared the Romans marched out of their camp refolved to aflault the enemy s rampart if they fhould refufe to fight and when a great part of the day had pafied and no motion was made by the enemy the conful ordered the troops to advance On the army beginning to move it fired the indig nation of the Equans and Volfcians to think that victorious troops were to be defended by a rampart rather than by valour and arms wherefore they alfb earneftly demanded the fignal for battle in which they were gratified by their leaders And now half of them had got out of the gates and the reft fol lowed in regular order marching down each to his own poft when the Roman conful before the ene my s line could be completed and ftrengthened with their whole force advanced to the engage ment fell on them before either the whole were drawn out of the camp or thofe who were had com pleted 3t8 t HE HISTORY BOOK pleted their difpofition and thus encountered an  1IIL unfteady multitude who were hurrying ftom one Y R 306 place to

their fpirits their leaders on every fide afking them in reproach if they intended to yield to vanquimed enemies and the fight was renewed LXI ON the other fide the Roman cohful de fired his troops to reflect that  on that day for the firft time they as free men fought for Romt as a free city that they were to conquer for themfelves and not in order to become a prize to the decemvirs that they were not acting under the orders of Appius but of their conful Valerius defcended from the deliverers of the Roman peo ple and himfelf one of their deliverers He bade them fhew that in the former battles the lofs of victory had been owing to the leaders not to the foldiers He told them it would be fcan dalous to pofiefs more courage againft their coun trymen than againft their enemies and to be more afraid of flavery at home than abroad that Vir ginia had been the only perfon whofe chaftity was in danger in time of peace and Appius their countryman the only one from whofe luft danger was to be dreaded but that fhould the fortune C of war turn againft them the children of every one of them would be in danger from fo many thoufands of enemies That he was unwilling on account of the omen to mention fuch things as neither Jupiter nor father Mars would fuffer tc happen to a city built under fuch aufpices He put them in mind of the Aventine and facred mounts and that  they ought to bring back dominion un impaired to that fpot where a few months ago they had obtained liberty to Ihew that the Roman foldiers OF ROME cc foldiers retained the fame abilities after the expul BOOK fion of the decemvirs which they had poffefied ni __ before their appointment and that the valour of Y R 50 the Roman people was not diminifhed by the B c â eftablifhment oflawswhich equalized their rights After fpeaking to this purpofe among the battalions of the infantry he flew from thence to the cavalry Come on young men faid he fhew that ye excel the infantry in valour as ye excel them in honour and in rank The infantry at the firft onfet have made the enemy give way before they recover the fhock give the reins to your horfes and drive them out of the field they will not fupport your charge and even now they rather hefitate than refift They fpurred on their horfes and drove furioufly againft the enemy who were already difordered by the attack of the foot and after they had broken through the ranks and pufhed on to the rear of their line a part of them wheeling round in the open fpace cut off the ene my s retreat to their camp towards which the greater number of them now began to fly on all fides j and by riding on before them compelled them through fear to take another courfe The line of infantry and the conful himfelf with the main body of the  army rufhed into the camp and made themfelves mafters of it killing a vaft number and getting pofiefllon of booty ftill greater in proportion The news of this victory was carried both to the city and to the other camp in the country of the Sabines in the city it excited only general joy in the camp it fired the minds of the foldiers with emulation of the glory their fellow foldiers had acquired Hbratius had already by inuring them to excurfions and try ing them in fkirmiLhes accuftomed them rather to place confidence in themfelves than to think of the ignominy which had been incurred under the com mand of the decemvirs and thefe flight engage ments had ftrengthened their hopes with regard to a general 326 THEHISTbfcY B rip K general one Nor did the Sabines who were fert v_ T_ _f dered prefumptuous by their fuccefies in the lafc Y R 306 year ceafe to provoke and urge them to fight B C 446 afking  why they wafted time in trifling excur fions and retreats like marauders and inftead of making one main effort to decide a fingle waf multiply their operations into a number of infig nificant fkirmifhes Why not come to a general engagement in the field and let fortune determine the victory at once LXII THE Romans befides that they had now of themfelves acquired a high degree of courage were exafperated at the difhonour which it would reflect on them if the other army were to return victorious to Rome while they lay expofed to the abufe and infults of the enemy  and when faid the Â  fhall we ever be a match for the enemy if we are not at prefent When the confulunder ftood that fuch were the fentiments generally ex preffed by the foldiers in the camp he called them to an affembiy and faid  Soldiers I fuppofe ye have heard the iflue of the campaign in Algidum the army have behaved as became the army of a free

he would comply with their de â  _j fire and vould next day lead them to the field Y R 306 The remainder of that day was fpent in putting B c 4 6 their arms in order On the following as foon as the Sabines perceived that the Romans were forming their line of battle they alfo marched out having for a long time ardently wifhed for an opportunity of fighting The battle was fuch as might be ex pected between armies both of whom were aflured of their own courage the one animated by a long and uninterrupted career of glory the other lately elevated by unufual fuccefs The Sabines added to their ftrength the advantage of a ftratagem for af ter forming a line equal to that of the enemy they kept two thoufand men in referve who were to make a pufh during the heat of the engagement on the left wing of the Romans When thefe by at tacking their flank were likely to overpower that wing which was thus in a manner furrounded the cavalry of two legions amounting to about fix hun dred leaped from their horfes and ruming forward to the front of their party who were giving way ftopped the progrefs of the enemy and at the fame time roufed the courage of the infantry both by taking an equal fhare of the danger and by exciting their emulation for they reflected that it would be iliameful that the horfe mould incur double danger by difcharging both their own duty and that of others and that the foot fhould not be equal to the horfe even when they were difmounted I LXIIL THEY prefied forward therefore to the fight which on their part had been fufpended and endeavoured to recover the ground which they had loft In a moment the fight was not only reftored to an equality but that wing of the Sabines compelled to give way The hcrfemcn then covered between the ranks of the foot retired to their horfes and vot i Y galloped 322 THE HISTORY B Oi K galloped acrofs to the other wing they carried with  _TI _j them an account of this fuccefs and at the fame Y R 306 time made a charge on the enemy difheartened by B c 446 tne defeat of the ftrohger wing of their army None difplayed in that battle more confpicuous bravery The conful s attention was every where employed He commended the brave and reproved the remifs Thefe immediately on being rebuked exerted them felves like men of fpirit fhame ftimulating them as powerfully as commendation had done the others The mout being raifed anew and all uniting their efforts they drove the enemy from their ground and then the force of the Romans could no longer be refifted The Sabines were difperfed all over the country and left their camp a prey to the enemy There the Romans recovered not the effects of their allies as was the cafe in Algidum but their own which they had loft in the devaftation of the coun try For this double victory obtained in two bat tles in different places the fenate fo unwilling were they to gratify the confuls decreed a fupplication in their name of one day only The people how  ever went in great numbers on the fecond day alfb to offer thankigivings and this irregular and popu lar fupplication was celebrated with rather greater zeal than the other The confuls by concert came to the city within a day of each other and called out the fenate to the field of Mars where while they were relating the fervices which they had performed the principal fenators began to complain that the fcnate was purpolely held in the midft of the fol diers to keep them in terror The confuls therefore to take away all grounds for fuch a charge removed the fenate into the Flaminian meadows to a place where the temple of Apollo now ftands called even at that time the Circus of Apollo Here a vaft majority of the fenators concurring in refufing a tri Â mph Lucius Icilius tribune of the commons pro pofed to the people the ordering a triumph to the 10 confuls O F R O M E 323 confuls Many flood forth to argue againft this B O O K proceeding particular Caius Claudius exclaimed _ that  it was over the patricians not over the ene Y R 306 my that the confuls wifhed to triumph and B c 4 6 that they fought it as a return for their private kindnefs to a tribune not as an honour due to valour That a triumph was a matter which had never hitherto been directed by the people j but the judgment on the merit and the difpofal of it had always been in the fenate That even the kings had not in this refpect derogated from the majefty of that order the principal one in the ftate He charged the tribunes not to occupy every department fo entirely with their own authority as to leave no room for the deliberation of the public and afierted that by no other means could the ftate be free or the laws equalized than  by each order maintaining its own rights and its own dignity Though many arguments were ufed to the fame purpofe by the other elder fena tors yet every one of the tribes approved of the pro pofition This was the firft inftance of a triumph celebrated by order of the people without the appro bation of the fenate LXIV THIS victory of the tribunes and com mons was very near terminating in a wanton irregu larity of pernicious tendency a confpiracy being formed among the tribunes to procure the re election of the fame perfons to that office and in order that their own ambition might be the lefs confpicuous to re clect the fame confuls They alleged as a pre text a combination of the patricians to fap the foun dation of the rights of the commons by the affronts which they threw upon the confuls What would be the confequence they faid  if before the laws were firmly eftablimed confuls mould

Marcus Duili us a man of prudence and who clearly perceived what a heavy load of public difpleafure they would probably have to fuftain if they fhould be continued in office He declared that he would admit no vote for any of the former tribunes while his colleagues ftrenuoufly infifted that he fhould leave the tribes at liberty to vote as they thought proper or elfe fhould give up his turn of prefiding ro his colleagues who would hold the election according to the laws rather than according to the pleafure of the patri â cians Duilius on finding a conteft thus forced up on him called the con fills to his feat and afked them what was their intention with refpect to the election of confuls To which they anfwered that they intended to appoint new confuls Having thus gained popular fupporters of his unpopular meafure he advanced together with them into the afiembly The confuls being there produced before the peo ple and afked in what manner they would act mould the Roman people out of gratitude for having by their means recovered their liberty and for their me ritorious and fuccefsful fervices in war appoint them a fecond time to the confulfhip declared the fame refolution

the commons were elected the other candidates not being able to make up the reqaifite number of tribes on account of the eagernefs with which the nine tribunes openly pufhed for the office he dif mified the afiembly and did not calt one afterwards for an election He faid that he had fulfilled the law which without any where fpecifying the num ber O F R O M E 325 her of tribunes only enacted

number than ten tribunes xhen the perfons whom thefe fhall aflume as colleagues to them felves fhall be legal tribunes of the commons with the fame privileges as thofe whom ye on that e day made tribunes of the commons Duilius perfevering to the laft and declaring the common wealth could not have fifteen tribunes after baffling the ambition of his colleagues refigned his office with high approbation both from the patricians and the plebeians LXV THE new tribunes of the commons mewed V R 307 in their election of colleagues an inclination to gra B c s tify the patricians They chofe two

444 in fedition by a proclamation for a levy of troops to act againft the quans and Volfcians Giving as a fufficient reafon that while harmony prevailed in the city every thing abroad was alfo in quiet but when ever civil difcord broke out their foreign enemies aflumed new courage This care to preferve peace abroad proved the caufe of domeftic concord But each of the orders always took an improper advan tage of moderation in the other As foon as the commons grew quiet the younger patricians began to infult them When the tribunes attempted to protect the weaker party 3 even at firft they were of little ufe afterwards they themfelves fhared the ill treatment particularly in the laft months becaufe the combinations then formed among the more powerful encouraged them to ufe thofe officers ill and the vigour of every magiftracy generally relaxes fomewhat in the latter part of the year And now the commons began to think that they had nothing to hope from their tribunes unlefs they got fuch as Icilius for thofe whom they had for two years paft were but nominal tribunes On the other fide the elder patricians although they were convinced that the younger part of their body carried their pre fumption too far yet were better pleafed if the bounds of moderation were to be exceeded that their own party mould poffefs a redundancy of fpirit than their adverfaries So difficult

when the war mould be brought to a conclufion they would appoint a time for confidering excufes and he whofe excufe was difapproved of fhould be treated as a deferter All the young men attended on the

Quintius commanded the right wing Agrippa the left the care of the centre they entrufted to Spurius Poftu mius Albus lieutenant general and gave the com mand of the cavalry to another lieutenant general Servius Sulpicius The infantry in the right wing fought with extraordinary valour and met with a ftout refiftanqe from the Volfcians Servius Sulpi cius with the cavalry broke the centre of the

Volfcians and Equans had acquired the glory of fubduing the Sabines the con fuls were afhamed to demand a triumph for fervices â which amounted only to the half of theirs left even if they mould obtain it there might be room to ima gine that the compliment was paid to the perfons rather than to their deferts LXXI THIS honourable victory obtained over their enemies the people difgraced at home by a fcandalous decifion of a difpute concerning the boun daries of their allies The people of Aricia and thofe of Ardea had often difputed in arms the right t of property to a certain diftrict of land and wearied by many lofles on both fides referred the affair to the arbitration of the Roman people Both parties attended to fupport their claims and an afiembly of the people was held by the magiftrates at their re queft here the matter was debated with great ve hemence and after the witneffes had been pro duced when the tribes ought to have been called and the people proceed to give

therefore fpeak with knowledge of rm affair which though after fuch a length of tims it was generally forgotten was deeply fixed in his memory The lands in difpute he faid had be longed to the territory of Corioli and when Co rioli was taken became by the right of war the public property of the Roman people He won dered by what precedent the Ardeans and Ari  cians could juftify their expectations of furrep titioufly wrefting from the Roman ftate by mak ing it an arbiter inftead of proprietor its right to a tract to which while the ftate of Corioli fub fifted they had never

the deputies carry home this ac count Muft this be made known to the world  Muft the allies muft the enemy hear this What grief would it give to the former what joy to the latter Did they imagine that

promifcuous intermarriages than to produce an irregular intercourfe between patricians and ple beians not very different from that between brutes So that one of their offspring fhould not V be able to

farther  than to found people s fentiments in converiation on a plan of one of the confuls being elected from â among the commons now they publicly pro pofed a law that the people might appoint con

parts they would rather die a thou c fand deaths than fuffer fuch difgracc to be incur  red They were confident that could their an ceftors have forefeen that in confequence of their unlimited conceffions the commons inftead of  coming to better temper towards them would become more intractable and as faftas they ob tained their demands advancing others more un reafonable and exorbitant they would have ftrug gled at firft with any difficulties whatever rather than have allowed fuch terms to be impofed on  them Becaufe a conceffion was at that time  made to them with refpect to tribunes it was for â that reafon made a fecond time This would be â the cafe for ever Tribunes of the commons and a fenate could not fubfift together in the fame ftate either the office of the former

betray his country that he  would fuffer it to be attacked and to fall into the  enemy s hands What courage muft that decla ration afford not to the Roman commons but  to the Volfcians to the Equans and Veientians  Might not thefe hope that under the guidance of Canuleius they would be able to fcale the Capi tol and the citadel if the tribunes while they ftripped the patricians of their

It is well known that fince the expulfion of the kings we admitted the Claudian family from among the  Sabines not only into the number of citizens but 1 â â  The records in which the names of the

every meafure not â â heretofore practifed and in a new ftate there muft â be many meafures not yet introduced into prac tice be therefore rejected even though it fhould be evidently advantageous In

are anxious to prevent our being united to them â c by any affinity or confanguinity j to prevent our blood from being mingled with theirs What If c this would be a ftain on that nobility of yours which the greater number of you the progeny of Albans and Sabines pofiefs not in right of birth or of blood but of cooptation into the body of c the patricians having been clected either by the kings

enter into a marriage contracl But it is the prohibition of it by a law the inter marriage of patricians and plebeians being inter dicted this is what the commons muft confider as an infult For why do ye not procure a law to be  pafled that the rich fhall not intermarry with the poor THE HISTORY BOOKÂ poor A matter which in all countries has been  J I left to the regulation of people s own prudence Y R 310 that each woman fhould marry into whatever fa B c 441 ct mily fhe has been betrothed to and each man take a wife from whatever family he had con tracked with this ye fhackle with the

fue mould a patrician marry a plebeian woman or  a plebeian a patrician woman  What alteration is thereby made in the rights of any perfon Surely  the children follow the condition of the father  So that neither have we any advantage in view from intermarriage with you except that of being confidered on the footing of human beings and of fellow citizens nor is there any reafon why  ye mould conteft the point unlefs ye feel pleafurc  in labouring to fubject us to fcorn and infult V In fine let me afk you whether is the fu c preme power vefted in the Roman people or in you Was the expulfion of the kings intended to  procure abfolute dominion to you or equal free dom to all Is itt fitting that the Roman peo ple mould have the power of enacting fuch laws  as they choofe or whenever any matter of the kind has been propofed to their confideration fhall ye by way of punifhment pafs a decree for a levy of troops And as foon as in capacity of tribune I fhall begin to call the tribes to give their fuffrages will you ifi the office of conful compel the younger citizens to take the military oath and lead them out to camp Will you me nace OF ROME 349  nace the commons Will

out of regard to our interefts l that ye did not proceed to force or was the avoiding of extremities owing to this that the  e party which pofiefied the greater mare of ftrengthj  pofiefled alfo a greater degree of moderation  Nor Romans will there now be occafion for force Thofe men will on every occafion make trial of your fpirit your ftrength they will never try Wherefore confuls to thofe wars whether real or fictitious the commons are ready to at tend you provided that by reftoring the right of intermarriage ye at length unite the ftate into one body provided they are allowed to coalefce to be united and intermixed with you by the con nections of private relationfhip provided hopes are allowed and the accefs to honours laid open to men of induftry and fpirit provided they are allowed to Hand on the footing of partners and af fociates in the commonwealth and what is the natural refult of equal freedom in the rotation of annual magiftracies to obey and to command in turn If any fiiall obftruft thefe meafures ha  rangue about wars and multiply them by reports not a man will give in his name not a man will take arms not a man will fight for haughty mafters by whom he is excluded as an alien both from the participation of public honours and the private connections of mar riage j VI THE confuls too came out into the aflcmbly and after a long feries of harangues on the fubject an altercation arifing and the tribune afking  for what reafon was it improper that a plebeian mould be made conful one of them anlwered though perhaps 350 THE HISTORY  BOOK perhaps with truth yet unluckily with regard to 1V the prefent difpute Becaufe no plebeian had the power of talcing the aufpices and for that rea Ion the decemvirs had prohibited intermarriage left from the uncertainty of men s defcent the aufpices might be vitiated This above all kindled the indignation of the commons into a flame when they heard it affirmed that they were not qua lified to take aufpices as if they were objects of the averfion of the immortal gods Nor did the conteft ceafe the commons being headed by a tribune of undaunted refolution and they themfelves vying with him in fteadinefs of perfeverance until the fe nate were at length overpowered and gave their confent to the pafling of the law concerning inter marriage judging that the tribunes might moft probably be thereby induced either to lay afide in tirely or to defer until the end of the war the ftrug gle for plebeian confuls and that in the mean time the commons fatisfied with having obtained the right of intermarriage would be ready to enlift On the other hand the high degree of credit which Canuleius had attained by his victory over the fc nate and the favour of the commons proved a ftrong incentive to the other tribunes to exert their utmoft efforts in fupportof the law which they had propofedj and whilft the accounts of the enemy s proceedings grew every day more alarming they obftructed the enlifting of troops The confuls finding that by the continual protefts of the tri bunes every proceeding of the fenate was rendered abortive held confultations at their houfes with the principal patricians Here they faw their dilemma they muft be vanquifhed either by their enemies or by their countrymen The only confulars who were prefent at their deliberations were Valerius and Ho ratius Caius Claudius gave his opinion that the confuls mould proceed againft the tribunes by force of arms The Quintii both Cincinnatus and CapU 4 tolinus OF ROME 351 tolinus declared themfelves averfe to the fhedding B O O K of blood and offering violence to thofe officers  _w _f whom by the treaty concluded with the commons Y R 3 o they had acknowledged as facred and inviolable B c The refult of thefe consultations was that they fhould allow military tribunes with confular power to be elected out of the patricians and plebeians without diftinction and that with refpect to the election of confuls no change mould be made and with this the tribunes were fatisfied and the commons alfo An afiembly was now proclaimed for the election of three tribunes with confular power and as foon as this proclamation was ifllied immediately every one who had either by word or deed been a promoter of the fedition particularly thofe who had held the office of tribune began to folicit votes and to buftle through the Forum as candidates fo that the patri cians were deterred at firft by defpair of attaining that dignity while the minds of the commons were in fuch a ferment and afterwards by the indigna tion which they felt at the thoughts of holding the office in conjunction with fuch colleagues At laft however overcome by the preffing inftances of the leading patricians fome of them declared themfelves candidates left they might feem to have voluntarily furrendered the adminiftration of public affairs The iflue of that election afforded a proof that men s fen timents during the heat of a conteft for liberty and dignity are very different from thofe which they feel after the conteft has been ended and when the judgment is unbiafied For the people fatisfied with the admiffion of the right of the plebeians to ftand candidates elected every one of the tribunes from among the patricians Never was there found even in a fingle individual fuch moderation difin tereftednefs and elevation of mind as was dif played on that occafion by the whole body of the people VII IN THE HIS fOUY  I v thfe year three hundred and ten from the foundation 6f the city of Rome for the firft time military tribunes irt the room of confute entered into qffice tliefe Were Aulus Sempronius Atratinus Lucius Acilius and Titus Ga eilius ami during their ct ntinuan c in office concord prevailing at home produced likewife peace abroad There are fome writers who without mentioning ifhfe prOpofal of the law concerning the election of plebeian confuls affirm that on account of a war breaking out with the Veientians in addition to thofe with the quans and Volfcians and the revolt of the Ardearts two confuls being unequal to the tafk of conducting fo many wars at once three military tribunes were cre ated and invefted both with the authority and the badges of confuls However the eftablifhment of this office did not at that time remain on a perma nent footing for in the third month after their com mencement they refigned their dignity in purfu ance of a decree of the augurs alleging a defect in their election becaufe Caius Curtius who had pre fided on that occafion had not performed the requi fite ceremonies in pitching on the ground for his tenr Ambafladors came from Rome to Ardea complaining of the injuftice done to them and at die fame time profeffing an intention of remaining in amity and adhering to the treaty provided that by the rcftoration of their lands that injuftice were rc drefled The fenate anfwered that  they could not refcind the fentence of the people were there no other reafon than the prelervation of concord between the orders in the ftate but befides fuch a meafare was not juftified either by law or pre cedent If the Ardeans would be content to wait  until they could find a feaibnable conjuncture and leave it entirely to the fenate to find a remedy for the injury offered them they fhould have reafon afterwards to rejoice for having moderated their refentment and ihould be convinced that the  fenate OF ROME  353 ct fenate had ever been fincerely difpoled to preventB 0 O K C any injury being offered to them and were not __ j lefs fo now to prevent the continuance of the Y R 3n one which had been done On which the am B c 4 1 bafladors declaring that they would take the fenfe of their countrymen anew before they formed any re folution they were difmified with exprefilons of friendfhip The commonwealth being now without any curule magiftrate the patricians affembled and created an interrex and the interregnum was pro longed for a great many days by a contention whe ther confuls or military tribunes mould be appointed The interrex and the fenate warmly promoted the election of confuls the plebeian tribunes and the commons the election of military tribunes The patricians at length prevailed for the commons who had no intention of conferring either the one office or the other on any but patricians defifted from their fruitlefs oppofition and befides the leaders of the commons were better pleafed with an election where they were not to appear as candidates than with one where they would be pafied over as unwor thy The plebeian tribunes wifhed alfo to pafs as a compliment to the principal patricians their declining   to prefs the difpute to a dÂ cifion Titus Quintius Barbatus the interrex elected confuls Lucius Papi rius Mugilanus and Lucius Sempronius Atratinus In their confulate the treaty with the Ardeans was renewed and this ferves as a record to prove that there were thofe confuls in that year though they are not to be found either in the old annals or in the books of the magiftrates I fuppofe that becaufe in the beginning of the year there were military tri bunes that therefore though thefe confuls were after wards fubftituted in their room yet the names of the confuls were omitted as if the others had continued in office through the whole of the year Licinius Macer affirms that they were found both in the Ar dean treaty and in the linen books in the temple of VOL i A A Moneta JS4 THE HISTORY BOOK Moneta Tranquillity prevailed not only at home L_ _L_ but abroad notwithftanding fo many alarms given by the neighbouring ftates Y R 311 VIII WHETHER this year had tribunes only or confuls fubftituted in their room the fucceeding year undoubtedly had confuls Marcus Geganius Macert nus a fecond time and Titus Quintals Capitolinus a fifth time being invefted with that honour This fame year produced the firft inftitution of the cenfor fbip an office which fprung from an ineonfiderable origin but grew up afterwards to fuch a height of importance that it became pofieffed of the entire regulation of the morals and difcipline of the Ro man people The fenate the centuries of the knights and the diftribution of honour and ignomi ny were all under the fupreme jurifdiction of thefe magiftrates The difcrimination of public from pri  vate property in lands or houfes and the entire re venue bf the Roman people were finally adjufted by their fovereign decifion What gave rife to the in ftitution was that as the people had not for many years paft undergone a furvey the cenfus could neither be longer deferred nor could the confuls find Icifure to perform it while they were threatened with war by fo many different ftates An obfcrvation was made in the fenate that a bufinefs fo laborious and ill fuited to the office of conful would require officers to be appointed for that particular purpofe to whole management fhould be committed the bufi nefs of the public fecretaries the fuperintendance and cuftody of the records and the adjuftment of the form of proceeding in the cenfus This propo fal though deemed of little confequence yet as it tended to increafe the number of patrician magiftrates in the commonwealth the fenate on their part re ceived with great pleafure forefeeing alfo I fup pofe what really happened that the influence of thofe who fhould be raifed to that poft wpuld derive additional OF ROME additional authority and dignity on the office Itfelf B O O And on the other fide the tribunes looking on the i 1 employment rather as neceflary which was the cafe Y R 31 at the time than as attended with any extraordinary B c  luftre did not choofe to oppofe it left they fhould feem through perverfenefs to carry on their oppo fition even in trifles The leading men in the ftate hewing a diflike of the office the people by their fuffrages conferred the employment of performing the cenfus on Papirius and Sempronius the perfons whofe confulate is doubted in order to recompencc them by that office for having enjoyed the conful fhip only for a part of the ufual period From the bufinefs of their office they were called Cenfors IX DURING thefe tranfactions at Rome ambaf fadors came from Ardea imploring in regard of the alliance fubfifting between them from the earlieft times and of the treaty lately renewed relief for their city now on the brink of ruin For the peace with Rome which they had by the foundef t policy preferved they were prevented from enjoying by in leftine war the caufe and origin of which is faid to have arifen from a ftruggle between factions which have proved and will ever continue to prove a more deadly caufe of downfall to moft ftates than either i foreign wars or famine or peftilence or any other of thofe evils which men are apt to confider as the fe vereft of public calamities and the effects of the di vine vengeance Two ydung men courted a maiden of a plebeian family highly diftinguifaed for beauty one of them on a level with the maid in point of birth and favoured by her guardians who were them felves of the fame rank the other of noble birth captivated merely by her beauty The pretenfions of the latter were fupported by the intereft of the nobles which proved the means of introducing party difputes into the damfel s family for the nobleman s wifhes were feconded by her mother who was am A

having heard the claims of the mother and of the guardians de creed that fhe mould marry according to the direc tion of her parent but this was prevented by vio lence for the guardians after haranguing openly in the Forum among people of their own faction on the iniquity of the decree collected a party in arms and forcibly carried off the maiden from her mother s houfe the nobles more highly incenfed againft them than ever united in a body and in military ar ray followed their young friend who was rendered furious by this outrage A defperate battle was fought in which the commons were worfted and being incapable of imitating in any particular the commons of Rome they marched out of the city in arms feized on a neighbouring hill and from thence made excurfions with fire and fword on the lands of the nobles Even the city itfelf which had hitherto efcaped the effects of their difpute they pre â pared to befiege having by the hopes of plunder allured a great number of the artizans to come out and join them nor is there any mocking form or calamity of war which was not experienced on the occafion as if the whole Hate were infected with the mad rage of two youths who fought the accomplifh ment of that fatal match through the means of their country s ruin Both parties thinking that they had not enough of hoftilities and fighting among them felves the nobles called upon the Romans to relieve their city from a fiege j the commons the Volfcians to join them in the ftorming of Ardea The Vol fcians under the command of Cluilius an JEquan  arrived firft at Ardea and

with the conful and told him that if the in tention of the Romans in coming thither was to raife the fiege he was willing to withdraw the troops of the Volfcians from the place To this the conful

under the yoke each with a fingle garment loaded with igno miny and fufterings and having afterwards halted near the city of Tufculum the inhabitants of that city out of the inveterate hatred which they bore them attacked them unprepared and unarmed as they were and executed fevere vengeance on them fcarce leaving a fufficient number to carry home the news of their deftru ion The Roman general

Thefe were the expref fions made ufe of in the tables exhibited to public view in order to conceal from the tribunes and com mons the defign which they had formed of refcinding the fentence But they had agreed among them felves to enrol for the colony a much greater num ber of Rutulians than of Romans and then that no other land mould be diftributed but that which had been fraudulently obtained

returned B C 439 to the Ardeans The commiflioncrs appointed to con duct the colony to Ardea were Agrippa Menenius Titus Cbelius Siculus and Marcus Ebutius Elva â who in the execution of their very unpopular em ployment having given offence to the commons by afligning to the allies that land which the Roman people had by their fentence pronounced to be their own and not being much favoured even by the principal patricians becaufe they had fhewn no de ference to the influence of any of them were by the tribunes cited before the people to anfwer a charge of mifconduct but they evaded all vexatious at tacks by enrolling themfelves as fettlers and re maining in that colony which would ever bear tefti mony to their juftice and integrity Y R 3 XII TRANQUILLITY continued at home and 3  abroad during both this and the following year in which Caius Furius Pacilus and Marcus Papilius Craflus were confuls The games vowed by the de cemvirs in purfuance of a decree of the fenate on occafion of the feceflion of the commons from the patricians were this year performed An occafjon of fedition was fought in vain by Petilius who though he was elected tribune of the commons a fecond time merely out of people s reliance on the ftrength of his declarations that he would effec fc thofe very purpofes yet he was neither able to carry the point that the confuls fhould propofe to the fenate a diftribution of lands to be made to the commons nor when after a great ftruggle he had prevailed fo far as that the fenate mould be conlulted whether it was their pleafure that confuis mould

year wherein B c Â 7 Proculus Geganius Macerinus and Lucius Menenius Lanatus were confuls a year remarkable for a vari ety of dangers and difafters j for feditions for fa mine and for the people having almoft bowed their necks to the yoke of arbitrary government feduced by allurements of largefies One calamity they were exempt from foreign war had this aggravation been added to their condition the aid of all the gods could fcarcely have preferved them Their misfor tunes began with a famine whether owing to the leafon being unfavourable to the productions of the earth or the culture of the ground being neglected while the people were captivated by the pleafures of the city and the aflemblies for both caufes are men tioned The patricians laid the blame on the idle nefs of the commons the tribunes fometimes on the evil defigns fometimes on the negligence of the confuls At length the plebeians prevailed the fe nate giving no oppofition that Lucius Minucius mould be created prefident of the market who proved in the courfe of that employment more fuc cefsful in guarding the public liberty than in the im mediate bufmefs of his own department Although in the end he obtained both the honour of having re lieved the fcarcity of provifions and alfo the gratitude of the public for that important fervice finding no effectual relief to the markets from feveral embaffies which he fcnt by land and fea to all the neighbour ing nations to no purpofe except that fome corn was brought in no great quantity from Etruria he had recourfe to the expedient of dealing out in mares the fcanty flock of provifions and at the fame time compelled people to difcover their ftores of corn and to fell whatever they had beyond a month s al lowance he robbed the flaves of

heads and threw themfelves into the Tiber XIII WHILE things were in this fituation Spuri us Maelius a man of equeftrian rank and poflcflVd of extraordinary wealth for thofe times engaged in a plan which though ufcful for the preftnt was per nicious in its tendency and was in fact fuggefted by defigns ftill more pernicious for having by means of his connexions and dependents bought in a quantity of corn from Etruria which very proceeding I fuppofe obftructed the endeavours of the magiftrates to lower the price of provifions he began the prac tice of beftowing largefies of corn and having gained the hearts of the commons by this munifi cence became now the object of general attention afluming thence a degree of conlequence beyond what belonged to a private citizen wherever he went he drew them after him in crowds and they by the favour which they exprefied towards him encouraged him to hope for the confulfhip with a certain profpect of fuccefs As men s defires are never fatiated

Should require for there is nothing certain on this head only that his name as prefident was entered in the linen books among the other magiftrates for both years This Minucius tranfacting in a public

before them rather longer than was confiftent with fafety left he might offer any information  which was ill grounded or uncertain On hear ing this the principal patricians highly blamed the confuls of the former year for fuffering fuch largefies and fuch meetings of the commons in a private houfe and alfo the new confuls for lying by until the prefident of the market reported to the fenate an affair of fuch importance which it was the duty of a conful both to difcover and to punifli To this Quintius replied that  it was unfair to blame the confuls 364 THEHISTORY BOOK  confuls who being

Lucius Quintius dictator in him would be found a fpirit equal to fo great a power Every one exprefied his approbation Quintius at firft re fufed the office and afked them what they meant by expofing him in the extremity of age to fuch a vio lent conteft On which they all joined in afierting that his aged breaf t was fraught not only with more â wifdom but with more fortitude alfo than was to be

might not at a juncture fo dangerous be the caufe of detriment or difhonour to the commonwealth was appointed dictator by the conful and he then named Caius Servilius Ahala his mafter of the horfe XIV NEXT day after fixing proper guards he went down to the Forum and the whole attention of the commons being turned towards him by the furprife and the novelty of the affair whilft the parti 2ans of Maelius and their leader himfelf perceived that the power of this high authority was aimed againft them and thole who were ignorant of their defigns were at a lofs to difcover what tumult what fudden

and when at length a ferjeant by order of the mafter of the horfe laid hold on him he was refcued by the by ftanders and betook himfelf to flight imploring the protection of the commons of Rome affirming that he was perfecuted by a confpiracy of the patri cians againft him for having aded with kindnefs to ward the commons j and befeeching them to aflift him in this extremity of danger and not to fuffer him to be murdered before their eyes Whilft he exclaimed in this manner Ahala Servilius overtook him and flew him and belmeared with the blood which flowed from his wounds and furrounded by a band of young patricians carried back an account to the dictator that Maelius on being fummoned to attend him had driven back the ferjeant and en deavoured to excite the multitude to violence for Which he had received condign punifhment â I applaud faid the dictator  your meritorious conduct Caius Servilius you have preferved the commonwealth XV HE then ordered the multitude who not knowing what judgment to form of the deed were in violent agitation to be called to an afiembly there he publicly declared that  Maelius had been legally put to death even fuppofing him to have been in nocent of the crime of afpiring at regal power for having refufed to attend the dictator when fummoned by the mafter of the horfe That he had taken his feat in order to have examined into the charge and that

regal tyranny had been punifhed with  confifcations exile and death in that very city Spurius Mcdius had conceived hopes of pofiefling himfelf of regal power And who was this man Although no nobility no honours no merits lay open to any man the way to tyranny yet ftill the Claudii and Caffii when they raifed their views to an unlawful height were elated by confulfhips by decemvirates by honours conferred on themfelves and their anceftors and by the fplendor of their fa milies But Spurius Maelius to whom a plebeian tri bunefhip fhould have been an object rather ofwifh cs than of hope a wealthy corn merchant had con ceived hopes of purchafing the liberty of his coun try men for two pounds of corn and had fuppofed that a people victorious over all their neighbours could be inveigled into flavery by having food thrown to them So that a perfon whofe eleva tion to the rank of fenator the ftate could have hardly digefted they would patiently endure as their king pofieffing the enfigns and the authority of Romulus their founder who had defcended â â from and returned to the gods This muft be 8 deemed O F R O M E 3 s7 â deemed not more criminal than it was monftrous B o o K

his ef fccts fhould be confifcated being contaminated by the intention of making them the price of the li berty of the public  and that therefore he ordered the quaeftors to fell thofe effects and depofit the produce in the public treafury XVI HE then ordered his houfe to be immedi ately rafed and that the vacant fpace mould remain as a monument of the fuppreflion of that abominable enterprize This was called EquimEelium Lucius Minucius was honoured with a prefent of an ox with its horns gilded and a ftatue on the outfide of the gate Trigemina and this with the approbation of the commons for he diftributed among them the corn collected by Mfelius at the rate of an as for each peck In fb me authors 1 find that this Mi nucius had changed fides from the patricians to the commons and that having been chofen by the ple beian tribunes as an eleventh member of their body he quieted the commotion which arole on the death of Maelius But it is hardly credible that the patri cians fuffered the number of tribunes to be augment ed and that the precedent mould have been introduced particularly in favour of a man of patrician rank and that the commons did not afterwards maintain or even attempt to maintain a privilege once conceded to them But what above all evinces the falfehood of that infcription on his ftatue is that a few years before this provifion had been made by a law that the tribunes mould not have power to aflume col leagues in their office Of the college of tribunes Quintus Caecilius Quintus Junius and Sextus Titi nius alone had neither been concerned in the law for

to inquire into the reafons of this change of conduct Some pal liate the guilt of the king alleging that an ambi guous expreffion of his on a fuccefsful throw at dice being mifapprehended by the Fidenatians as an or der for their execution occafioned the death of the ambaffadors but this Teems an incredible tale for it cannot be fuppofed that his thoughts would be fo intently employed upon his game as that he mould be regardlefs of a circumftance of fo much confe quence as the arrival of his new allies the Fidena tians who were come to confult him upon the per petration OF ROME 359 pctration of a murder which would violate all the B o o lc laws of nations or that in fuch an affair he fhould  _ __ feel no compunction It is much more probable Y R 317 that his view was to involve

of B c 4 34 fog hills between Fidena e and the Anio Nor did they defcend into the plains until the legions of the Falifcians came to their aid then indeed the camp of the Etrurians was pitched under the walls of Fi denac The Roman dictator took his poft at a little diftance from thence at the conflux and on the banks of the two rivers drawing lines acrofs from one to the other where the length of

in protracting the war Tolumnius although the advice of his countrymen was more agreeable to his own fenti ments yet fearing left the Falifcians fliould grow weary of a diftant war gave notice that he would fight on the following day The enemy having de clined the fight added to the confidence of the dic tator and the Romans j and on the day following the foldiers openly threatening that they would

diforder in all parts of the field prolonged the conteft XIX THERE was at that time among the Ro man cavalry a military tribune called Aulus Corne lius Coflus remarkable for the extraordinary beauty of his perfon as well as for his fpirit and bodily ftrength and attention to the honour of his family which having defcended to him with a great degree of luftre he conveyed to his pofterity with a large increafe and with additional fplendor perceiving that wherever Tolumnius directed his courfe the troops of Roman cavalry fhrunk from his charge and knowing him by the diftinction of his royal ap parel as he flew through every part of the army he cried out  Is this he who breaks the bands of hu man fociety and violates the laws of nations This victim will I quickly flay provided it is the  will of the gods that any thing fhould remain fa cred on earth and will offer him to the manes of the amb afladors With thefe words he clapped fpurs to his horfe and with his fpear prefented Â B a  tingling 37 THE HISTORY BOOK fingling him out for an antagonift rufhed againft  _ J  him Having unhorfed him with a ftroke and y R 318 preffing him down with his fpear he inftantly fprung B C 434 down himfelf on the ground where as the king at tempted to rife he ftruck him back with the bofs of his fiiield and with repeated thrufts of his fpear pinned him to the earth He then ftripped off the fpoils from the lifelefs body and having cut off the head and carrying it about on the point of his fpear as a trophy of the victory he put the enemy to rout through the difmay which ftruck them on the death of their king Their body of cavalry likewife which alone had kept the victory in fufpenfe was defeated with die reft The dictator purfued clofe on the flying legions and drove them to their camp with great flaughter The greater number of the Fidena tjans through their knowledge of the country made their efcape into the mountains Coflus having crofied the Tiber with the cavalry brought to the city an immenfe booty from the lands of the Veien tians During this battle there was another fight at the Roman camp againft the party which Tolum nius as was mentioned above had lent againft it Fabius yibulanus manning the rampart all round ftood at firft on the defenfivej then when the ene my were earneftly engaged againft the rampart fally ing out with the veterans from the principal gate on the right he made a fudden attack on them which ftruck fuch terror that though the flaughter was lefs they being fewer in number yet the rout was not lefs diforderly than that of their grand army XX CROWNED with fuccefs in every quarter the dictator in purfuance of a decree of the ienate and an order of the people returned into the city in tri umph By far the moft diftinguifhed object in this procefiion was Coflus carrying the fpolia opima grand fpoils of the king whom he had lain while the foldiers chanted their uncouth verfes extolling him O F R O M E 373 him as equal to Romulus With the ufual form of B O O K dedication he prefented and hung up the fpoils in the  _T_L â temple of Jupiter Fcretrius near the fpoils dedi Y R 318 cated by Romulus which were the firft denominated B Ct J41 opima and the only ones then exifting He drew off the people s attention from the chariot of the dic tator to himfelf and enjoyed almoft folely the ho nour of that day s folemnity The dictator by or der of the people depofited in the Capitol as an offering to Jupiter a golden crown of a pound weight at the expence of the public Following all the authors who have written before me I have reprefented Aulus Cornelius Coffus as a military tri bune when he carried the fecond fpolia opima into the temple of Jupiter Feretrius but befides that thofe fpoils only are properly deemed opima which one general has taken from another and we know no general but the perfon under whofe aufpices the war is carried on the infcription itfelf wriften on the fpoils proves againft them and me that Coffus was conful when he took them Having once heard Auguftus Caefar the founder or reftorer of all our temples on entering the temple of Jupiter Feretrius which from a ruin he had rebuilt aver that he him felf had read this infcribed on the linen breaftplate I thought it would be next to facrilege to rob Col fus of fuch a teftimony refperting his fpoils as that of Caefar to whom the temple itfelf owed its being Whether the miflake is chargeable on both the very antient annals and the books of the magiftrates writ ten on linen and depofued in the temple of Moneta and continually cited as authority by Licinius Ma ccr which have Aulus Cornelius Coflus conful with Titus Quintius Penius in the ninth year after this every one may form his own judgment For that fo celebrated a battle could not be transferred to that year there is this farther proof that for three years before and after the conlulmip of Aulus Cornelius there was an almoft entire ccffation from B B 3 war THE HISTORY  K

more than the names of the confuls Coflus indeed is mentioned as military tribune with confular power in the third year be fore his confulate and in the fame year as mafter of the horfe in which poft he fought another remark able battle with cavalry In refpect to this there is  room for conjecture but in my judgment un grounded furmifes may be applied to the fupport of any opinion whatfoever whereas the perfon con cerned in the fight on placing the recent fpoils in the facred repofitory having in a manner before his eyes Jupiter to whom they were contecrated and Ro mulus as witnefies who

and Lucius Papirius Crafius were confuls armies were led into the territories of the Veientians and of the Falifcians numbers of men and cattle were carried oft as fpoil but the enemy did not fhew themfelves nor give any op portunity of fighting However no attempt was made on their towns the people at Rome being at tacked by a peftilential diforder Endeavours were alfo ufed at home to excite difturbances but with out effect by Spurius Marlins a plebeian tribune who imagining that by the popularity of his name  he fhould be able to raifc fome commotion had commenced a profecution againft Minucius and alfo propofcd a law for confifcating the effects of Servilius Ahala alleging that Maelius had been in fidioufly crufiied under falfe charges by Minucius and objecting to Servilius his having put to death a citizen who was under no legal fentence Thefe charges however when canyafied before the peo ple  O F R 0 M E 375 ple were found entitled to as little credit as the pro B o o K

depredations Then the army of the Veien tians being called to their aid for the Falifcians could not be prevailed on either by the calamities of the Romans or the intreaties of their allies to re new

which mould remain as a monument of his dictator Ihip he undertook therefore to limit the cenfor fhip either judging its powers exceflive or difap proving of their duration more than of their extent In purfuance of this defign having fummoned an afiembly of the people he told them that  with regard to foreign affairs and the eftablifhing of fecurity on every fide the immortal gods had taken the

plebeians If the commons were allowed time to breathe from their intreaties mixed with menaces they would come to an election with a due regard to the intereft of their own party and as they had

propofe a law that no perfon mould be allowed on applying for an office to add any white to his gar ment  This may appear at prefent a trivial mat ter fcarcely fit to be ferioufly mentioned yet it

were they kept in fufpenfe with refpect to the danger appre hended from their enemies The Equans and Vol fcians having held a levy of troops under their de voting law which is their moft powerful inftrument for forcing men into the fervice marched a nume rous body of forces from each nation to Algidum where they met and formed feparate camps the generals taking extraordinary pains beyond what had ever been practifed before in fortifying their pofts and exercifing their men which rendered the accounts brought to Rome ftill more alarming The fenate refolved that a dictator fhouki be appointed becaufe though thefe were nations often vanquifhed yet in the prefent revival of hoftilities they had exerted more vigorous efforts than they had ever done before and no fmall number of the Roman youth had been cut off by the ficknefs Above all they were alarmed by the perverfenefs of the confuls the difagreement between themfelves and the op pofition which they gave each other in every mea fure Some writers lay that thefe confuls were de feated in a battle at Algidum and that that was the reafon for appointing a di ator Thus much is certain that though they differed in every thing elfe they perfectly agreed in the one point that of op pofing the will of the fenate and refufing to name a dictator until Quintus Servilius Prifcus a man who had OF R O M E had pafied through the

himfelfthus B 4 41 Tribunes of the commons matters having come  to extremity the fenate appeals to you that in the prefent alarming ftate of public affairs ye  may by the authority vefted in you oblige the confuls to name a dictator This application feemed to the tribunes to afford them a good oppor tunity of extending their power wherefore after retiring together they declared by the authority of their body that  it was their determination that the confuls mould follow the directions of the fc nate and that if they perfifted in their oppofition to the fentiments of that moft illuftrious body they would order them to be carried to prifon The confuls were better pleafed to be overcome by the tribunes than by the fenate at the fame time re monftrating that  the prerogatives of the chief magiftracy were betrayed by the fenators and the confulfhip fubjugated to the tribunitian power If the confuls were liable to be over ruled by a tri bune by virtue of his office in any particular they were liable alfo to be fent to prifon And what greater hardfhip could any private perfon apprehend It fell by lot for even on that point the colleagues could not agree to Titus Quin tius to name the dictator and he named Aulus Pof tumius Tubertus his own father in law a man of remarkable ftrictnefs in command Lucius Julius was by him nominated rnafter of the horfe At the fame time a proclamation was iflued for a vacation from civil bufirtefs and that nothing mould be at tended to in any part of the city but preparations for the war The examination of the cafes of thofe who claimed immunity from fervice was deferred  until the conclufion of the war which induced even thofe whole claims were doubtful to give in their 6 â names 384 THE HISTORY BOOK names The Hernicians and Latines alfo were or i__r _ dered to fend a fupply of forces and they both ex y R 314 erted themfelves with zeal in obedience to the B c 4i dictator s orders s XXVII ALL thefe meafures were executed with the utmoft difpatch and the conful Caius Julius being left to guard the city and Lucius Julius mafter of the horfe to anfwer the fudden exigencies of the war that there fhould be no delay with refpecl to any thing which might be wanted in the camp the dictator repeating the form after the chief pon tiff Aulus Cornelius vowed to celebrate the greac games on the occafion of this fudden war Then dividing his troops with the conful Quintals he be gan his march from the city and quickly came up with the enemy Having obferved that thefe had formed two camps at a little diftance from each other they in like manner encamped feparately at the diftance of about a mile from the enemy the dictator towards Tufculum and the conful towards Lanuvium Thus there were four armies and fo many fortified pofts having in the middle between them a plain of fufficient extent not only for the fkirmifhes of fmall parties but even for drawing up the entire armies on both fides in battle array From the time when the camps were pitched in the neighbourhood of each other there was continual fkirmifhing without inrermiffion the dictator readily allowing his men to compare ftrength and from ex periencing the ifiiie of thefe combats gradually to form a confident expectation of future victory in a general engagement The enemy therefore finding no hopes left of fucceeding in a regular engagement made an attack by night on the camp of the conful hazarding on the chance of the uncertain iflue the final decifion of the difpute Their fhout which they fct up on a fudden roufed from

To Quintus Sulpicrus lieutenant general he gave the charge of the camp to Marcus Fabius lieutenant general he afligned the cavalry with orders that thofe troops which it would be hardly poffible to manage in the confufion of an action by night mould not ftir un til day light Every meafure which any other ge neral however fkilful and active could at fuch a juncture order and execute he ordered and executed with perfect regularity But it was a fingular in ftance of judgment and intrepidity and intitled to more than ordinary praife that hot content with de fenfive plans he difpatched Marcus Geganius with fome chofen cohorts to attack that camp of the enemy from which according to the intelligence of his fcouts they had marched out the greater num ber of troops Falling upon men whofe whole attention was engrofied by the danger of their friends while they were free from any apprehenfion for them felves and had neglected pofting watches or ad vanced guards he made himielf mafter of the camp fooner almoft than the enemy knew that it was at tacked A fignal being then given by fmoke as had been concerted the dictator perceiving it cried out that the enemy s camp was taken and ordered the news to be conveyed to all the troops VOL I cc XXVIII 38 5 THE HISTORY B Q o K XXVIII Bv this time day appeared and every ____V _ thing lay open to view Fabius had already charg Y R 31 ed

his vic torious troops both horfe and foot in the way of all their efforts as they turned themfelves about to the diffonant fhouts and the various fudden aflaults Be ing thus hemmed in on every fide they would to a man have undergone the punifhment due to their infraction of the peace had not Vectius Meffius a Volfcian a man more renowned for his deeds than hisdefcent upbraiding his men as they

and moft forcible of weapons No fooner had he uttered thefe words than he put them in execution and the reft ralling the mout anew and following him made a violent pufh on that part where Poftumius Albus had drawn up his forces in their way and made the conqueror give ground until the dictator came up juft as his men were on the point of retreating Thus the whole weight of the battle was turned

the Roman generals them B c is felves were not unhurt in the fight one of them Poftumius retired from the field having his fkull fractured by the ftroke of a ftone but neither could the dictator be prevailed on by a wound in his fhoulder nor Fabius by having his thigh almoft pinned to his horfe nor the conful by his arm being cut off to withdraw from this perilous conflict XXIX MESSIUS at the head of a band of the braveft youths charged the enemy with fuch impe tuofity that he forced his way through heaps of flaughtered foes to the camp of the Volfcians which was ftill in their pofleffion and the whole body of the army followed the fame route The conful pur fuing their difordered troops to the very rampart nflaulted the camp itfclf and the dictator brought up his forces with the fame purpofe on the other fide There was no lefs bravery fhewn on both fides in this aflault than had been in the battle We are told that the conful even threw a ftandard within the rampart to make the foldiers pufh on with more brifknefs and that the firft irnpreffion was made in recovering that ftandard The dictator on the other Cde having levelled the rampart had now carried the fight into the camp on which the enemy every where began to throw down their arms and fpr render and on giving up themfelves and their camp they were all except the members of their fenate cxpofed to fale Part of the fpoil was reftored to the Latines and Hernicians who claimed it as their property  the reft the dictator fold by auction and having left the conful to command in the camp after making his entry

occafion for the aid of the cavalry and defiring him to fhew then by his behaviour that he ftill bore in mind his fight with their king the magnificent offering which he had made and the refpect which he owed to Ro mulus and Jupiter Feretrius The legions began the conflict with furious impetuofity The Romans inflamed with keen animofity gratified their rancour both with deeds and words upbraiding the Fidena tians with impiety the Veientians as robbers calling them truce breakers polluted with the horrid mur der of ambaffadors ftained with the blood of their own brethren of the colony perfidious allies and daftardly foes XXXIII THEIR very firft onfet had made an im preflion on the enemy when on a fudden the gates of Fidenae flying open a ftrange kind of army lallied forth unknown and unheard of before An immenfe multitude armed with fire all in a blaze with burn ing firebrands as if hurried on by frantic rage rufhed on againft the â enemy This very extraordinary mode of fighting filled the Romans for fome time with terror j on which the dictator who was active ly employed in animating the fight having called up the mafter of the horfe with the cavalry and allb Quintius from the mountains haftened himfelf to the left wing which being terrified by the conflagra tion as it might more properly be called than a battle had retired from the flames and with a loud voice O F R O M E 395 voice called out Will ye fufFer yourfelves to be B O o K driven from your ground and retreat from an un t  armed enemy vanquimed with fmoke like a Y R i9  fwarm of bees Will ye

the honour of the Roman name your own bravery and that of your fathers turn this conflagration on the city of t your enemy and with its own flames demolifh Fidenae which ye could never reclaim by your  kindnefs This is what the blood of your am  bafladors and colonifts and the defolation of your frontiers ought to fuggeft At the command of the dictator the whole line advanced the firebrands which had been thrown were caught up others were wrefted away by force and thus the troops on both fides were armed with fire The mafter of the horfe too on his part introduced among the cavalry a new mode of fighting he ordered his men to take off the bridles from their horfes and he himfelf clap ping fpurs to his own fprung forward before the reft and was carried headlong by his unbridled horfe into the midft of the flames In like manner the other horfes being fpurred on and freed from all re itraint carried their riders with full fpeed againft the enemy The clouds of duft intermixed with the fmoke excluded the light from the eyes both of men and horfes and that appearance which had ftruck terror into the men had no fuch efFect on the horfes The cavalry therefore wherever they penetrated bore down every thing with irrefiftible force A fhout was now heard from a new quarter which having furprifed and attracted the attention of both armies the dictator called out aloud that his lieu tenant general Quintius and his party had attacked the enemy s rear and then raifing the fhout anew advanced on the enemy with redoubled vigour The Etrurians THE HISTORY BOOK Etrurians furrounded and

was blocked up by the new enemy and the horfes freed from the bridles having fpread them felves with their riders over every different part the greateft number of the Veientians fled precipitately to the Tiber Thofe of the Fidenatians who fur vived made toward the city of Fidenae The for mer flying in confirmation fell into the midft of foes and met deftruction They were cut to pieces on the banks of the river fome were forced into the water and fwallowed in the eddies even fuch as were expert at fwimming were weighed down by fatigue by their wounds and the fright out of a great number few reached the oppofite bank The other body proceeded through their camp to the city whither a brifk and unremitted purfuit inftantly brought up the Romans alfo particularly Quintius and thofe who had juft now come down with him from the mountains thefe being the frefheft for ac tion as having come up towards the end of the en gage ment XXXIV THESE entering the gate together with the enemy made their way to the top of the walls and from thence gave a fignal to their friends of the town being taken On feeing which the dictator who had himfelf by this time entered the deferted camp of the enemy encouraging his men who were eager to difperfe themfelves in karch of plunder with hopes of greater booty in the city led them on to the gate j and being admitted within the walls proceeded to the citadel whither he faw the crowds of fugitives hurrying Nor was lefs flaughter made in the city than in the field until throwing down their arms and begging only their lives the enemy furrendcred

the mafter of the horfe to refign his office he immediately refigned his own on the fixteenth day of his holding it giving up the government in a ftate of tranquillity which he had received in a ftate of war and of danger Some annals have re ported that there was alfo a naval engagement with the Veientians at Fidenae a fact equally impractica ble and incredible the river even at prefent being not broad enough for the purpofe and at that time as we learn from old writers confiderably narrower This we can no otherwife account for than by fup pofing that they magnified the importance of a fcuffle which took place perhaps between a few mips in difputing the paffage of the river and thereon grounded thofe empty pretenfions to a na val vicctory XXXV THE enfuing year had military tribunes Y R j o

one for three years to the y Equans although thefe had petitioned for a longer term At home there was no difturbance from feditions The year following though not diftinguifhed either by war abroad or fedition at home was rendered remarkable by the ce lebration of the games which had been vowed on occafion of the war through the fplendid manner in which they were exhibited by the military tribunes and alfo through the extraordinary concourfe of the neighbouring people The tribunes with confular Y R J1T power were Appius Claudius Craffus Spurius Nau B c IU tius HISTORY BOOK tius Rutilus Lucius

perfons vho were the objects of their hatred as to fit down liftlefs in a ftate of endlefs Qavery and not only wanted fpirit to afpire to the recove ry of their hopes of fharing in the confulfhip but even in the election of military tribunes which lay open to both patricians and plebeians they mewed no regard to themfelves or their party They ought therefore to ceafe wondering that no one bufkd himfelf in the fervice of the commons people expended their labour and danger on ob jects from whence honour and emolument might  be expected j and there was nothing which men  would not undertake if for great attempts great rewards were propofed But furely it could nei ther be required nor expected that any tribune fhould rufh blindfold into difputes the danger of which was great the Â fpfÂ nothing in confe quence of which he knew with certainty that the pat icians1 Pgainft whom his efforts were directed would perfecute him with inexpiable rancour and the commons on whole fide he contended would never think themfelves the more obliged to him By great honours men s minds were elevated to greatnefs no plebeian would think meanly of himfclf when he ceafed to be condemned by others The experiment ought at length to be made on one or another whether there were any plebeian capable of fuftaining a high dignity or whether it were next to a miracle and a prodigy that there fhould exiit a man of plebeian extrac tion endowed with fortitude and induftry By the moft O fr R O M E 399 moft vigorous exertions and after a violent ftrug BOOK gle the point had been gained that

country deferves to be re corded Vulturnum a city of the Etrurians now Capua was feized by the Samnites and called Capua from Capys their leader or which is more probable from its champaign grounds The manner in which they made themfelves mafters of it was this they had fome time before when the Etrurians had been greatly harafied in war been admitted to a fhare of this city and its lands thefe new fettlers afterwards taking the opportunity of a feftival attacked and maflacred in the night the old inhabitants heavy with fleep and food After this tranfaction the con fuls whom we have mentioned entered on office on the ides of December by this time not only thofe employed on that bufinefs had reported that the Volfcians were ready to commence hoftilities j but alfo ambafiadors from the Latines and Hernicians had brought information that never at any former time had the Volfcians exerted more diligence and care either in the choice of commanders or the enlifting of troops that it was a common ex preffion among them that they muf t either lay afide for ever all thoughts of war and arms and  fubmit to the yoke or they muft prove themfelves not inferior to their competitors for empire either â in courage perfeverance or military difcipline The intelligence was not without foundation yet the fenate were not affected by tt as might have been expected j and Caius Sempronius to

victorious army againft one which had been _  _ overcome before fo that there was more of the Â 11 331 Roman difcipline in the Volfcian army than in the B C 410 Roman Succefs therefore as on many other occa fions attended merit in the firft engagement which was entered on by Sempronius without either pru dence or caution the action was begun without Itengthening the line by a referve and without poft ing the cavalry in a proper fituation the fhout gave a prefage at the very beginning to which fide fuccels would incline That raifed by the enemy was loud and full whilft the moiit of the

recent difpleafure of the people towards the conful Sempronius afforded a fit opportunity for reviving the anger of the pub lic againft them having therefore convened the people they exclaimed loudly that the common wealth had been betrayed by its commanders at Veii and afterwards in confequence of their efcaping with impunity the army was betrayed by the conful in the country of the Volfcians the cavalry men of diftinguifhed bravery given up to flaughter and the camp Ihamefully delcrted Then Caius Junius one of the tribunes ordered Tempanius the horfernan to be called and in their prefence

therefore that they would not require from him a detail of the de figns and duties becoming the office of a general or of a conful matters which even from perfons of the moft exalted capacity and

the Roman people  for fortune and the night had caufed abundance of miftakes both on one fide and the other He then begged that they would not detain him as he was much diftrelTed with fatigue and

whither â waggons and other carriages were fent from the city and took up the men who were fpent with the fatigue of the action and the march by night The conful foon after entered the city and was

tended to expel the pa  tricians from the public lands the pofieflion of which they had unjuftly acquired But as matters were managed the ill treatment fhewn them in this very inftance was an additional fource of vexation as the nobility not only perfifted with obftinacy to re tain pofielTion of thofe public lands which they held by force but even refufed to diftribute to the com mons tfye vacant lands lately taken from the enemy which would like the reft in a fhort time become the prey of a few This year the legions were led out by the conful Furius againft the Volfcians who were ravaging the country of the Hernicians and not finding the enemy there they proceeded to and took Fererutnum whither a great multitude of the Volfcians had retreated The quantity of the fpojl was lefs

of the ftate fo that not finding more than one fenator for each embaffy they were obliged to join two knights to each of them Except from the ficknefs and the fcarcity there happened no thing during

protracted to a great length by wrangling difputes the confuls appealing to gods and men that whatever lofies or difgrace had already been or was likely to be fuffered from the enemy the blame of all was to be imputed to Mae nius who hindered the levies Maenius on the other hand exclaiming that if the unjuft occupiers would refign the pofieflion of the public lands he would give no delay to the

Coflus and Lucius Furius Medullinus a fecond B C 406 time The commons were never more highly dif pleafed at not being allowed to elect tribunes Ac the election of quaeftors they both difcovered this

the people would at leaft in the election of qusftors the only one which the fenate had left open to both patrici ans and plebeians fhew a proper degree of fpirit for the accomplifhtnent of what they

confuls began to levy troops the tribunes exerted themfelves ftrenuoufly to hinder them affirming that this was an advantageous op portunity prefented by fortune to them and to the commons There were three of them all men of the moft active talents and of a family of diftinc tion among the plebeians Two of thefe chofe each a conful whofe motions he was to watch with unre mitting afliduity the

they wifhed After fome time for tune inclining to the fide of the commons exprefies arrived that the Equans had attacked the citadel of Carventa while the folciers of the garrifon were draggling abroad in fearch of plunder and had put to death the few who were left to guard it that fe veral were flain as they were haftily returning to the citadel and others while they were difperfed through the country This incident while it prejudiced the ftate added force to the project of the tribunes For though aflailed by every argument to induce them to defift at leaft in the prefent fituation of

pointing undoubtedly at the Icilii whom they accufed of aiming at the confular tribune fliip as a reward for their feditious condudt in the plebeian After this the levy and other preparations for war went forward with the general concurrence of all ranks The diverfity of the accounts given by writers renders it uncertain whether both confuls inarched to the citadel of Carventa or whether one remained at home to hold the elections but thofe facts in which they do not difagree we may receive as certain that after having carried on the attack for a long time without effect the army retired from the citadel of Carventa that by the fame ar my Verrugo in the country of the Volfcians was retaken great devaftation made and immenfe booty captured in the territories both of the Equans and

for contrary to the ex pectation of all three patricians were chofen mili tary tribunes with confular power Caius Julius lulus Publius Cornelius Coffus and Caius Servi lius Ahala It is faid that an artifice was practifed by the patricians on the occafion and the Icilii charged them with it at the time that by inter mixing a number of unworthy candidates with the deferving they turned away the people s thoughts from the plebeian candidates through the difguft excited by the remarkable mcanneft of fome of the number O F R O M E 431 number Information was now received that the Vol BOOK fcians

and the garrifon of Verrugo to be overpowered That now not on ly armed troops but colonies alfo were fent into their territories and that the Romans not only kept pofieffion of their property and diftributed it among themfelves but even made a prefent to the Hernici ans of Terentinum a diftrict of which they had been ftripped People s minds being inflamed by thefc reprefentations wherever they came great numbers of the young men were enlifted Thus the youth of all the feveral nations were drawn together to Antium and there pitching their camp they waited for the enemy Thefe violent proceedings being reported at Rome and exaggerated beyond the truth the fenate inftandy ordered a dictator to be nomi nated their ultimate refource in all perilous con junctures We are told that this meafure gave great offence to Julius and Cornelius and was not accom plifiied without a great deal of ill temper The principal patricians after many fruitlefs complaints againft the military tribunes for refufing to be di rected by the fenate at laft went fo far as to ap peal to the tribunes of the commons reprefenting that compullbry meafures had been ufed by that bo dy even to conluls in a

were under no reftraint of reverence to the laws and magiftrates might by themfelves manage the tribunitian office along with the reft LVII THIS contention at a moft unfeafonable time when they had on their hands a war of fuch importance occupied every one s thoughts until at length after Julius and Cornelius had for a long time defcanted by turns on the injuftice done them in matching out of their hands the honourable em ployment intrufted to them by the people when they were furliciently qualified to conduct the war Servilius Ahala one of the military tribunes faid that  he had kept filence fo long not becaufe he was in doubt what part he ought to take j for what good citizen would confider his own emolument as diftinct from that of the public  but becaufe he wifhed that his colleagues would of their own accord yield to the authority of the fenate rather than let fupplications be made to the college of tribunes for fupport againft them That not withftanding what had pafied if the fituation of affairs would allow it he would ftill give them  time to recede from an opinion too obftinately 1 maintained But as the exigencies of war would not wait on the counfels of men he would

Cornelius to Eccetra and wherever they came they made ex tenfive depredations both on the lands and houfes in order to divide the forces of the Volfcians Fabius marched without any plundering to

would never endure that others fhould fervc on better terms than they themfelves had done  and that they fhouM bear the expence both of then own fervice and of the fervice of others Thefe arguments had an effect on great numbers of the commons At laft on the publication of the decree for levying the tax the tribunes went fo far as on their part to give public notice that they would fup port any

The fenate now fcarce fet any bounds to the torrent of joy which flowed in upon them for they did not as in the cafe of the horfemen pafs an order for thanks to be conveyed by the magiftrates neither

fequence of which was that the guards at the gates were fuddenly overpowered and the place taken by furprize The number of foldiers flain was the lefs becaufe except the fick they were all employed

folici tude for the Roman commanders mewed aftronger difpofition to quarrel among themfelves than to act with fpirit againft the enemy And befides the power of their adverfaries received an addition by the unexpected arrival of the Capenatians and Falifcians Thefe two ftates of Etruria contiguous in fuuation to Veii judged that fhould that city be conquered they fhould be the next expofed to the attacks of the Romans The Falifcians were farther induced by a reafon particularly affecting them felves to enter into the quarrel as having formerly piade themfelves a party in the war of the Fidena c c 4 tians THE HISTORY B o o K tians wherefore after having by reciprocal em   _i baffles ratified their engagements with an oath they Y R 353 advanced with their forces to Veii at a moment B C 399 W

Etruria had been fet in motion and had come out in a mafs againft them The fame opinion roufed to action the Veientians in the city Thus the camp was attacked on both fides and the troops in oppofing the attempts of the enemy be ing obliged to wheel round their battalions from one fide to another could neither effectually confine the Veientians within their fortifications nor repel the afiauh from their own works and defend themfelves sgair ft the enemy on the outer fide Their only hope was that they might be reinforced _from the greater camp and then the feveral different legions would fupport the different parts of the fight Tome cgainft the Capenatians and Falifcians others againft the fallies from the town But that camp was com manded by Virginius between whom and Sergius fubfifted a mutual perfonal hatred on being inform ed that moft of the forts were attacked the fortifi cations fcaled and that the enemy poured in on both fides he kept his men within his own camp under arms faying that if there were need of a reinforce ment his colleague would fend to him His arro gance was equalled by the obftinacy of the other who fooner than he fhould appear to have afked any affifb n

long time at laft abandoning the works a very fVnall part of them made their way to the prin cipal camp the greater number with Sergius him â felfj proceeded to Rome here as he threw the  entire O F R O M E 457 entire blame on his colleague it was determined BOOK that Virginius fhould be called home from the camp  __Y J and that in the mean time the lieutenant generals Y R 353 fhould hold the

the commonwealth each adhered to one or the other juft as he happened to be prejudiced by private regard or intereft IX THE principal fenators were of opinion that whether the mifconduct or the misfortune of the commanders had been the caufe of fuch an ig nominious overthrow they ought not to wait for the regular time of ele6Hon but to create immedi ately new military tribunes who fhould enter into office on the calends of October While the mem bers were proceeding to fhew their afient to this opinion the other military tribunes offered no ob jection but Sergius and Virginius to whofe be haviour it was evidently owing that men wifhed to get rid of the magiftrates of that year at firft depre cated the ignominy which would hereby be thrown upon them and afterwards protefted againft the pafling of the decree and declared that they would not retire from office before the ides of December the ufual day for magiftrates entering into office On this the tribunes of the commons who during the general harmony and the profperity of public affairs had unwillingly kept filence at once afluming confidence threatened the military tribunes that unlefs they fubmitted to the direction of the fenate they would order them to be carried to prifon Then Caius Servilius Ahala one of the military tri bunes faid As to your part tribunes of the peo ple and your menaces I alTure you I would

hand either my colleagues fhall act according to the will of the fenate or if they perfift any farther in oppofition I will inftantly nominate a dictator who will compel them to retire from office This difcourfe being received with univerfal appro bation and the fenators rejoicing that another power had been thought of which by its fuperior authority might reduce the magiftrates to order without the terrors of the tribunitian office thofe magiftrates yielded to the univerfal defire of the public and held an election of military tribunes who were to enter into office on the calends of October and before that day they diverted themfelves of the ma giftracy Y R 354 X THIS military tribunate with confular power 39 of Lucius Valerius Potitus a fourth time Marcus Furius Camillus a

operations of war were to be car ried on in many different places at once at Veii and at Capena j atFalerii and among the Volfcians for the recovery of Anxur from the enemy Then at Rome there was great uneafinefs occafioned by the levying of troops and at the fame time by the paying in of the tax There was alfo a ftruggle about the appointment of the plebeian tribunes and befides the trials of two of thofe who had lately been invefted with confular power excited no trifling difturbance The military tribunes applied them felves firft of all to the raifing of troops and not only the younger men were enlUied but the elder citizens OF ROME citizens alfo were compelled to give in their names BOOK to ferve as a garrifon to the city Now in propor L L__ tion as the number of foldiers was augmented fo Y R 3S much the more money became neceflary for their B C ssÂ pay and this was made up by a tax which was very unwillingly paid by thofe who remained at home becaufe as the guard of the city lay upon them they muft alfo perform military duty and give up their labour to the public Thefe circumftances grievous in themfelves were fet forth in more provoking co lours in the feditious harangues of the plebeian tri bunes who infifted that  the eftablifhment of pay to the foldiers was intended for the purpofe of ruining one half of the commons by the fatigues of war and the other half by a tax That one war had now been protracted to the fifth year and was conducted without fuccefs defignedly in or r der that it might afford them the longer employ ment Befides armies had been enlifted at one levy for four different wars and even boys and old  men dragged from their homes That no dif tinction was now made between fummer and win ter left any refpite fhould be allowed to the wretched commons who now as the finiming c ftroke had been made fubjedr to a tax fo that when they mould return with their bodies wafted through toils wounds and even age and find every thing at home in diforder from the long abfence of the owners they mould be obliged out of their ruined property to refund in a manifold proportion to the ftate the money which they had received as pay as if it had been taken up at ufuri ous intereft Between the levy and the tax and men s thoughts being occupied by more important concerns the number of plebeian tribunes could not be filled up on the day of election A violent effort was afterwards made to have patricians aflfumed into the vacant places and that being found impracticable another plan was adopted for the purpofe of weaken â ing 4 Jo T H E

the influence of the patricians XL IT fo happened that this year Caius Tre bonius was a plebeian tribune and he confidered it as a duty incumbent on his name and family to patronize the Trebonian law He therefore com plained loudly that  a meafure which had beenat tempted by fome patricians and in which they were baffled at their firft fetting out had been violently carried by the military tribunes â that â the Trebonian law had been fubverted and ple beian tribunes elected not in conformity to the fuffragc of the people but to the mandate of the patricians And the matter was brought to this iffue that people muft be content to fee the office of plebeian tribune filled either by patricians or by the dependants of patricians â that all the advan tages of the devoting laws were wrefted from rhem and the tribunitian power forcibly trans ferred to other hands And he infifted that this muft have been effected either by fomc fraudulent artifices of the patricians or by the villainy and treachery of his colleagues The public being inflamed with an high degree of refent ment not only againft the patricians but the tri bunes of the people alfo as well thofe who had been elected as thofe who had elected them three of that body Publius Curatius Marcus Metilius and Marcus Minucius greatly alarmed for their own in terefts made an attack on Sergius and Virginius military tribunes of the former year and by a pro fecutiori which they commenced turned off upon them the anger of the commons and the refentment of the public They defired people to  take no tice that fuch as felt themfelves aggrieved by the levy by the tax by long fervice in the army and the OF ROME 461 the diftance of the feat of war fuch as lamented BOOK the lofs fuftained at Veil fuch as had their houfes

the two perfons who were the guilty caufes of them For to Sergius and Virginius were owing they afierted  the caufes of all their misfortunes And that was not more fully evinced by the charge of the profecutor than by the acknowledgment of the defendants who be ing equally confcious of guilt each imputed it to the other Virginius charging Sergius with cow ardice Sergius Virginius with treachery The  abfurdity of whofe conduct was fo incredible that c there was a much higher degree of probability that the whole affair was tranfacted by concert and according to a wicked defign of the whole body of patricians who for the purpofe of protracting the war firft gave the Veientians an opportunity to burn the works and now had delivered up an army to the fword of the enemy and furrendered a Roman camp to the Falifcians The manage  ment of all affairs was directed to one end that the young men mould grow old before Veil and that the tribunes mould be thereby deprived of the power of taking the fenfe of the people either concerning the lands or any other advantages of the commons of having their plans fupported by a numerous attendance of citizens or of making head againft the confpiracy of the patricians That the caufe of the defendants had been already prejudged by the fenate by the Roman people and by their own colleagues For by a decree of the fenate they had been removed from the adminiftration of government j and refufing to refign their office had been conftrained to fub mit by their colleagues who threatened them wi h THEHISTORY BOOK with a dictator and the Roman people had elected _ __  tribunes who were to aflume the government not Y R 354 on the ufual day the ides of December but in B C 598  ftantly on the calends of Oilober becaufe the continuance of thofe men in office was incompati ble with the fafety of the commonwealth Yet c after all this thofe men pre condemned and overwhelmed by fo many decifions againft them prefented themfelves to trial before the people and imagined that they were difcharged and had undergone fufficient punifhment becaufe they had been reduced to the rank of private citizens two months fooner than ordinary never confidering  â  that this was only taking out of their hands the power of doing farther mifchief not inflicting pu nimment their colleagues who were manifeftly c clear of all mare of the blame being deprived of authority as well as themfelves They requefted that the citizens of Rome would refume the fame fen timents which they had felt when the difaftrous event was recent when they beheld the army flying in confternation covered with wounds and filled with difmay j pouring into the gates ac cufing not fortune nor any of the gods but thefe their commanders They were confident that there was not a man prefent in the afiembly who did not on that day utter execrations and curfes againft the perfons the families and for tunes of Lucius Virginius and Marcus Sergius And it would be the higheft inconfiftency if they did not now when it was not only lawful but their duty exert their own power againft thofe on whom each of them had imprecated the ven geance of the gods The gods themfelves

earneft fupplications that they would not render him â more unfortunate at home than he had been in the field The current of popular refentment having been thus turned againft them almoft obliterated the remembrance of the afliimption of tribunes and the fraudulent infraction of the Trebonian law The vic torious tribunes in order that the commons might reap an immediate advantage from the trial pub limed a propofal of an agrarian law and forbade the tax to be paid fince pay was required for fuch a number of armies and the fuccefs of their arms in any of the wars had been no more than fufficed to keep their hopes in fufpenfe For at Veii the camp which had been loft was recovered and ftrengthened with forts and a garrifon Here Mar cus Emilius and Caefo Fabius military tribunes

Camillus from Capena leaving nothing undeftroyed that could be injured either by fword or fire XV IN the meantime many prodigies were re ported to have happened the greater part of which met with little credit and were difregarded partly becaufe the accounts refted on the teftimony of fingle perfons and partly becaufe while they were at war with the Etrurians they could not procure aruf pices to perform the expiations One of them at tracted univerfal attention the lake in the Alban foreft fwelled to an unufual height without any rain or other caufe which could account for the fact â without a miracle Commiflloners were lent to the  oracle at Delphi to inquire what the gods portended by this prodigy but an interpreter of the will of the fates was thrown in their way nearer home a certain aged Vcientian who rmidft the feoffs thrown out by the Roman and Etrurian foldiers from the fuit pofts and guards pronounced in the manner of one delivering a prophefy that  the Roman would â never be mafter of Veii until the water were dif charged from the Alban lake This at firft was difrtgarded as thrown out at random after wards it became the fubject of converfation at kngth one of the Roman foldiers on guard afked a townfman on the neareft poft as from the long con tinuance of the war they had come into the practke of converting with each other who that perfon was â who threw out thofe ambiguous expreflions concern ing the Alban lake and on hearing that he was an arufpex the man whofe mind was not without a tindture of religion pretending that he wifhed to confult him if he could fpare time on the expia tion OF ROME 469 tion of a private portent enticed the prophet to a B O O K conference And when they had proceeded free  _  from any apprehenfions being both without arms Y R 357 to a confiderable diftance from their parties the B C 39S young Roman having the fuperiority in ftrength leized the feeble old man in the view of all and in fpite of the buftle made by the Etrurians carried him off to his own party Being conducted to the ge neral he was lent by him to Rome to the fenate and on their inquiring the meaning of the informa tion which he had given concerning the Alban lake he anfwered that  certainly the gods had been in cenfed againft the Veientian nation on that day when they prompted him to difclofe the decree of the fates which doomed his native country to de ftraction What therefore he had then delivered under the influence of divine infp ration he could not now recall fo as to render it unlaid and perhaps the guilt of impiety might be contracted â in as high a degree by concealing what it was the will of the gods fhould be publiihed as by pub lifhing what ought to be concealed Thus there fore it was denounced in the books of the fates and the Etrurian doctrine that whenfoever the Alban water fhould rife to an unufual height if the Romans fhould then difcharge it in a proper manner victory would be granted them over the â Veientians but until that fhould be done the gods would never abandon the walls of Veii He then gave directions with refpecl to the proper method of draining it but the fenate deeming his authority of but little weight and not to be entirely relied on in a cafe of fuch importance determined to wait for the deputies and the anfwer of the Py thian oracle XVI BEFORE the commiffioners returned from Y R

concern for the lofs fuftain cd by the inroads of the Tarquinians They there fore undertook the bufinefs without either much preparation or long delay Aulus Poftumius and Lucius Julius having collected a body of troops not by a regular levy for in that they were prevented by the tribunes of the commons but moftly volun teers whom by perfualions they had prevailed on to follow them directed their march by crofs roads through the territory of Caere and came upon the Tarquinians unawares as they were returning from their depredations heavily laden with fpoil they flew great numbers of

captive prophet upon this began to be held in very high efteem and the military tribunes Cornelius and Poftumius thenceforward confulted with him concerning the expiauon of the Alban prodigy and the proper method of appeafing the gods It was at length difcovered what was that neglect of ceremonies and omiflion of cuftomary rites for which they were blamed by the gods It was in fact nothing elfe

to let the elections proceed unlefs a previous ftipulation were agreed to that the greater number of the military tribunes mould be chofen out of the commons During thefe tranfactions a general afiembly of Etruria was held at the temple of Voltumna and the Capenatians and Falifcians demanding that all the ftates of Etruria fhould unite unanimouny in the defign of raifing the fiege of Veii the anfwer re turned was that  they had formerly given a re fufal of the fame requeft to the Veientians be caufe thefe ought not to apply for fuccour where in a cafe of fuch confequence they had not

additional forts were erected at fmaller dif tances from each other and by an edict forbidding any to fight without orders the foldiers were taken off from fkirrniming which had hitherto been fre quently practifed between the walls and the rampart of the camp and their labour applied to the works Of all their works the greateft by far and moft la borious was a mine which they undertook to carry into the citadel of the enemy In order that there fhould be no interruption of this work and at the fame time that the fame fee of perfons fhould not by uninterrupted labour under ground be fpent with fatigue he formed the whole number of pioneers into fix divifions and fix hours were allotted for each divifion to work in rotation nor did they ftop either by night or day until they

the perfevering courage of the B c troops Veii would immediately be in the power  of the Roman people and requefted their direc tions with regard to the fpoil Two opinions divided the fenate j one was that of old Publius Li cinius who being the firft called upon by his fon as we are told propofed a refolution that public notice fhould be given to the people by proclama tion that whofoever chofe to mare in the fpoil fhould go to the camp to Veii The other that of Appius Claudius who cenfured fu ch profufion as unprecedented extravagant partial and productive of ill confequences if people fhould once conceive an opinion that it would be criminal to depofit in the treafury when exhaufted by wars the money taken from the enemy and he recommended it to them to make that a fund for the payment of the foldier s wages to the end that the commons might be eafed of part of the tax For  every man s family he faid  would feel its mare of fuch a bounty in equal proportion and the hands of the idle city rabble ever greedy  of rapine would not then fnatch away the prizes due to men who had fhewed their bravery in war â 5 it being generally the cafe that the man who is moft ready on every occafion to undertake the largeft fhare of toil and danger is the leaft active in plundering Licinius on the other hand ar gued that in that cafe the money would be an eter nal caufe of jealoufy and ill humour would afford grounds for invidious reprefentations to the com mons and in confequence for feditions and the enacting of new laws It was therefore more to be dcfired he faid  that the affe ion of the commons might be conciliated by a bounty of that kind that this refource fhould be afforded them after they had been exhaufted and entirely drained T H E II I S T O R Â B OvO K drained by the payment of the tax for fo mart  _ _ years j and that they fhould enjoy the fruits ari i npr y R 359  from a war in which they had employed one C 393 it might faV the better part of their lives That what a man took with his own hand from the ene my and brought home with him would afford  him more fatisfaction and delight than a lhare  many times larger conferred on him by another That the dictator himfelf was aware of the odi um and the difagreeable reflections to which this c bufinefs might fubject him and had for that rea fon transferred the determination of it from him felf to the fenate and that the fenate ought on their part fince the bufinefs had been thus thrown upon them to hand it over to the commons and let every man enjoy what the chance of war fhbuld give him This plan was deemed the fafer as ie promifed to procure popularity to the fenate Ac cordingly proclamation was made that all fuch as chofe might go to the camp to the dictator to Jhare in the plunder of Veii The vaft multitude who went entirely filled the camp XXl THEN the dictator after taking the aii fpices came forth and having previoufly ordered the foldiers to take arms fpoke thus O Pythian Apollo under thy guidance and infpired by thy divinity I am now proceeding to deftroy the city of Veii and I devote to thee the tenth part of the fpoil thereof Thee alfo imperial Juno who now dwelleft in Veii I befeech that when we fhall have  obtained the victory thou wilt accompany us into our city foon to be thine own where a temple fhall receive thee worthy of thy majefty Af ter thefe prayers having more than a lufficientnum ber of men he aflaulted the city on every quarter in order to prevent their perceiving the danger which threatened from the mine The Veientians ignorant that they had been already doomed to ruia by OF ROME 479 by their own prophets and likewife by foreign ora BOOK cles that the gods had been already invited to a   fhare in their fpoil that fome of them liftening to v R 359 the vows by which they had been folicited to forfakc B c 3Â J their city began to look towards the temples of the enemy and new habitations and that this was the laft day of their exiftence fearing nothing lefs than their walls being already undermined and the citadel filled with enemies ran brifkly in arms to the walls wondering what could be the reafon that when for fo many days not one Roman had ftirred from their pofts they mould now run up to the walls with out apprehenfion as if ftruck with a fudden fit of madnefs A fabulous account has been given of an incident happening at this juncture that while the king of the Veientians was offering facrifice the words of the arufpex were heard in the mine de nouncing that whoever mould cut up the entrails of that victim fhould obtain the victory and that this incited the Roman foldiers to burfi open the mine feize the entrails and carry them to the dictator But in matters of fuch remote antiquity I think it enough if relations which carry a refemblance of truth be received as true ftories of this kind better calculated for the extravagant exhibitions of the ftage which delights in the marvellous than for gaining belief it is needlefs either to affirm or refute The mine at this time full of chofen men fuddenly difcharged its armed bands in the temple of Juno which ftood in the citadel of Veii fome of whom at tacked the rear of the enemy on the walls fome tore open the bars of the gates fome let fire to the houfes from the roofs of which ftones and tiles were thrown by the women and flaves Every place was filled with

every quarter After great flaughter Y R 359 had been made the ardour of the combatants at B C 393 length began to abate and the dictator proclaiming orders by the heralds that no injury fhould be done to the unarmed put an end to the effufion of blood The townfmen then began to lay down their arms and furrender and the foldiers with permifiion of the dictator difperfed in fearch of booty When the fpoil was collected before his eyes far exceeding both in quantity and in the value of the effects all his calculations and hopes the dictator is faid to have raifed his hands towards heaven and prayed that if any gods or men looked on his fuccefs and that of the Roman people as exceffive fuch jea loufy might be appeafed by fome calamity pecu liar to himfelf alone rather than by the flighteft detriment to the Roman people It is recorded that as he turned himfelf about during this addrefs to the gods he ftumbled and fell and this was con fidered afterwards by fuch as judged of the matter by the events which followed to be an omen portending Camillus s own condemnation and the difafter of the city of Rome being taken which happened a few years after The lubduing of the enemy and the plundering of this very opulent city employed that whole day XXII NEXT day the dictator fold the inhabitants of free condition by auction the money arifing from the fale was all that was applied to

had laid the affair before the fenate and the father firft propofed the 13  popular OF ROME 481 popular refolution When the wealth belonging to B o o K the inhabitants had been carried away from Veii  _ they then began to remove the treafures of the gods Y R 359 and the gods themfelves but with the demeanour of B Ct 3 J worfhippers rather than of ravifhers for certain young men felected out of the

a colony mould be fent off to the country of the Volfcians for which three thoufand Roman citizens fhould be enrolled and the triumvirs appointed to conduct it diftributed three 112 acres 484 THEHISTORY BOOK acres and feven twelfths to each man This dona _J_yl __ tion now began to be looked on with fcorn becaufe Y R 360 they confidered the offer as intended to pacify them B C 391 on the difappointment of higher expectations for why faid they  fhould the commons be fent into exile among the Volfcians when the beauti ful city of Veii lay within view and the territory belonging to it more fertile and more extenfivc than the territory of Rome The city too they extolled as preferable even to the city of Rome both in point of fituation and the magnificerrce of its edifices and inclofures both public and private Nay they went fo far as to propofe the fcheme which after the taking of Rome by the Gauls was more generally adopted of removing to Veii But their plan now was that half of the commons and half of the fenate fhould fix their habitations at Veii and thus two cities compofing one commonwealth might be inhabited by the Roman people The nobles oppofed thefe meafures with fuch warmth as to de clare that they would fooner die in the fight of the Roman people than any of thofe matters mould be put to the vote for  when one city at prefent fupplied fuch abundance of diffenfions what would  be the cafe with two Was it poflTible that any one could prefer a vanquifhed to a victorious city and let Veii after being captured enjoy a greater degree of profperity than ever it had in its moft flourifhing days In fhort they might be forfaken in their native country by their fellow citizens but no force fhould ever compel them to forfake their native country and fellow citizens and to follow Titus Sicinius for he was the plebeian tribune who had brought forward the propofition as a founder to Veii abandoning the divine Ro  mulus the fon of a god the parent and founder of the city of Rome And thefe difputes pro ceeded to a fhameful height for the patricians had drawn over half of the plebeian tribunes to their fen time nts j O F R O M E 485 timents j fo

throwing themfelves B Ci 391 foremeft in the way of the crowd defired that they might be the perfons attacked ftruck and put to death and the populace not only abftained from offering violence to their age their dignity and honourable characters but refpect for them re ftrained their rage even from any fuch attempts on others XXV CAMILLUS on every occafion and in every place publicly afierted that  there was nothing furprizing in all thefe commotions that the ftate was actually gone mad j for though it was bound by avow yet it beftowed more concern on every other kind of bufinefs than on acquitting itfelf of the obligation He would lay nothing of the con tribution of an alms in reality rather than of a tenth However as each man had bound himfelf in his private capacity the public was fet free But his confcience would not fuJter him to be filent on another head that the tenth of that part only of the fpoil was fet apart which confiiied of move able effects and no mention was made of the city or of the lands which as well as the reft were comprehended in the vow The fenate finding it difficult to form a determination on this point re ferred it to the pontiffs in conjunction with Camillusj and that body gave their opinion that whatfoever had been the property of the Veientians before the littering of the vow and after the vow was made came into the power of the Roman people of that the tenth part was facred to Apollo Thus the city and the land were brought into the eftimate The money was ifllied from the trealury and the confular military tribunes were commiflioned to lay it out in the purchafe of gold A fuSHcient quantity of this i i 3 metal 48 5 THEHISTORY B OvO K metal could not be procured  on which the matrons  r _ after holding fome meetings to deliberate on the fub Y R 360 jeft with unanimous confenr engaged to fupply the B C 391 military tribunes with gold and actually carried all their ornaments into the treafury Nothing ever happened which gave greater pleafure to the fenate and it is faid that in return for this generofity the matrons were honoured with the privilege of ufing covered chariots when going to public worfliip or games and open chaifes on any day whether fdlival or common The gold being received from each by weight and a valuation being made in order that the price might be repaid it was refolyed that a golden bowl thould be made thereof to be carried o Delphi as an offering to Apollo No fooner were men s minds difengaged from religious con cerns than the plebeian tribunes renewed their fe ditious practices ftimulating the refentment of the populace againftall the nobility but efpecially againft Camillus alleging that  by his confutations and confecrations he had reduced the fpoils of Veil to nothing daringly abufing the nobles in their abfence and on their appearing as they fometimes threw themfelves in the way of their fury fhewing them fome refpect When they perceived that the bufinefs would be protracled beyond the prefent year they re elected for the year following fuch tribunes of the commons as had promoted the paff ing of the law and the patricians exerted themfelves to effect the fame with refpect to fuch of them as had protefted againft it By thcie means the fame perfons moftly were re elected plebeian tribunes J J Â XXVI AT the election of military tribunes the patricians by ftraining their intereft to tlie utmoft prevailed to have Marcus Furius Camillus chofen They pretended that on account of the wars in which they were engaged they vyithed to have him as a commander but in fact they wanted him as an O F R O M E  an antagonift to the tribunes to check their corrupt B profufion Together with Camillus were elected military tribunes with confular power Lucius Furius Y R Medullinus a fixth time Caius Emilius Lucius Valerius Poplicola Spurius Poftumius and Publius Cornelius a fecond time In the beginning of the year the plebeian tribunes declined proceeding in the bufinefs until Marcus Furius Camillus fhould fet out againft the Falifcians for he had been ap pointed to the command in that war In confe quence of this delay the ardour of the purfuit was cooled and Camillus whom they had chiefly dread ed as an opponent found an increafe of glory in the country of the Falifcians for the enemy at firft con fining themfelves within their walls which appeared to be the fafeft plan by ravaging the country and burning the houies he compelled them to come forth from the city But ftill their fears prevented them from advancing to any confiderable length At the diftance of about a mile from the city they pitched their camp for the fecurity of which they confided entirely in the difficulty of the approaches all the roads on every fide being rough and craggy in fome parts narrow in others fteep but Camillus following the directions of a prifoner taken in the country who acted as his guide decamped in the latter end of the night and at break of day fhewed himfclf on ground much higher than theirs The Romans were formed into three divifions each of which in turn worked on the fortifications of the camp while the reft of the troops ftood in reaclinefs for battle The enemy then making an attempt to â interrupt his works he routed and put them to flight and with fuch confternation were the Falifcians ftruck that in the precipitancy of their flight they pafied by their own camp which lay nearer in their way and pufhed forward to the city Great num bers were flain and wounded before they reached the gates through which they rufhed in great

fupplied than the befiegers with corn and all other neceflaries from magazines which they had formed fome time before to judge from appearances the affair would have been as laborious and as tedious as that at Veii had not fortune together with an inftance of me ritorious conduct which in refpect of military mat ters he had already fufficiently difplayed procured to the Roman commander a fpeedy victory XXVII IT was the cuftom among the Falifcians to employ the fame perfon as mafter and private tutor to their children and as it continues to be the prac tice to this day in Greece feveral were intrufted at the fame time to the care of one man The teacher who was fuppofed to pofiefs the greateft fhare of knowledge had of courfe the inftruction of the chil dren of the firft rank this man having made it a cuftom in time of peace to carry the boys out of the city for the fake of exercife and play and having ne ver difcontinued the practice fince the war began now drew them away from the gate fometimes in fhorter fometimes in longer excurfions and when he found an opportunity advancing farther than ufual by introducing a variety of plays and conver fations he led them on between the advanced guards of the enemy and then through the Roman carnp into his tent to Camillus and there to this atrocious act added a fpeech ftill more atrocious that  he had O F R O M E 48  had delivered Falerii into the hands of the Ro B O O K mans by putting into their power thofe boys i 1  whofe parents were there at the head of affairs Y R 361 On hearing which Camillas told him  Neither B c Â l

methods by valour by labour and by arms Then ordering him to be ftripped naked and his hands to be tied behind his back he delivered him to the boys to be conducted back to Falerii and gave them rods with which they mould fcourge the trai tor and drive him into the city Such a fpectacle firft attracting a concourfe of the people and the fenate being afterwards fummoned by the magiftrates on the

that in fpite of the in treaties of Emilius and all his endeavours to detain them they fled to Tufculum in the utmoft diforder From thence a report was carried to Rome that Poftumius and his army were cut to pieces How ever as foon as day light had removed the danger of falling into ambufcades in cafe of a hafty purfuit riding through the ranks and demanding the per formance of their promifes he infufed into the men fuch a degree of ardour that the Equans could no longer withftand their efforts but betook themfelves to flight when a Daughter of them enfued as in a cafe where anger was more

with in habitants that he fhould every day enjoy that monument of his own glory and have before his eyes a city which he himfelf had carried in his triumph and that all men at every ftep they took fhould meet with teftimonies of his renown4 But in his opinion it would be an impious pro ceeding if a city forfaken and abandoned by the immortal gods were to be inhabited  if the Ro man people were

paffage of the Gauls into Italy what we have learned is this when Tar quinius Prifcus reigned at Rome the fupreme go vernment of the Celts who compofed one third part of Gaul lay in the hands of the Biturigians thefe gave a king to the Celtic nation Ambigatus a man very eminently diftinguifhed by his own merit and by the extraordinary degree of profperity which attended him both in his own private concerns and in thofe of the public for under his government Gaul was fo fruitful and fo numeroufly peopled that it feemed fcarcely practicable to retain fuch an enormous multitude under the direction of govern ment Being far advanced in years and wifbing to exonerate his realm of a crowd with which it was overburthened he declared his intention offending away his fifter s fons Bellovefus

impaflable having never before been climbed over through any path at leaf t as far as we have learned from any tradition handed down to us unlefs we choofe to believe the fables told of Hercu les Whilft the height of the mountains kept the Gauls there penned up as it were and they were looking about for foms path by which they might gain a paflage into another world between thofc lofry fummits which joined the fky an ominous inci dent alfo gave them fome delay for an account was brought to them that fome Grangers who had come in fearch of lands were attacked by the nation of the Salyans thefe were the Maffilians who hzd come by fea from Phocaea  The Gauis confidering this as an omen of their own fortune gave them their af fiftance in fortifying the ground which they had firft feized

themfelves of the track which reaches from the river Utens to the JECis This latter people I find it was who came to Clufium and from thence to Rome But whether alone oraf fifted by all the nations of Cifalpine Gauls is not known with certainty The Clufians on obferving the great multitude the appearance of the men different from any which they had feen before and the kind of arms which they carried were terrified at the approach of this ftrange enemy and having heard that the legions of the Etrurians had been often defeated by them on both fides of the Po although they had no claim on the Romans either in right of alliance or friendfhip except that they had not protected their relations the Veientians in oppofition to the Roman people yet they fent ambafFadors to Rome to folicit

was almoft entirely filled with lamentations Then on the ar rival of intelligence that the enemy were at hand the apprehenfions excited by the public danger flifted all private forrow foon after the barbarians pa troling about the walls in troops they heard their yells and the diflbnant clangour of their martial in itruments During the whole interval between this and the next morning their minds were held in the moft anxious fulpenfe every moment expecting an affault O F R O M E 509 aflault to be made on the city At the enemy s firft B O O K approach they iuppofed that they would begin the  _

before night becaufe there was not much of the day remaining then that the defign was put off until night in order to ftrike the greater terror At laft the approach of light funk them in difmay and the evil itfelf which they dreaded clofed this fcene of unremitted ap prehenfion the enemy marching into the gates in hoftile array During that night however and alfo the following day the ftate preferved a character very different from that which fuch a daftardly flight at the Allia had indicated for there being no room to hope that the city could pofiibly be defend ed by the fmall number of

of the aged light as of a crowd left behind in the city with a certain profpect of  perifhing And that fuch of this multitude as confifted of plebeians might bear their doom with the greater refignation the aged nobles formerly dignified to THE HISTORY BOOK dignified with triumphal honours and confulfhips L  openly declared that  they would meet death along Y R 365  with them and would not burthen the fcanty B C 387 ftores of the fighting men with bodies incapable of carrying arms and of protecting their country Such were the confolations addrefied to each other by the aged who were deftined to death XL THEIR exhortations were then turned to the band of young men whom they efcorted to the Ca pitol and citadel commending to their valour and youthful vigour the remaining fortune of their city which through the courfe of three hundred and fixty years had ever been victorious in all its wars When thofe who carried with them every hope and every refource parted with the others who had deter mined not to furvive the capture and deftruction of the city as the cafe itfelf and the view which it ex hibited were fufficient to call forth the tendereft feelings of pity being then joined with the lamen tations of the women who ran up and down in diftraction now following one party then the other afking their hufbands and their fons to what fate they would confign them all

becaufe though the meafure of lefiening the number of ufelefs perfons in a fiege would doubtlefs be an ufeful one yet it was a mtafure of extreme inhumanity The reft of the multitude confifting

Quirinalis where at prefent it is reckoned profane even to fpit The reft they carried diftrr buting the burthens among themfelves along the road which leads over the Sublician bridge to the Janiculum On the afcent of that hill Lucius Al binius a Roman plebeian obferving them as he was conveying in a waggon his wife and children among the other crowd of thofe who being unfit for war were retiring from the city and retaining even in his prefent calamitous ftate a regard to the dif tinction between things divine and human he thought it would betray a want of the refpecT due to religion if the public priefts of the Roman peo ple were to go on foot and thus to carry the facred things whilft he and his family were feen mounted in a carriage ordering his wife and children then to alight he put the virgins and the facred things into the waggon and conveyed them to Caere whither the priefts had determined to go XLI MEANWHILE at Rome when every difpb fition for the defence of the citadel had

cafting round their eyes on the temples of the gods and on the citadel the only fpot which retained the appearance of war From thence leaving a fmall guard to prevent any attack from the citadel or

on a fudden a Ro man youth drew on himfelf the attention and ad miration OF R O M E  miration both of his countrymen and the enemy There was a facrifice always folemnized by the Fa bian family at

after duly performing there the Ibleinn rites returned by the fame way preferving the fame firmnefs in his countenance and gait confident of the protection of the gods whofe worfhip even the fear of death had not power to make him negletft and came back to his friends in the Capitol while the Gauls were either held motionlefs with aftonifhment at his amaz ing confidence or moved by confiderations of reli gion of which that nation is by no means regard lefs Meanwhile thofe at Veii found not only their courage but their ftrength alfo increafing daily And as not only fuch of the Romans repaired thither who in conlcquence either of the defeat in the field or of the difafter of the city being taken had been difperfed in various parts but volunteers alfo flowed in from Latium with a view to fhare in the fpoil it now feemed high time to attempt the recovery of their native city and refcue it out of the hands of the enemy But this ftrong body wanted a head the fpot where they ftood reminded them of Ca millus a great number of the foldiers having fought with fuccefs under his banners and aufpices Be tides Caedicius declared that he would not take any part which might afford

particular pcr fon a portion fubtracted from the fupport of his own perfon and his neceflary fupplies Then thofe who had been on guard at the place where the ene my climbed up unobferved were cited and though Quintus Sulpicius military tribune had declared that he would punifh every man of them according to the rules of rriilitary difripline yet being deterred by the unanimous remonftrances of the foldiers who threw all the blame on one particular man of the guard he fpared the reft The one who was manifeftly guilty he with the approbation of all threw down from the rock From this time forth the guards on both fides became more vigilant on the fide of the Gauls becaufe a rumour fpread that mefiengcrs pafied between Veii and Rome j and on that of the Romans from their re collection of the danger to which they had been ex pofed in the night XLVIJI BUT beyond all the evils of the war and the fiege famine diftreflcd both armies To tfhich was added on the fide of the Gauls a pefti

feparatdy they gathered the bodies in B c 387 heaps pramifcuoufly and burned them and this ren dered the place remarkable by the name of the Gal lic piles A truce was now made with the Romans and conferences held with permiflion of the com manders In which when the Gauls frequently made mention of the famine to which the others were reduced and thence inferred the neceffity of their liu rendering it is faid that in order to remove this opinion bread was thrown from the Capitol in feve ral places into the advanced pofts of the Gauls But now the famine could neither be difi embled nor en dured any longer Wherefore whilft the dilator â was employed in perfon in levying forces at Ardea in fending his mafter of the horle Lucius Valerius to bring up the troops from Vcii and in making

completed the whole quan tity of gold being not yet weighed in c onfequence of the altercation the dictator came up to the fpot ordered the gold to be carried away from thence and the Gauls to clear the place And when they made oppofition and infifted on the agreement he affirmed that fuch an agreement could have no vali dity being made after he had been created dictator without his order by a magiftrate of fubordinate au thority j and he gave notice to the Gauls to prepare for battle His own men he ordered to throw their baggage in a heap to get ready their arms and to recover their

obje Â t which they were bound by the ftrongeft duties to defend to recover and to re venge He then drew up his forces for battle as the nature of the ground would allow on the fite of the half

Here the laughter was immenfe their camp was taken and not even a fingle perfon left to carry the news of the defeat The dictator having thus recovered his country from the enemy returned to the city in triumph and among the rough jokes which the foldjers throw out on fuch occafions re ceived the appellauons of a Romulus and the father of his country and a fecond founder of the city praifes not unmerited His country thus faved by arms he evidently faved a fecond time in peace when he hindered the people to remove to Veii a fcheme prefled by the tribunes with greater ear neftnefs after the burning of the city and which the commons of themfelves were then more in clined to purfue and for that reafon he did not re fign the dictatorfhip immediately after his triumph being entreated by the fenate not to leave the com monwealth in that uncertain ftate L THE firft bufinefs which he laid before the 1 fenate was that which refpected the immortal gods j for he was remarkably attentive to all

them and that the form of expiation lhould be fought in the books by the duumvirs That a league of i hofpitality 5 6 THE Hi STORY B o o K  hofpitality fhould be formed by public authority TL  with the people of Caere becaufe they had af y R 365  forded a reception to the facred utenfils and to B c 387 K t ie priefts of the Roman people and that to the c kindnefs of that people it was owing that the worfhip of the immortal gods had not been in termitted that Capitoline games fhould be ex  hibited in honour of Jupiter fupremely good and great for having in time of danger protected his own manfion and the citadel of the Roman people and that a certain number for the due performance thereof fhould be incorporated by the dictator out of thole who refided in the Ca pitot and citadel Mention was alfo intro duced of expiating the voice which had been heard by night giving notice of the calamity before the Gallic war and which had been neglected and an order was made that a temple fhould be erected to Aius Locutius in the new ftreet The gold â which had been refcued from the Gauls and alfo â what had been during the hurry of the alarm car ried from the other temples into the recefs of Jupi ter s temple was all together judged to be facred and ordered to be depofited under the throne of Ju piter becaufe people could not recollect to what temples it ought to be returned The ftate had before this manifefted a high regard to religion in accepting a contribution of gold from the matrons when the public fund was found inefficient to make up the fum ftipulated to be paid to the Gauls rather than meddle with the facred gold To the matrons public thanks were given and alfo the privilege of having funeral orations delivered in honour of them on their death as the men had When he had

of Veil for what a number of years and  with what an immennty of labour was it carried on Yet it could not be brought to a conclu fion until in obedience to the admonition of the gods the water was

during the fiege was beheld with no lefs admiration by the enemy than by your u felves in that excellent youth Caius Fabius when c he went down from the citadel through the midft of Gallic weapons and performed on the Quiri nal hill the anniverfary rites pertaining to the Fa bian family Is it your opinion that the religious performances of particular families fliould not be  intermitted though war obftruct bi t that the public rites and the Roman gods fhould be for faken even in time of peace and that the pontiffs and flamens fhould be more negligent of the public rites of religion than a
