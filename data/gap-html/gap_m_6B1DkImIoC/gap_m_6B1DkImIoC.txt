reconcile Youth in the early stages of their ap plication to the study of the CLASSICS to facilitate and promote their progress and to enlarge their ideas in the English as well as Latin phraseology the use of literal translations hath been of late years most successfully adopted The advantages arising from translations con structed on a more liberal plan at a more advanced period after etymology inflexion construction accent and a sufficient stock of words have been acquired will be equally considerable To lay a foundation for good taste and true criticism is a point of which we must never lose sight in classical studies The observations of a good teacher in the course of his prescriptions will be very important but the practical art of arranging classing and disposing a liberal stock of phrases vvitl taste and judgment will receive a surprising improve ment from imitation By comparing the original with an elegant translation and that translation again with the original the student s style will be insensibly elevated and he will quickly ac quire a facility and readiness of expression in both lan guages without which all the time and labour spent up on study would be in a great measure lost But to one whose only assistant is his dictionary a good translation must be still more necessary The drudgery of scram bling the sense of an author out of a dictionary is not only intolerably tedious but requires an extraordinary degree of penetration to succeed to any purpose a good translation properly used will render the study easy ex peditious and effectual It was with this view that I employed some of my lei sure hours in translating the first jive books of Liny J o whose writings I have always been mightily attached on account of the beauty and dignity of his style and his luminous intelligible and agreeable manner In trans lating I have endeavoured to be spirited and faithful equally avoiding the closeness of a literal version iu â x THE TRANSLATOR which the spirit of the author would have evaporated and the freedom of a loose paraphrase which would not have answered the purpose intended by it In one word I have endeavoured as far as I could to transfuse the sen timents and fire of Livy into a British botly but how far I have succeeded I must leave to the impartial public To render the purchase easy and that I may have the opinion of the public before I should proceed farther I have confined myself at present to five Books â If these already translated be read with a proper degree of atten tion a translation for the rest will not be perhaps neces sary however should this specimen be well received the rest may soon follow Although the work of TITUS Livius have immortalized his name he was too regardless of popular applause or places of distinction and too much delighted with philoso phical retirement and humble privacy to leave many vestiges of his rank employments adventures or fortune It is however generally agreed that he was born at Pa dua and descended p no obscure family since it had the honour to give consuls to the Republic of Rome â It is also known that he lived in the Augustan age that he dedicated to Augustus those Dialogues which he published on the philosophical questions of the times and that this made him known and recommended him to the favour of that emperor That he afterwards wrote a Treatise on Eloquence inscribed to his son of which Quintilian makes honourable mention â We also know that he began to write his history at Rome where he might have recourse to such memorials and original pa pers that had been preserved in the capitol as were pro per to set him to rights concerning the origin of the city and to remove those Intricacies and doubts into which fabulous traditions had involved it That after he was sufficiently master of his subject he retired to Naples where his labours might meet with fewer interruptions That some time after this he read some passages of his history to the emperor Augustus and Maecenas of which they formed so favourable an opinion that the emperor  T Liv lib 1 cap 19 TO THE PUBLIC tii appointed him praeceptor to his grandson Claudius after wards emperor It is recorded by the younger Pliny that the reputa tion of Livy had begun already to make so much noise in the world that he received an honourable visit from the extremity of Spain occasioned by the fame of his great and extensive genius which had found its way thi ther t After the death of Augustus he returned to his native Padua where he was received by his fellow citizen with every demonstration of joy and mark of honour He died there in the fourth year of the empire of Tibe rias Whilst he staid at Rome and had the countenance and protection of Augustus he had every opportunity of attaining whatever knowledge was necessary to his design j to the study of which he was so much attached that he sequestered himself in a manner from the world and the pursuits of ambition so that his life became thereafter more obscure for applying his whole attention to the great work he had undertaken he shut himself up in his study and consequently had very little intercourse with society So vast and so great an enterprise both in the plan and execution certainly required the noblest effort of human genius but the elevated and generous senti ments which so remarkably distinguish and stamp an un common beauty and excellency on Titus Livius history are derived from the nobleness of the heart for which our author seems to have been illustriously conspicuous Any one who has read the works of Livy with atten tion will be at no loss to pronounce him a man of worth and probity The manner in which he speaks of him self is peculiarly modest vanity is a foible to which he seems to have been a perfect stranger Of himself per sonally he seldom or never speaks nor in the whole course of his history does he mention the least thing that concerns hirn save only that the temple of Janus was shut in his time Nothing can be a greater proof of bis natural turn of mind in this particular than the strain of modesty which runs through the preface to his history No author ever promised less or performed  Suet in Claud cap 41 t Lib II Ep 3 viii THE TRANSLATOR more With what diffidence does he disclose his design and with what distrust of his abilities to support with propriety so great an undertaking But his fears are a proof of his wisdom and he promises little that his read ers might be agreeably disappointed So true it is that a man s modesty is generally in proportion to his judg ment This is one reason why Livy attracts our admira tion whenever we read his works for having promised nothing we soon discover the clearness of his composi tion the depth of his penetration the extent of his genius the fertility of his imagination and in fine numberless beauties elegancies and excellencies pecu liar to himself which in the modesty of his Introduction we were not taught to expect What fund of wisdom what politeness of manners were requisite to depress that pride that self appropriation so natural to the human mind and yet to do justice to his character If Livy s sincerity could have been possibly stifled the respect shown him by Augustus the favour to which he was elevated and the estimation he was held in at court might have corrupted him yet none of these consider ations prevented him from doing justice to the character ofPompey and speaking respectfully of Brutus and Cas sius whenever an opportunity offered A conduct so generous candid and disinterested Cremutius Cordus according to Tacitus thought he could never sufficiently praise Such was Livy in the qualities of his heart and such were his personal endowments And without doubt but for such an historian there would have been something defective in the glory or rather the good fortune of a people who by their military and political virtues raised themselves to the highest pitch of terrestrial greatness This gave rise to the Famous inscription found at Padua Anno 1413 in the church of St Justina Ossa Titi Livii Patavini unius omnium mortalium judicio digJK cujus prope invicto calamo invicti populi Romani res gesttE con scribcrentur j The end and design of history is to instruct and im prove the present by exhibiting a true picture of past  Tac Lib iv Anna    TO TIJE PUBLIC ix ages and when we consider the various accomplishments and requisites for executing it well the reason why the most learned and polished nations have produced so few perfect historians will be abundantly obvious To com plete this character the philosopher the politician the general the orator and the man of the world must all be united in one and the same person To accuracy and â diligence in his researches symmetry and proportion in the arrangement of his matter elegance and nervous ness of diction freedom and impartiality in his reflexions he must join a thorough acquaintance with the consti tution of the state whose history he writes and the dis criminating characters of its various ages an intimate knowledge of the human heart and above all an honest virtuous steady and unbiassed disposition The more extended the subject the greater variety of examples it exhibit the more genius it requires to treat it with pro priety and the more extensive the advantages to be de rived from it The subject upon which Livy treats accurately con sidered in evejy circumstance is perhaps the most beau tiful and richest that possibly can be conceived The Romans were a people who from an origin the most obscure and inglorious by correcting what was amiss iu their manners by prudence in their councils by activity and address in the executing of their plans by secrecy and fidelity in their negociations by strictness of disci pline civil and military and by their unshaken firmness and fortitude amidst the most imminent dangers arrived to fL pitch of glory almost incredible which they owed alone to the vigour of their constitution and their virtu ous principles so that their history furnishes us with all that is great â with all that is excellent â with all that is truly noble In contemplating this mighty empire the imagination musfrbe highly delighted when the virtues which pro moted its elevation and the vices which hastened its ruin pass in reuiew before it It is here where we can ex amine the most illustrious characters with candour and impartiality unbiassed by prejudice and undazzled by greatness Can the understanding be more enlarged or the judgment be letter confirmed than in living thus over past ages profiting try their experience and x THE TRANSLATOR trating into the motives of every action and cause of every event Can there be a greater incitement to virtue than from the example exhibited to us in the history of the antient Romans for modesty frugality generosity disinterestedness patriotism and all those shining vir tues which have rendered them the admiration of suc ceeding ages It was in this view that Livy considered his subject in which he saw so many opportunities of displaying his genius and which he knew so well how to improve In short in the manner he has handled his subject nothing seems to be above his merit The beauty and elevation of his style is equal to the glory and greatness of the people whose history he writes He is everywhere luminous intelligible and agreeable but when he en ters into important affairs he rises even above himself to treat them with peculiar attention and a kind of self delight and complacency The actions he describes he renders present he sets them before the eyes he does not relate them he shows them He paints the genius and character of his dramatis persona from nature and puts words iuto their mouths which are always conform able to their sentiments and situations In one word he has the wonderful art of keeping his readers in so pleas ing a suspense by the variety of his events and of en gaging their curiosity so strongly that it is impossible to quit his relation of any incident till it is entirely at an end f It is reported of the celebrated Scotch historian George Buchanan that he read Titus Livius s history ten times over to fix in his mind the stile and manner of that great author before he attempted the work which has justly placed him at the head of all the writers who have transmitted their sentiments to posterity in the Latin language since the Augustan age Nay some have not scrupled to affirm in drawing a comparison between Livy and the celebrated Roman orator Cicero that if the latter had turned his whole attention from the bar to  Les Oenvres du P Rapin f Rolling Roman history TO THE PUBLIC ii the writing of history his appearance as a historian would rather have eome short of Livy s Our author s Roman history originally consisted of 142 Books extending from the foundation of Rome to the death of Dausus A U C 744 but the lamentable depredations which have been committed on the literary treasures of antiquity by Goths and Vandals Monks worms and that notorious belluo librorum time have deprived us of above 170 Books the value of which may be estimated from the expectations which have been formed the searches that have been made and the re wards that have been proposed for recovering all the Books of this inimitable historian which are wanted in our printed copies Once indeed it was fully expected that all the works of Livy would have been restored en tire to the world One Justinian a Greek merchant of the island of Chios happening to be m France in the year 1685 offered the French king all the works ofLivy He pretended that at the great fire which happened at Constantinople in the 1665 this valuable work was a mong other books thrown out a window and picked up bv a Turk who sold it privately to a merchant by whom he was commissioned to sell it The bargain was struck  by which Justiniani was entitled to receive at the rate of 10 000 crowns instantly paid him for every two Decades he could produce But he never returned with the copy which was an universal disappoint ment Thus in all ages since the works of Kvy made their first appearance in the world have they been universal ly admired and sought after with the greatest avidity and such was the veneration paid to their illustrious au thor by Alphonso king of Naples that he sent in the year 452 Panormita as his ambassador to the Veneti ans in whose dominions the bones of Livy had been lately discovered to beg a relic

HISTORY OF THE REGAL GOVERNMENT OF ROME INTRODUCTION writing the history of the Roman people from the Tery foundation of the city whether I may offer to the public a work of merit is a question I cannot well resolve nor if I could would I venture to do it sensible as I am that it is a trite and common thing for every new author to imagine to himself that he will state facts with a greater air of authenticity titan his predecessors or by the colourings of his style throw a new light upon the shades of more ancient productions Whatever may be in that to me the reflection will be however agreeable that I too have contributed my part to perpetuate the memory of the atchifevements of a people who have become lords of the universe And should I in such a groupe of writers appears less con spicuous I shall still rind some consolation in the lustre of those characters who are superior tome in the annals of fame Moreover to write the history of so great a B 14 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I people for a period of more than seven centuries must be a very laborious task more especially as from a be ginning the most inconsiderable they raised themselves to a pitch of greatness which they are now hardly able to support To the generality of readers too I doubt not but the origin of the city and what immediately followed will be less interesting whilst they hurry on to these latter times when for several years past the power of this extraordinary people hath been engaged in working its own destruction â On the other hand should I have no other reward for my trouble while my attention is totally engaged in reviewing those scenes of antiquity I can at least withdraw mine eyes from be holding the raging wickedness of the times and conse quently be void of care which though it may not influ  ence the mind of a writer with respect to truth can very sensibly hurt his feelings What happened before and about the time the city was built as the accounts are rather embellished with poetical fables than supported by incontestible authorities I am resolved neither to affirm nor refute It is an in dulgence allowed to antiquity the better to stamp a su perior dignity on the original of cities to blend things human with divine And if any people on earth can possibly be allowed the privilege of consecrating their original and ascribing it to the gods such is the mili tary g ry of the Roman people that when they claim a pecultar title to call Mars their author and the father of their founder all the nations bear it as cheerfully as they submit to their yoke But these circumstances anj mliers of the same nature however taken or con sidered shall give me no concern I shall only request the reader s serious attention to what respects the lives and manners of this people the men and measures in the cabinet and the field by which their empire was founded and exiended Then let him still continue to observe whilst the strictness of their discipline gradually relaxed first a corruption of their morals then a con stant progressive decay and at last a total degeneracy till he arrive at the present age when we can neither bear our political disorders nor the application of a re medy CHAP i ROMAN HISTORY 15 In the study of history there is this peculiar advantage There you have examples of every kind set before you in a conspicuous point of view whence you may set up models for your imitation as an individual or a state or beacons to warn you against base attempts which end in disgrace But either I am prepossessed in favour of the work I have undertaken or there never was a state more respectable for its greatness its sanctity or variety of excellent characters Never was there a state into which luxury and avarice found their way so late nor where poverty and frugality were held so long and so much in repute that the less they had the less they desired Of late years riches have introduced luxury and a profusion of pleasures a taste for extravagance in ail the ways of riot and debauchery but as complaints will not even then be agreeable when perhaps they are necessary let us at least drop them in the introduction to so great a work or rather were it fashionable with us histdrians as it is with the poets set out with more enlivening ideas with good omens and vows and prayers to the gods and goddesses that they would vouchsafe to

or because a god was a more honourable cloak for her offence she fathered upon Mars But neither gods nor men screened her from the cruelty of the king  the vestal was put in close confmement and the infants were ordered to be thrown into the Tiber where the current was most rapid  By the interposition of some divinity the river had at that time overflowed its banks upon which the waters stood diffused in still pools which rendered the channel quite inaccessible They who were charged with the execution of the orders thinking the water however still would be sufficient to drown the infants laid them down in the nearest pool where now stands the Ruminalis ficus  formerly by tradition the ficus Romularis concluding that they had now fairly done their duty The country was at that time a

when they were yet young but roamed and hunted in the forests by which exercise having acquired strength and courage they not only encountered witd beasts but attacked bands of robbers loaded with

determined to acknowledge Remus Wherefore a plot is laid for the king on all sides Romulus however did not advance with his young adventurers in a body as being by open force unequal to the attempt but having ordered the shepherds by different routs to meet at the palace at an hour con certed he then forces his way to the king whilst from Numitor s house Remus advances with another party which

recognized king of Alba Romulus and Remus became passionately fond of building a city on the very spot where they had been exposed and brought up A number both of Trojans and Albans could well enough be spared and the shepherds had al ready acceded to the motion who altogether were easily induced to hope that in future times Alba and Lavi nia would only be looked upon as inconsiderable villages compared with the city they were about to build These views were afterwards interrupted by ambition an here ditary evil which though it was attended with no sort of acrimony at first had an event sufficiently tragical As the brothers were twins and the respect due to seniority could make no distinction they agreed that the tutelar gods of the country should decide by Augury  which of the two

that Hercules having killed Gerion brought off with him some cows of surprizing beauty and that having swipamed across the Tiber driv ing them before him he lay down in a meadow fujl of grass to refresh himself after the fatigue if his journey and feed his cattle with the rich pastured There having eat and drunk plentifully before when he had fallen fast asleep a shepherd named Cacus who resided there about being full of his strength and quite charmed with the beauty of the cows resolved to make free with them And because the marks of their feet would have betrayed his retreat to their owner had he driven them forwards he drew the most beautiful of the whole herd one by one into his cave backwards by the tail Hercules getting up as soon as day appeared and surveying his cattle found some of them were gone upon which he walked Jo the next cave if possible to trace them But when he observed their footsteps all turned from it and leading no where else he was quite confounded and having no other alternative began to drive his cattle from the enchanted spot Upon this as it commonly happens some of the cows as he was driving them along began to low for want of those they had left behind nor did the cows in the cave fail to CHAP 7 ROMAN HISTORY 35 answer them which induced Hercules to turn back As he was advancing to the cows Cacus attempted to stop him with all the force he could muster but Hercules with a singte stroke oi his ciub laid him breathless at bis feet whilst he vainly imptored the protection of the shepherds At that time Eyaader having fled from Peloponnesus had the government of this country more out of respect to bis superior merit than any legal investiture He was highly revered for his wonderful learning a thing quite uncommon among men who were ignorant of every art and still more for the supposed divinity of his mother Carmenta to whom before the coming of the Sybil into Italy these nations for her prophetic spirit paid great veneration This Evander was called upon by the shepherds who crowded in great consternation about the stranger and impeached him with open murder Having heard the crime and the provocation fully explained and observing a certain dignity in the air of Hercules and his size rather above the human he asked him who he was The moment his name his father and his country were mentioned  Hail Hercules said he son of Jupiter my mother a true prophetess  hath declared to me that you will increase the num ber of the celestials and that to you an altarf shall be dedicated here which an empire the most povt er ful upon earth shall call the greatest f Hercules reaching him the hand of friendship replied That he gladly accepted the omen and would fulfil the plea sure of the fates by raising and consecrating an altar accordingly Thus for the first time an heifer being selected for the purpose the most beautiful in the whole collection a sacrifice was made to Hercules the Potitii and Pinarii families of the first distinction in the country performing the service and partaking of the entertainment It happened however that the Potitii were present at the  Now the Morea f The Sybils

the Pi narii as the entrails bad been eaten up came only to the remaining part of the entertainment For which reason it was enacted that the Pinarii should never in future be allowed to eat of the entrails at solemn sacri fices The Poiitii being instructed by Evander continued priests of Hercules for many ages till they gave up this solemn hereditary office to be administered by public slaves that the whole family became extinct â This was the only foreign sacred rite which Romulus adopted and this too out of deference to that immortality which is the perquisite of virtue whither his own fates seemed to point CHAP VIII The Senate chosen A N C 753 Rom 1 XVOMULUS having with all due solemnity perform ed the duties he owed to religion called an assembly of his people to whom he prescribed laws and regulations which alone bade fairest for uniting them in one com munity and judging that these laws would have a greater impression on his uncivilized rustics were he himself distinguished by ensigns of royalty he rendered bis appearance more majestic by the richness of his dress and particularly by twelve Lictors who were to attend his person Some are of opinion that the twelve Vultures which had been the omen of his regal power determmed him to fix upon this number But I rather imagine accord ing to others that he copied the Apparitors as well as this kind of

occasion to this number among the Etruri ans was the number of nations of which they consisted each having a vote in the election of a king to whom also each of them assigned a Lictor In the mean time the walls of the city were extended by including one place after another within their works which they carried on more in hopes of an accession of inhabitants than for the accommodation of the numbers they had at present Thereafter that this speculation might not be aerial Romulus in order to increase his numbers adopting the policy of those ancient founders who by drawing togetlier an assemblage of people in low circumstances and of mean extraction pretended that men arose to them out of the earth opened an asylum in that place which is now enclosed as you go down the hill between the two groves thither freed men and slaves and whoever had a taste for novelty fled in multitudes without distinction from the neighbouring nations which was the first accession to their infant power  As they were now become a pretty formidable party the next step was to put them under some proper regu lation For this purpose an hundred Senators were chosen either because that number was thought suffi cient or because no more were found who could with propriety be elected But it was surely out of respect that they were called Fathers and their children Pa tricians s CHAP IX War with the Ssiinw JK

deputies through the neighbouring states to solicit their alliance and connexion by intermarrying with his new subjecis and urging That cities like other things rose from very small beginnings â That those who were assisted by the gods and their own indus try have in time become great and opulent â That they might be very sensible that the gods had coun tenanced the building of Rome and that in point of virtuous industry the citizens would not be deficient â That therefore he hoped as they themselves were â men they would not refuse to mix their blood and fa milies with men like themselves i This embassy had a gracious reception nowhere and at the same time that they were held in the utmost con tempt they were dreaded as a monster growing up in the heart of their country to devour them and their pos terity They were therefore dismissed by most of the neighbouring states with this insulting question  Whe ther had they opened an asylum for female vagrants â for such only would be suitable matches for them The Roman youth were not a little piqued at this afl ront and without doubt began to meditate on a more violent mode of courtship To give them time and opportunity for putting their designs in execution Romulus con cealing his chagrin makes preparations for celebrating solemn games in honour of Equestrian Neptune He calls them Consualia f and orders them to be announ ced to all the cities around They were celebrated with all the pomp and magnificence they could contrive or afford that their splendour might not come short of the popular expectations Great

The whole nation of the Sabines came with their wives and children Being treated with great hospitality in the different houses when they had taken a view or the city its situation fortifications and the prodigious number of houses it contained they could not conceal their wonder at the rapidity of Its progress in so short a time When the exhibition came on their eyes and minds being equally fixed on that object a tumuit was set on foot as had been concerted and the signal being given the Roman youth ran different ways to carry oil the young women by force A great part of them were borne away promiscuously by those into whose hands chance had put them Some of superior beauty destined for the principal senators were by persons employed for the purpose carried to their houses A young lady in her person and looks far surpassing all the rest it is said had been seized by a party commissioned by one Talas sius who to save her from rudeness when the question was put for whom was she intended they repeatedly cried out for Talassius a word which afterwards was adopted in the marriage ceremonies The consternation occasioned by this proceeding hav ing interrupted the games the parents of the young wo men in sorrow fled from the city exclaiming bitterly against the Romans for violating the laws of hospitality and invoking the vengeance of that god to countenance whose games they had come to Rome betrayed under the specious pretence of religion and public faith Nor were the hopes of the young women more sanguine nor their resentment less poignant But Romulus in person went about and informed them That whatever had happened was entirely ow ing to the pride of their fathers who had refused to give them in marriage to their neighbours but that nevertheless they should be joined by indissoluble ties to their fortunes and freedom as well as to their per sons And moreover what would still be a more endearing connexion they would be united with their husbands in the tender affection of parents of the same â From Sabus their founder SO TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I children â that now they ought to soften their re sentment and surrender their hearts to those men to whom fortune had given possession of their persons â â That from wrongs and injuries love and friendship had often proceeded and that they would find their husbands behave themselves with so tender an affec tion as would leave them no cause to regret the loss of either parents or country To these soothing expostulations we may add the ca resses of the husbands pleading in excuse the ardour of their passion and violence of their love pleas which seldom fail to operate with success on the female heart CHAP X Opima Spolia presented to Jupiter Feretriui DY this time ihe passion of the ladies had greatly sub sided but their parents all the while were going about in a pitiful dress endeavouring by tears and lamenta tions to stir up their states to revenge nor did they confine their complaints to their own country but as sembled from all quarters to Titus Tatius king of the Sabines to whom as being the most conspicuous cha racter in these countries all embassies were addressed The Cseninenses Crustumini and Antemnates had their share in the indignity To them Titus and his Sabines seemed slow and inactive for which reason having formed a triple alliance among themselves they prepare for hostilities Stilj were the motions of the Crustumini and Antem nates too slow for the ardour and fury of the Caeninenses so that they alone made an incursion upon the Roman territories but Romulus meeting them with his army as they were ravaging the country in straggling parties soon convinced them in a slight skirmish that fury un supported by strength is impotent in the extreme Their army is defeated

importunities of the ravished ladies requests of him to be reconciled to their fathers and re ceive them into the city for by such union there would be between them a reciprocation of interest This fa vour was easily obtained After this he marched against the Crustimini  who too had commenced hostilities But here the resistance he met with was feeble indeed The enemy was quite dispirited by the overthrow of their neighbours Colo nies were sent to each of these places but on account of the richness of the soil the majority enlisted for Crustu minium From them too there were frequent emigrations to Rome consisting chiefly of the parents and relations â of the ravished ladies The last but not the least war they had on this account was with the Sabines they were neither actuated by passion nor love of plunder nor did they threaten before they were ready to execute To expedite their designs they had recourse to a stra tagem Spurius Turpeius was then governor of the ci tadel With the promise of a sum of money Tatius prevailed on a young lady the governor s daughter to permit his soldiers to enter the citadel in arms by chance at that time she had gone without the walls to fetch water for some sacred purpose They whom she admitted either because they thought it more honourable that it should appear the citadel was taken fairly or to make her an example to posterity that no faith should be kept with traitors smothered her under their bucklers Because the Sabines on their left arms commonly wore bracelets of great value and on their fingers rings set  From Inhere to

shields Some also alledge that in consequence of her bargain she insisted for their arms and thus seeming to have acted with duplicity she got the reward she had urged CHAP XII The Romans dtfeat the Sabines in battle A HE Sabines however got possession of the citadel but from thence though the Roman army the next day was drawn up along the field which lies between the Palatine and Capitolioe hills they did not venture into the plain till the Romans fired with indignation and eager to recover the citadel charged up to their front The battle was begun by two principal officers Mettius minis on the side of the Sabines and Tullius Hostilius on the side of the Romans He in spite of the disad vantage of ground supported the Romans among the foremost ranks by his spirited and intrepid conduct The moment he fell the Romans gave way and fled to the old gate of Palatium Romulus too being hurried along with the fugitive  lifting up his arms to heaven Jupiter cried he com manded by thy birds I

he was vaunting in this insulting manner Ro mulus charged him at the head of a party of gallant young fellows and as it happened that Metiius fought on horseback it was the more easy to drive him from his post He is put to flight in his turn and pursued Another battalion of the Roman army spirited up by the gallantry of their prince routs the Sabines Mettius was thrown into a swamp from his horse

adjusted and an union of both cities and kingdoms effected Rome tvas made the seat of the united government By this coalition the numbers of the cities being doubled the Sabines were called Suirites from Cures by way of distinction â As a monumSnl of that battle the place where Curtius s horse springing out of a dry swamp set him upon shallow water was called the Curtian lake This quick and â happy transition to peace from a very unnatural war endeared the Sabine women to their fathers and hus bands more than ever and most of all to Romulus who when he divided the people into thirty Curia dis tinguished them by their names Though doubtless the number of the women exceeded that of the Curiae yet it is not said whether they who gave names to the Curiae were selected to that honour for their seniority superiority of their own or husbands rank or by lot At the same time three hundred knights were enrolled and from Romulus were called Ramnenses and from Tatius Tatienscs Why or how they they were called Luceres is yet a question From this date the associate kings ruled in common on the most amicable footing  CHAP XIV The Fidenates routed OOME years after the relations of Tatius behaved rude y to the femlrassadors of the Laurentes who when they 36 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I demanded satisfaction were very little regarded by Tatius for which reason the punishment of his relations recoiled upon himself for the people at Lavinuim where he was attending some annual solemnity rose up and killed him â It was said of Romulus that he gave him self less concern about this event than it seemed to claim whether it was that associates in sovereign power are seldom firm friends or that he really thought Tatius had met with the fate he deserved however no war follow ed Only to expiate in some measure the indignity done the ambassadors and the murder of the king the treaty between the two cities Rome and Lavinium was renewed Though peace of which there was little expectation had been thus concluded with the Laurentes another war broke out much nearer nay almost at the very gates of Rome The Fidenates finding the Roman power was growing too formidable in their neighbourhood were for striking a blow before it should arrive at that pitch of greatness which the Vapidity of its progress seemed to point at Wherefore having let loose a body of youth in arms upon the Roman territory they laid waste all the coun try between Rome and Fidenae Then turning to the left because they were prevented by the Tiber on the right they continued their depredations to the great terror of the country people who flying in crowds from the country to the town were the first to bring advice of the irruption Roused by this intelligence Romulus instantly leads out his army for the approaches of the enemy were too near to admit of deliberation He encamps about a  mile from Fidenae Marching put with the main body and leaving only a small party for a guard he orders a detachment to ly in ambush in a place entirely covered with brushwood then advancing with the greater part of the foot and all the horse he rode up to the enemy s gates in a disorderly and blustering manner by which he provoked the enemy to sally out which was all he aimed at The behaviour of the horse too made the appearance of a sudden retreat seem less affected for whilst they seemed through fear to hesitate whether they should CHAP IS ROMAN HISTORY Â fight or fly the infantry drew back also Upon this the enemy s gates instantly flew open and out they rush from every quarter The Roman army fled before them and by their eagerness to pursue and harass them in tbeir retreat were decoyed to the place where the party lay in ambush The Romans starting up all of a sud den attack the enemy in flank the guard which had been left in the camp advancing at the same time with colours flying added to their consternation â The Fide itates being thus alarmed from every quarter took to their heels almost before it was possible for Romulus and those who attended him on horseback to wheel about and fled in earnest back to the town much faster than before they had pursued the pretended fugitives But all could not save them  for Romulus keeping close at their heels before they could shut the gates entered among them with his army as if they had all belonged to the same corps CHAP XV The Vejentes conquered J HE sparks which issued from the war with the Fide nates set the minds of the Vejentes on fire And their relation for the Fidenates were also Etrurians added to their vicinity should this warlike disposition continue with the Romans to the molestation of their neighbours blew it up into a flame Wherefore they made an in cursion into the Roman territories but it had more the air of a plundering match than a regular expedition FÂ r without encamping or waiting for an enemy they returned to Veii loaded with their plunder Romulus on the other hand finding the enemy had evacuated the country being already prepared and now determined to give them a decisive blow crosses the Tiber When the Vejentes were informed that he had already encamped and was on the point of advancing to their city they chose rather to risk a battle than shut up within be obliged to fight from their houses and walls There Romulus without the least stratagem by Vy 38  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I the dint of superior strength and the exertions of his brave veterans obtained a complete victory for he routed and pursued the enemy to the gates of their city which however as it was strongly fortified by nature and art he did not attempt to take In his return he laid waste their country not for the sake of plunder but from motives of revenge The Vejentes no less hum bled by these depredations than their tate defeat sent deputies to Rome to sue for peace They were fined ia a part of their territory but obtained a truce for an hundred years These are the most remarkable transactions that hap pened in the reign of Romulus both in peace and in war none of which seem to discredit his divine original or the divinity ascribed to him after his death neither his courage in recovering his grandfather s kingdom the wisdom of his ptan in building nor his Economy in establishing his new city by arms and good policy For by the strength it acquired and the progress it made under him it enjoyed profound peace for the space of forty years after He was however a greater favourite with the people than the senate but above all particu larly dear to the soldiers of them he chose three hun dred to attend him in arms as a body guard in peace as well as in war and called them Ceteres or light horse â R CHAP XVI Romulus is carried out of sight and deified OMULUS having thus immortalized his name by the glory of his actions as he was haranguing his army at a review of his troops n a plain beside the Goat s pond a storm of hail and thunder rising all of a sudden hid the king in so thick a cloud as carried him quite out of sight Hot did he ever after make his appearance among the people The Roman youth having at last got the bet ter of their panic and the day recovered its former calm ness and serenity when

stood next him yet struck as it Were with awe for the loss of their father a mournful silence for some time prevailed Then a few of them leading the way the rest in one voice supported them ordering Romulus their king and founder of their city the son of a god to be addressed as a god With earnest prayers they invoke his favour and gracious protection on all occasions as they had the honour to be his own descendants I know it has been alledged that he was torn in pieces by the senators but that report was only retailed in whispers and gained little credit The present conster nation joined to the veneration they had for their king stamped a currency on the first account of the matter which was still more confirmed by the address of a single witness One Proculus Julius whilst the city was affect ed for the loss of their king and far from being satisfied with the fathers enters the assembly with a prodigious air of gravity as coming to deliver a message of singular importance Romulus says he  O Romans the father of this city suddenly descending from his ce lestial mansion appeared to me early this morning Whilst filled with sacred horror and reverential awe i stood beseeching his permission to look upon him Go says he tell the Romans it is the will of the gods that my Rome shall be the capital of the universe Let them therefore cultivate the art of war For they must know and they may hand it down to posterity that no power on earth shall be able to withstand the Roman arms â When he had thus spokeu he ascend ed into heaven The avidity with which this story was received and the joy diffused through all ranks from a belief of the king s immortality are equally inconceivable CHAJ XVII i f The Fathers and people agree to choose a King  J N the mean time ambition and plotting about the sue cession to the throne entirely engrossed the fathers They did not form parties for supporting the claim of any 40 TITUS LJVIUS BOOK I individual for nobody among a people so lately em bodied was conspicuous enough to have pretensions the contest was among the orders The Sabines contended that it was their turn to furnish a king as on their part none had succeeded toTatius as joint sovereign with Ro mulus and thereby their constitutional right was in danger of prescription The old Romans could not think of swearing allegiance to a foreigner But however much they differed in these â particulars they were all agreed in one essential that they must have a king for they had not yet tasted the sweets of liberty The fathers too were under no small concern lest whilst the city had no governor and the army no head they should be attacked by some foreign power especially as their neighbours bore them no good will Therefore they were determined to have some head though in the choice neither party would yield to the other For this reason the hundred fathers came to a resolution of sharing the sovereign power among them selves For this purpose they divided their number in to ten decuries one being chosen in every decury who should have the supreme direction of affairs and though ten governed only one of them was attended by the lie tors and ensigns of government Their power continued for five days and regularly passed through the whole for the space of a year that they had no king This interval of regal government from its own nature was called an interregnum a name it still retains After this the people began to complain that their slavery was increased in proportion to the number of their masters having now an hundred instead of one and seemed de termined for the future to obey but one king and him too of their own choosing When the fathers saw how matters were like to turn thought it most prudent to make a voluntary resignation of what they must soon lose and paid a compliment to the people by yielding to them the supreme power with this special provision that they should j ot by the concession give up their own privileges  For they enacted that the people should nave the nomination but that should only be valid when ratified by the fathers Upop this law though it is now CHAP tff ROMAN HISTORY l obsolete are founded the forms used in elections and passing bills even at this day For before a single vote is taken up a convention is called by the senate who can know nothing of the event Then the assembly being met the inter rex addresses them thus  Good fortunate and happy may it be Elect O Romans for yourselves a king The senate give their consent and if you pitch upon a prince worthy of succeeding Romulus will also ratify your choice The people considered this a very high compliment and that they might not be outdone in generosity they only voted and enacted that the election should be entirely left to tlio tat hers CHAP XVIII Numa appointed king A HERE was at that time a man of great reputation for piety and justice called Numa PprtyqJiiuS He resid ed at Cures a Sabine city and m t1i knowledge of all laws divine and human the age he lived in knew not his equal Because they can pitch upon no other philoso pher they give out but without reason that he was a disciple of Pythagoras the Samian who it appears flourished above a century after him in the reign of Ser vius Tullius and had a number of young men attending him in their studies in the remotest parts of Italy about Metapontus Heraclia and Croton From which places had he even been cotemporary with Numa how could fais fame reach the Sabines By what communication of language could he excite in any one an ambition for learning Or how was he escorted travelling alone through so many nations whose language and manners were so widely different I am rather of opinion that Numa owed his extra ordinary qualifications to the force of his own natura I genius and that he was not so remarkable for the ac quisition of foreign knowledge as he was a perfect mas ter in the severe and rigid discipline of the Sabines for merly in very high repute for its strictness and purity 42 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I Upon hearing the name of Numa mentioned the Roman fathers although they saw that the balance of power would be in favour of the Sabines should they take a king of that nation yet none of them had the assurance to put himself or any of his party or in fine any ol the senators or citizens in competition with him so that to a man they all agreed to confer the kingdom on Numa Pompilius Being brought to Rome in imitation of Romulus who before the city was built was raised to the throne by Augury he made it a point that the gods should also be consulted concerning his election He was then led into the citadel by an Augur who ever after had the honour to perform that ceremony on public occasions and set on a stone with his face to the south The Augur sat down on the left his head covered with a veil and a crooked rod in his right hand without a knot which he called Li tuus Having from thence taken a cursory view of town and country and prayed for him he marked out the quarters of the heavens from east to west calling that to the south the right and that to the north the left then looking forward as far as his eye could reach he mark ed the bounds in his mind Then shifting the Lituus to his left hand his right hand being laid on the head of Numa he prayed thus O father Jupiter if thou ap provest of the choice of the Romans in Numa Pom pilius whose head I hold to be their king I beseech thee give us some sure and evident signs expressive of thy pleasure within the bounds I have marked out Then he mentioned the omens he wished to appear and these being seen Numa is declared king and comes down from the temple CHAP XIX Numa builds tlie temple ef Janus UMA being thus raised to the throne lays a plan by justice laws and wise regulations to give the city a more solid foundation than that which was laid by force of arms But as he was extremely sensible that it would CHAP 19 ROMAN HISTORY 4 be quite impracticable amidst the noise and confusion of war to give minds already grown wild with the use of arms a relish for the arts of peace he resolved to sof ten and extinguish their martial ardour by degrees and therefore builds the temple of Janus at the end of the street Argiletum to be the sign of peace and war of war when operf of peace when shut Twice only since the reign of Numa has it been shut once in the consulship of Titus Manlius after the end of the first punicwar and a second time in the reign of the Em peror Caesar Augustus after the battle of Actium which gave peace by sea and land a happiness it hath pleased the gods to grant to our age Having made peace with all his neighbours by trea ties or alliances the temple of Janus was shut so having no apprehension of danger from abroad to prevent li centiousness the concomitant of idleness in his subjects at home whom fear of the enemy and military exercises had always kept in order he had recourse to religion proper impressions of which he conceived would be the most effectual means of civilizing a multitude at that period rough and unpolished to a great degree But as even these impressions could be but faint unless they were accompanied with something supernatural he pre tends that in the night time he was admitted to hold conferences with the goddess Egeria and instructed by her he instituted such sacred rites as would be most ac ceptable to the gods to each of whom he also appoint ed their respective priests And first of all he made twelve lunar months the  measure of the year And because a lunar month does not consist of thirty days complete and some days are wanting to complete a full solar year he managed mat ters so by inserting intercalary months that twenty four of these years taken together should equal the same number of revolutions and the days should return to the tame point in the ecliptic He likewise distinguished the days into lawful and unlawful because on some days there would be no occasion for calling assemblies of the people  44 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I CHAP XX Nuata teaches religious rites AN the next place he set about the creation of priests although many of these offices he performed tUperson particularly in the department of priest of Jupiter But as in a military state he foresaw there would be more kings of the disposition of Romulus than of Numa who would head their armies in person that the religious duties incumbent on the king might not suffer in the mean time he instituted a priest who should constantly attend on the service of Jupiter and distinguished him ty a rich robe and royal curule chair To him he added two other priests one for Mars and another for Romu Jus He likewise made an election of vestal virgins an institution of Alban extraction with which the founder of the city was materially connected To these he ap pointed salaries out of the treasury because their atten dance in the temple admitted of no avocation Their virginity which was perpetual and ceremonies attend ing their ordination rendered their order venerable a nd sacred He likewise appointed twelve Salii for Mars Gradi vus f whose badge of distinction was an embroidered coat and a breast plate of brass to be wore above it The business of this order was to carry the celestial arms called Ancilia and to walk through the streets singing in concert and dancing in the comic and serious stile Then from the Patrician order he chose Numa Marcius the son of Marcus for hjghjgriest to whom he delivered a system of religious ceremonies in manuscript signed and sealed ascertaining the sacrifices the days when and temples where they should be offered  and the funds n hence money to defray the expence should be drawn AH other things public and private respecting the worship of the gods he submitttd to the judgment of the high priest that the people might never be at a loss  From SaKus the leader of a band of musicians brought by Evander f From Gradient denoting the regular inarch to an attack I From CHAP 21 ROMAN HISTORY 45 for advice or redress should any innovation be made in their religious ceremonies either by the neglect of their own or the substitution of others of foreign growth But to preside over matters of religion was not the only business of the high priest He was also to instruct them in the manner of performing funeral obsequies and appeasing tiie manes of the dead what prodigies from thunder or other phaenomena were to be consider ed as motives to action or cautions against it To gain this divine intelligence he dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius on the Aventine mount where he consulted him by augury in what acceptation the auguries should be taken CHAP XXI Numa institutes an annual festival and other sacrifices J HE minds of the people were now so totally engrossed with these deliberations and expiations that arms and acts of violence were rather an aversion and being made sensible that the deity presides over all human affairs from their constant practice of religious duties their sentiments of piety were so sincere that promises and oaths in the government of the city were as effec tual as the terror of the laws and punishment And now since the Roman citizens formed their manners upon the plan of their royal master which all consider ed as the most perfect model the neighbouring nations also who before had viewed Rome not in the light of a city but a camp set down in the heart of the country to oppress them were now impressed with so high an opinion of its sanctity that to give the least disturbance to a state entirely devoted to the service of the gods they reckoned the highest sacrilege There was a grove constantly watered by a spring issuing from a dark cave which ran through the middle of it Because Numa often retired thither by himself under pretence of meeting with his goddes  he conse crated the grove to the Muses where ho they and his  Prom Atic en 1 4d TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I wife Egeria might meet in sweet council together To the goddess Faith he also instituted an annual festival To that solemnity he ordered the priests to be carried in an arched chariot drawn by two horses having their hands during the service muffled up to the fmgers im porting that Faith ought to be protected and her seat made sacred even in thex right hands of men He insti tuted many other sacrifices and places where they were to be offered which the priests call Argei But nothing showed him greater in his political abilities or patriot virtues than his address in preserving the honour of the crown as well as the peace of the kingdom during the whole course of his reign Thus two successive kings improved and enlarged the state by different maxims the one by force of arms and the other by the arts of peace Romulus rigned thirty seven and Numa forty three years during which the state had not only ac quired vigour but a firmness of constitution by warlike exercises and wise regulations  CHAP XXII Tullus Hestilius succeeds Numa and makes war â with the Albans PON the death of Numa the administration once more returned to an interregnum Then Tullus Hos tilius the grandson of that Hostilius who distinguished himself so nobly in the action with the Sabines at the foot of the citadel was declared king by the people and the fathers confirmed their choice Tullus was so far from resembling his predecessor Numa that his turn for war was even stronger than that of Romulus his youth his vigour and his grandfather s glory serv ing as so many spurs to his native valour Moreover he thought the citizens with respect to arms had con tracted a rust through dissuetude and therefore was casting about on all sides for an object on which he might employ his arms Very opportunely for his views it happened that the Roman and Alban peasants had made mutual encroachments and reprisals on each other  From ArgUi Greeks CHAP 22 ROMAN HISTORY 4T Caius Cluilius presided then at Alba To demand re stitution ambassadors were sent much about the same time from bcjth courts The Romans were strictly enjoined by Tullus not to lose a moment in executing their commission because being convinced they would mce with a retusal he would thereby be furnished with a plausible pretence for declaring war The Alban ambassadors were not so alert they were received by Tuilus with much civility and respect and enjoyed themselves with him in all the pleasures ot social festivity the Romans in the mean time havingfirst demanded restitution and that bemg re fused them declared war within thirty days and returned with the news to Tullus Then the Alban ambassadors were admitted to an audience when the design of their embassy was inquired into Being ignorant of all that had past they began with long apologies  That it was with the utmost reluctance they should be obliged to express themselves in any manner disagrreable to Tullus and that nothing could have laid them under that necessity but the orders of their state â In one word they had come to demand restitution and in case of refusal to declare war Tuilus answered  Tell your master that the king of the Romans appeals to the gods whether Rome  or Alba did first contemptuously dismiss the other s ambassadors demanding satisfaction that upon that nation they may heap all the calamities of this war The Albans return and deliver the message Both parties now exert their utmost in making pre parations for war â a war indeed that had the nearest resemblance to that carried on between factipjjs of the  same community or rather of the same fanÂ ly i for both were of Trojan extraction because Lavinium was of Troy Alba of La jnium and the Romans were the race of the Atban kings But the manner in which the con test was decided prevented the effusion of much blood for they never came to a general engagement and both nations became one people at the expence only of the houses of one city which were demolished The Albans were first in the field and entering the Ronran territory with a prodigious army encamped and entrenched 18 TITUS LIVIUS Boon I themselves within five miles of the city This intrench tuent was called the Cluilian ditch from the name of the general for some ages till the ditch and name together fell the victims of time In this camp the Albans lost their leader Cluilius and for his successor in the command chose Mettus FutTetiu In the mean time Tullus naturally brave and animated still more by the death of Cluilius gave out that the great God of heaven having already be gun at the head would not stop there but take ven ptanco on the whole Alban nation as the authors of this unjust war Wherefore passing the enemy s camp in the night he marches into the territory of Alba with a hostile army This motion drew Mettus out of his camp who having led his army as near the enemy s lines as possible dispatched a herald with his compli ments to Tullus and orders to tell him that previous to any engagement it would be for their mutual interest to have an interview  Tullus did not decline the meeting but suspecting it was only calculated to amuse him draws out his army into the field as did the Atbans also Whilst both ar mies stood drawn up in order of battle the generals escorted by a few of their principal officers advance to meet in the centre between the armies where the Alban delivers himself thus  I think I have heard Cluilius alledge as the grounds of this war the damages re ceived from Rome and the refusal of satisfaction in terms of the treaty and I doubt not O Tullus but on your side the same plea will be urged but if instead of amusing ourselves with appearances we state facts as they really are it will not be denied that Â ambition and a thirst of empire excite to arms two nations united both by blood and neighbourhood whether justly or not I shall not determine that con sideration belongs to the author of the war the ma nagement of which the Albans have committed to me as their general Of one thing O Tullus 1 beg leave to remind you that we are both but you parti cularly hemmed in by the powerful states of Etruria and as you lie nearer them than we you must be the  more sensible of the propriety of this observation By CHAP 2Â ROMAN HISTORY 49 land they are powerful and mighty by sea Re member that the very moment the signal of battle shall be given they will become spectators and will not fail to attack the conquerors and conquered equally weakened and exhausted by fighting against each other Wherefore if we are not destined to destruction since not satisfied with the liberty we enjoy we will run the hazard of empire or slavery let us adopt a plan for ascertaining this point with out much loss of blood or prejudice to either The proposal was not disliked by Tullus though his native courage and hopes of victory inclined him more to a battle Whilst they were deliberating on the method to be taken chance pointed out a way agreeable to both CHAP XXIV Treaty relative to the Horatii and Curiatii JL HERE were at that time in each army three twinw brothers differing very little either in point of years or strength That the brothers on the one side were called the Horatiii and the other the Curiatii is admitted by all nor can antiquity produce an instance of gallantry more noble Yet in the history celebrated as it is there is still a doubt to which side the names respectively be longed In this point authors differ but most are of opinion that the Horatii were Romans which I am in clinable to follow The generals on each side propose to the brothers respectively to decide by their swords the fortune of their countries and withal to remember that sovereign ty was to be the certain consequent of victory Both accepted with joy and the time and place is fixed for the combat previous to which it yvas confirmed by treaty between the contending powers that the nation to whom the victors belonged should command and govern the other by just and equitable laws Other treaties may have different clauses but they are all expede in the same uniform 50 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK I This treaty was ratified in the following form and it is surely the most ancient record in history A herald put the question to king Tullus Is it your pleasure O King that I enter mto a treaty with the Pater Patra tus of the people of Alba The king answering in the affirmative Give me then vervain O king con tinued he  take it up pure rejoined the king the herald took up a pile or pare grass from the temple and then put this second question  Do you O kmg consti tute me the royal ambassador of the Roman people Do you appoint me an equipage and a retinue To which the king made answer  Whatever I can do with out prejudice to myself or the Roman people that I do The herald was Marcus Valerius who nomi nated Spurius Fusius the pater patratus touching his head and hair with vervain It is the business of the pater patratus to administer the oath by which the treaty is ratified and this he does in along form of words too tedious to mention the se veral clauses and conditions being all read over  Hear O Jupiter says he  give ear O pater patratus of the Alban people and ye O people of Alba hear that the Romans shall not be the first to depart from these conditions which out of these waxed tables without fraud or equivocation have from first to last been read over in your hearing in the real accepta tation in which they are this day taken and under stood And if by public authority or fraudulent de sign they should be the first to break through these conditions may thou O Jupiter that moment so strike the Roman people as here this day I strike this hog and may thy stroke great Jupiter be as much heavier as thy power is greater â Having thus spoke he struck the hog dead with a flmt The Albans took their own oath and went through their own forms with their own dictator and priests CHAP 25 ROMAN HISTORY 51 1 CHAP XXV The combat of the Horatii and Curiatii J HE treaty being thus concluded the three brothers on each side take arms according to agreement Whilst each party are animating their respective champions by representing that their gods their country their fathers and mothers the whole city and army had their eyes fixed on their swords and actions the combatants brave of themselves and still more invigorated by such press ing exhortations advance to the centre between the two armies The two armies were ranged on both sides round the field of battle safe from danger for the present but anxious for the future because empire was at stake depending on the exertions and fortune of so few Where fore agitated with these reflections and solicitous about the event they turn their whole attention to a sight which could not be very agreeable The signal is given and the champions march boldly three and three against each other themselves alone in spired with the courage of great armies Both insensi ble of their own danger having nothing before their eyes but the slavery or liberty of their country the future destiny of which must entirely depend upon their present exertions The moment thes clashing of their weapons is heard and the glitter of their swords seen the spectators seized with fear and alarm whilst hopes of success inclined to neither side continued motionless and seemed to have lost the power of speech and even of breathing When they were thus fairly engaged not only the motion of their bodies and the brandishing of their weapons attracted the eyes of the spectators but the wounds and blood running from them Two Ro mans dropped dead at the feet of the Atbans who were wounded all three Thejpfall was instantly announced by the loud and joyful shouts of the Alban army whilst the Roman legions remained without hope but not with out anxiety trembling for the single Roman who now stood surrounded by the three Albans Happily he was not wounded V 52 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I Thus though he was no match for them altogether he was more than a match tor any one of them singly Therefore to separate his opponents he takes to flight being persuaded they would follow him with more or less expedition as their strength after so much loss of blood would permit them Having now got a little wav from the seat of action he turned and saw the Curiatii pursuing him at considerable distances from each other and one of them not far behind him Upon him he turns with all his force and while the Alban army were crying out to his brothers to assist him Horatius having already dispatched his man runs to a second engage raent It was then the Rdmans animated their cham pion with great shouts such as generally proceed from unexpected joy whilst he on the other hand made haste to finish his business and before the other who was at no great distance could come up to assist his brother he laid him breathless at his feet The number on each side was now equal but their strength and hopes very different The Roman yet without a wound and flushed with his double victory advanced with great spirit to the third combat His an tagonist on the other hand weakened with the loss of blood and spent with miming could scarce stand upon his legs and being already vanquished in the fall of his brothers encounters the victor But this could not be called a combat The Roman then cried out with an air of triumph  The two first I have sacrificed to the manes of my brothers the third I am now to sacrifice to the honour of my country that Rome â may give laws to Alba Curiatius could scarce stand up under his arms so the other plunged hjs sword in his bosom and stripped him as he lay dead j   â The Homans receive Horatius into their camp with expressions of joy and acknowledgments proportioned to the risk they had run After this both parties applv themselves to bury their dead but with minds widely different the Romans having acquired a considerable accession of power whilst the Albans were become theh subjects Their tombs are still to be seen on the very spot where each of them fell These of the two Horatii CHAP 26 ROMAN HISTORY 53 nearer Alba and of the Curiatii towards Rome but OB different spots where they respectively fell CHAP XXVI Horatius airaigned and acquitted 1JEFORE they left the ground Mettus went up to Tul lu and in terms of the treaty asked his commands Tul lus orders him to keep the youth in arms as in case of a war with the Vejentes he might have occasion for their assistance After this both armies returned home Horatius marched at the head of the Romans bearing before him the triple spoils he had so gloriously obtained His sister promised in marriage to one of the Curiatii came out to meet him at Porta Copena Perceiving on her brother s shoulder a military cloak wrought with her own hands and presented to her future spouse she tears her hair and sheds a torrent of tears in mournful ac cents calling upon her lover now no more The young conqueror offended with his sister s lamentations amidst the public joy and his triumph stabs herin the transport of his passion with these severe reproaches  Go unnn natural sister go to thy lover with thy unseasonable passion thou who forgettest thy dead brothers thy living brother and thy country Thus let her perish who shall ever dare to lament the death of an enemy to Rome To the senate and people of Rome this seemed a ne farious deed but the lustre of his recent victory plead ed strongly for the offender He was dragged however to stand his trial before the king who to avoid passing a sentence in so dismal and unpopular an affair or or dering execution after sentence should be pronounced having called an assembly of the people  I appoint Duumvirs says he to try Horatius according to law The law was of a horrible tenor Let the Duumvirs judge of the felony if the pannel appeal from their sentence let his appeal be received If their sentence be confirmed let him be hood winked and hanged with a rope upon an accursed tree having been first scourged either within or without the Pomoerium 54 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I Thus were Duumvirs appointed who thought accord ing to the letter of the law they could not acquit him even had he been innocent wherefore havmg found him guilty one of them condemned him in these words Publius Horatius 1 judge thee guilty of murder Go Lictor bind his hands The Lietor had come up and vas fastening the rope when Horatius by the advice of Tullus a mild interpreter of the law cried out I ap peal upon which the cause was carried before the people During the trial the judges were moved with com passion especially when old P Horatius cried out That it was his own opinion his daughter had justly me riled her fate for had he thought bis son criminal he would by his paternal authority have punished  him  Then having recourse to entreaties conjuring them not to render him childless now whom but a little before they had seen blessed with an eKcellent progeny In the mean time the old ma n embracing his sou and pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii deposited in that place which they now call Pila Hnratia Is it possi ble continued he O Romans that you can tamely l i lu Id this brave champion who but a little while ago walked in your sight glorious and triumphant adorned with the spoils of your enemies bound to ait infamous stake â expiring amidst scourging and tor tures A spectacle so shocking that even the Albaas could hardly bear Go Lictor bind those victorious hands which so lately in arms acquired empire for the people of Rome veil the head of the deliverer of this city hang him on an accursed tree scourge him either within the Pomrerium so it be done amidst the Pila Horatio and spoils obtained by his valour or without the Pomoarimn provided it be among the tombs of the Curiatii For which way can you lead this youth where he shall not find in the monuments of his glory a protection against the ignominy of such a punishment The people could not hold out against the tears of  A square pillar built of stone CHAP 27 ROMAN HISTORY 55 the father nor sufficiently admire the undaunted spirit of the son which was proof against every danger He was therefore acquitted rather out ot a regard to his bravery than from a conviction of the justice ot his cause But not to leave so manifest a murder wholly unpunish ed the father was ordered to make satisfaction for him out of the public treasury At the same time having made some expiatory sacrifices which were ever after kept up in the Horatian family he set up a gallows in the high way under which his son behoved to pass hood winked as if he had passed under the yoke The remains of the galiows may be seen at this day repair ed at the public expense known by the name of the Sister s Rafter A tonfb of square stones was erected for Horatia in the place where she was killed CHAP XXVII The Atbans revolt 1 HE peace with Alba did not hold long The people were highly offended that the fate of the whole nation had been committed toMhe arms and gallantry of three combatants which put the fluctuatmg genius of the dic tator upon new schemes with a view since good policy had not succeeded with him to recover the esteem and confidence of his citizens by the most perfidious de signs Wherefore as but lately he had courted peace when he had war for an alternative so now in peace he wishes for war And conscious that the power of the Albans was by no means equal to their inclination he makes it his business to stir up other states to make war openly and avowedly whilst he and his people under the mask of allegiance should act as traitors The Fidenates a Roman colony in concert with the Vejentes their allies assured of the revolt of the Albans take the field The Fidenates having thus openly de clared themselves Tullus sends for Mettus and his army from Alba and marches against the enemy Having crossed the Anio he encamped at its conflux with the Tiber between which place and Fnlenae the Vejentes had crossed the Tiber They draw up on the right to wards the river and the Fidenates on the left towards 56 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I the mountains To the Vejentes Tullus opposes his Romans and to the Fidenates the Albans Mettus as destitute of courage as of honour durst neither main tain his post nor pass over at once to the enemy but withdrew imperceptibly up the hills till fmding he was sufficiently remote that he drew up on the eminence and to spin out the time whilst he was still in suspense he extended his line His purp ose was whatever way fortune should flow to follow the tide The Romans who were posted next them were struck with amazement at first when they saw their flanks left exposed by the desertion of their friends and they in stantly dispatch a trooper at full gallop to inform the king that the Albans were retiring Tullus amidst this consternation vows twelve Salii and temples to Pallor and Pavor Then rebuking the trooper with a voice loud enough to be heard by the enemy he orders him back to his post telling him that he had nothing to fear for it was by his orders the Albans had made a circuit that they might fall on the unguarded rear of the Fide nates He also orders the cavalry to carry their spears high by which expedient the greatest part of the Ro man foot saw nothing of the motions of the Alban They who observed them thinking only of what they had heard from ihc king fought with the greater ar dour The panic was now transferred to the enemy for they had heard distinctly what the king said and most of the Fidenates as being a Roman colony under stood Latin Wherefore that their retreat from the town might not be cut off by the sudden descent of the Albans they made the best of their way Tullus pur sues and that wing where the Fidenates were posted being thus routed he falls with redoubled fury on the Vejentes who were already disheartened by the flight of their allies Nor could they stand so vigorous a charge The river however which was in their rear obliged them to keep in a body At last when they could stand it no longer many of them quitting their arms threw themselves headlong into the river others whilst they were deliberating on the banks whether to fight or fly were cut to pieces â This perhaps was tha hardest worl ihe Romans ever had  CHAP 28 ROMAN HISTORY y 1 CHAP XXVIII Mettus Fuffetius punished 1 HEN the Alban army who had only been spectators of the action were led down into the plain Mettus con gratulates Tullus on his victory and Tullus returns the compliment with a good grace He then orders the Al bans to join their camp to his and wishes much prospe rity to follow the junction Preparations are made for a sacrifice of purification against next day All things being prepared as usual both armies are summoned to an assembly The heralds beginning at the outmost lines gave the first intimation to the Albans who instigated with curiosity crowded round the king to hear his speech The Roman legion stood round the Albans as previously ordered in arms and the centu rions were appointed to see the orders put in immediate execution Then Tullus addresses himself as follows Ifever O Romans in any war you had reason first to thank the gods for their protection and to congratulate your selves on your own bravery it was certainly in yes terday s action For you had to contend not only with your enemy s forces but what is much more dangerous and terrible with the treachery and perfi diousness of friends For be no longer deceived it was not by my orders the Albans retired to the hills I suffered you to believe and even declared aloud that it was my command that you might not take the alarm at being deserted and to spread terror among the enemies who thought they were to have been at tacked in the rear But all the Albans are not cul pable They followed their iertder as you would have done had I given yoa the like orders It was Mettus drew them after him It was Mettus who was the contriver of this war It is Mettus who is the vio later of the Roman and Alban treaty Let any one copy after him if I do not make him this day a no torious example to all mankind At that instant Mettus was surrounded by the Qenturions in arms and 58 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I then the king proceeded in continuation For the ad  vantage prosperity and felicity of the Roman people  for nry own and for yours O Albans I ana resolved to remove all the inhabitants of Alba to Rome to make the people citizens and the nobles senators In one word to unite the two nations in one city and one commonwealth that as Alba once formed two nations of one she may now return to unity again The Alban youth at these words were variously agi tated in their minds but seeing themselves surrounded with armed soldiers they were all impressed with the same common fear which kept them silent Tulius then turning to Mettus resumed his discourse  If said he  you could learn to be true to your word and faith ful to treaties I would suffer you to live and be my self your instructor but as I see your disposition iis incurable you shall by your punishment teach man kind to hold those things sacred and inviolable which you have disgracefully infringed As therefore in yesterday s action you kept your mind divided be tween Rome and fridenae so shall you to day give your body to be divided and torn asunder Then he ordered two chariots to be brought drawn iby four horses and Mettus to be tied thereon stretched at full length The horses were then xlrawn different ways and his body torn in pieces each chariot carrying along with it the members which had been tied to it The spectators could not stand the shocking sight but turned away their eyes â This was the first and last punishment among the Romans that seemed inconsistent with the laws of humanity In all other instances they could boast that no other nation punished with less se verity CHAP XXIX Alba destroyed J N the mean time the horse had been previously dis patched to Alba to bring the people to Rome and after that tbe foot to demolish the city Their entry there was not attended with that tomult and confusion which generally accompany the taking of towns when thfe CHAP 30 ROMAN HISTQRY 59 conquerors breaking open the gates battering down the walls or forcing the citadel spread themselves through every quarter and with dreadful cries destroy all with fire and sword But here a mournful silence and sullen grief had so arrested every faculty that through fear they forgot what they had left behind or shoutd carry with them listless and absent often asking one another the same questions One while they stood motionless at the doors of their houses and another ran through them in distraction only to see them for the last time But when the horsemen became clamorous and urgent for iheir departure when thev now heard from the remotest corners of the city the noise of the falling houses when the dust rising in different places had darkened the horizon then snatching up what they could they march away leaving behind them household gods country gods and the roofs under which they had been born and brought up Already had a long train of emigrants lined the streets The mutual sight of their calamities by a na tural sentiment of compassion made tears of sympathy flow afresh Lamentations and mournful cries were heard especially of the women when in passing their august temples they saw them beset with armed men and left their gods as it were prisoners of war When the Albans were all out the Roman soldiers levelled to the ground all the buildings public and private Thus in one hour the work of four hundred years the time Alba had stood was entirely demolished and razed to the ground The temples however by the king s ex press order were spared CHAP XXX The Albans made citizens of Rome War declared against the Sahincs JVOME in the meat time improved greatly upon the rums of Alba The number of citizens was doubled It was then that mount Claelius was added to the city upon which Tullus built a palace for himself and resid 60 TITUS LIVIUS   BOOK I ed ever after to encourage others to build there also He admitted among the patricians the principal families of Alba such as the Julii Servilii Quintii Geganii Cu riatii and Claelii that the patrician order might be in creased in proportion and upon this accession to the order he built a temple for a senate house which our fathers knew by the name of Hostilia And that every order might derive some additional strength from the ac cession of the Albans he formed from among that peo ple ten centuries of knights With them also he re cruited the old and formed new legions Being now confident of his strength he declares war against the Sabines a nation at that time next the Etrurians the most populous and powerful of all their neighbours Encroachments had been made and satis faction demanded by both parties to no purpose Tul lus complained that some Roman merchants had been seized at a public market near the temple of Feronia the Sabines that some of their people were detained at Rome although they had fled for protection to the asylum From these injuries the war is said to have originated The Sabines being well aware that their strength had suffered a considerable diminution in the party incor porated by Tatius with Rome and that the Roman power had been considerably increased by the accession of Alba thought proper to look about for foreign aid Etruria lay next them  and of jthat country the Vejentes were their nearest neighbours From thence they drew volunteers who when the ashes of former wars were raked up in their minds were easily prevailed on to re volt Vagrants too among the poorer sort enlisted in their service for pay but by public authority they had no assistance for the Vejentes strictly observed the trea ty made with Romulus and it is not surprizing that they were joined by none of the other powers Both parties having made all possible preparations and nothing remaining now but to strike the first blow Tullus begins to march his army into their country A bloody actio ensued near the malefactor s forest ia which the Roman army proved far superior not only in the weight of their infajUry but also by the late aug CHAP 31 ROMAN HISTORY 61 mentation of the horse It was by a vigorous charge of the Roman horse that the ranks of theSabines were first broke after which they could neither fight nor fly without being exposed to a most dreadful slaughter  J CHAP XXXI  r  Tullus killed by lightning  PTER PTER this defeat of theSabines when the administra tion of Tullus was in high repute and the Roman affairs in a most flourishing state news were brought to court that it rained stones on mount Alba As the thing seemed incredible proper persons were sent to examine into it more minutely who saw them fall thick from heaven like hailstones driven by the wind in balls along the ground Moreover they thought they heard a voice thundering from the grove on the summit of the hill enjoining the Albans in sacred matters to observe the files of their country which they had totally overlooked as if they had abandoned their gods with their country having either conformed to the religion of Rome or being dissatisfied with fortune had given themselves no trouble about religion as often happens in such cases  Upon account of this prodigy the Romans too either instigated by the voice thundering from mount Alba for that is also alledged or by the advice of the Aruspices instituted expiatory sacrifices which lasted nine days Certain it is that the same kind of solemnity is yet in use for whenever the city has been alarmed with any similar jrodigy nine days have always been employed in such expiations Not long after the plague raged among them which though it checked their military ardour Tullus who breathed nothing but war gave them no respite from arms pretending that the youth had a better chance in action abroad than in idleness at home till at length he was himself seized with a lingering distemper Then his spirits great as they were fell so low and his body so weak that he who hitherto had thought it a weak ness unbecoming a king to mind the ceremonies and observances of religion all at once became a slave to the D â 62 TITUS L1VIUS BOOK I lowest and most childish superstitions and by his ex ample the people were also infected For the Romans in general returned to the same spirit that prevailed un der Numa persuaded that no other means were leftthem â of escaping from the present calamity but recourse to the gods and appeasing their wrath with sacrifices It is also said that the king himself in examining the register of Numa found that there were certain private sacrifices oflered annually to Jupiter Eliciu which he shut himself up to perform Butsoniething being wrong either in point of time or mode of execution he saw no sigu from heaven of its acceptance and besides Jupiter â was so provoked at his mistaken zeal that he and his house were consumed with fire from heaven â Tullus â reigned with great glory for thirty two years CHAP XXXII Ancus Al riius renews tlie institutions of Numa A R  r the death of Tullus the administration agreeably to the constitution devolved on the Senate They named an inter rex who having called a convention Ancus Martius was declared king by the people and the Senate confirmed their choice He was the grandson of Numa by a daughter The new king mindful of his grand father s reputation found that however glorious the last reign had been iu other respects in the worship of the gods either in point of frequency or mode of perform ance there had been a prodigious neglect Therefore to avoid all innovations he resolved to restore the insti tutions of Numa and for that purpose he orders the high priest to collect them from the royal register and transcribe them upwn tables to be exposed to public view From this specimen his own subjects fond of ease and the neighbouring nations too gladly hoped that the king would implicitly follow his grandfather s plan in civil as well as religious matters In this confidence the Latins with whom Tullus had settled all things by treaty began to pull up a spirit and having made an incursion upon the Roman territory treated with inso  The fire from heaven iu ascribed to Ancus Mjirtius CHAP 32 ROMAN HISTORY 63 lence the Roman ambassadors sent to demand satisfaction imagining that the Roman king would waste his time in indolence among the chapels and altars The spirit of Ancus seemed to partake equally of the genius of Numa and Romulus He easily saw that pacific measures in the reign of his grandfather when the peo ple naturally fierce had been but lately settled was the best policy but how it would be no easy matter for him to enjoy the peace which had distinguished his grandfather s reign unless he should resolve tamely to put up with insults that his patience had been already tried and his good nature despised  for which reason to Rome at present a Tullus was more necessary than a Numa â However as Numa in time of peace had in stituted the ritual with respect to religion the ceremo nials with respect to war should be his care that war might neither be proclaimed nor carried on but in pro per form From the ancient nation of the Equicoloe he borrowed that ceremony observed by the heratds even at this day when satisfaction is demanded The ambassador the moment he reaches the frontiers of that people upon whom he is to make the demand his head being covered with a woollen cap cries out Give ear O Jupiter hear ye confines naming the country  let justice hear I am the public ambassador of the Uoman people I come with a legal and just coiamis sion let credit be given to what I say Then he makes his demand and takes Jupiter to witness If I with any fraudulent or wicked intent demand these persons and these effects to be restored to me then may I never return to nry country again These words he repeats as he enters the frontiers to the first man he meets as he enters the gates of the city and as he goes into the market place with the variation of a few words in the Form of the speech and oath If his demand be not satisfied in thirty three days after such requisition for so many days are allowed he then declares war in words to the following effect  Hear O Jupiter and you O Juno Romulus and all ye gods in heaven in earth and hell give ear I take â A highland people inhabiting tbe hills above the Tiber 64 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK 1 you to witness naming the people whoever they are that this is an unjust people who act not agree ably to the principles of equity But we will consult the fathers in our own country how we may best compel them to make restitution Upon this he returns to Rome for advice when the king lays the matter before the senate in words nearly as follows  Concerning such matters disputes and quarrels as the Pater Patratus of the Roman people hath declared to the Pater Patratus of the ancient La tins and such things as ought by the ancient Latins to have been yielded granted and done and the which by them have not been yielded granted nor done Say continued he addressing himself to the person whose opinion he first asked   give me your opi nion I think returned the other that they should be compelled to make restitution by fair and open war for this I declare myself and give my vote ac cordingly â Then the vote went round in order When the majority present declared themselves of the same opinion war was then said to have been unani mously determined on when the herald bearing a lance headed with iron or dipped in blood and burnt at the end went to the confines of the offending power and in the presence of three witnesses each at least fourteen years of age cried out  Because of the injuries done to and committed on the people of Rome by the peo pie of the ancient Latins and the ancient Latin men Because the people of Rome have commanded that war should be made upon the Latins and the senate of the people of Rome hath voted agreed and deter mined that war should be denounced against the an cient Latins I and the people of Rome do hereby war proclaim denounce and make upon the people of the ancient Latins and ancient Latin men and with these words he darted a lance against the enemies lands â This then was the mode of demanding restitution and proclaiming war against the Latins which posterity have ever after adopted CHAP 33 ROMAN HISTORY 65 CHAP XXXIII The Latins conquered and made free of the city X NCUS having committed the care of religious mat ters to the Fiamens and other priests and having levied la new army marched against Polytorium and took it by storm Then following the example of his predecessors in adding to the population of the city by adntitting the conquered nations he transported all the inhabitants to Rome And because all the ground about the Palatium â had been assigned to the ancient Romans that about the capital and castle to the Sabines and mount Caelius to the Albans the Aventine mount was appointed for the new people Soon after another set from Tellini and Ficana also taken were stationed in the same quarter Polytorium suffered a new siege some time after this having been a second time peopled by the Latins For this reason it was razed to the ground that it might npt be a place of refuge for the enemy After this Medulla became the seat of the war where several battles were fought with various success in which neither party had much advantage for the town was defended by strong works and an able garrison and the Latin army being encamped in the open plain had several skirmishes with the Romans At last Ancus mustering all his force for the first time obtained a complete victory and returned to Rome with a consider able booty On that occasion too many thousands of the Latins were received into the city and accommodat ed with ground to build upon near the temple of Murcia in order thereby fo join the Aventine and Palatine hills Janiculum was also added not for want of room but lest at any time it should become a lodgement to the enemy He thought proper alsp to join it to the city not only by a wall but also for the convenience of travelling by a wooden brjdge the first that was ever thrown over the Tiber The Fossa Quiritium which rendered the city less ac cessible from the lower grounds was also the work of  â â â cJ i  â â  â â â â 6Â TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I  Ancus The number of inhabitants being so considerably increased in such a multitude to distinguish between a good action and a bad was no easy matter so that many secret acts of villainy were committed Wherefore to check such growing licentiousness he built a prison in the heart of the city overlooking the forum Â lJnder the auspices of Ancus the city w not only enlarged but the Roman territories extended J The forest Micsia was taken from the Vejentes the Roman domain carried out to the sea Ostia built at the mouth of the Tiber salt pits dug about it and in grati tude for his extraordinary success he enlarged the tem ple of Jupiter Feretrfts CHAP XXXIV Luctano coma to Rome J N the reign of Ancus Lucumo a man of great sub stance and address came to settle at Rome Ambition and the hopes of rising to honours in the state a thing he found quite impracticable in his native Tarquinii as Iiis father was a foreigner were the leading motives to this measure He was the son of Damaratus of Corinth who having fled from his country for seditious practices happened to settle at Tarquinii where he married and had two sons Lucumo and Aruns Lucumo survived his 4 ather and succeeded to his estate but Aruns died be fore him leaving his wife pregnant The father did not long survive him and being ignorant of the circumstance of his step daughter s pregnancy made no provision for jt in his will The posthumous grand child having been disinherited before he was born was from that very cir cumstance called Egerius Lucumo on the other hand having now become sole heir of his father s fortune and his spirts rising with his circumstances became still more elevated upon his mar riage with Tanaquil a lady of great distinction who could not easily bear the thoughts that the rank of the man she had married should be below what her birth and high connections entitled her husband to have In short disdaining to live in her native city where her  nsband was not respected according to his merit be CHAP 34 ROMAN HISTORY 7 cause he was the son of an exile she persuades him to leave Tarquinii Rome of all others seemed te be the most eligible retreat In a new state where nobility is the perquisite of merit and but of short standing a man of courage and address would bid fair for distinction Tatins though a Sabine was raised to the throne Nu ma was called to the same dignity from Cures Ancus was born of a Sabine mother and had no other badge of nobility than a single statue of Numa Her arguments prevailed with Lucumo who was naturally ambitions and attached to Tarquinii from no other consideration but bat it gave birth to his mother Wherefore having sent oil their ertects tliey set out for Rome They happened to stop at the Janiculum where as he sat in the chariot with his wile an sagle falling gently with spread wings took of his cap and fluttering over the chariot with a prodigious noise as if sent down from heaven on purpose replaced it orderly on his head and then soared aloft It is said that Ta naquil received the omen with raptures being much versed in celestial prodigies as the Etrurians generally are and embracing her husband encourages him to look up for great honours and preferment assuring him That the bird had come from a quarter of the heavens peculiar to Tu â piter himself whose messenger he was That it had taken the omen from the vertical point of man and lifted the ornament of the human head to replace it there by command of the gods â Full of these thoughts and expectations they entered the city and having purchased a house he went under the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus Being a foreigner and very rich be soon became conspicuous at Rome where by the affability of his demeanour frank invitations and objiging manner of conferring favours he procured him self friends and promoted his interest insomuch that at last he came to be mentioned at court where by discharging his duty about the king with assiduity and politeness he soon became a very great favourite and was admitted a privy counsellor Aiid having on all occasions distinguished himself by his integrity and abi lities he was at last appointed guardian to the royal fa mily by the king s last will 68 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK I CHAP XXXV Lucumo succeeds Aucus XxNCUS reigned twenty four years inferior to none of his predecessors in the arts of peace or war His sons had now almost reached the age of fourteen for which reason Tarquin pressed tu bring on the election of a new king with the utmost expedition An assembly of the people being called he sent out the princes on a hunting match at the time of their meeting  It is remained of him that he was the first who openly solicited for the crown and had a public harangue calculated to secure his interest with the people telling them  That he did not ask a thing unprecedented or uncommon as he was not the first but the third foreigner who had as pired to the sovereignty of Rome so that none need wonder or take offence at his presumption That Tatius was both a foreigner and an enemy when he was made king and Numa l a stranger to the city was called without soliciting it to that high office That he the moment he could dispose of himself had removed to Rome with his family and fortune where be had spent a greater part of his life than where he drew his first breath and a part too best calculated for the discharge of civil offices That he had studied the Roman laws both sacred and civil in peace and iu war under king A ncus himself a master of whom he had no reason to be ashamed For loyalty and re â spect to his sovereign he was second to none and for  generosity and beneficence to others not even to the  king himself â Whilst he was enumerating these cir cumstances in his favour which by the bye could not be disputed he was declared king by a great majority of the people The same ambition which actuated Tarquin a man in other respects of an unexceptionable character in canvassing for the crown he also discovered after he hajl obtained it For being no less attentive to the esta blishing of bis own authority than the aggrandizement of the state he created an hundred new senators who from that time were distinguished by the title of Sena CHAP 36 ROMAN HISTORY 69 tores minorum gentium a party no doubt that would continue firmly attached to the prince by whose favour they were raised to that dignity The first that felt the weight of his resentment was the Latins From them he took Appiolse by storm and having returned with much more booty than couki have been expected from an expedition so inconsiderable he  celebrated his games at an expence and with a magni ficence above any of his predecessors The place for the Circus now called Maximus was then first marked out and divisions made for the senators and knights where they might erect scaffolds for their accommoda tion during the games These scaffolds were called Fori and supported by forked posts twelve feet high The games consisted chiefly in horses and boxers brought from Etruria and from that period have continued to be celebrated every year being sometimes called the Roman and sometimes the great games To private families also the prince let out the ground about the Fo rum for shops and piazzas CHAP XXXVI Tarquin makes war with the Sabines     J JLE was making preparations for raising a stone vail round the city but a war with the Sabines interrupted his designs The incursion was so unexpected that be fore the Roman army could march out to stop their pro gress they had crossed the Anio  Wherefore great was the alarm at Rome and in the first engagement though numbers fell on both sides the victory was disputed After this battle the enemy returned to their camp and the Romans got time to recruit Tarquin sensible that his army suffered much for want of horse resolved to add other centuries to the Ramnenses Titienses and Luceres and to distinguish them by his own name As Romulus had instituted this order by augury Attus Nayiu at that time much celebrated for his skill in the art contended that no alteration or new appointment could be made without the approbation of the birds At this the king flew in a passion and in ridicule of the 70 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I art as it is said  Come you conjurer says lie  tell me by augury whether what I just now conceive in my mind can be effected The other when he had consulted his birds returned and told the king it could surely be done Truly then says the king I was  just thinking within myself whether it were possible to cut this flint with this razor do take them and per form what your birds say is possible In a moment they say he cut the flint â A statue of Attus with his head veiled was erected in the Comitium upon the stairs on the left of the senate house where the affair happen ed They likewise add that the flint was deposited in the same spot where it might remain as a monument of the miracle to posterity This affair brought so much credit on augury and the college of augurs thai no matter of any moment in peace or war was ever after carried into execution till the birds were consulted Assemblies were broke up armies disbanded and negotiations the most important broke off when the birds were averse Tarquin at that time made no alteration in the cen turies of horse save only that he doubled the comple  ment of men in each corps so that the three centuries consisted of one thousand eight hundred knights CHAP XXXVII  Tarquin beats the Salines JriAVING thus augmented his cavalry he had another brush with the Sabines and although his army had been considerably reinforced yet with all the secrecy he could he put in practice the following stratagem He dispatched a party to set fire to a heap of timber as it lay on the banks of the Anio and afterwards to throw it into the river The timber thus set on fire and driven by the wind catched hold of the piles and boats and so set the bridge in a flame This contrivance damped the Sabin es not a little in time of action and after they were routed greatly retarded their flight so that many of them who might have made good their retreat were CHAT 33 ROMAN HISTORY 71 drowned in the river which carried their arms floating with the current to publish this signal victory at Rome before the arrival of the express The principal honour in this action was due to the horse for as they were posted in the two wings and observed the infantry which composed the main body of the army already giving way it is said they charged so briskly in flank that they not ojily gave a check to the Sabine legions who were carrying all before them but obliged them to retreat with precipitation The Sabines fled to the mountains in great disorder which only few of them reached the greatest part as formerly observed having been pushed by the cavalry into the river Tarquin determined to make the must of their terror sent the prisoners and booty to Rome and having piled up and set fire to the spoils which he had vowed to Vul can advanced with his army to the Sabine territories Although the Sabines had got a severe check and could see no prospect of being able to retaliate yet as there was no time for deliberation they came out with an army tumultuously assembled but they were routed again and being reduced to the last extremity sued for peace CHAP XXXVIII He builds a wall round the city and drains the water from the rallies V OLLATIA and the country about it in consequence of this victory was ceded to the Romans and Egerius the king s nephew left governor of the place It is how ever affirmed in history that Collatia capitulated and surrendered in the following form The king put the question  Are you delegates and deputies commission ed by the people of Collatia to surrender yourselves and them We are Are the people of Collatia their own masters They are Do you then surrender yourselves the people of Collatia their city their lands their water their marches temples utensils and every thing sacred or civil belonging unto them 72  TITUS UVIUS Book 1 into my power and that of the Roman people We have done it And I receive them The Sabine war being thus concluded Tarquin re turned to Rome in triumph Then he made war upon the ancient Latiusi and without coming to a general en gagement by appearing before their towns one after another he subdued the  whole nation The cities Corniculum Old Ficulnea Cumeria Crustumerium Ameriola Medullia Nomentum were either taken from the Latins themselves or from those who had revolted to them Now there was peace when he turned his niind upon carrying on the works he had begun in it even more keenly if possible than he had done the war that the people might have no more idle time at home in peace than abroad in arms For he not only made preparations for drawing a stone wall round that part of the city which had not been fortified the beginning of which had been interrupted by the Sabine war but be â cause the water could not be easily carried off from the flat grounds he drained the low places of the city about the Forum and the other vallies lying between the hills by common sewers which were drawn sloping to the Tiber Moreover he levelled an area for laying the foundation of a temple to Jupiter in the capital which he had vowed in the Sabine war anticipating even then in idea the future greatness of the place CHAP XXXIX A strange phenomenon XA BOUT this time a very surprising phenomenon for lowed by an event no less so happened in the palace The story goes that in presence of many the head of a boy cai ed Servius Tullius seemed all in flames whilst he was a leep The prodigious noise occasioned by this strange appearance awaked the royal family and when one of the servants was fetching water to extinguish the flame he was stopt by the queen who after the confu sion was over ordered that nobody should stir the boy till he should awake of himself Very soon the flame Chap 39 ROMAN HISTORY 73 disappeared with the child s sleep Then Tanaquil tak ing her husband aside See you that child said she whom we educate so meanly Let me tell you he will one day be a light to us in our distress and a protec tion to our house when we need it most Let jis therefore from this moment train up this youth with the utmost care for whom in a public as well as pri vate capacity great honours are reserved From that moment he was treated as their own and instructed in every science calculated to excite men of spirit to aim at high fortune What Heaven is pleased to countenance requires little cultivation from man Ser vius soon discovered a princely disposition and when they looked about for a son in law to the king was there one among all the Roman youth who could in any qua lification bear a comparison with him The king there fore gave him his daughter in marriage 1    Whatever it was that raised him to this honouraMe distinction it certainly discredits the conjecture that he was either born of a lave or that he himself when a child had ever been in the servile line I am rather f their opinion who think that after the capture ofOr uicolum the wife of Servius Tullius who had been a grandee in that city was left pregnant when her hus band was killed and that when she came to be knawn among the rest of the prisoners in consideration Â fher rank was rescued from slavery by the Roman queen and was delivered at Rome in the royal palace â That the child having been brought up at court from his in fancy had been much caressed and esteemed there an extraordinary friendship between the ladies having taken place upon so signal an indulgence and that the mo ther s estate which after her country was taken became the perquisite of the conquerors gave rise to the surmise that he was the son of a slave   J â 74 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I CHAP XL Turfjuin killed by a plot of the tons of Marcius 1 ARQUIN having reigned now upwards of thirty seven years Servius Tullius had not only by far the greatest share of the royal favour bi t also stood very high in the esteem of both senate and people About this time also the two sons of Marcius who had always reflected with indignation that their guardian had art fully tricked them out of their father s kingdom and secured it to himself a stranger descended of no family in Rome nay not even in Italy when they observed that the kingdom was not like to revert to them even after the death of Tarquin but to become the perquisite of the refuse of mankind set no bounds to their resent ment What said they shall the Roman state a century after Romulus its founder and sovereign while on earth whose extraction was divine and him self ranked among the gods be given to a slave â the son of a slave to reign over it while we the sons of Ancus are living Shall the Roman throne lie open not only to strangers but even to slaves Would not this be a reproach to the Roman name and an inde lible stain on that illustrious house which can never be wiped off By the sword therefore they resolve to do themselves justice But their indignation for the injuries they had received was rather excited against Tarquin than Ser vius as the revenge of a king was more to be dreaded than that of a private man moreover should they de stroy Servius Tarquin might provide himself in another son in law who could also succeed him for these rea sons the plot was laid against the king himself Two of the most resolute among the shepherds were chosen for executing their villainous purpose They had each such iron instruments as they used to carry in the country and pretending to quarrel at the gate of the palace made such a prodigious noise that they brought all the officers of the court about them Then when they both appealed to the king the noise they made reaching the CH AP 41 ROMAN HISTORY  75 inmost rooms of the palace they were called and accord ingly went before the king Upon theirfirst appearance they bawled out both at the same time the one striving to interrupt the other but when checked by the Lie tor and ordered to speak each in his turn they gave over their railing One of them then as had been con certed began to tell his story to which while the king was all attention the other lifting up his hatchet threw it against his head and leaving the weapon in the wound both ran instantly out of doors CHAP XLI Tarquin succeeded by SermusTttltius W I1ILST some of the company hastened to assist the wounded king the lictors pursued the rufftans and seiz ed them By this time there was a great uoise and con course of people about the palace wondering what could be the matter During the confusion Tanaquil orders the palace gates to be shut and having cleared it of the crowd she carefully gets every thing ready for the cure of the wound as if there had been hopes of her husband s recovery at the same time should no hopes remain she plans other expedients for her security Servius being called in all haste she carries him to her expiring hus band and taking his right hand in tier s she conjures him that he would not suffer his father in law s death to pass unrevenged nor his mother in law to be exposed to the insults of her enemies If you are a man Servius continued she the crown is thine not theirs who by the hands of assassins have committed the most exe crable villainy Take Courage then and follow the gods thy conductors who foretold thy future glory by the divine fire which shone around thy head let that celestial flame now warm thee Rouse thyself now in earnest We who were strangers have reigned here Consider who not of whom thou art If your own

Trabea attended by the Lictors and being seated on the throne determines some causes and leaves others undetermined till he should consult the king Thus therefore though Tarquin had been already dead

Vejentes the truce with them be ing now expired and the other states of Etruria In that war fortune conspired with his own native gallan try to ennoble Tullius for having routed the enemy s prodigious

CHAP XLIII     He divides tlie people into classes and centuries V yF those whose fortune amounted to or exceeded 100 000 asses of brass he made up eighty centuries one half whereof were of the aged citizens and one half of the younger These together were called the first class The design of the elder part was to have them aU ways at hand to guard the city of the younger to carry arms abroad The arms assigned them were a helmet a round shield boots a coat of mail all of brass These â â â i â Â Â  18 4d â â  78 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I were designed for defence a spear and sword were also given them as weapons of offence To this class were added two centuries of mechanics who were to serve without arms and to be employed in carrying the mili tary engines  The second class comprehended those whose estates amounted to 75 000 asses of brass and upwards to 100 000 and of those including old and young were made up twenty centuries Their arms were in every respect the same as those mentioned above excepting that they had an oblong shield instead of a round one and no coat of mail The third class lie appointed to consist of those who were rated at 50 000 asses f Tljese again with respect to difference of age and number of centuries were dis tinguished in UK same manner as the second nor was there any alteration in their arms  but that they had no boots In the fourth class the valuation was estimated at 2 5 000 asses t and the centuries the same as in the third This class bad no defensive arms but their offensive were a spear and a long javelin In the fifth class the centuries were increased to thirty and were armed with slings and stones Among them were reckoned the Accensi the blowers on the horn and pipers divided into three centuries This whole class consisted of those who were rated at 1 1 000 asses Â The sixth class comprehended all such as were below the last rate and of them one century was made up which was exempted from carrying arms The infantry being thus arranged and accoutred he raised twelve centuries of horse from among the princi pal citizens and to the three centuries instituted by Romulus he added six others by the same names assign

laid on the rich upon whom to balance the account was conferred an addition of honours For they did not now vote by poll as instituted by Romulus and followed by his successors nor were their suffrages of equal weight but a subor dination was established by which none seemed to be deprived of the right of voting and at the same time the balance of power lay entirely on the side of the principal The knights were first called then the eighty centu i of 4he first class If they happened to differ which was rarely the case the second class was called and it Avas seldom known that they ever came so low as the last class It needs be no matter of wonder that the present regulation since the increase of the tribes to thirty five should differ from the number of centuries of young and aged citizens instituted by Servius Tullius since they are now double the number of what they were at that time For having divided the city into four parts according to the quarters and hills which were then in habited he called these divisions tribes I fancy from the tribute they paid for he made out a scheme for levy ing the taxes according to the valuation of estates so that these tribes had not the least relation to the number and division of the centuries CHAI Enlarges the Pomarium and adds several hills to the city J HE Census being thus completed which the dread of tin fine enacted against those who should neglect to en rol themselves in the censor s books had greatly acce lerated he published an edict requiring all the Roman citizens horse and foot ranged according to their re

sacrifice of a sow a sheep and a bull and this was called the fmishing stroke of the lustrum because then the census was completed It is computed that eighty thousand citizens were inrolled in that census Fabius Pictor the oldest his torian we have adds  That this was the number of citizens fit to bear arms To accommodate this great number of people it was thought necessary to en large the city in consequence of which he added two hills the Quirinal and Viminal f and soon after the Esquiline where to give a reputation to the place he dwelt himself He fortified the city with a rampart ditches and a wall quite round it and consequently en larged the Pomcerium They only who have a regard to the natural significa tion of the word will have the pomaerium to be a space of ground without the walls but it is rather a space on each side of the wall which the Etrurians formerly in laying the foundation of cities consecrated by augury extending to certain lines on each side of the wall they intended to raise so that the houses might not be joined to it on the inside as they do generally at present and that on the outside there might be some ground left un tilled This space which could neither be ploughed nor built upon is by the Romans called ponuerium not more because it lies without the walls than because the walls lye without it And on all occasions when the city was enlarged in

which they had often disputed with their swords Although the Latins now seemed to have dropped all concern about what they had so often attempted to esta blish in vain fortune seemed to point out to one of the Sabines an opportunity of recovering the superiority to his country by a private scheme of his own A certain Sabine had a heifer brought forth among his cattle re markable for her size and beauty Her horns which were hung up in the porch of the temple of Diana re mained for many ages a monument of her enormous bulk The thing was considered and it could not well be doubted in the light of a prodigy and the sooth savers had foretold that the man who should sacrifice this heifef to Diana should certainly fix the sovereignty of his coun try This prediction had also reached the ears of the high priest of Diana The Sabine on the first day that seemed proper for the sacrifice drove the heifer to Rome led her to the temple of Diana and set her before the al tar Then the Roman priest struck with the extraordi nary size of the victim which had been so much cele brated by fame at the same time recollecting the pre diction thus addresses the Sabine  What do you pro pose friend says

them impartially the conquered lands he then ventur ed to put the question  Whether they willed and com manded him to be their king Upon which they re cognized him king with an unanimity scarce ever known before But this was so far from discouraging Tarquin or giving a check to his ambition that it only confirm ed his hopes for besides the impetuosity of his own temper he was constantly dunned with the solicitations of his wife Tullia he was not ignorant that the division of the conquered lands among the people was not agree able to the fathers and therefore he concluded that he had a noble opportunity in accusing Servius to the se nate of raking bis own reputation This produced a scene of the most inhumyi and savage cruelty in the court of Rome That the people disgusted at monarchy might the sooner enjoy the sweets of liber ty and that he should be the last king who should usurp the title by the commission of the work of crimes this Lucius Tarquinius whether he was the son or grandson of Tarquiuios Priscus is a question but out of respect to most authors I shall call him his sorr had a brother called Aruns Tarquinius remarkable for sweetness of disposition To these brothers as we have formerly ob served the two Tullias the king s daughters who were also very different in their tempers had been married It had so happened by the good fortune very probably of the Roman people that the two violent tempers were not united by which means the life of Servius was pro longed to form the morals of the state CHAP 47 ROMAN HISTORY S3 The savage Tullia was prodigiously fretted ibat she could find in her husband no spark of spirit or ambition i or which reason she was all in raptures with Lucius him she admired it was he that deserved the name of a uau â â he was indeed of the blood royal Her sister she despised who though she was matched with a man of spirit had not the resolution of a woman A similitude of tempers soon produced an intimacy between them for the wicked are the fittest company for each other However this ambitious woman laid the foundation of all the tragical scenes that ensued She had been in use to have private conversations with her sister s husband when she threw out the bitterest invectives against her husband to his brother and against her sister to her hus band j and insisted that it were better they were both free than so improperly matched to be obliged to lan guish in obscurity owing to the deadness of those with whom they were respectively connected If the gods had given her the husband she merited she would soon have seen the sovereign power in he r own family which she now sees in her father s JJy such insinuations the young man quickly imbibed all the venom of her malignant soul Aruns Tarquinius and the younger Tullia were buried almost at the same time to make way for a new connection which accord ingly happened rather without opposition from Servius than with his consent CHAP XLVII Tarquin usurps the throne T ROM this period Tullius s old age became every day more burthensome and his throne more uneasy For alter one rime this fury immediately set about contriv ing another fseiiher night nor day did she sutFer her husband to rest lest the parricides they had committed should lc e their intended eflect What said she do you think I wanted a man merely to be my hus band with whom I might

expectations of the people why do you suffer them to regard you as a man of a princely soul Go coward get you hence toTar quinii or Corinth and sink into the former obscurity of your family since you have more in you of your brother than your father By these and such reproaches the young man s mind was set on fire nor could she be at rest herself If Tanaquil thought she who was a foreigner had the address to dispose of the kingdom twice successively first to her husband and then to bet son in law shall I who am born a princess have no influence what  ever in taking away or bestowing a crown Tarquin impelled by the reveries of this mad woman renewed his intrigues among the senators particularly those of the last creation putting them in mind of his father s favours for which he now was soliciting a re turn The young men he engaged to his interest by presents promising to do wonders in his administration and wherever he went charging the king with the blackest crimes At last when he found a proper op portunity for putting his design in execution surround ed with a body of armed men he forced his way into the forum and whilst all present were struck with ter ror placing himself on the throne in the senate house he ordered the fathers to be summoned to attend king Tarquin in the house by the public crier They im mediately obeyed some because they were in the plot others through fear that their absence might be made CHAP 48 ROMAN HISTORY Â 5 a crime being astonished at the surprising revolution and fully convinced it was all over with Servius Then Tarquin began his invectives against the king with the obscurity of his birth  That being a slave and the son of a slave he had afier the cruel murder of Tarquin his father possessed himself of the king dom not after an inter regnum according to custom nor by the free voices of the people nor the approba tion of the senate but by the mere artifice of a wo man Thus descended and thus created king he had ever been the favourer of mean wretches like himself and out of hatred to the Patricians for their noble birth he had stript them of their estates to distribute them among the vilest of the people That the bur dens which before were common to all he had heaped on the nobles alone That he had instituted the census that the fortunes of the rich might be more visible to the eye of envy and be ready whenever he had a mind to throw them away among beggars CHAP XLVIII Tullius murdered by L Tarquin at the instigation of â Tullia VV HILST he was yet speaking Servius appeared hav ing been alarmed with the news of what was going on and immediately from the porch of the senate house cries out with a loud voice What is it you mean Tarquin What is it that has made you so audacious to convene the senate and take possession of my throne while I am alive I only take possession replied he sternly of my father s throne to which I am surely much better entitled than my father s slave a slave that has been too long permitted to insult his masters The parti zans on both sides set up a shout and the people crowd ed into the senate house it seeming now to be past a doubt that the sovereign power would follow the victory in this struggle Then Tarquin compelled by necessity to out brave every difficulty having much the advantage in youth and strength seized Servias by the waist and carrying E 86 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I him out of the senate house threw him from the top to the bottom of the stairs and hen returned to hold the senate The king s officers and attendants made the best of their way He himself quite faint was returning home supported by a small retinue half dead with fear and had got to the top of the Cyprian street when he was overtaken and slain by a party sent out by Tarquin for that purpose This happened it is thought by Tullia s advice as she had been deeply concerned in all the other villainous plots One thing however is certain that she drove in her chariot and without minding the crowd about her she called her husband out of the senate house and was the first to salute him king and being ordered by him to retire out of the crowd on her way home when she had reached the upper part of the Cyprian street where lately stood a temple of Diana as she was wheeling to the right towards the Virbian ascent which was the way to the Esquiline hill the charioteer struck with horror checked his horses and made a stop pointing to the bo dy of Servius which lay murdered in the street Cruel and inhuman is the action that is said to have followed upon this of which the place itself exhibits a proof they call it the wicked street in which Tullia racked and tortured with the furies of her husband and sister is reported in a fit of madness to have driven her chariot over the body of her father and to have carried home on her clothes and chariot part of his blood to her own house gods and those of her husband who being justly provoked at the barbarity of the action brought their usurpation speedily to an end suited to the wicked ness of its beginning The reign of Tullius had been so glorious forforty five years that it would have been hard even for a good prince a reasonable king to have filled his place with equal dignity â This too adds to the glory of his reign that the just and legal exercise of the royal prerogative fell at the same time with him Some authors are of opi nion that he had it in view to have resigned his power however mild and moderate the exercise of it had been because it was absolute had not the intrigues of his own family cut short his plan of fixing his country s liberty CHAP 49 ROMAN HISTORY 87 CHAP XLIX Farquin keeps an armed guard A IL C 220 J HEN Tarquin began to shew away in the regal func tion his arrogance procured him the sirname of proud for he refused to suffer the usual obsequies to be per formed for his father in law alledging for a reason that Romulus himself died without that honour The principal of the senators whom he suspected to have been in Servius s interest he put to death and being sensible that the base means lie had made use of to raise himself to the throne might become a president that would recoil upon hiaiseU he never appeared without a strong guard For indeed he had no legal pretensions to the crown but what were founded in violence and in justice having neither obtained the consent of the people nor the sanction of the senate Add to this that as he had no hopes of gaining the affections of the people he could only support himself on the throne from motives of fear the influence of which that he might make as universal as possible in all criminal causes he sat judge in person admitting neither the assistance nor advice of any assessor whatever This furnished him not only with an opportunity of butchering and banishing such as he hated or suspected but also of confiscating the effects of those whom he could charge with no crime provided he could enrich himself with their spoils Having by these means in particular very much re duced the order of the Fathers he determined to make no new creation that the order thus reduced might dwindle into contempt consequently be the more indif ferent that nothing was transacted by their means He was the first king who broke through a rule observed by all his prÂ lo essorsÂ pf consulting the senate upon every emergen y i All state affairs he managed by domestic counsels iVar peace treaties alliances he made with whomsoever he choosed and broke when he pleased by himself alone without the countenance or consent of se nate or people He was at great pains to make himself popular among 66  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I the Latins that by means of their power his safety at home might be less precarious Nor did he only culti vate friendship with their nobility but to make the con nection stronger by family alliances For he married his daughter to Octavius Mamilius Tusculanus the most il lustrious of the Latin name beinjr descended if we can believe the story of Ulysses and Circe by which means he secured in his interest the numerous iriends and rela tions of that nobleman CHAP L He appoints a general convention Inveighed against by Turnus Herdonius J ARGUIN having now a considerable weight among the Latin chiefs he appoints a day for a general conven tion at the grove of Ferentium pretending he had some thing to propose tor their common interest Great num bers appeared by tive morning s dawn Tarquin was in deed punctual to the day but not to the hqur for he did not make his appearance till a little before sun set Dur ing the whole day iu the course of their debates many observations were made in council Turnus Herdonius of Aricia inveighed bitterly against Tarquin in his ab sence exclaiming That it was no wonder that he was surnamed the proud at Rome for he went common ly by that name though it was only in corners and in whisper can any thing be more impudent than to trifle thus with the whole Latin name To sum mon hither the Latin chiefs from so great a dislancei and yet the scoundrel who had appointed the meeting not deign to appear himself Doubtless he means to put our patience to the test and to judge by our tame ness how far he can subject and oppress us when we have no moans of relief Is there any of us so blind as not to fmd out that he pretends to an hereditary right over the Latins Supposing his own subjects had made a judicial surrender of their liberties to him if that might be called a surrender which had been â Now Marino CHAP 51 ROMAN HISTORY 89 extorted by parricide the Latins being a distinct peo ple were under no obligation to follow the example But if the Romans now repent of what they have done being butchered exiled and robbed one after another by that rapacious wretch can the Latins find in Tar quin a less cruel and covetous master If they will take my advice they will immediately return home and mind the assembly day no more than he that ap pointed it Whilst this seditious and enterprising man who had by his address amassed a great fortune at home was proceeding in invectives against Tarquin he made his appearance in the assembly which put an end to the harangue Every one turned about to pay his compli ments to Tarquin who when silence was made being put in mind by some that sat next him that he ought to make an apology for coming so late he answered  That he had been engaged making up a difference between a father and a son and that his concern to see them reconciled had detained him so long It is said Tur nus did not suffer this excuse to pass uncensured for he told him That no process on earth could be shorter than between a father and son nor required a briefer sentence â if the son would not obey the father he would be considered as a worthless wretch CHAP LI Tarquin conspires against Turnus JL HE Arician having thus cavalierly rated the R p man king left the council which sinking deeper in the stomach of Tarquin than he choosed to express he im mediately plots against the life of Turnus with a view in his fate to impress the minds of the Latms with the same ideas of terror 6y which he had over awed the minds of his own subjects And because he had no authority to put him to death onenly he procured his destruction though innocent by a fictitious impeach ment By means of some Aricians of an opposite party he prevailed on Turnus s slave for a sum of money to 90 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I permit them to hide a great quantity of arms in his master s lodgings Tarquin having completed all his scheme in the course of one night sent for the La tin chiefs a little before day and as if he had been alarmed with some extraordinary discovery told them That his absence yesterday had been ordered by the wise providence of the gods both upon their account and his own That Turn us he was told had concert ed measures to dispatch him and the principal of the Latins that he alone might have the supreme power over the nation That the attempt would â have been made yesterday in the convention had it not been delayed because he who had called the council and whom he particularly pointed at was absent That for this very reason he had spoke so illiberally of him in his absence because his late appearance had disconcerted his measures He had no doubt if his intelligence was good but by day break when the assembly meets he will come in arms with a band of conspirators that he was also informed that a great number of swords had been se cretly conveyed to him which whether true or false could be discovered in a moment Upon this he re quested that they would go along with him to Tur nus The violence of Turnus s temper his speech the day before and Tarquin s late appearance in the assembly because it seemed as if that circumstance had delayed the intended massacre all put together made the thing look suspicious wherefore although they accompanied Tarquin disposed to give credit to his report yet they were of opinion that should the swords not be found wkh him it would all go for nothing When they came to his lodgings they awaked Turnus set a guard upon him and seized his domestics who out of affec tion for their master began to make opposition when the arms that had been concealed were brought from every corner of the apartment The truth of the matter now seemed indisputable and Turnus was clapped in chains Immediately a council of the Latins was called in a prodigious hurry where the swords produced in court exasperated them so much against him that CHAP 52 ROMAN HISTORY l would not hear him in his own defence but condemned him to a new kind of death to be thrown in at the head of the spring of Ferentinum with a hurdle laid on him covered with stones heaped on it and there drowned CHAP LII Tarquin s address to the assembly L ARQUIN having recalled the Latins to the assem bly and having commended them highly for the just punishment they bad inflicted upon Turnus for the mtended massacre proved against him to pave the way for a revolution in the state addressed them in the fol lowing terms  That he could plead an ancient right seeing all the Latins came originally from Alba that they were included in that treaty whereby the whole Alban state with its colonies had submitted to the government of Rome in the reign of Tullus But he thought it would be more for the common interest if that treaty were renewed And that the Latins should rather share with the Romans in their good for tune than either be in perpetual terror of or subject ed to the destruction of their towns or devastation of their lands as had been the case first in the reign o Ancus and then in that of his own father The Latins were easily persuaded although they saw that the balance of mterest lay upon the side of the Ro mans when they found that the leading men of the na tion were disposed to coincide with and stand by the king s motion Besides they were tauyht in the exam ple of Turnus what they had to expect should any of them be so bold as oppose him Thus was the treaty renewed and the Latin youth ordered by proclamation in consequence of this treaty to assemble in arms on a certain day at the grove of Ferentinum When those of all the different tribes had rendezvoused at the place appointed agreeable to Tar quin s proclamation that they might have no leader of their own no separate command or ensigns of distinc tion he blended the Romans and Latins together in eve ry company making one of two and two of o e Hav 92 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I ing thus doubled the number of companies he appoint fl Centurions to command them CHAP LIII Defeats the Volsci and tuith the spoils builds a tÂ iple to Jupiter Capitolinus JL UT though Tarquin was a tyrannical prince in time of peace in war as a general he made no despicable figure In that art he would not have been thought in ferior to his predecessors had not his degeneracy in other respects eclipsed that brighter part of his character He was the first who carried the Roman arms against the Volsci and began a war which subsisted for two hun dred years after him from them he took Suessa Pome tia by storm In the division of the plunder when he reserved forty talents of gold and silver to himself he conceived in idea the dimensions of a temple which should be worthy the king of gods and men adequate to the dignity of the Roman empire and suited to the BiHJÂ ty of the place where it was to be erected The money saved from the spoils of the Volsci he set apart to defray the expence of building it  After this a war he had undertaken did not keep pace with his hopes It was against the Gabii f a city in the neighbourhood for the reduction of which he had exerted his utmost but in vain Having been often repulsed with loss and seeing no probability of succeeding by a siege at last he had recourse to fraud and stratagem arts never practised by the Romans to accomplish his purpose For pretending to have laid aside all thoughts of war his attention being wholly engrossed with laying the foundation of the temple and other public works his son Sextus the youngest of three as concerted between his father and him made his elopement to Gabii where he exclaimed against his fa ther s inhuman cruelty declaring  That he had now shifted the scene and turned away his insupportable pride from other objects that the whole weight of it  jÂ 7750 t Now fcelenna CHAP 3 ROMAN HISTORY  03 might fall upon his own family that the number of his family affected him prodigiously and for that reason he intended to make his own house as thin as he had done the senate house so that he might leave no representative nor heir to his crown For his own part that he had escaped his father s fury amidst swords and daggers and was fully covinced that he could be safe nowhere but among the enemies of Tarquin For that they might not be imposed on the war was by no means discontinued as it was pre tended  but only with a view of attacking them upon an occasion when they should be lulled in security If there was no place among them to serve as a refuge for the distressed he would wander all over Latium and there should there be occasion he should make his suit to the Silqui the Volsci and Hernici till he should have the good fortune to meet with some hos pliable power who knew how to protect children from the cruelty and unnatural tyranny of parents Perhaps too among some of these people he might be â able to raise up an enemy to this overbearing monarch and his mighty subjects When they saw that he seemed to be going swelled with resentment if they should make no advances to stop him he met with a handsome reception from the Gabini They bid him not be surprized that the man who could act as he had done to his subjects and al lies if at last be treated his children in the same inhu man manner Nay if every other object should fail be would wreak his vengeance on himself To them however he was excessively welcome and they had no doubt but in a short time by his assistance they would be able to carry the war from Gabli to the ve ry walls of Rome  Part of Campagna di Roma i  9 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I CHAP LIV Sexttts admitted into the Gabinian council Gabii reduced PON this he was admitted into the council of state where with respect to other matters he said he would yield to the old counsellors of the Gabini as they had access to know more about them but with respect to the war which he took every opportunity of advising he pretended to be a better judge being intimately acquaint ed with the resources of both nations and moreover such was the intolerable pride of the Roman king that it not only subjected him to the odium of the people but to the aversion of his own family As he thus insensibly stirred up the Gabini to renew the war he went in person with the most alert of their youth upon pillaging parties and in all his words and actions acted his part so much to the life that his credit with the Gabini was quite established Insomuch that at last he was chosen general to prosecute the war Upon this some skirmishes happened between the peo ple of Gabii and Rome in which for the most part the Gabini had the better who never yet could discover the cheat but from the highest to the lowest were positive to a man that Sextus Tarquinius had been sent them by the gods to lead them on to victory Among the soldiers too the cheerfulness with which he exposed himself to the dangers and fatigues of war and the ge nerosity he discovered in dividing the plunder so endear ed him to the soldiers that Tarquin had no more to say at Rome than he had at Gabii Therefore when he saw that he could be sufficiently Supported for any attempt he dispatches one of his confidents to Rome to ask his father what were his futther commands for the gods had given him an unlimited power at Gabii To this message the king 1 suppose diffident of the fidelity of the bearer returned him no answer in words but as if he had meant to consider of the matter walked into the garden whither his son s messenger followed him As he walked in the garden for some time in silence he struck off it is said the heads of the tallest CHAP 55 ROMAN HISTORY 95 poppies with his cane The messenger being oat of all patience with begging and waiting for an answer return ed to Gabii no wiser than when he left it However of what he said himself and what he had occasion to ob serve he makes a faithful relation adding moreover that Tarquin whether from passion resentment or pride never once deigned to open his mouth The moment Sextus had unriddled these dark hints he puts to death the most eminent men of the city some by accusing them to the people others became proper objects of his revenge by envying his greatness Many of them were executed publicly others against whom the indictment could not be so clearly proved were made away with privately Some were permitted to make their escape and some were banished but in whatever manner they were disposed of whether dead or alive if they were out of the way their estates were confiscated and divided among the people The sweets of plunder and the private emolument arising from these largesses extinguished in the people all sense of feeling for the public calamities till destitute of counsel and void of all resources the state of Gabii became an easy prey to Tarquin without striking a stroke CHAP LV Tarquin turns his attention to the affairs of the city JL ARQUIN having thus got possessionof Gabii made a peace with the Equi and renewed the treaty with the Etrurians He then turned his attention to the affairs of the city particularly to the building a temple to Ju piter on the Tarpeian mount which he might leave as a monument of his name and reign since of he two Tar quins who had reigned at Rome the first had vowed this temple and the last had finished it And that the area of this temple might be clear of the worship of other gods and totally appropriated to Jupiter he re solved to deprive several small temples and chapels of their consecrated honours which had been vowed by Tatios in the heat of the battle he had fought with Ro mulus and afterwards hallowed and dedicated Â 0 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I In the very beginning of th rs work it is affirmed that the gods exerted their power to presage the future great ness of this empire For though the birds declared that all the other temples might be deprived of their sacred honours they could not be brought to approve of the measure with respect to Terminus This omen and augury was thus explained that as Terminus would not move and being the only one of all the gods that had not been moved from their respective stations they had in that circumstance a sure sign of the permanency and stability of their empire This oruen being understood to have a respect to the permanency there followed another which portended its greatness For as the story goes whilst the masons were opening the ground for the foundation of the tem ple a human head appeared to them with the face en tire This phenomenon without straining the interpre tation plainly presaged that this temple should be the head of the empire and the empire univer al This too was the opinion of the soothsayers not only of Rome but of those also who had been sent for from Etruria to be consulted on it Presages so flattering could not miss to enlarge the king s mind with respect to the ex pence insomuch that the spoils of Pometia originally intended to defray the expence of the whole superstruc ture were scarcely sufficient for laying the foundation â For this reason I am the more inclinable to believe Fabius besides that he is the more ancient author who restricts the plunder of this city to forty talents than Piso who atfmns that 40 000 pound weight of gold and silver had been sequestrated for that purpose a sum scarcely to be expected from the spoils of any one city in the world at that time and more than sufficient for laying the foundation of any the most magnificent fabric cf modern times CHAP LVI Sends a colony to Signia and Ceredum Sends Brutu i to Delphos J ARQUIN being intent upon building the temple hired architects and skilful workmen from Etrnria CHAP 56  ROMAN HISTORY 97  aud though he made use of the public money to de fray i he expence in the laborious part he made the people the drudges Though this was a considerable addition to their military servitude yet the considera tion that they were building a temple to the gods with their own hands induced them to assist in carrying it on with more cheerfulness than usual This servitude was afterwards extended to works less honourable but still more laborious as the construction of galleries in the circus and of a large drain under ground for re ceiving and carrying off the refuse of the city works so very considerable that even the magnificence of the present ago can scarce pretend to equal them Whilst the people were engaged in the execution of these designs because he thought numbers for whom he could not find employment were a burden to the city that the frontiers of his dominions might be better in habited he sent colonies to Circeii and Sigma f which proved a defence to the city in succeeding ages both by sea and land Whilst he was engaged in these matters a terrible prodigy appeared A serpent jumping out of a wooden pillar spread such terror among all who saw it that they ran directly to the palace The king was not so much concerned for fear of danger as he was solicitous about what might fojlow Therefore though upon other occasions the Etrurian diviners were thought sufficienti yet this phenomenon having impressed him with un usual anxiety for his domestic concerns he resolved to send to the oracle at Delphi the most famous at that time in the world And not daring to trust the oracle s answer to any â other he dispatched two of his sons into Greece A R 243 through tracts of land Â at that time very little and seas still less known Titus and Aruns set out Lu cia Junius Brutus Tarquin s nephew by a sister Tar quinia a young man of a very different turn of mind from what he choosed it should appear to be was of their retinue â  Monte Circello f A city in Latium J A city in Greece r o v Delfo Sabona and Castri 8 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK I This young nobleman when he understood that the principal of the Roman nobility and among the rest his own brother had been butchered by his uncle he resolved that nothing should appear in his spirit to alarm the fears and nothing in his fortune to tempt the rapa city of the king imagining he would be safer under the cloak of contempt than in the protection of the laws Wherefore designedly assuming the air and habits of a fool he suffered himself and all his fortune to fall into the hands of the king and very cheerfully took the sir name of Brutus that his extraordinary abilities con cealed under this title of reproach might watt for the proper season to appear with redoubled lustre in assert ing the liberty of Rome When at that time he accompanied the Tarqnins to Delphi rather as their buffoon than companion it is reported of him that he carried with him a rod of gold enclosed in a case of elder which gave it the appearance of a common stick as a present to Apollo â This was a true emblem of his own mind and external appearance When they had finished their journey and executed their father s commands they were prompted by their curiosity to enquire of the oracle which of them should succeed him in the kingdom Upon which it is said a voice from the bottom of the cave made the following response  Whoever of you gentlemen shall first have the good fortune to give a kiss to his mother shall be ruler at Rome The Tarquins as Sextus their brother had been left at Rome and consequently ignorant of the oracle s answer that he should have no share in the government order that all should be kept secret and determined by lot which of them two upon their return to Rome should first kiss his mother Tullia But Brutus concluding that the oracle s mean ng was very different pretended to fall down by chance and kissed the earth the common mother of all living Af ter this they all returned to Rome where they found the city in a commotion on account of the preparations for a war against the Rutuli CHAP 5T ROMAN HISTORY 09 CHAP LVII A dispute about the excellency of Wives A HE Rutuli were considered as a very wealthy na tion in that age and country and were in possession of Ardea It was their riches alone that gave rise to the war For Tarquin having drained his treasury to de fray the expence of his public works was speculating for a new supply to himself  and that he might by a large booty soothe the minds of the populace who besides their dislike of him for other acts of tyranny were enraged at the oppressive manner in which they hatl been obliged to serve the mechanics and do other servile work He made an attempt to take Ardea by storm but having failed in the attempt he tried to dis tress the besieged by blockading their city and raising works against it When an army is encamped and the war rather tedi ous than violent it generally happens that they come and go without restraint though that indulgence only extends to the officers The young princes sometimes spent their leisure hours in visiting and entertaining one another One day while they were enjoying themselves over a bottle with Sextus Tarquinius where Collatinus Tar quinius the son of Egerius also supped the conversa tion happened to turn on the merit of wives Every one was loud in the praises of his own and the dispute turning hot  What occasion is there for words said Collatinus  since you can be satisfied in a few hours how much my Lucretia is superior to the rest If then  we have yet

way to Rome where they arrived about the dusk in the evening and from thence to Collatia There they found Lucretia not employed like the king s daughters in law in company with other ladies of

her husband and the Tarquins with much ailkbiltty Her husband not a little vain of his con quest invited his royal guest to a friendly repast There Sextus Tarquinius was so captivated with the charms and behaviour of Lucretia and so inflamed with passion that he was resolved to enjoy her by force â However having thus got over their youthful frolic which had taken up a great part of the night they

motives of this visit he was entertained with great civility and respect and after supper conducted to his apartment In flamed with the ardour of his passion observing everv thing was quiet and the

holding it out all bloody before him Yes said he  I swear by this blood once so pure that nothing but royal villainy could have polluted and I call the gods to witness this my oath that I will pursue Lucius Tarquin the proud his wicked wife and all their race with fire and sword and every other act of violence in my power nor will I ever suffer any of that or any other family whatsoever to be king in Rome This said he presented the knife to Collaiinus then td Lucretius and Valerius who were not a little astonished at the sur prising revolution in the intellects of Brutus However at his desire they all took the oath and their grief be ing now converted into rage they all followed Brutus as their leader from that moment incessantly employing his interest to overturn the regal power The body of Lucretia was brought from Collatia and laid in the Forum As it is usual in such cases great multitudes assembled drawn together by their wonder at so extraordinary a spectacle or their indignation at the author Every one from his own experience had some crime or act of violence to lay to the charge of the Tar quins They were moved by the father s tears but Brutus insisted that they should dry up their tears and drop their unavailing complaints and show themselves men and Romans in taking up arms against those who oared to act a villainous part against them The most resolute of the youth appear in arms volun teers in the service and the rest soon follow their exam ple Then having left a sufficient guard at the gates of Collatia and placing sentries that the Tarquins might get no notice of this insurrection the rest headed by CHAP 59 ROMAN HISTORY  103 Brutus marched in arms to Rome After they had en tered the city the appearance of a body in arms spread terror and confusion wherever it went but when the principal men of the state were observed to be at the head of it they readily concluded whatever it might be it had been no rash nor unadvised undertaking Nor did this barbarous action occasion less commotion at Rome than it had done at Collatia From all quarters they ran into the Forum and the moment they were convened they were summoned by the public crier to attend the tribune of the celeres with which office Brutus happened to be invested at that time Then he harangued the people but with a force and energy very dirferent from that degree of wisdom and capacity of which the character be assumed had been expressive to that day Then be inveighed against the violence and brutal passion ofSextus Tarquinius the rape of Lucretia so infamous that he blushed to mentiou it â her unfor tunate end â The loss to Triclpitinus of his daughter the cause of whose death was more afflicting and dis tressing than her death itself â To these he added the king s haughtiness â 4he miseries and servile labours of the people oppressed with ditching and draining common sewers and that the Romans conquerors of all the na tions around them of soldiers were now become common mechanics and hewers of stone He mentioned the in human murder of their king Servius Tultius and his ac cursed daughter riding in triumph over the body of her expiring father he invoked the gods the avengers of parents By a lively representation of these horrid scenes and others I fancy still more glaring dictated by the ca lamity of the times which a modern historian cannot easily collect or narrate he had the address to engage the people already enraged at the Tarquins to abolish the regal authority and by their suffrages to confirm a decree of the senate condemning Tarquin his wife and all his posterity to perpetual banishment Having levied and armed a body of youth who voluntarily listed themselves he put himself at their head and marched to the camp of Ardea to persuade the army to join in the rebellion against the king He left the government of 104  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK the city to Lucretius who had before been appointed to the office of praefect by the king During this uproar Tullia made the best of her way out of the city both sexes wherever she went pursuing her with curses and calling on the furies of her parents to overtake her  CHAP LX Brutus and Collatinus created Consuls JL HE news of these transactions having reached tlie camp the king alarmed with this sudden revolution goes to Rome to quell the commotions Brutus being S lvised of his motions turned out of the way that he raight not meet him Brutus reached Ardea much about â he time that Tarquin had got to Rome Tarquin found the gates shut and an act of banishment passed against him But Brutus was joyfully received in the camp as the deliverer of Rome and the young Tarquin expelled Two of them followed their father who retired to Caere a city of Etruria Sextus Tarquinins having gone to Gabii where he considered himself as king fell by the hands of those who owed him a spite for the old feuds  which by his murders and rapines he had raised against himself Lucius Tarquinius Superbns reigned twenty fire years and the regal government prevailed at Rome from the building of the city to this period of its deli verance two hundred and forty four years Immediately after the expulsion of the Tarquins two consuls Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus were elected at the Commitia by centuries according to the regulations of Servius Tullius  A U C

Brutus binds tJte people by oath never to suffer a King at Rome J N the subsequent part of this work I am to write the history of the Romans considered as a free people and to give an account of their annual magistrates and their government under the jurisdiction of the laws superior to that of men The insolent behaviour of the late king gave them now a greater relish for the sweets of liberty for with so much moderation had their former princes ruled that they may be justly stiled the founders of those parts of the city which each of them successively had added for the accommodation of the people whose num bers were increased by their care But it is an absolute certainty that had this very Brutus who distinguished himself so gloriously in the expulsion of the Tarquins through an unseasonable zeal for liberty wrested the sovereign power from any of their former princeÂ he would have done an irreparable 106 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK It injury to the public interest For what would have been the consequence had that commonalty consisting of herdsmen arid strangers out laws from their countries who under the protection of an inviolable asylum found liberty or at least impunity besn set free from the dread of majesty and begun to be agitated by the storms of tribunitian fury What would have been the conse quence had they then begun to engage in quarrels with the nobles in a strange city before the pledges of wives and children and an attachment to the soil which comes not in an instant had associated their hearts Distrac tions of this nature in a state not brought to maturity would certainly have ruined it whereas a peaceable and geÂ tle government fostered and cherished it and by a proper nourishment brought it to such strength and per fection as already to produce the wholesome fruits of liberty But it is to be observed that the source of liberty is found rather in the duration of the consular government which was only for a year than in the diminution of the power which had been invested in the crown The first consuls had all the privileges and ensigns of authority which belonged to the kings only it was provided that both consuls should not be attended with the fasces at the same time so as they might not appear to be armed with double terror Brutus who was not more active in recovering liber ty than he was steady in maintaining it was the first with permission of his colleague who was attended by the fasces Of all the people who at first were mighty fond of their new acquired liberty he exacted ait oath that they never would suffer another to sway the sceptre in Rome that they might not upon any after occasion either affected with the prayers or corrupted by the largesses of Tarquin be prevailed onto recede Then to add to the influence of the senate by increasing the  According to Pompohius ex cansulere to watch for the public good but according to v arro and Cicero ex consubreto ask coun sel  because according to the

that order which had suffered greatly from the king s butcheries he drafted the principal of the Equestrian order to make the number of the fathers three hundred Hence it is said arose the distinction ef fathers and conscript fathers when they were called to the senate they who were added to the list to make up the new senate being called conscript It is impos sible to conceive how much this measure contributed to the unanimity and mutual friendship of senate and peo ple CHAP II Constrains Tarquinius Collatinus on suspicion of an attach ment to the Tarquins to resign the consulship and leave Rome IMMEDIATELY after these regulations they turned their attention to matters of religion and as some part of public worship had belonged to the regal function that the want of kings might not be felt in this respect they created a magistrate for the purpose and gave him the title of king of sacred things This office they made sub ordinate to the pontificate that the specious title might no way obstruct their liberty which had now become their principal concern and I am not certain but their zeal in securing it even in matters of very little moment carried them too far For the very name of the other consul to whose conduct they could have no objection besides became odious to the state They reflected That habit had made it constititutional in the Tarquins to affect sovereign power That this had originated in Priscus whom Servius Tullius had indeed succeed ed but what then During his whole reign was not Tarquin the proud claiming an exclusive right though he saw another in possession and at last by proceed ings the most villainous and violent did he not seize on the supreme power as the hereditary domain of his family Tarquin the proud is banished it is true but is not the supreme authority vested in Tarquin of Col Iatia The Tarquins cannot exist in a private station â it is morally impossible â there is a harshness iÂ the very name â it will never chime with liberty 108  TITUS LlVIffS BOOK II Reflections of this kind being at first artfully whisper ed and by degrees published all over the city to sound the inclinations of the people Brutus summoned tjiem to a council whilst they were anxious under these impres sions of jealousy when first of all he repeats to them the oath which they had taken That they would suf fer no kings at Rome nor any thing else that would endanger their liberty That this was a maxim of which they were never to lose sight nor were they to overlook whatever in the least regarded it That he addressed them in these terms much against his incli nation out of respect to a single gentleman nor would he touch on the subject did not the love of his country constrain him That it was tmpossible to convince the Roman people that they were yet in full posses sion of their liberty for as yet not only some of the royal family but even some who bore the name of Tarqum still resided in the city and were even invest ed with the supreme power It is this which obstructs â it is this which stands in the way of their liberty Then turning to Collatinus This fear O L Tarquin do you voluntarily remove We have not yet forgot nay we openly acknowledge that you expelled the kings Complete what you have so generously begun Take hence the regal name Your fellow citizens I promise you will not only give youl up all you can call your own but if you want any thing besides will generously supply you Leave us in friendship Free this city from a fear that perhaps is groundless But the people arc fully persuaded that tyranny will never be totally extirpated whilst any of the Tarquin family remains in the city The consul was at first so confounded at this sudden and unexpected motion that he could not open hia mouth When he was beginning to speak in his own defence he was surrounded by those of the first distinc tion in the city ai d with the most pressing intreaties importuned to depart Their influence however would have gone no great length had not Spurius Lucretius a man highly respected for his merit and venerable for his years and who also was his father in law used va rious methods of persuasion with him sometimes intreat CHAP 3 ROMAN HISTORY 109 ing and sonffitimes advising him to suffer himself to be prevailed upon by the united wishes of his country He then began to consider that after he should be returned to the condition of a private citizen he might be obliged to leave the city his estate might be confiscated and be sides he might receive some other mark of disgrace wherefore he resigned the consulship and having con veyed all his effects to Lavinium he retired from Rome Brutus by a decree of the senate moved to the people that all the family of the Tarquins should be banished and in an assembly by centuries he got Pub lius Valerius who had assisted him in expelling the Tarquins to be chosen his colleague CHAP III Deputies from the Tarquins arrive at Rome ALTHOUGH nobody doubted that the Tarquins would have recourse to arms yet that happened not so soon as was generally expected The Romans were on the point however of losing their liberty by deceitful and treasonable practices of which they had never en tertained a suspicion Among the Roman youth there were some of illus trious families who during the late reign had pursued their pleasures without restraint and being much about the same age and much in company with the young Tarquins were accustomed to take all the liberties com mon to princes Wishing still to live in the same licetv tious stile although now every citizen was upon the same footing they complained to one another that whatever liberty other men enjoyed they saw nothing for them selves but slavery A king continued they is a man â from whom you may obtain justice and in case of need you may have indulgence too Here there is a plea for interest and favour A king can both show his resentment and his clemency and distinguish a friend from a foe But the laws always deaf and in exorable are better calculated for the poor than the rich only once transgress them and you will find that neither indulgence nor pardon is competent F 110 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II Considering the frailty of human nature to depend on  innocence alone will be found but a precarious si tuation   While their minds were thus naturally chagrined de puties from the Tarquins arrived unexpectedly at Rome who without mentioning a syllable of their return only required that their effects should be given up After they had been admitted to an audience in the se  nate it was debated for several days whether their de mands should be granted as a refusal might be a pre tence to the Tarquins for beginning hostilities and a compliance afford them the means for carrying on a war In the mean time however they were otherwise em ployed for while they openly demanded their effects they were plotting in private for recovering the kingdom j and under pretence of courting the young patricians for their interest to support their claim in the senate they were sounding their inclinations To those whom they saw disposed to listen to their proposals they delivered letters from the Tarquins and concerted measures for taking the royal family into the city in the night time CHAP IV The plot discovered by means of a slave and the conspira tors c lapt in irons A HE conspiracy was first communicated to the Aquil Iji and Vitellii of whom there were several brothers Brutus had married a sister of the Vitellii and by her had two sons called Titus and Tiberius whom their uncles engaged to be their associates in their design There were other young Patricians concerned in the plot but their names in so long an interval have been totally lost When it was carried by a majority of the senate that the effects belonging to the royal family should be restored the ambassadors made it a pretence for protracting their stay at Rome as the consuls ha d al lowed them time to provide carriages for their transpor tation This time they employed in conferences with the conspirators upon whom they prevailed by their ur CHAP 5 ROMAN HISTORY Ill gent solicitations to write to the Tarquins For how else said they is it possible to convince them that what we have to advance about a business of the highest consequence is not altogether a mere fiction These letters which were given as a pledge of their fidelity discovered the whole plot For the day before the ambassadors were to take their departure they hap pened to sup with the Vitellii where the conspirators as is usual in such cases conversed long together in pri vate about their new concerted plot One of their slaves who before had found out what they were about over heard their conversation but he waited for that oppor tunity when the letters should be delivered which when seized would make a full discovery of the whole affair The moment he observed that the letters were delivered he advised the consuls who went directly to seize the ambassadors and conspirators together The whole affair was crushed without any noise They took care in the first place to secure the letters lest they should be put out of the way The traitors were immediately clapt in irons but with respect to the ambassadors they were for some time at a loss Their crime indeed merited the treatment due to enemies but a regard to the law of nations prevailed CHAP V The conspirators condemned and executed and the effectf of the Tarquins given tip to be plundered by the people J HE restitution of the tyrant s effects which the senate had formerly voted came once more upon the carpet The fathers exasperated as they were would neither suffer them to be restored nor confiscated They were therefore given up to be rifled by the people who after they had shared in the plunder might upon no future occasion have any hopes of a reconciliation with the Tarquins A field between the city and the Tiber their pro perty was consecrated to Mars and ever since hath been called the Campus Martius It happened that it was tmder corn ripe for cutting down but as they deem 112 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK II ed it unlawful to use iti after it was reaped the people flocked in numbers to carry it away with the straw in baskets and then threw it into the Tiber the waters of which being low as it is usual in the heat of summer the heaps of corn sticking in the shallows were covered with mud by these and other materials carried thither by the stream an island rose by degrees which by the addition of banks as I imagine and the assistance of art was so raised and consolidated that temples and porti coes were built upon it After the tyrant s effects were plundered the traitors were condemned and executed What rendered their punishment particularly remarkable was that Brutus s office as consul laid him under the necessity of punish ing his own children and the man who ought to have been removed from beholding such a melancholy spec tacle fortune obliged to stand by and see the punish ment inflicted Young men of the first quality stood tied to a stake but from all the criminals as from per sons unknown the consul s sons drew the eyes of the spectators pitying them not more on account of the severity of their punishment than the horrid crime for which they suffered in the very year of their deliver ance from slavery that they should have conspired to betray into the hands of Tarquin who had been a haughty tyrant at Rome and now an hostile exile their country after it was freed from his despotic sway their father too its deliverer the consulate which originated in the family of the Junii the fathers the people and whatever belonged to the gods or the citizens of Rome The consuls seated themselves in the tribunal and the lictors being dispatched to inflict the punishment stript them naked whipt them with rods and struck off their heads All the time the eyes of the spectators were fixed upon Brutus to observe his deportment as a father and a patriot â in love for his country he stood distin guished during all the tragical scene After the execution to set an example of rewarding as well as punishing the slave who made the discovery got a sum of money out of the treasury his liberty and the freedom of the city He was the first according to tradition that was made free by the Rod Vindicta CHAP 6 113 ROMAN HISTORY which some think was so called from the circumstance of his name which was Vindicius Hence it has been a rule that freedom obtained in this manner has en titled the receiver to all the privileges of a Roman ci  tizen CHAP VI The Tarquins muster an army are defeated but Brutus is killed JL ARQUIN having been informed of these things grief rage and hatred all at once seized him upon the disappointment of his only hopes and since now he had no hopes in succeeding by stratagem and that there was no alternative but open war he made the circuit of Etru ria humbly beseeching particularly the Vejentes and Tarquinienses  That they would not suffer to perish before their eyes himself and the prmces his sons of the same blood with themselves who though now an abject exile was but lately possessed of a consider able kingdom That others had been sent for from foreign parts and invested kings of Rome but Utat he their lawful sovereign whilst enlarging the empire by his arms abroad was dethroned by a conspiracy tif his nearest relations that they since no single one among them was judged equal to the honour of ruling alone had split the regal office into parts and shared them among them that they had given up all his ef fects to be plundered by the people that all mong them might be somehow concerned in the guilt What he ardently wished for now was to recover his kingdom and his country to take vengeance on his ungrateful subjects that they were peculiarly inte rested in supporting his pretensions because in his quarrel they would revenge the injuries done them before when their armies had been so often slaugh tered and their lands wrested from them These arguments were specious and weighed with the Vejentes who felt themselves heroes in an instant boast ing with prodigious bluster that now with a Roman general at their head they would wipe off every formcf 11 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II disgrace and recover all they had lost in war The name and relation to the Tarquinienses were irresistible motives Besides they piqued themselves upon the ho nour of giving a king to Rome Thus the armies of these two states put themselves under the command of Tarquin to reinstate him on the throne and take ven geance on the Romans When they entered the Roman territories the consuls went out to meet them Valerius led on the foot in square battalia and Brutus marched before with the horse to reconnoitre the enemy The Tarquins marched in the same order Aruns Tarquin s son advancing with the horse and Tarquin himself following with the legions Aruns by the lictors knewnt was one of the consuls who was advancing against him when at a dis tance but upon a nearer approach he discovered by his face that it was certainly Brutus Then boiling with indignation There says he  is the man who hath banished and expelled us our country see him how he rides in state proud in the ensigns of our dignity Ye gods avengers of injured kings assist me now â With this he put spurs to his horse and drove against the consul with all his force Brutus saw his aim and as in those days it was reckoned a piece of gallantry in the generals to open the battle by en gaging in single combat at the head of their armies he met him with equal ardour They rushed against each other with inveterate fury insomuch that neither caring how much his own person was exposed could he only wound his adversary they both tumbled from their horses at the same instant lifeless to the ground pinned together by their lauce which being pushed in opposite directions had transfixed them through their shields At the same time the battle with the horse became general nor was it long before the foot came up  often was the victory lost and won and in the end very doubt ful The right of both armies carried all before them while the left of both was defeated The Vejentes ac customed to be beat by the Roman were routed and put to flight The Tarquinienses a new enemy not only stood their ground but where they fought obliged the Romans to give way CHAP 7 ROMAN HISTORY 1 13 CHAP VII The Ladies mourn for Brutus a whole year FTER this desperate engagement Tarquin and his Etrurians were seized with such a panic that giving over his design as impracticable the two armies ofthe Yejen tes and Tarquinienses made the best of their way in the night time to their respective homes Or this battle also strange stories are reported that a loud voice which they imagined to be Sylvanus s was heard frdm the forest of Arsia in the dead of night pro nouncing these words  The Etrurians Dave lost one man in the battle more than the Romans The Ro mans are masters of the field One thing however is certain that the Romans left the field as conquerors and the Etrurians with all the marks of a defeat For after the light appeared and not a man of the enemy to be seen rublius Valerius the consul gathered up the spoils and returned in triumph to Rome He buried his colleague with all the poiup at that time possible But a much greater compliment was paid to his memory in the public mourning of the city particularly remark able from this consideration that the ladies mourned for him a complete ear as for apparent to shew their re spect for the bold avenger of their sex s honour  Though the surviving consul had been very popular yet so fickle are the minds of the muttitude that he not only fell under their jealousy and resentment but was even charged with the most odious crimes Reports were spread that he aspired at sovereignty because he had not chosen a colleague in the room of Brutus and was building a house on the upper Velia where from its height and situation it would be an impregnable for tress As these things were become common topics of con versation and gaining credit they gave the consul no little pain wherefore having called a council of the peo ple he came down to die assembly with his fasces low ered Nothing could have pleased the people mere han to see the ensigns of authority lowered to them as it L 116 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II was a plain acknowledgment that the majesty and power of the people was paramount to that of the con sul When they were called to silence the consul highly extolled the good fortune of his colleague who after the delivery of his country had fallen in the greatest honour fighting for its liberty when his glory was at its height and before it was sullied by the foul touches of envy whilst himself had survived the glory he had acquired to become the but of envy and cri minal impeachments and from being esteemed the deliverer of his country had his character now level led with that of the Vitellii and Aquilei Shall there never be a time says he  that virtue will be so fully approved by you as to be proof against jealousy Is it possible that I who have shown myself an implac able enemy to kings should have reason to fear that ever a charge of aspiring to regal power would be laid against myself Were I to live in the capitd nay in the citadel itself could I ever imagine that I should become formidable to my fellow citizens Does my character among you depend on circumstances so trifling Is your confidence in me so slightly founded that you should rather be concerned about the situa tion of my house than the conduct of my life But gentlemen the house of Publius Valerius shall never obstruct your liberty No longer be afraid of Velia I will not only bring down my house into the plain but even build it at the foot of the hill that you may dwell above me a suspected citizen Permit those to build upon Velia whom you think more worthy to be entrusted with your liberty than Publius Valerius All the materials were accordingly brought down to the valley below Velia and his house was built at the foot of the hill where the temple of Victory now stands CHAP 8 ROMAN HISTORY 117 CHAP VIII  â r P Valerius proposes a law for allowing appeals to the people The capital dedicated this the consul made laws which not only cleared him of all suspicion of aiming at sovereign power but oh the contrary made him even popular From this consideration he got the name of Publicola The laws which above all others raised him in the esteem of the public were these which made an appeal to the people competent from the judgment of the magistrates and the person and effects of him who should form any plot for usurping the sovereign power execrable These laws he passed while the only consul that he might have the sole merit of them and immediately after he as sembled the comitia for electing a colleague Spurius Lucretius was chosen consul who being now very old and quite unfit for the duties of his office died in a few days after his election M Horatius Pulvillus succeeded Lucretius In some old histories I do not fmd Lucretius mentioned as con sul at all but Horatius immediately after Brutus The reason I imagine may be owing to this that nothing re markable happened during the short time he enjoyed his office The temple of Jupiter was not yet dedicated in the capitol wherefore Valerius and Horatius the consul cast lots which of them should have the honour of per  forming that ceremony The lot fell to Horatius and Publicola marched against the Vejentes Valerius s friends showed more uneasiness than became them that the honour of dedicating so famous a temple should have fallen to Horatius Nothing was left unattempted to throw obstacles in the way and after every other scheme had proved abor tive they endeavoured to sur  prise him with a melancholy piece of news just as he was holding the post in the temple and addressing his prayer tn the god telling him That his son was dead  and that he could not dedicate the temple when his family were in mourning Whether he gave no 118 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK II credit to this intelligence or had resolution enough not to mind it is not snid nor is it easy to conjecture He only stopped while he ordered the body to be buried and stili holding the post went on with his prayer 3nd finished the dedication These were the most remark able transactions at Itome in peace and in war the first year after the expulsion of the kings After which Publius Valerius a second time and Titus Lucretius were made consuls CHAP IX Ai Porsenna prevailed on to espouse the quarrel of the Tarquins FTER this the Tarquins made their application to Lars Porsenna king of Clusiutn There mingling their advice with intreaties hey now requested That he would never suffer them who were Etrurians hy descent and of the same blood and name to live in perpetual exile and poverty Again they advised him  by no means to suffer this growing practice of banishing kings to pass unrevenged That liberty had in itself many inducements  and if kings were not as tenacious of the royal prerogative as the people were of their liberty there would be an end to all subordination There would be no distinction among mankind all would he on a level Then adieu to mo narchy the most glorious institution among gods or men Porsenna thinking it would add greatly to the honour of Etruria to establish a king at Rome especially one of their own nation marched against it with a hostile army Such consternation never seized the senate be fore so formidable was Clusium at that time and so great was the reputation of Porsenna Nor did their fear only extend to the enemy they were apprehensive of their own citizens lest the populace overcome by their fear should admit the tyrants into the city and give their liberty in exchange for peace Wherefore  Chiusi CHAP 10 ROMAN HISTORY 119  great was the complaisance which was shown to the peo ple by the senate at I hat time Their first care was to lay in provisions for procur ing which agents were sent among the Volsci and to Curnae And because the tax on salt was farmed at a very high rate the monopoly was taken from private persons and committed to clerks who were to manage it for the public The common people were relieved of all imposts and taxes whatever whicU were laid upon the rieh who were able to bear them The poor contribut ed enough to the state when they brought up their chil dren Wherefore this tenderness of the fathers so unit ed the hearts of the people that notwithstanding all the distresses they suffered during the siege and famine the name of king was equally detestable to high and lowj nor could ever a man since that period by mdirect prac tices acquire a popularity equal to that which the senate obtained by their good government Ui CHAP X The gallantty of Cocks I PON the enemy s approach eyery one to save him self fled from the country into the city the city itself they secured with strong guards and having walls upon one side and the Tiber on the other it seemed pretty we ll defended The bridge Sublicius however had almost opened a  passage for the enemy into the city when the gallantry of one man Horatius Cocles prevented it To him did â the fortune of Rome owe its defence that day He hap pened to be placed sentry on the bridge when he saw the Janiculum taken by surprise and the enemy running down from thence with all the speed they coulci observ ing a crowd of the Romans throwing down their arms and leaving their ranks in confusion he laid hold of them one by one pulling them back and beseeching them in the name of gods and men he declared That their flight would signify nothing if they once deserted their post if they left the bridge behind them free for the  A city of Campania 120 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II enemy to pass they would soon sec more of them in the Palatium and capitol than in the Janiculum and for that reason he advised and charged them to de molish the bridge by the axe by fire or by any other means of destruction in their power that in the mean time he would singly sustain the enemy s attack with all the vigour he was master of He then advanced to the entrance of the bridge and being easily distinguished among those who had turned their backs and fled facing about to engage with the enemy hand to hand by that surprising instance of gallantry he confounded the Etrurians Two however Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius men eminent for their birth and noble actions were ashamed to leave him with them for a short time he stood the first shock of danger and the most disorderly part of the assault and at last upon a call from those who were employed in catting down the bridge he obliged his companions to retire upon the little that remained Then looking fierce ly at the Etrurian officers and with a threatening air he challenged them one by one and upbraided them all telling them That they were the slaves of haughty tyrants who regardless of their own liberty came to wrest it from their neighbours They hesitated for some time and looked at one ano ther who should step out to begin the attack shame at length put the army in motion who setting up a shout threw their javelins from every quarter at a single ene my all which when he received on his shield and stood firm and undaunted to keep possession of the bridge they endeavoured to justle him off by force when the crash of the bridge that was now broke down and the shouts of the Romans rejoicing that it was done stunned them with the shock and suspended their fury Then Cocles  O father Tiberinus says he earnestly do I pray that thou wouldst receive these arms and this soldier and that thy streams would be merciful Wherefore he threw himself into the Tiber armed as lie was and amidst ten thousand darts that fell about him he swimmed across the river to his own party with  Ingcns gradus stately step CHAP 11 ROMAN HISTORY 121 out the least hurt ah exertion that to posterity will ap pear rather matter of wonder than of fact For such uncommon bravery the public shewed every mark of respect A statue was erected for him in the Comitium and he got as much land as he could encircle with a plough in one day Nor were private families less eager in expressing their gratitude than the public foi though the scarcity of provisions was great yet every one in proportion to what he had in his family saved some part of his own allowance as a gratuity to him CHAP XI Porsenna turns the siege into a blockade A ORSENNA being repulsed in his first attempt re solved to turn the siege into a blockade wherefore havmg garrisoned the Janiculum he encamped with the main army upon a plain along the banks of the Tiber Then having collected boats from all quarters to enable him to guard the river so effectually that no provisions could be conveyed to Rome and at the same time to serve him as transports when he should chuse upon occasion to send foraging parties to one place after another on the other side of the river in at short time he so harassed Uie country about the city that the peo ple were not only obliged to remove every thing else but also to drive all their cattle into the city nor durst any body venture them without the gates The Etrurians were permitted to take these liberties not more through fear than good policy for the cpn sul Valerius watching his opportunity of falling on them unexpectedly when a numerous party and straggling without order through the fields he suffered smalt par ties to pass with impunity reserving the weight of his indignation for occasions more important Therefore to ensnare these ravagers he ordered mul titudes of his own people to drive out the cattle next day at the Equiline gate which lay farthest from the enemy presuming they would get intelligence because it was hardly possible that with the closeness of the 122 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II blockade and seventy of the famine the slaves would all continue faithful but some of them desert to the enemy It happened accordingly that they were informed by a deserter a much greater number had crossed the river now from a persuasion tltat they were to carry off all the cattle together Upon this Valerius orders Titus Herminius to post himself with a pretty considerable party on the Gabinian way about two miles from the city so as they might not be observed Spurius Lartius to post himself at the gate of Collina with a select corps of light armed youth till the enemy should pass and then to throw himself between them and the river to prevent their return Titos Lucretius the fcther consul sallied out at the port Naevia with some companies of foot whilst Vale rius himself led some select cohorts out from mount Cae lius and these were the first that were observed by the enemy The moment Herminius heard the noise he burst from his concealment and the Etrurians having now turned to charge Valerius he galled them in the rear The alarm was given on the right and left from the ports Colliiia and Naevia Thus these marauders were surrounded and cut to pieces being too weak for resistance and every avenue blocked up that could fa cilitate their escape This proved a lesson to the Etru rians with regard to straggling parties CHAP XII Macius adventure NOTWITHSTANDING of all this the blockade was continued wh M at the same time scarcity lr well as a prodigious dearth of provisions prevailed by which means Porsenna was not without hopes that only by continumg die siege the city would surrender in course Thtm Caius Mucius a young Roman of noble birth reflecting with indignation that the Roman people when eni lave 1 by the hand of iyranny had never puce  been blocked up by any enemy and that now when they were a free and independent people they were confmed within tlieir walls by the Etrurians an erieroyv CHAP 12 ROMAN HISTORY 123 whose backs they had seen more than once and being determined by some great and noble adventure to be revenged for this disgrace had at first resolved to pe netrate into the enemy s camp without communicating his design to any body but then upon reflection he was afraid tliat should he go without the knowledge or consent of the consuls he might be seized by the Roman guards and brought back as a deserter especially at a time when the condition of the city would justify the accusation He therefore goes to the senate a nd tells them  I intend fathers to cross the Tiber and if pos sibie enter the enemy s camp not with a view of mak ing reprisals or taking revenge for their depredations on us No My design with the assistance of the gods is more noble and glorious He obtained the approbation of the fathers Where fore concealing a poniard below his clothes he sets out upon his adventure After he had got into the enemy s camp he planted himself among the thickest of the crowd near the kino s tribunal It so happened that the soldiers were then receiving their pay and the king s secretary sitting by him and dressed almost in the same uniform was much employed in dispatching business and receiving petitions Afraid to ask which of the two was Porsenna lest his igno rance in that particular should betray him as fortune blindly directed the thrust he stabbed the secretary in stead of the king Endeavouring to make his escape y from thence he opened a passage for himself with his â â bloody dagger through the trembling crowd when the cry was given the king s guards gathered about him and seizing him brought him back to the royal presence there too threatened with fortune on every band with a look that struck more terror than it expressed fear he addressed the king as follows  I am a citizen of Rome my name is Cains Mucius As an enemy I would have killed my enemy nor am I less determined to receive than I was to give the fatal blow A Roman has not only spirit to act but to suffer Believe me I am not the only person you have to fear there is a long list after me candidates for the same honour i Wherefore prepare for their attempt if you please 124 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK If for every hour you must run the risk of your life You have the enemy and his sword drawn in the very door of your tent This war we the Roman youths have denounced against you and if you escape you need be afraid of no army â no battle again It is with you and you alone that we one by one have to do When the king at once boiling with passion and ter rified with his danger in a menacing tone o dered fires to be kindled about him if he did not instantly discover the plots which by his threats he had darkly insinuat ed were prepared against him Only see says he how little bodily pain is regarded by those whose  ambition is glory and with that thrust his right hand into the fire that was lighted for the sacrifice When he continued to broil it as if insensible of pain the king struck as it were with astonishment at so much intrepidity jumped down from his throne and ordered the youth to be removed from the altar at the same time addressing him thus Yes get away from hence your adventurous spirit has hurt yourself more than me I would encourage you to persevere in your virtue had that resolution been exerted for my country Now I discharge you from the right war gives me over you and I dismiss you without violence or injury Then Mucius as if he would not be out done in generosity made the following return Since you pay so great a respect for virtue you will draw a confession from me by your generosity that you could not have extorted by your threats Know that three hundred young noblemen of the first distinc tion in Rome have conspired to take away yoor life ip the manner I have attempted It was my lot to make the effort the rest will follow in course and each will asI ail you in his own time as fortune shall give him an opportunity CHAP 13 ROMAN HISTORY 125 CHAP XIII Porsenna concludes a peace with Rome Adventure of C alia JVlUCIUS being thus dismissed who afterwards from the loss of his right hand got the sirname of Scaavola ambassadors from Porsenna followed him to Rome So strongly had he been impressed with the first attempt against him in which nothing had saved him but a mis take of the hand that directed it and reflecting that he must repeatedly run the same risk while a single one of the conspirators existed he was determined to offer conditions of peace to the Romans as a motion from himself He endeavoured though to no purpose to have the restoration of the Tarquins made a clause in the articles of pacification because he conld not refuse them t hat favour not but that he knew welt thÂ Romans would never accede to the proposal An article requiring the restitution of lands to the Vejentes was granted and the Romans agreed to give hostages upon condition the garrison should be withdrawn from the Janiculum Peace being now settled upon these terms Porsenna drew off his troops from the Janiculum and evacuated the Ro man territory The fathers in consideration of Mucins s spirited conduct made him a present of lands on the other side of the Tiber which ever after weut by the name of the Meadows of Mucius Bravery being thus distinguished the ladies too were emulous by their actions to do honour to their country Clselia a young lady one of the hostages xas the camp of the Etrurians was at no great distance from the bante of the Tiber having escaped from her guard put her self at the head of a troop of her companions and amidst a shower of the enemy s darts swam to he other side of the river brought them to Rome and delivered them safe to their relations At which when it was told to the king he was at first offended and sent deputies to Rome demanding Clselia to be delivered up again for the rest he did not much regard Afterwards transport 123 TITUS LIVIUS Book IL ed with admiration he said that this was an action su perior to the Achievements of Codes and Mucins and he would make a point Oi it if the hostage was not return ed that lie would consider himself no longer Ooinid by the treaty but if she were he ivould send her back to her parents inviolate Bith parlies acted honourably the Romans restored the hostage according to treaty and her virtue was not only safe wiih Porsenna but her bravery greatly honour ed After many encomium he offered to present her with some of the hostages and she might choose whom she pleased When they were all brought out it is said that she made choice of the young men under age both because it was most consistent with her character and approved by the hostages themselves as their time of life required that they should be first at liberty as be ing less able to bear the rigours of slavery The peace being renewed the Romans distinguished this extraordinary bravery in a lady by an extraordina ry honour namely an Equestrian statue which they erected for her on the top of the Via Sacra represent ing a lady on horseback CHAR XIV Ti Arms Porsenna s son roughly handled at Aricia HE custom handed down to us from the ancients and still retained among the other solemn usages at this day when goods are exposed to vendue of calling that a sale of goods of Porsenna does not at all accord with the peaceable departure of that king from Rome This usage must either have originated during the war and been continued after the peace or must have been found ed on principles of greater humanity than the title of selling an enemy s effects seems to import The most probable reason that has been assigned seems to be that Porsenna when he marched from Janiculum made a present of his camp richly stocked with provisions con veyed to him from the adjacent fruitful plains of Etruria that the city at that time being in great distress occa sioned by the length of the siege these effects left in CHAP 15 ROMAN HISTORY 127 the camp were sold to prevent the people from break ing in to rifle them and that tiiey were called the goods of 1 orsenna rather in compliment to his generosity than that his property was exposed to veudae which the Ro mans had never in their power The war with Rome being thus laid aside that his army might not seem to have been led mto tiie e coun tries for nothing Porsenna sent his son Arurt with a detachment of it to lay siege to Aricia At first the Aricians were struck with this unexpected invasion but afterwards having procured assistance from the people of Latium ami Curnae they thought themselves suffici ently strong to venture a battle Then the Etrurtans changed with such prodigious fury that the Aricians im mediately gave way but the Oitman cohorts opposed good generalship to force They fell back for a little and after the enemy had passed them in great disorder turned and charged them in the reap Thus were the Etrurians though they had almost a complete victory surrounded and cut to pieces A part of them by far the least having lost their general and having no nearer safe retreat came to Rome without therr arm in circumstances and a condition not to be envied There they met with a kind reception aifd were hospitably entertained When their wounds Were cured some of them went home where they made honourable mention of the civilities they had met with at Rome Many of them out of regard to their hosts and attach ment to the city staid at Rome where ground was as signed them to build upon ever since called the Tuscan street CHAP XV Porsenna sent an embassy to Rome X FTER this P Lucretius and P Valerius Publico la were made consuls for the third time That year Porsenna sent an embassy to Rome to treat of a restora tion of the Tarquins for the last time by whom though they could have returned an answer the senate chose to send ambassadors to the king and immediately the most 123 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II honourable of that order were commissioned for the pur pose telling him  That the answer to his embassy might have been very short that monarchy would never be re established at Rome but they rather chose to depute the most illustrious of their body to himself than give that answer to his ambassadors at Home But that the affair of the Tarquins might be for ever buried in oblivion and no anxiety arise on that score to interrupt the perfect union and amicable footing they were on at present by making a requisition en tirely inconsistent with the liberty of the Roman peo pie and putting them under the disagreeable necessity of refusing him a request to whom they would wish to be ail compliance or subscribing voluntarily to their own destruction That the Roman people were not uow under the government of kings their motto was Liberty and they were resolved to open their gates to any of their enemies sooner than to kings nay there was not a citizen of Rome but was firmly determined that the existence of heir liberty and that of the city should have the same period Wherefore they ear nestly intreated if he wished them well he would per mit them to be free Overcome by the modesty of their arguments the king answered  Since you are so irrevocably fixed and determined I will give you no farther trouble by repeating the same request to no purpose nor will I amuse the Tarquins with the hopes of assistance I am not disposed to give but whether they choose to live at peace or have recourse to war they must find some other retreat in their exile that nothing may interrupt the peace subsisting between you and me To these expressions of friendship he ad ded very signal acts of generosity For he restored the hostages that had been left with him and the lands of the Vejentes ceded to him by the treaty of Janiculum Tarquin despairing now of a possibility of being re established retired to Mamilius Octavius his son in law at Tusculum Thus Was the peace with Porsenna inviolably observed CHAF 16 ROMAN HISTORY 129 CHAP XVI War with the Sabines Revolt of Pometia Death of Valerius FTER this M Valerius and P Posthumius were chosen consuls This year the Roman arms were suc cessful against the Sabines and the consuls received the honour of a triumph Upon this the Sabines renewed their preparations with more vigour than ever The better to guard against them and to prevent anv sur prise from Tusculum whence they were apprehensive of a war though no declaration had ensued P Valerius for the fourth time and Lucretius for the second time were made consuls The Sabines were split into two factions one of which were for peace and the other for war by which means a part of their strength was transferred to Rome For Atta Clausus afterwards called Appius Claudius at Rome having always declared for peace being for that reason harshly treated by those in the opposition for whom he Was by no means a match fled from Regillum with a considerable number of vassals in his retinue and settled in Rome They were made citizens and had lands assigned them on the other side of the Anio They went by the name of the old Claudian tribe and were afterwards increased with the addition of some small tribes which had come from that country Appius himself being brought into the senate in a short time rose to the highest dignity of that order The consuls marched into the Sabine territory with an hostile army and by ravaging their country and after wards by defeating them in battle having reduced them so low that they had no reason to dread an insurrection for a considerable time returned to Rome in triumph The next year in the consulship of Agrippa Menenius ami P Posthumius died P Valerius allowed by all to have been the ablest roan in Rome both in the arts of peace and war full of glory but so destitute of the poods of fortune that his funeral charges could not be iic frayed from his own estate and he was therefore In â â V i ISO TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II ried at the public expence The ladies mourned for hint as they had done for Brutus This year too two Latin colonies Pomttia and Cora revolted to the Arunci against whom war was commen ced and a numerous army of them being defeated who had the boldness to make head against thVconsuls enter ing their country the whole weight of the war fell upou Pometia After the battle the Arunci were spared no more than in the heat of action For many more were slain than taken and the prisoners were put to the sword without distinction nor did even the hostages to the number of three hundred escape the rage of war This year also there was a triumph at Rome Ti CHAP XVII Defeat of the Arunci and capture of Pometia HE following consuls Opiter Virginias ai d Sp Cassius first endeavoured to take Pometta by storm and afterwards by a close siege by raising Vines and other works But the Arunci instigated more by irreconcileable hatred than any hopes of succeeding or the advantage of a favourable opportunity made a sally and armed with lighted torches rather than swords scattered fire and slaughter every where Having burnt down the Vineae and killed and wounded many of the besiegers one of the consuls but which of them is not said was thrown from his horse mortally wounded and left almost dead m the field Upon this disaster the Romans re turned home and the consul was left among many who were wounded with but very little hopes of his re covery Having employed a short jime injuring their wounds and reet u it ing their army against Pometia theyvmarched with a more numerous army and hearts more keenly set on revenge The Vineae and other works were re paired and the siege so far advanced that the soldiers  This was a warlike engine made of timber and hurdles under  hi ii in an assault they came safely under the vails of a town and so scaled them CHAP IS ROMAN HISTORY 131 were just about to scale the walls when the town surren dered The Arunci however shared the same fate as if the city had been taken by assault for the principal ci tizens were all beheaded the rest sold for slaves the city raited and estates exposed to sale The consuls obtained the honour of a triumph rather in compliment to the se verity of the revenge taken on the enemy than the im portance of the war they had finished â  CHAP XVIII A Dictator created at Rome 1 N the following year Posthumus Cominius and T Lartius succeeded to the consulate During the cele bration of the games at Rome as some of the Sabine yotuh were hurrying along with them some women of the town in a frolic the mob rose upon them and the scuffle that ensued had well nigh ended in a bloody bat tle  and this circumstance however inconsiderable in it self seemed to put the whole nation in a ferment Add to this the dread of a war with the Latins certain intel ligence they received that thirty different nations had entered into a confederacy against them at the instiga tion ofOctavius Marnilius Whilst the city was under the greatest concern about the event of such mighty preparations against them the nomination of a dictator was proposed for the first time but in what year it happened and who were the con suls that were suspected to be in Tarquin s interest is extremely uncertain Nor does history authorise us to say who was the first dictator The most ancient histo rians condescend upon Titus Lartius as being the first that was raised to that high office and on Spurius Cas sius as his general of the horse To men of consular dignity by the law made for the election of a dictator their choice was confmed For which reason I should rather imagine that Lartius who had been consul was appointed to an office superior to the consulate rather than Manius Valerius the son of Marcus and grandson of Volesus who as yet had never been invested with the consular dignity For had they pointed particularly at 132 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II cue of that family they would certainly have paid the compliment to his father Valerius who had been consul and given proofs of his merit When the dictator was first created at Rome and the people saw the axes carried before him they wereÂ truck with prodigious awe and became very submissive and obedient For it was not now as under the consular government where the power being equal they might have influence on one of them or at any rate appeal to the people Here there was no alternative but ab solute submission and obedience The Sabines too were not without their fears when they heard that a dictator was created at Rome more especially being persuaded that tney were the object against whom he was pointed  Wherefore they sent ambassadors to sue for peace re questing of the dictator and senate that they would par don the folly of the youth They received for answer that they could easily forgive the folly of the young men but the petulance of the oldi who were constantly hatch ing one war after another coutd not so easily be over looked They continued however their negotiations about a peace which would at last have been conclud ed had the Sabines thought propeV to comply with a demand of reimbursing the Romans in the expence they had been at in their preparations for war War was accordingly proclaimed but a truce privately concluded kept all quiet for that year CHAP XIX War with the Latins J HE consuls were Servtus Sulpitius and Manius Tul lus but during their administration nothing remarkable happened They were succeeded by T jEbutius and C Veturius During their consulship Fidenae was be sieged Crustumeria taken and from the Latins Prae neste revolted to the Romans Upon this the war with the Latins which had been gathering for some years immediately broke out The dictator A Post humius and his general of the horse marching at the head of a numerous army of horse and foot to the lake CHAP 20 ROMAN HISTORY  133 Regillus in the territory of Tusculum came up with the enemy and getting intelligence that the Tarquins were among the Latins could no longer suppress their fury but charged them immediately For this reason the battle was more bloody and desperate than usual the generals not only giving orders and seeing them properly executed but exposing their persons in the hottest of the action so that scarce an officer on either side excepting the Roman dictator escaped without a wound â Whilst Posthumius was drawing up and haranguing his men Tarquin the proud although weak and unwieldy bv years rode up with great fury to attack him but receiving a blow on the side he was carried off safe by a party of his own people In the other wing Ebutius general of the horse had singled out Octavius Mamilius who on his part observing his motions did by no means avoid him but put spurs to his horse to meet him With lance in hand they pushed against each other so impetuously that ffibutius was run through the arm and Mamilius wounded in the breast Sbutius inca pable of holding his lance fcny longer by means of the wound in his arm left the field whilst the Latin gene ral was received into the second line and returned soon after to the charge without regard to his wound Ob serving his troops in disorder he made the cohort of the Roman exiles advance commanded by Titus Stima lated by revenge against enemies who had deprived them of their fortunes and country they fought desperately and by that means in some measure restored die battle CHAP XX Battle of Regillus A R 258 W HEN the Romans began to give ground on that side Valerius brother to Publicola perceiving young Tarquio who shewed himself at the head of these exiles with haughtiness and deftance eager to acquire his fa mily the honour of putting to death as it had already of expelling the Tarquins he spurred his horse full speed against him in order to pierce him through with h s G 134 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II lance Tarquin to avoid the charge of so terrible an enemy fell back into a battalion of his men and whilst Valerius pursued him wit li inconsiderate ardour amopg the exiles he was run through the body by on of them and the wound of ihe rider havmg no impression on the horse s career the Roman fell breathless to the ground with his arms above him Posthumius the dictator seeing the fall of this brave man and the bold and rapid movement of the exiles before whom his troops were giving way gave the signal to his own cohort a set of brave fellows which he kept about his person as body guards to treat every Roman soldier who should attempt to run away as an enemy The Romans fmding iheir danger the same in trtmt as in rear returned to the charge and restored the battle The dictator cohort who had not been engaged before now with fresh vigour and courage fell upon the wea ried exiles and cut them to pieces Here the principal officers on each side engaged a second time The Latin general seeing the exiles just on the point of being surrounded by the dictator flew to the front with some companies of the corps de reserve Titus Hermimus the lieutenant general observing the move ment of this corps and Mamilius at tlieir head distin guished from the rest by his dress and arms he charg ed him with a toice so much superior to the general of the horse that at the last push lie laid him dead with his lance But whitst lie was intent upon taking the spoit he received a wound himself with a javelin from the eniifloy and though he was carried back to the camp vu t nous he expired under the surgeon s hands a moment after  Then the dictator flew to the horse beseeching them to alight and relieve the foot wearied out with fighting They instantly obeyed and having dismounted flew to the van covering those in the front rarrks with their round bucklers This ga e new spirits o the foot see ing the young nobility ser vi ngon a level wit h themselves and sharing the same dangers The La ms being thus repulsed and struck with terror retreated The cavalry remounted the better to pursue the enemy j and the in fantry also followed CHAP 21 ROMAN HISTORY 135 The dictator attentive to every thmg that could con ciltate the assistance of gods and men is said to have vowed a temple to Castor and also to have promised rewards to the tir t and second man vrfio shoutd enter the enemy s camp And such was the ardour of the Ro ntans thntihey coi t tiued the charge with unremitted vigour till they became masters of the enemy s camp Such was the event of the battle of Regillus The dic tator and general of the horse returned to the city in triumph  J CHAP XXI Mws of Tarquitfi death A temple dedicated to Mercury the three succeeding years there was neither open war nor settled peace Q Clseiius and Titus Lartius and then A Sempronins and M Muratius were consuls Durmg their presidency a temple was dedi cated to Saturn and the Saturnalia appointed to be kept as a festival I find in Some authors that ihe battle of Regillus hap pened his year and that A Posihumius having resign ed his office of consul because his colleague s1 fidefity was suspected was afierwards made dictator Such gross errors in chronology are blended with the history of these times some ranking the magistrates in one or der and some in anoiher that according to some writers it is impossible to say with any degree of precision who were consuls or what year was distinguished by any re markable event by reason of the antiquity of the tacts and the historians who relate them This year was remarkable at Rome for the news they received of the death of Tarquin The intelligence raised the spirits of the senate and people to a very hi h pitch The joy of the faihers was rather extravagant  for from that moment they began to behave very in solently to the commons whom to that day in every  Durine the celebration of this festival in honour of Saturn which tasied three five seven and sometimes nine days friend ship was cultivated to a high degree aud there was a total rac tion from all butinws 156 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II instance they had treated with all imaginable com plaisance   This same year also the colony which Tarquin had sent to Signia was recruited by a new supply of planters The tribes at Rome were increased to twenty one and the temple of Mercury was dedicated on the 15th of May CHAP XXII Honourable behaviour of the Latins PURING the contest with the Latins the Volsci could not be properly said to have kept the peace or to have been at war with Rome For they had mustered a force with which they intended to have supported the Latjns but the alertness of the Roman dictator pre vented them for he had made forced marches that he might not be obliged to make head against both at the same time Full of resentment for ihis conduct the consuls led the Roman legions against the country of the Volsci who suspecting BO evil consequences from their intention were the more alarmed at the unexpected mo tion Wherefore without any thought of arms they deliver the children of the first nobility of Cora and Po metia to the number of 300 to remain as hostages for their good behaviour i upon which the legions were withdrawn without striking a stroke Not long after when the Volsci had recovered of their fright their natural disposition began to shew itself â Once more having entered into an alliance with the Her nici they made secret preparations for war They like wise had embassies all ovier the country soliciting the Latins to join in the confederacy But the late over throw at the lake Regillus stuck so deep in their sto machs that they could listen to no overtures relating to w ar without indignation and abhorrence at those who made them insomuch that they did not even spare the ambassadors themselves but seized and sent them to Rome There they were delivered up to the consuls to whom also were the warlike preparations of the Her nici and Volsci communicated The matter being laid before the senate the fathers CHAP 23 ROMAN HISTORY 137 were so charmed with the honourable behaviour of the Latins that they sent home 6000 of their prisoners re ferring to the new magistrates to conclude a treaty with them a suit which till that time hadxbeen almost con stantly refused The Latins however exulted in what they had done and they who had advised to peace were highly respected They sent to the capitol a crown of gold as an offering to Jupiter and many of the pri soners who had been sent home to their relations came â in the retinue of the ambassadors who brought it They waited on those whose slaves they had been and very politely thanked them for their civilities and kindness shewn them in their distress Never at any former period either in public or in private had the Latins en deared themselves so much to the Republic of Rome CHAP XXIII Disturbances at Rome on account of Usury A R 259 JtjUT the war with the Volsci was still impending and the city divided within itself was inflamed with civil discord between the senate and people which originat ed in the cruelties practised upon the debtors They complained bitterly that they who fought abroad for li berty and extension of empire should be seized and op pressed at home by their fellow citizens war to them was more salutary than peace and foreign enemies less inimi cal to the liberty of the populace than their countrymen This resentment which naturally spread of itself was considerably inflamed by the unhappy circumstances of  a single person An old man appeared in the forum with the testimonies about him of ail he had suffered his clothes were greasy and ragged and his person made still a more wretched figure being feeble pale and ema ciated a long beani and hair neglected and in disorder  completed the hideousness of his figure Through all his uncouth outside he was however known and out of com passion whispered about for a centurion who had ac quired many military rewards by his valour la testimony of the gallantry of his behaviour on se veral occasions he shewed the wounds cm his breast 199 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II When the people crowding about him as if summoned to an assembly asked him how he came to be in those circumstances he told them  That his land having been ravaged by the depredations of the enemy dur ing the war with the Sabines in which he served he had not only lost the crop for a year but his farm had been burnt his effects plundered and his cattle carried off That to add to his misfortune the pay meut of a tax had been exacted from him at a very unseasonable time which laid him under the necessity of borrowing that interest rising upon interest he had been obliged to sell his paternal estate and after wards all his moveabie subjects At length the disease had spread to his body and overspread his whole person That his creditors had carried him prisoner from his house where they had not been so generous as treat him like a slave but as a malefactor condemn ed to the torture With these words he bared his back and shewed the still recent marks of the rods and whips with which he had been tortured This histor r and the proofs that supported it raised a prodigious outcry The tumult was no longer con fined to the forum but spread through all quarters of the city All such as had been delivered up to their creditors and now at liberty appeared in public im ploring the protection of the people The mob was joined by volunteers from every quarter Multitudes repaired from all the streets to the forum with furious shouts Such of the senators as happened to be on the spot would have been in danger of their lives had not the consuls PubliusServilius and Ap Claudius hastened to quell the riot The whole multitude turned towards these magistrates showing them their chains and other marks of inhuman treatment telling them that these were all the rewards of their past services in arms every one upbraiding them with the different campaigns they had made With a menacing rather than suppliant air they insisted that the senate should be assembled and determined as it were to direct and over rule their deli berations they crowded round the senate house A small number of the senators whom accident had brought thither joined the consuls fear prevented the CHAP 24 ROMAN HISTORY 139 rest from making their appearance either in the senate house or forum The thmness of the house prevented them from entering upon business This circumstance was only considered by the mob as an evasion to gain time They exclaimed that the senators had absented themselves not from fear nor any accidental cause but from design to elude their demand That the consuls themselves only trifled with them and it was too evidentr that they only insulted their miseries To so great a height did the edition rise that the respect due to consular authority could hardly restrain the violence of the mutineers At tength however the fathers persuaded that it would be full as dangerous to stay at home as to appear came to the senate house but though by this time the house was full the members were far from being unanimous nay the consuls them selves were divided in their sentiments Appius a man of a violent temper was of opinion that this insurrec tion should be suppressed by the authority of the con suls and that if one or two of them were seized the rest would be quiet of course Serviiius who was more moderate gave it as his opinion that whilst the people were in this ferment it would not oniy be easier but a much safer measure to bend than to break them But amidst these debates and deliberations something stilt more alarming occurred CHAP XXIV War with the Volsci V OURIERS came post from Latium with the disa greeable advice that the Volsci had taken the field with a numerous army and were in full march to lay siege to the city which intelligence so much had those in testine broils divided the city produced very different effects in the senate and among the people The po pulace exulted with joy crying out that the gods were coming to avenge the pride of the fathers They ex horted each other not to give in their names for the war if they must go to perdition let it be in company with ill the orders of the state and not by themselves â That 140  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II the senators might take arms and march against the ene my let them who reaped the fruits of war encounter the dangers of it  The sertate in so critical a conjuncture having every thing to fear from within as well as without the walls were in the utmost perplexity wherefore they entreat ed the consul Servilias whose disposition was milder and more popular than his colleague s to ex rt himself for the delivery of the state from the evil that threatened it Servilius having dismissed the senate repaired to an assembly of the people where he tells them That the fathers had nothing more at heart than the redress of their grievances but in the moment they were delibe rating on proper measures for their interest who were but a part though by far the greatest a far more serious subject of fear had occurred to interrupt them which re garded the wliole community Nor was it possible for them while the enemy had almost reached their gates to apply their minds to any other subject but the war And though some respite were given it would not be come the people to refuse to take up arms for their coun try till they had been paid beforehand and as little for the honour of the senate to provide for their insolvent citizens through motives arising from their present fears than afterwards as the effects of inclination To con vince the assembly of the reality of these intentions he published a proclamation  Prohibiting all and sundry from detaining a Roman citizen in prison or in chains go as to prevent his enlisting himself under the con suls and from seizing or selling the effects of any sol dier or arresting his children or grandchildren while he remained in camp This edict being publish ed the debtors who were present immediately gave in their names and as now their persons could not be de tained by their creditors came out from their conceal ments and crowded into the forum to take the military oath Of these a considerable party was completed and none behaved with greater gallantry or contributed more to put an end to the war with the Volsci The consul led out his army against the enemy and encamp ed not far from then CHAP 25 ROMAN HISTORY 1Â CHAP XXV Defeat of the Volsci  HE next night the Volsci confidmg in the differ ences that subsisted among the Romans made au attempt upon their camp expecting to find some under cover of the night who would either desert to them or betray the rest They were discovered by the guard an alarm spread and upon a signal given they ran to arms Thus were the Volsci disappointed in their design and both parties for the remainder of that night continued quiet Next morning early the Volsci having filled up the ditches made an attack upon the rampart Already had they begun to break down the pallisadoes op all sides but the consul willing to try the mettle of his sol diers delayed coming to action for some time although the soldiers from every quarter especially the debtors cried out to him to give the signal But now convinced of their ardour he at length gave the word of command and the soldiers eager to attack made a general sally from every gate of the camp The enemy unable to stand so vigorous a charge were put to flight the foot pursued and put all to the sword they could overtake The rest were driven in great con sternation by the horse to their camp which was imme diately invested by the legions soon after deserted by the Volsci in a panic and taken and plundered by the soldiers The enemy fled to Suessa Pometia whither the Ro man legions pursued them the day after In a few days tlie city was taken and given to be plundered by the soldiers which was some relief in their present dis tress The consul marched back his victorious army to Rome with the greatest glory When he was applied to by the deputies of the Ecetrans who were a part of the Volsci and after Pometia was taken were afraid for themselves the senate by their decree granted them peace but their lauds were taken from them 142 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II I CHAP XXVI The Sabincs and Arunci defeated IMMEDIATELY after this a war with the Sabines menaced Rome but it was father a tumult than a war The city was alarmed in the night with an account that the Sabine army was ravaging the country and had ad vanced as far as the Anio plundering and burning all the arm houses in their Â ay A Posthufnius who had been dictator in the war with the Latins was immedi ately sent against them with the cavalry and the consul Servilius followed him with a select body of infantry Most of the stragglers were cut oil by the horse and the resistance the Sabine legions made against the foot when they came up with them was not vigorous Exhausted with their march and plundering the country in the night and many of them overcharged with eating and drinking in the houses as they had come along had not strength enough Heft to carry them away The war with the Sabmes being begun and ended the same night the next day when the Romans thought they had now secured peace with all their neighbours â he ambassadors of the Arunci came to the senate threatening them with an immediate declaration of war if they did not withdraw their troops from the territory of the Volsci At the same time that the couriers took their departure for Rome the army of the Arunci began their march The report that it was seen near Aricia occasioned such hurry and confusion at Rome that the senate could not be properly consulted and whilst they were arming themselves they could not give a deliberate answer to those who had laid them uuder that necessity They immediately march for Aricta with a hostile army nor was it far from thence that they came up with the Arunci whom they discussed in one battle CHAP 27 ROMAN HISTORY CHAP XXVII  â  â Disputes about the debts betvxen the Senate and People jT FrERthe defeat of the Arunci the Romans who bad been victorious in so many battles in so short a time now fully expected thai the promises made them by the consul and senate would have been put in execu tion But Appius from the native haughtiness of his temper and with a view to make void the promise his colleague had made the people adjudged the causes of the debtors with all the rigour the law would admit In consequence of which they who before had been prison ers were delivered up to heir creditors again and others were also added to the list When diligence was to be executed against a soldier he immediately applied to the other consul To Servi lius the multitude crowded for relief They reminded him f his promises enumerating their respective ser vices and exposing the wounds they had received They pressed him to lay their case before the senate that as their consul he might protect his citizens and as their general his soldiers These arguments had sufficient weight with the con sul but circumstances obliged him to temporize for he had not only his colleague to combat with but the whole body of the Patricians were unanimous against him In endeavouring to please both parties he had the good will of neither  The senators considered him as a soft easy consul that flattered the multitude and the people pro nounced him a cheat and it soon appeared that he was bated as much as Appius A dispute arose about the dedication of the temple of Mercury an honour which each of the consuls claimed as his right The senate referred the cognizance of that affair to the people aml enacted that whoever should be promoted to that honour should preside in the court of victuallers establish a board of trade and act as high priest within the verge of the temple The people gave that honourable commission to M Loetonus the first centurion of a legion but it was abuu 144 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II dantly evident they did not raise him to an office so much above bis rank with a view to his particular ho nour as to offer an open insult to the consuls This af front set Appius and the senate in a terrible rage but the people who had now acquired more spirit acted very differently from what they had done at first For despairing now of any redress from the consuls and the senate when they saw any debtor dragged to the tribu nal thither they crowded from all quarters Whenever the consul passed sentence they raised such a noise and clamour that it could not be heard nor if it had durst any one attempt to put it in execution Force now uni versally prevailed Insomuch that when a single debtor had been seized by a posse of officers in presence of the consul danger and fear of servitude shifted sides and from the debtors flew upon the creditors Add to these intestine calamities the terror of a war with the Sabines for which when a levy was decreed not a man would give in his name whilst Appius was all fury loudly complaining of the complacency of his col league who by a popular silence betrayed the interests of his country and besides that he had not done justice in respect to the debts had neglected to make the levies decreed by the senate Yet that the commonwealth was by no means abandoned nor the consular dignity without force whilst he alone remained to support his own authority and the honour of the senate When the mob hardened in licentiousness by constant use stood about him he ordered a remarkable ringleader of the sedition to be seized who after he was in the custody of the lictors appealed to the people The con sul would not have suffered this appeal to pass being well aware what the people s judgment would be had be not though with difficulty been overpersuaded rather by the wise remonstrances and authority of the senate than compelled by the seditious clamours of the people The evil grew every day more serious The multitude confmed themselves no longer to mere outcrie  but what was of a much more dangerous tendency they retired in parties to hold secret committees At length the con suls quitted their office bofli hated y the people Ap pius was however much in the good graces of the senate but Servilius neither of senate nor people CHAP 28 ROMAN HISTORY 415 CHAP XXVIII Further contests and the levies opposed JL HE new consuls were A Virginius and T Veturius The commons in the mean time uncertain how these new magistrates would act began to hold nocturnal con ventions partly on the Esquiline and partly on the Aventine hiHs for the purpose of concerting such mea sures as exigencies should require to prevent their being surprised into hasty resolutions in the forum or taking measures inconsiderately before they were properly di gested The consuls considering how dangerous the con sequences of these cabals might turn out made a report of them to the senate But the affair could not be taken regularly under con sideration so much tumult and clamour arose from every part of the house upon this representation agamst the consuls who instead of doing the duties of their office were for ridding themselves of the odious part of it by transferring it to the senate Were there really ma gistrates in Rome said they  there would be only one public council but the republic now was split into a thousand senate houses and assemblies some of which were held on the Esquiline others on the Aven tine hill One man of spirit such as Appius Claudius but that is of more consideration than a consul would send all these cabals a packing in an instant The consuls nettled at this reprimand asked the se nate in what manner they would have them to proceed assuring them at the same time that they should not want resolution to act agreeable to their pleasure It was therefore determined that they should proceed to make the levies with all possible severity as the people were become insolent for want of employment The senate being dissolved the consuls ascended their tribu nal and cited the younger citizens to enlist by name when nobody made answer and the people crowding round as if they had been summoned to an assembly told them  That the people would be no longer im posed on and that they should not have a single sol U6 TITOS LIVIUS BOOK IE dier unless they performed the promise that had been made them â that before they put arms in their hands â  it was highly proper they should restore them their li berty that they might know whether they were to fight for their country and fellow citizens or for des potic tyrants The consuls knew well the extent of their commission from the senate but of all those bold declai mers who had talked so high within the walls of the senate house not one appeared to share with them in the public odium Besides it appeared that this contest with the people would be a serious affair Therefore before they should come to extremities they judged it expedient to talk over the matter with the senate a second time which they did accordingly The young senators then crowd ed round the consuls chairs ordering them to abdicate the consulship and resign an authority they wanted spirit to support  CHAP xxix Tlie Consular authority slighted Various plans proposed J HE consuls having sufficiently tried both experi ments made this short reply Conscript fathers re member we tell you that a terrible sedition is on the point of breaking out and we insist that they who brand us with pusillanimity may only assist us in making the levies Since you advise violent measures â we shall act with all the spirit the keenest of you would desire With these words they returned to their tribunal and cailed upon one of the most factious whom ihey had in their view to come and be inrolled As the man stood still without returning an answer and a crowd got about him to protect him in case of need the consuls sent a lictor to seize him The lictor being repulsed such of the senators as were present with the consuls exclaiming against the indignity came down from the tribunal to support the lictor But the mob who had only preventer the officer from seizing the man now turned upon the senators The consuls interposed and the tumult was appeased Neither stones nor darts CHAP 29 ROMAN HISTORY 147 were employed the alfair passed with more noise and angry words than any real mischief The senate assembled tumultucmsly and went upon the business still more so Those who hod been person ally insulted demanding an inquiry and the most violent members declaring themselves more by their noise and clamour than by giving their opinions At length their passion subsided and the consuls having remarked to their reproach that the same ungovernable spirit that prevaited in the forum had now taken possession of the senate house they began their deliberations with more composure There were three different opinions prevailed in the senate P Virginias was not for a general act of grace and gave his opinion  That those only who upon ihe promise of the consul Servilius had carried arms against the Volsci Arunci and Sabines were entitled to a discharge Titus Largius represented  That this was not the time to weigh and balance services with precision â that the whole body of the people were drowned in debt and it was impossible to stop the evil but by a general release For to make a distinction among the debtors would only inflame not extinguish thii flame of discord Appius Claudius who was naturally violent and rendered still more so in the present emer gency by the haired of the people on the one side and the excessive praise of the senators on the other cried out  That it was npttmiseiy but licentiousness that was the source of thq e riots â That the behaviour of the populace was the effect of wantonness and not of fury The source of all these disorders lay in their right to appeal which divested the consuls of every  power but that of threatening since a delinquent could appeal from their judgment to that of their owa peers and co operators Come continued he let us create a dictator from whom their lies no ap peal and this flame which spreads with such vio lence will in an instant come to nothing Let them dare to insult an officer when they see the power of life and death in the hands of that person whose au thority they had the assurance to insult 148 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK If CHAP XXX Manius Valerius chosen Dictator _L HE opinion of Appius seemed to many as it really was extremely harsh and severe On the other hand the propositions by Virginius and Largius would be dangerous precedents especially that of Largius which would give a fatal blow to all credit and commerce It was admitted that the opinion of Virginius which by a judicious medium corrected Largius s excess was the most moderate and eligible But the intrigues of par ties and the view of private interest which ever did and ever will obstruct public deliberations turned the scale in favour of Appius s opinion who was within a little of being declared dictator himself which would en tirely have exasperated and alienated the people at this dangerous conjuncture when the Volsci JEqu t and Sa bines were all in arms together But the consuls and the older senators took care that an authority in itself imperious and absolute should be conferred upon one of a mild and moderate disposition So the election fell upon Manius Valerius the son of Volesus The people saw well enough that it was against them a dictator was cheated yet having got the right of appeal by a law preferred by his brother they suspected nothing oppressive or tyrannical from that family t An edict of the dictator much of the same nature with that published by the consul Servilius confirmed them afterwards in these hopes Wherefore in confi dence of the dictator s name and the sovereign power of his office they gave in their names without opposition Ten legions were raised an army superior to any levied before Each of the consuls commanded three and the dictator four They were obliged to take the field im mediately for the Equi had entered the territory of I atium with a hostile army and the Latins by their deputies insisted that the senate should relieve them or permit them to arm in their own defence It seemed more eligible to send an army for their protection than CHAP 30 ROMAN HISTORY  140 by putting arms in their hands to allow them to defend themselves Vetusjus the consul was therefore sent to their assistance which put an end to the inroads of the jEqui and obliged them to retire from the Champaign country as their dependence was not on the strength of their arms but the advantage of the ground they se cured themselves by keeping on the tops of the moun tains The other consul marched against the Votsei and scorning to spend time in laying waste their country he challenged them to move their camp nearer his and to ceme to action at once Both armies stood drawn up before their lines in a plain between their camps The Volsci had rather the advantage in numbers which en couraged them to advance without order as if they had despised the enemy The Roman consul did not ad vance nor sutler the soldiers to return the enemy s shouts but gavÂ orders to stand still with their spears fixed in the ground and when the enemy advanced near enough to attack them sword in hand The Volsci already exhausted with running and shout ing imagining the Romans were petrified with fear be gan the attack accordingly but finding themselves vi gorotfsly received and seeing the swords glittering in their eyes they took to their heels in as great disorder as if they had fallen into an ambuscade But they had already been so much exhausted with advancing to the field that they had not strength enough left to carry them out of it On the other hand the Romans having had nothing to fatigue them m the beginning of the action were fresh and vigorous and quickly came up with the Volsci al ready exhausted took their camp by assault drove out the enemy and pursued them to Velitrse which they en tered peli mell with them By the promiscuous slaugh ter of all ranks which ensued there was greater effusion of blood in this place than the action itself A few were pardoned who laid down their arms and gave them selves up 150 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IL CHAP XXXI Victory over the Sabines PURING these transactions among the Volsci the dictator was at blows with the Sabines on which side lay the weight of the war He defeated them took their camp and gained a complete victory He had broke the main body of their army by charging with his horse and by drawing out the wings too far their ranks were weakened in the centre In this confusion the foot charg ed them warmly and with a complete victory also forced their camp Since the action at lake Regillus there was not a more memorable battle than this The dictator entered the city in triumph and besides other honours a place of distinction with a curule chair was granted to him and his descendants at th 5 games of the circus The territory of Velitra was taken from the Volsci after their defeat and a colony sent from Rome for its cultivation Soon after this there was an engagement with the jEqni much indeed against the inclination of the consul who easily saw the difficulty attendmg an attack when the enemy was so advantageously posted but the soldiers complained that the war was protracted on purpose that the time of the dictator s authority might expire before they should reiurn to Rome which would render his promises as vain and ineffectual as Servilius bad been and so forced him rashly to march his army up the bill However imprudent this step the enemy s want of spirit crowned it with success for before the Romans were come within reach of their darts the SSqui struck with astonishment at their resolution abandoned their camp which by its situation was almost impregna ble and ran down into the valleys over against them â Here the Romans found much booty and victory without loss of blood After all these gallant actions and three different wars successfully ended the senate and people began to be equally solicitous about the event of their domestic dis putes The usurers had not been idle all the while but CHAP 32 ROMAN HISTORY 151 had their measures so conceited that by their interest and artful management they not only frustrated the expec tations but tf e good intentions of the dictaior also Valerius immediately after the return of the consul Vetusius previous to every other consideration made a motion in favour of the victorious commons and pre pared a bill for the relief of insolvent debtors When his motion was rejected   I plainly perceive said he that I am by no means agreeeble to you because I am for peace in the bosom of the republic My Her cules the period is not distant when you will wish that the Roman people had patrons of the same prin ciples But as to what regards me expect not that I will deceive my fellow citizens or continue dictator in vain A foreign war and domestic feuds were the republic s motives for honouring me witd the dictator ship We have now peace abroad ami I am prevent ed from establishing it at home I had much rather behold the sedition as a private person than with the title of dictator Then leaving the senate abruptly he resigned the dictatorship The matter appeared to the commons in its genuine point of view that he had laid down his office from a generous resentment of their injuries Wherefore as he had nobly exerted himself in their fa vour they conducted him home with loud shouts and acclamations as if he had fulfilled every obligation he had come under CHAP XXXII A secesiion J HE Fathers were now in the utmost terror lest the army should be disbanded and their private caballing and plotting be resumed for this reason though the le vies had been made by the dictator since they had taken the oath to the consuls they thought they were still bound to obey them and under pretence that the Equi were again in arms ordered them to be marched into the field An immediate sedition was the consequence The soldiers at first proposed it is said to put the con M8  TITUS LIVIUS Book II suls to death by that means to evade their military oath but being told that no religious engagement could be dissolved by a crime by the advice of one Sicinius without any orders from the consuls they withdrew to the sacred mountain on the other side of the Anio three miles from Rome This account meets with more credit than that of Piso who makes it the Aventine hill Here they fortified their camp with a moat and rampart continued quiet for several days though subject to no leader neither gave provocation nor received it and took nothing but what their subsistence barely required The city was now in the utmost consternation and both parties being mutually afraid of each other could come to no resolution that was decisive The commons who had been left in the city by their party dreaded the exasperated fathers who on the other hand uncer tain of their sentiments as to staying or going were equally afraid of them It was a common question How long will the seceders remain quiet What would be the consequence were any foreign war to break out in the mean time They were now sensible that there were no other means of saving the state but by re unit ing it and that for this reason the people must be re conciled and made their friends at any rate Wherefore they agreed to send Menenius Agrippa an excellent speaker and very acceptable to the com mons being descended of a Plebeian family as deputy to the seceders Being admitted into the camp he is said to have repeated the following fable in the rough and unpolished manner of the times without any other argu ment Upon an occasion says he when members of the human body were not on the same friendly foot ing as at present and each member had a council and language peculiar to itself the other parts of the body were in no small passion that they should all  sweat toil and labour for the belly whilst it enjoyed the pleasures provided for it in idleness and at ease In consequence of all this they conspired that the hands should no longer carry food to the mouth that the mouth should not receive it nor the teeth grind  it Whilst they were thus furiously intent upoh re CHAP 33 ROMAN HISTORY 153 ducing the belly by famine all the members separate ly and the body in a lump became lean and languid to an extreme Hence it appeared that the belly was not so idle as had been imagined and that if it was nourished by the other members it contributed no less to their support in its turn in communicating by the digestion of food to the several parts of the body that blood by which their life and strength subsisted and in circulating it in due quantities through all the veins He compared this intestine sedition of the parts of the human body to the discord that then divided the senate and people and the application as it was very natural had a wonderful influence upon their minds CHAP XXXIII Tribunes of the People created The Volsci routed and Corioli taken J T was then they entered upon terms of reconciliation and among other concessions the people were allowed to have magistrates of their own whose persons were to be sacred and whose office was to protect them against the power of the consuls Nor could any of the Patrician order be elected into that office Thus were two tri bunes of the people created in the persons of Cains Lici nius and L Albinus and they chose three colleagues for themselves Sicinius the ring leader of the mutiny is said to have been one of them but about the other two historians are not agreed According to some authors only two tribunes were created on the sacred mountain and that the law whereby their persons were made sa cred was enacted there During the secession Sp Cassius and Posthumus Co rninius entered in office as consuls In their consulship a treaty was concluded with the Latin nations One of them remained at Rome on purpose to ratify it whilst the other went to chastise the Volsci The Volsci An tiates were routed and forced into Longula which was taken by assault Polusca another city belonging to the enemy shared the same fate Then the Romans laid close siege to Corioli Among the troops that sat down before Corioli there 15 TITUS LIV1US Book II was a young officer a Pairician by birth named Mar cius ureally esteemed for his valour and prudence and afterwards sir named Coriolanus Wlnle the Romans were engaged in the siege ofCoriof and their an cut toil wholly t iken up with the operations of the besieged wrh in the walls and apprehending no danger from without the Volscian legions marching from Antium fell sudden ly upon them at t e same time ihat the besieg d made a vigorous sally from he town Marcius happened to be then on guard and pulling himself at the head of a select corps he not miy repulsed those who had sallied from the town but rushing luriously in at a gaie they had opened and having tilled ihe part of the city that lay next to him with blood and slaughter he hastily snaiched up some fire and threw it against the houses that overlooked the wall The cries of the townsmen and the shrieks of the women and children when they saw the flames break in out gave the Romans new spirits and damped the enemy who found the city was taken they had come to relieve Thus were the Volsci roined and Corioli taken at the same time The glory acquired by Marcius in this war so far eclipsed the reputation of the consul that if the treaty made with the Latins by Sp Ca sius alone whilst his colleague was absent an I engraven on a pillar of brass had not handed down to posterity that Posihumius Co minius commanded in the expedition against the Volsci his concern there wrould have been totally forgot This year the public lost Menenius Agnppa a man who through the who e course of his life had been dear to both senate and people but still more so to the people after their secession although he had the honour to be mediator and umpire in the dispute between the orders although he was chosen delegate from the fathers to the peop e and although he had influence to re unite the people to the senate he died so poor that all his estate was not sufficient to defray the expence of his funeral That charge was defrayed by the people who assessed themselves for that purpose each in the value of the sixth parth of an ass  The one eighth part of a farthing Chap 34 ROMAN HISTORY 155 Ti CHAP XXXIV A Famine 1TUS Geganius and Pubiius Minutius were elected consuls for the following year under whom though there was no enemy stirring abroad and every d tl er ence settled at home the stale waÂ afflicted by a cala mity more gnevous than either During tlie secession there was a total suspension of agriculture which brought on a dearth of provisions aud that was followed by a fa mine as severe as if the city had been besieged It would undoubtedly have ended in the destruction of both slave s and people had not the consuls provided for their relief by dispatching agents through all the countries around to buy up corn not only into Etruria all along the shore to the right of Ostia and through the country of the Volsci on the left as far as Cumae but even to Sicily such was the ill will of their neighbours that they were obliged to apply for relief to these remote countries Wheu they had purchased some corn at Cumae Aris todernus the tyrant detained the ships by way of re prisal for the effects of the Tarquins who had made him their heir They could make no purchases among the Volsci and in the country of Pomptinus the vic tuallers were in hazard of being insulted by the inha bitants However Tuscany furnished them with a small quantity Ly the Tiber which relieved the com mon people lor the present A dangerous war would have doubled the distress oc casioned by the famine had not a plague raging among the Volsci cut short their intentions when they were just On the point of beginning hostilities This calamity however sunk them so low that even when its vio lence had subsided they had not got the better of their fright The Romans increased their colony at Velitrae and sent a new one into the mountains of Norba which might serve for a fort in Pomptinus In the consulship of Marcus Minucius and A Sent 159 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IL pronius corn was imported in considerable quantities from Sicilv and there was a debate in the senate about the price at which it should be retailed Many were of opinion that they had now a fair opportunity of bumbling the commons and recovering these rights which by their secession and violence they had extorted from the senate Marcius Coriolanus who was a de clared enemy of the tribunitian power insisted  That if they would have provisions on the old footing it were but just they restored the senate its ancient rights Shall I as if reduced to a state of slavery and ransom  ed from robbers tamely behold these Plebeian ma gistrates Why do I see a Sicinius over my head  And must I bear these indignities longer than there is any necessity Must I to whom the pride of a king Tarquin was so intolerable put up with the insolence of Sicinius Let him secede now with the people at his back to the sacred mount or any other hill the way lies open Let them seize upon our corn in the fields as they did three years ago Let them enjoy now the fruits of their revolt I can venture to affirm that this calamity has conveyed to them such salutary instruction that they would rather chuse to apply themselves to agriculture than to arms by means of a new secession to interrupt it It is hard to say whether his plan ought to have been adopted though jt seems pretty evident that the senate by reducing the price of provisions might have rid themselves of the Tribunitian power and all other popular laws that had been imposed on them  CHAP XXXV Coriolanus condemned â retires among the Volsci â J HIS speech was even considered by the senate as too severe and it so exasperated the commons that they were on the point of taking up arms We are now they cried  to be attacked with famine like enemies we are to be deprived of every means of subsistence The ibreign corn the only resource that fortune offer ed us and so unexpectedly too is to be snatched from CHAP 35 ROMAN HISTORY 157 our mouths unless we give up our Tribunes tied hand â and foot to Coriolanus â unless he be allowed to wreak his vengeance on the commons of Rome Death or slavery is the only choice this new execu tioner has left us The mob would have fallen upon him as he left the house had not the tribunes very seasonably appointed him a day to take his trial Here their rage subsided because every one saw him self the judge and the disposer of the life or death of his adversary Marcius at first heard the threats of the tribunes with contempt affirming That their office was  instituted for protection not punishment and that they were the tribunes of the commons not of the fathers But so outrageous were the people that the fathers were glad to purchase their peace at the expence of one of their order They did all however in their power to stem the torrent of public odium and strained every nerve each in his private as well as public capacity to save him The first expedient they put in practice was to dispose his clients so judiciously as to deter the peo ple one by one from frequenting their meetings and cabals Then all the senate went in procession as if the whole body had been impeached and with the most pressing instances begged the people fltat if they would not acquit Marcius for the sake of his innocence they wou ld at their intercession spare one citizen one sena tor even should he be found guilty He did not appear on the day of his trial which in flamed them still the more He was â therefore con demned in his absence in consequence of which he re tired amongst the Volsci even then breathing nothing but revenge and carrying with him eve y hostile inten tion against his country The Volsci received him with every mark of respect and their civilities daily increas ed in proportion as his resentment against his country was more strongly marked for bitter complaints suc ceeded by terrible threats were often observed to drop from him He lived with Attius Tullius at that time the most respectable nobleman of all the Volsci and one who had always been an enemy to the Romans As the one was actuated by a hatred of an old standing and the other H 158 TITUS UVIUS BOOK II impelled by fresh resentment they conferred together about making war upon Home They easily saw that there would be some difficulty in engaging thÂ Volsci to take up arms which they had done so often to their own ruin Their spirits were broke by being so often en gaged in war and moreover their youth had suffered exceedingly by the late plague Length of time had al most extinguished the hatred between the two nations for which reason they judged that it would require â some address to rekindle the flame by means of some fresh indignity CHAP XXXVI A strange Phenomenon Y ERY opportunely for their purpose preparations were gomg on at Borne for renewmg the great games upon the following account In the morning of the tlay in which they had been represented the master of a slave had obliged him to carry a cross and whipt Jhim severely through the middle of the Circus notwith standing of which the exhibition went on as if there had been nothing ominous in the matter After some time had elapsed Jupiter appeared in a dream to T Atinius a plebeian and told him  That he was not satisfied with the person who led up the dance in the last games and unless they were renewed with mag niticence the state would repent it â Go say he  and tell these things to youf consuls The man although he was not without a sense of re ligion yet he was so ashamed to approach men of that dignified character with a story that might expose bim to ridicule tkut itls modesty prevailed over his fear This hesitation cost him dear In a few days his son dropped down dead That he might be at no loss to find out the cause of this sudden disaster whilst he was mourning for his loss the same vision appeared to him again in his sleep and seemed to ask him repeatedly If he had not been sufficiently punished for his con â tempt of the gods but if he did not instantly go and tell the consuls something still more dreadful would J befall him CHAP 37 ROMAN HISTORY 15Â Now he felt the impression more forcibly But still hesitating and putting it oil he was struck with a palsy all over his body It was then that the wrath of the gods roused him from his lethargy for afflicted by his former calamities and oppressed with the weight of his present trouble he called a meetmg of his nearest friends and telling them all he had heard and seen how Jupiter had often appeared to him in a dream how he had been threatened and the calamities in consequence which the gods had inflicted oh him by the unanimous advice of all present he was conveyed to the consuls in a litter into the forum By their order he was trans ported from thence into the senate house and when he had made the same relation there another extraordinary circumstance happened to the surprise of every body the man who was carried thither without the use of a single member returned as the story goes upon his own legs CHAP XXXVfl Tullui s plan for spiriting up the Vdsci against Rome 1 HE senate decreed that the games should be cele brated with all possible magnificence At the desire of Attius Tullus vast numbers of the Volscian youth re paired to Rome to see them Before the exhibition Tullus waited on the consuls as had been concerted at home with Martins and tells them Ire had something of importance to communicate that concerned the state Having retired where they could not be overheard he told them  h is with the utmost reluctancy that I am to mention any circumstance that may seem to reflect the teast dishonour on my countrymen but I come not to accuse them of any thing they have alreadyl â done but to put you on your guard with respect to what they may do The disposition Of my country men is by far more fluctuating and restless than I could wish This we have felt to our cost since we owe our existence as a nation at present more to your good nature than our own good behaviour There are in the city at this moment vast numbers of the Volsct The scene of exhibition will soon open 160 TITUS LIVIUS Book II and the attention of the citizens will be engrossed by it I remember what happened on u similar occasion by means of the Sabine youth within this city and I tremble lest our people should take some rash and in considerate step which I thought it my duty to lay  before you O consuls both on your account and ours For my own part 1 am resolved to go home imme diately lest by remaining on the spot my feelings should be hurt in what I might hear or see With these words he took his leave The consuls im mediately lay this equivocal hint the manner in which and the person by whom it was communicated before the senate who more out of regard fo the author s cre dit than any suspicion of danger were induced to take some steps by way of precaution which might as well have been spared Wherefore by a decree of the se nate the Volsci were ordered to evacuate the city and the public criers were dispatched to publish this order all over the city that the Volsci might all be gone before night Whilst they ran hither and thither to their quar ters to fetch their things they were in a terrible panic but on their return home their indignation rose to a prodigious pitch when they began to reflect that like infamous scoundrels or persons tainted with some infec tious disease they had been driven from seeing the games upon the day of the exhibition as unworthy to associate with gods or men CHAP XXXVIII Resentment of the Volsci J HEY returned from Rome in almost one contibucd body and Tullus who had gone before them as far as Ifle head of the spring of Ferentinum accosting the fore most of them as they came up asked them many ques tions and expressed his displeasure at the indignity that had been offered them Fond of any thing that en couraged their resentment they gave great attention to what he said and followed him to a plain below the road where the whole multitude were persuaded to join them There as if he had been haranguing them in an assem bly he spoke to the following effect  Should you CHAP 39 ROMAN HISTORY 161 gentlemen resolve to bury in oblivion the injuries done you by the Romans in former times and the losses you have suffered in short though you should forget all former wrongs is it possible that you can tamely bear the insult offered you to day by the Ro mans who have made our disgrace the prelude to their games Are you not sensible of the triumph they have this day over you What in the face of all the citizens â all the strangers â all the neigh bouring states to make such an ignominious depart ture Were not your wives and your children public ly affronted What were the sentiments of those who heard the proclamation What were the sentiments of those who saw you leaving the city Or what were the sentiments of those who met you on the way loaded with ignominy Why that we are a set of impious and profane wretches whose presence would have pollut ed the solemnity of the games and that we were re turning to make expiation This therefore is the rea son we are driven from the habitation the company and communication of honest men What are you not sensible that our very lives depended on our speedy departure If it does not rather deserve the name of a flight Do you not consider the Romans as your enemies among whom one day s delay would have been our last War is declared against you in this affront to the perdition of those who have doni it if you are but men Full of resentment before of themselves and exasperated still more with this discourse of Tullu each returned to his own home and inflamed their countrymen

abilities of their generals in their 162 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II iuperiority over their neighbours than to the bravery of tbeir troops Having marched to Circei he first drove the Roman colony from thence and delivered to the Volsci the city which he had freed from the Roman yoke Then crossing the country by marches and counter marches he made himself master of the towns lying on each side of the Latin road as Satricum Lon gula Polusca and Corioli which had been lately con quered by the Romans After this he retook Lavinium Corbio Vitellia Trebia Labici and Pedum From Pe dum he led his army toward Koine and encamped at the Cluilian ditch five miles from it From whence he detached pillaging parties to plunder the Roman lands having sent out guides however with the parties to save the lands of the Patricians either because his resentment was chiefly pointed at the commons or that he might widen the breach between the senate and them which certainly would have been the case so unwearied were the tribunes in inflaming the people already sufficiently irritated by bringing accusations against the first men of the state had they not been united by the fear of ene mies from without the greatest bond of harmony within however jealous of and incensed against each other In one point they differed however the consuls had all their confidence placed in arms and the commons preferred any terms to the chance of war Spurius Nau tiiH and Sex Furius were at that time consuls Whilst they were mustering the legions placing guards upon the walls and other posts where they thought them ne cessary they were alarmed with a turbulent noise of a multitude bawling out for peace Then they obliged them to convene the senate and lay before hem the ex pediency of sending deputjegJaJC Marciaa The se nate agreed to the motion after they observed the des pondency of the people Deputies were accordingly sent who brought back this haughty answer If the lands they had taken from the Volsci were first restored to them they might then talk of peace but if they chose to sit at their ease and live upon the spoils of former wars that hr who was neither insensible of the injuries done him at Rome nor the civilities shown him by the Volsci would endeavour to make them sensible that banish CHAP 40 ROMAN HISTORY 16 ment far from depressing had only exalted his cou rage The same gentlemen were sent back to him but they were not admitted to his camp We find also that the priest dressed in their robes of ceremony went to wait upon him at the camp humbly suing for peace but they succeeded no better than the deputies had done   â CHAP XL Rome relieved by the intercession of Vituria I HEN the ladie in vast crowds waited on Veturia Coriolanus s mother and Volumnia his wife whether by adviee of the senate or instigated by their own fears is not said But they certainly prevailed with Veturia a very old lady and Volumnia carrying her two sons by Marcius with her to walk to the enemy s camp and try if the tears and prayers of the women would defend the city since the men were no longer able to do it by arms When they had reached the camp and word carried lo Coriolanus that a great train of ladies had come to wait upon him as neither the majesty of a pub lic deputation nor the respect due to religion and the priesthood haJ been capable of moving him he thought be would be proof against the tears of a troop of women But when he was told by one of his acquaintances who had distinguished Veturia among the rest by her dis consolate look standing between her daughter in law and her grand children  If my eyes do not deceive me your mother wife and children are here Coriolanus threw himself from his tribunal almost out of his senses and run full of anguish to embrace his mother Stay says she assuming an air and tone of resentment instead of intreaties  let me know before I receive your em braces whether I speak to a son or an enemy and whether I am considered as your

a long servitude His wife and children then saluted him The tears and lamentations of all the Roman ladies for their own account and that of their country at length softened Coriolanus He embraced his relations and dismissed them soon after he decamped and marched his army back from the city â Accoiding to some accounts the Volsci were so exasperated at his withdrawing the legi ons from the Roman territory that they put him to death Others give a different account of the matter Fabius by far the most ancient author extant affirms that he lived to a great old age and mentions a saying of his in the decline of life  that banishment was iti all cases in supportable but especially to an old man The men were not jealous of the encomiums bestowed upon the women for such was their disinterestedness that none endeavoured to detract from the glory of ano ther To preserve the remembrance of so singular an event by a public monument they built and dedicated a temple to Female Fortune The Volsci once more in conjunction with the Equi returned into the Roman ter ritory but the jEqui refused to fight under the command of Attius Tullus This contest about the nomination of a general who should command both armies was pro ductive at first of a quarrel which ended in a bloody battle There the fortune of the Roman people dispatched two formidable armies in a battle no less fatal to the combatantsi than it was obstinate The consuls for the ensuing year were T Sicinius and CHAP 41 ROMAN HISTORY  165 C Aquilins The province of the Volsci fell to Sicinius and the Hernici who were also in motion fell to Aqui lius The Hcmici were this year defeated j and with the Volsci the Romans had a drawn battle CHAP XLI â  Cassius condemned for affecting Popularity Jl HEN Spurius Cassius and Proculus Virginius were made consuls a treaty was concluded with the Hernici by which they ceded two thirds of their lands one of which the consul intended to divide among the Latins and the other among the commons To this act of ge nerosity he added some ground unjustly held by private persons to the prejudice of the public Many of the fa thers who were themselves possessors of these lands were alarmed at their proceeding thinking their property was in danger And the senate was under no less con cern for the public safety being apprehensive that the consul by his liberality aimed at a power which would be dangerous to their liberty It was then that the Agrarian law was first mentioned which from that day to this whenever it came to be the subject of debate ne ver failed to raise great commotions in the state The other consul opposed the division and was sup ported by the senate and some of the people At first they had begun to consider it as no great compliment when their allies were to share equally with them and then they listened with great attention to Virginius when he often prophesied in their assemblies That his col league s liberality had a most pernicious tendency  That whoever should be tempted with these lands would find that they were given them in exchange for their liberty That the very intention of them was to pave the way for regal power which was pretty evi dent from the scheme of division in which the allies and LStin nations are admitted to a share of the spoil For what purpose was a third part of the conquered il lands restored to the Hernici who but lately had ap peared in arms against them but that these nations might have Cassius at their head instead of Coriolanus 166 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK It Both the promoter and the opposer of the Agrarian law had each his party among the people to whom both consuls were emulous who should be most oblig ing Virginius declared he should have no objection to the division proposed were it confined to Roman citizens only Cassius s credit sunk greatly with the people for the kindnrss he showed in getting the allies included in the Agrarian law wherefore to recover their good graces by another act of generosity he ordered the peo ple to be reimbursed in the money they had paid for the corn imported from Sicily but the people rejected it with indignation considering it in no other light than as bounty money to enlist them to serve under the ensigns of tyranny Nay such was their aversion at monarchy that they spurned at his presents as if ihey had swimmed in plenty It is certain that the moment he was out of office he was condemned and suffered accordingly Some make his father the author of his punishment who having tried him at home scourged and put him to death consecrat ing at the same time all his effects to Ceres and apply ing the proceeds to the erection of a statue to that god dess with this inscription  PRESENTED BY THE CASSIAN FAMILY I find in some authors what seerns most probable that a day was assigned him by Kaeso Fabius and Lucius Valerius the qusestors to answer to an impeachment for treason when he was condemned by a sentence of the people and his house demolished by public autho rity It stood where we have now the area before the temple of Tellus By whomsoever he was sentenced whether by his father or the people it is universally admitted that he suffered in the consulship of Ser Cor nelius and Q Fabius  The business of these magistrates was to take care of the finances and the public treasure for which they were answerable at the expiry of their office which save them a right to appear as prosecutors against sr ch as attempted to misapply the public â property CHAP 42 ROMAN HISTORY CHAP XLII Domestic broils The jEqui and Volsci defeated  BUT the resentment of the people did not long sur vive Cassius The charms of the Agrartan law the pro moter of which they themselves had cut off recurred to their minds with double force What added to these impressions was the rapacity of the fathers who aher the defeat of the Volsci and jEqui that year defrauded them of the plunder for all the perquisites arismg from the war were converted into money by the consul ta biud and lodged in the exchequer The whole Fabtan family became odious to the people on account ot the last consul The fathers however prevailed so tar hat Kaeso Fabius succeeded to the consulate with L flSmilHM The people still more unrated by this election raised a foreign war with their seditious behaviour at home This war gave a short respite to their civil commotion and the senate and people uniting under the conduct ot jEmiiim ave a fatal blow to the jEqui and Volecr who had renewed the war The enemy suffered more m their flight than they did in the battle so warmly did the horse pursue them  The temple of Castor was dedicated upon the IJttt day of July of that year It had been vowed durmg the war with the Latins by Posthumius the dictator whose son was created duumvir on purpose for its deo cation That year too the alluring impressions o the Agrarian law were revived in the minds of the populace The tribunes of the people by their exertions m favour of this popular law strove to ennoble their popular office The fathers sensible that there was too much fire m the spirit of the commons even when they had no mduce ment to shew it trembled at the thoughts of largesses as incitements to rashness The consuls at the head ot the senate showed themselves extremely keen m the op position and prevailed not only for the present but had also the address to get M Fabius the brother of KÂ so  Anno Romse 269 168  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II and Lucius Valerius still more odious to the people for liis impeachment ot Sp Cassius to be consuls for the en suing year During their consulate the bickerings with the tri bunes did not cease but the law was thrown aside and its patrons exposed to ridicule for boasting of good offi ces they had no power to confer At this time the Fa bian family was in high repute owing to their noble and steady exertions in opposition to the tribunes in the course of three successive consulships Wherefore the consular dignity was continued in that family for some time where it had been so judiciously placed After this the Vejentes commenced hostilities and the Volsci also take the field Rome however was more than a match for all her foreign enemies had her strength not been exhausted in domestic wranglings Moreover whilst the minds of all ranks were tlrus afflicted they were alarmed with celestial prodigies portending almost every day some signal calamity to town and country And the soothsayer when consulted in a private as well as public capacity sometimes by the entrails at others by the flight of birds could give no other reason why the gods were displeased but that the sacrifices had not been performed with the proper ceremonies Their fears had this effect that the vestal Opia being convicted of incontinence was condemned and suffered the usual pu nishment CHAP XLIII Great generalship f Fabius I HEN Q Fabius and TIaius Julius were made con suls During this year the civil commotions were as violent as ever and the war with the neighbouring states spread farther than before For new the jEqu were in arrri and the Vejentes were ravaging the Roman terri tories These wars growing still more serious KJESO Fa bius and Sp Furius are chosen consuls The Equi had laid siege to Onona a Latin city when the Vejentes loaded with plunder threatened to lay siege to Rome itself Such terrors should no doubt CHAP 43 ROMAN HISTORY 169 have cemented the jarring parties at home but they on ly served to render the people more insolent and untract able They were now put upofli the old scheme of re fusing to iulist Sp Licinius a tribune of the people thinking that now was the critical moment when the slate was in the utmost difficulty to cram the Agrarian law down the throats of the fathers had set himself to obstruct the levies But the whole load of envv to which the college of tribunes was exposed fell upon the author of this project For the consuls were not keener in disappointing bis design than his own colleague who to a man were in concert against him and by their assistance the consuls got the levies completed Against the two hostile powers two armies were raised at the same time the command of the one was given to Fabius to be led against the jEqui and of the other to Furius to march against the Vejentes With the Vejentes nothing remarkable occurred and Fabius had more trouble in managing his army than in defeating the enemy This man alone supported the common wealth while the army from their hatred to him as consul did all in their power to land it in perdition For after the consul in his preparations for and ma nagement of the war had given in every instance the most signal proofs of his abilities as a general he drew up his army with such judgment that by means of the horse alone be put the enemy to flight and yet when nothing was left for the foot but to pursue the flying enemy they absolutely refused it Nor could sharne for their criminal conduct their present disgrace m the face of the sun their future danger had the enemy re covered spirit to say nothing of the entreaties of a ge neral whom they hateJ prevail on them to move one foot faster nor even to march in good order But they  retired without orders and went back to the camp with looks so expressive of their dejection that one would  have imagined they had been heartily drubbed Some times cursing their general and sometimes the horse for their gallant exertions The general gave himself no trouble about fmding out an antidote for so dangerous a precedent so true it is that great men who excel in other respects more frequently want address to govern  their citizens than talents to conquer enemies The 170 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK If consul returned to Rome less distinguished for his mili tary glory than the inveterate and unrelenting hatred of the soldiers against him The fathers however had in fluence enough to continue the consulship in the Fabian family for they elected M Fabius consul aud gave him C Manlius for his colleague CHAP XLIV Claudius plan for defeating the tribunes NE of the tribunes brought the Agrarian law on the carpet again this year It was Tib Pontificius who go ing to work the same way with Sp Licinius obstructed the levies for a little Whilst the fathers were once more disconcerted with this opposition Appius Claudius told them That they had baffled the efforts of tribuni tian power the year before that at present they might do it by employing that power against itself an ex pedient that would never fail of success seeing they had found by experience that it could be cut down by its own force That one of the number might al ways be found who proud of defeating his colleagues and gaining the esteem of the better part of the citi zens would be disposed to promote the good of the public And no doubt several of these were it ne  cessary would be found ready to assist the consuls but one was sufficient against the whole body That therefore the best conduct of the consuls and principal senator would be only to exert themselves to bring over some one of these tribunes and attach him to the interest of the senate and commonwealth if their in fluence did not extend to the whole The fathers pursuant to Appius s advice treated the tribunes in the most kind and obliging manner and those who had been consuls and had private claims against any of them partly by their interest and partly by their authority prevailed on them to consent to make the privileges of the tribunitian power beneficial to the state Wherefore having four to one on their side the consuls were enabled to complete the levies Upon this they marched agamst the Vejentes who were supported by auxiliaries from all parts of Etruria flocking to them X HAP 45 ROMAN HISTORY  171 not so much from any prepossession in their favour as they were impressed with a notion that the Roman state would be brought to perdition by its intestine broils In a general convention of all the stales of Etruria the leading men were constantly bawling out That of the power of the Romans there would be no end â were they not by their seditions to turn their fury against one another â That this was the only poison the only blot found in states by which the most powerful were exposed to ruin â That this evil the bad effects whereof had been lately suspended partly by the wisdom of the senate and partly by the peo pie s patience was at length come to such an excess that Rome might be said to form two cities of which eaclvhad its own laws and magistrates â That though at first they showed themselves refractory in giving in their names to be enlisted yet in the field they obeyed their officers and whatever divisions were in the city while their military discipline could be maintained their animosities could be quelled but now the re bellion had passed from the city into the camp â That in the last war when drawn up in order of battle and in heat of action the Roman soldiery had volun tarily resigned the victory to the vEqni after it was obtained having quitted their standards abandoned their general in time of aciion and returned without his orders into the camp â That it was an undoubted truth that with proper exertions Rome might be re duced by its own forces â That it was only necessary to make a declaration and show of war and that fate and the gods would do all the rest Roused by these hopes the Etrurians armed and by a variety of fortune during the course of the war were often defeated and often victorious in their turn CHAP XLV War with the Vejentes and Etrurians â Eagerness of the Roman army 1 HE Roman consuls too dreaded nothing so much as their own forces â their own arms The retrospect 172 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II to their scandalous behaviour last war was terrible especially when they considered that they might be in the same predicament to have the terror of two armies upon them at the same time Wherefore to avoid a danger which tlirea ened them within as well as with out thev kept within their camp hoping that time and a little delay would soften their resentment against the senate and bring them to reason This prompted the confederates to act with still greater assurance They challenged them tri turn on They rode up before the camp and insulted them At last when they found nei ther the consuls nor the army in ihe least affected by their rodomontade they cried out  That they only pretended to have differences among themselves to serve for a cloak to their cowardice and that it was not the fidelity but the courage of the soldiers which the consuls suspected â That silence and quietness among men in arms was a species of sedition never heard of before Besides these reproaches they upbraided them with the obscurity of their origin and novelty of their fami lies in some respects true and others not These in vectives thrown out under their noses at the foot of the rampart and gates of the camp gave the consuls no con cern but stung the soldiers unaccustomed to such lan guage with shame and indignation at the satiietime that their domestic quarrels were quite forgot That the ene my should pa s unpunished they could by no means subscribe to but then they could not bear that the fa thers or consuls should have the glory of a Victory Thus were they agitated between two violent impulses of mind with respect to their foreign and domestic ene mies At length their indignation against the former prevailed unable to bear their outrageous insults any longer They came in crowds to the consuls tents in sisting that they should be led on to battle and the sig nal given The consuls seemed to confer together about the part they should act and drew out their conference to a great length They wished for nothing more than to engage but it was necessary to conceal it in order to quicken the resentment of the soldiers by a seeming de lay and opposition They therefore returned for an CHA 45 ROMAN HISTORY 173 swer that their demand was unseasonable it was not yet time to fight so that they must keep within their camp Then a proclamation was made prohibiting them to engage under the severe penalty of being treated as an enemy Dismissed thus the backwardness the consuls shewed to fighting only served to increase their ardour more over when the enemy got intelligence that the consuls had resolved not to risk a battle they repeated their insults with more violence than ever being now assured they might do it with impunity as the soldiers would not be trusted with arms This at last would terminate in a mutiny and that in the dissolution of the Roman empire Stimulated with these reflections they advan ced haughtily to the works branded them with a thou sand opprobrious names and were within a little of storming the camp The soldiers could no longer suffer an abuse so offen sive but ran from all quarters of the camp to the con suls not formally as before by the principal of the cen turions but almost all in a body with loud cries de manding to be Ied on to battle The time was now come but they were still put off at last Fabius find ing his colleague giving way lest the tumult should end in a revolt after the trumpet had sounded to silence addressed him thus That these fellows can conquer 1 am perfectly assured but whether they will â that is the question Therefore with me it is a decided and determined point never to give the signal for battle till they first swear that they will return vic torious They once deceived a Roman consul but the gods they will not deceive Among the fore most of those who were urgent for battle was M Flavo leius a centurion I shall return Marcus Fabius said he  from the field victorious If I deceive you may father Jupiter Mars Gradivus and ihe other incensed deities dash me to pieces The rest of the army followed his example each swearing to the same purpose Having thus sworn the signal is given they fly to their arms and big with resentment as well as hopes they march em to battle They tell them now to deal 174 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IL about their invectives and challenge those who had been so ready with their tongues to shew what they can do with their swords All that day the fathers and com mons signalized themselves with prodigious acts of va lour but of all others the Fabian name and family dis tinguished themselves most determined in that battle to recover the affections of the commons which they had lost in their disputes at home The army is drawn up nor were the Vejentes and Etrurians backward to engage CHAP XLVL A battle 2 Fabitti killed W ITH the enemy it amounted almost to a certainty that they would be no more in earnest in fighting against them than they were against the Equi nor did they doubt but something still more gross would ensue when their minds were in such a ferment and at a junc ture so very critical But they were dreadfully disap pointed for in no former action did the Romans en gage with greater spirit so much had they been exaspe rated by the enemy s insults anil the consuls delays The Etrurians had scarcely time to draw up when the Romans in the first hurry having thrown their javelins at random rather than with any aim rushed in with their swords which of all other wenpons make the bloodiest work Among the Patricians the Fabian family distinguished themselves by their extraordinary gallantry and set a noble example to their fellow citizens Quintus Fabius who had been consul three years before was the first who rushed among the thickest of the Vejentes but be ing exposed to enemies on every side a Tuscan full of his strength and skill in arms run him through the breast with his sword when he was not aware of him Fabius having extracted the blade and falling forwards expired of the wound Both armies were sensible of the difference made by the fall of this single officer and the Romans had begun to give ground when M Fabius the consul skipping over thu dead body and covering  47 ROMAN HISTORY 175 it with his shield cried put  Was it to this purpose â you swore gentlemen that you would fly back with the enemy at your heels to the camp Are you so much more afraid of these your most dastardly ene mies than of Jupiter and Mars by whom you have sworn I who have not yet sworn shall either return victorious or fall here with my sword in my hand near thee O Quint us Fabius  Theji CiÂ so Fabius who had been his predecessor in office steps up to the consul and asks him  Is it with these words brother that you think to succeed with soldiers No The gods by whom they have sworn will give them resolution As for us for the credit of the rank we bear and fhe honour of the Fabian name let us animate our fellow soldiers more by the gallantry of our actions than the force of our argu ments With these words the two Fabii flew with their lances to the foremost ranks and drew the whole battalion after them CHAP XLVIl Defeat of the Vejentes Ifc Manliut killed Fabiut becomes popular T HE battle being thus restored in one wing the con sul C Manlius with no less gallantry began the action in the other where fortune almost took the same turn For as in the other the soldiers nobly supported Q Fa bius so in this they kept close by Manlius driving the enemy before him as if they had been totally routed but receiving a dangerous wound he retired from the field and thinking he was killed drew back and they would have retreated had not the other consul gallopping up with some squadrons of horse cried aloud that his colleague was alive and that he himself having routed the other wing of the enemy was come to their assis tance and by that means recovered the fortune of the day Manlius too to re animate his troops placed him self again at their head The sight of the two consuls gave the Romans new courage The enemy s ranks were at this time const 178 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II derahly thirmed for trusting to the superiority of num bers they had detached the corps de reserve to storm the Roman camp There meeting with little resistance they carried it at the tirst assault but whilst they were more intent upon plunder than fighting the Triarii who could not sustain the first charge got time to send advice to the consuls of what passed in the camp and putting themselves in a body returned to the general s tent and of themselves renewed tlie engagement The consul Manlius too posted back to the camp planted guards at every gate and left the enemy not an opening to retire through Despair threw them into a fit of rage rather than inspired them with courage For when they had often attempted to force their way without success a body of youth attacked the consul whom they knew by the splendour of his arms The first volley of darts was received by the soldiers who supported him but the fury of the assailants at last prevailed for the consul having received a mortal wound fell from his horse when all his party were routed  This inspired the Etrurians with fresh courage and spread universal terror throughout the Roman camp and it would have ended in the total loss of the day had not the lieutenants carried off the bady of the consul and opened one of the gates of the camp for a passage to the enemy Through it they rushed out with the utmost precipitation and by the way fell in with the other consul who had been victorious and by his party were almost all cut to pieces Thus a glorious victory was obtained but the joy was damped by the loss of two of their bravest officers Wherefore the consul after the senate had decreed him the honour of a triumph declined it with this apo logy  That if the army could go through the ceremony  of a triumph without a general their generous exer  tions in the war entitled them to that honour and he would subscribe to it with pleasure but for his own part whilst his family were in mourning for the loss  So called from their position beinir marshalled in the third rank as ttie strength and hopes of their party They were com roonjy veterans of experience and known valour CHAP 48 ROMAN HISTORY  m of his brother Q Fabius and the republic for the loss of one of its parents he could not think of accepting the laurel defaced with public as well as private grief     The refusal of a triumph did him more honour than any triumph could have done so true it is that a proper neglect of glory sometimes considerably exalts it His first care was to pay the last honours to his brother and his colleague he pronounced their funeral orations him self and set the glorious actions of both in the fullest light  by which means the generous praises he bestow ed reflected in a very great degree upon himself Agree able to a plan he laid down to himself in the beginning of his consulship of bringing about a reconciliation be tween the senate and people he distributed the wounded soldiers among the houses of the senators to be cured and most into those of the Fabii and they were drest no where else with so much care From that date the Fabii became popular but by methods entirely consistent with and salutary to the commonwealth CHAP XLVIII Proposal of the Fabian Family J N consequence of this agreeable reverse Caeso Fabius is chosen consul with T Virginins as much by the good will of the populace as the interest of the senate 5 and make a point of it before he entered upon levies wars or any other public business that the hopes of con cord which begun already to be conceived should be nourished so as the senate and people might rjuickly come to a perfect understanding For this purpose in the beginning of the new year he made a motion that before any tribune should have it in his power to revive the question about the Agrarian law the senate should in its own right begin the division of the land taken from the enemy among the people with all the impar ttality in their power For nothing was more just than that these people shoutd have it by whose blood and toil it had been purchased The fathers would not agree to the motion 5 nay some of them complained that the 178 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II spirit of Caeso Fabius which formerly appeared great in every manly exertion through an excess of glory was now enervated and effeminate After this in the city party prejudice continued dor mant The Latins were however harassed by the in roads of the L Iui Coeso was dispatched with an army to chastise them and entered their country to make re prisals Upon this the Equi retired mto their towns and kept themselves within their walls for which reason no remarkable action happened By the rashness of the other consul the Roman army suffered severely in an action with the Vejentes and Ijnt for the seasonable in tervention of Cseso had beeii all cnt to pieces From this time with the Vejentes there was neither solid peace nor open war Tliflir views seemed to ex tend to rapine and plunder only Upon the approach of the Roman legions they fled into tl eir capitol  and the moment they disappeared ihey renewed their incursions upon the Roman territories evading a general engage ment by appearing to be at peare and all terms of ac commodation by repeated acts of hostility so that this war could neither be dropped nor finally discussed There were other nations too as the HL u and Volsci who never continuing longer quiet than till they had forgot their last loss were on the xiint of declarmg war nor was it improbable that the Sabines the constant enemies of Rome and all Etruria would quickly arm against them But the Vejentes who were rather cou stant than a formidable enemy gave them more trouble by their frequent inroads thnn apprehension of danger which at uo time could be so far overlooked as to per mit their attention to be directed to any other i narter Upon this the Fabian family made a proposal to the senate by the mouth of the consul in name of the rest to the following etfect Conscript fatliers to oppose the enterprises of the Vejentes as you well know re quires raiher an assiduous than a powerful party Do ye take care of the other wars and leave us of the Fabian family to manage the Vejentes We under take to be the guardians of the majesty of the Roman name in that quarter This war we will carry on at our private expeoce as if our family were only coo CHAP 40 ROMAN HISTORY 170 cerned in it so that the state may be at no charge in men or money upon that score The offer was ac cepted with great acknowledgments aud ihe consul left the house and retired home accompamed by a number of his clan who stood waiting in the porch till they should know the resolution of the senate They were ordered to rendezvous the next day in amis at the consul s gate and each of them departed to his own house accordingly  CHAP XLIX Tlit Fabii leave the city to keep the Vejentet in awe who sue for peace J HE news immediately spread over the whole city Every body admired every body extolled the Fabii to the skies That one single family should take upon them the burden of the state  that the war with the Ve jentes should be carried on at the expence and by the arms of private persons was an act of generosity never heard of before Were there two more such families in Rome the one might take upon them the war againsl the Volsci and the other agamst the JSqui whilst the  cornmomveali h would remain quiet and all the neigh bouring nations be added to its domain The next day the Fabii appeared all accoutered as they had been ordered When the consul came out in his military dress he saw his whole clan draw i up in the court before his house Tmd being received into the middle of tliem commanded them to march Never did an army so few in number and so highly distinguish ed with the praises and admiration of all march through the city Three hundred and six heroes all Patricians all of the same family of whom not one but might be judged worthy of commanding an army left the city threatening destruction to Veii by means of their in trinsic power alone They were followed by a crowd of their friends and clients animated with the same spirit and zeal and actuated only by great and noble views Others excited by public concern and transported with esteem and admiration cried out  Go brave men ISO TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II may fortune be with you â may your success be adequate to the generosity of your undertaking Then may you look for consulships â triumphs â all the re Wards alt the honours it is in the power of your country to bestow Passing by the capitol citadel and other temples every body implored all the gods that occurred to their eyes or imagination to favour theif departure and undertaking and to grant them a speedy and happy return to their country and parents But these prayers were not heard Marching out by an unlucky way through the right arch of the gate Carrnentalis they arrived at the river Cremera where they judged it would be proper to raise works and leave a garrison for their defence Lucius Emilius and C Servilius were at that time chosen consuls Whilst nothing was studied on either side but plun dering and reprisals the Fabii found themselves suffi cient to protect the Roman territory and by detaching flying parties through all the country where the Tuscau territory borders upon that of Rome protected their own frontiers and became very troublesome to that of the hnemy But these devastations were cut short For to enable die enemy to carry the works at Cremeraj they sent for an army out of Etruria L Emilius the consul in the mean time coming up with the Roman legions immediately attacked them The Vejentes had no time for battle arrangement insomuch that in the first hurry and confusion whilst theywere drawing up in form and posting a corps de reserve a wing of the Roman cavalry charged them so suddenly in flank that they had neither room to form their lines nor make an attack They were consequently routed and retreating to the Red Rocks where they had their camp humbly sued For peace That they obtained but from the natural levity of their tempers before the Roman garrison was withdrawn from Creraerai tliey were qaite of another mind CHAP 50 ROMAN HISTORY 181 CHAP L  The Fabii full into an ambuscade and are cut off V NCE more the Vejentes resumed their operation against the Fabii without any new preparations nor did they content themselves with ravaging the countrv or making sudden incursions but sometimes measured their swords in pitched battles upon fair ground Thus one Roman family frequently carried off the victory from a people who were at that time the most opulent of all the Etrurian nations By this the Vejentes at first thought themselves disgraced and highly affronted and in consequence formed a design of laying ambuscades for their intrepid enemy and rejoiced to find that the forwardness of the Fabii increased with their repeated victories Wherefore herds of cattle were frequently driven out in the way of foraging parties as if they had lighted on them by chance and by the flight of the peasants vast tracts of land seemed to be abandoned Parties of soldiers were also sent out to chastise the ravagers who retreated oftener through a pretended than a real fear By this time the Fabii held the enemy in such sove reign contempt that they did not imagine they could stand against their victorious arms let the occasion or ground be ever so advantageous Elated with these hopes and seeing some herds of cattle grazing in a plain at a considerable distance from Cremera although they were guarded by some small parties of the enemy they ran from the fort to carry them off Thinking them selves secure they had passed the ambush laid for them on both sides of the way and had dispersed in pursuit of the cattle straggling through the fields which they always do upon an alarm the enemy suddenly quitting their lurking places appeared all at once in front and in rear and on every side At first they raised a terrible shout and then poured in a volley of darts upon them from every quarter The Etrurians came closer together till the Fabii were totally surrounded by one strong uniform body of armed muti 182 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II and the more they were pressed by the enemy they were obliged to contract their own circle in proportion which at once discovered their weakness and the enemy s vast superiority in point of numbers when their ranks were crowded into so narrow a space Then giving over an attack which they made with equal vigour on all sides they directed all their force to one point Thither draw ing up in a wedge by the weight of their bodies and the points of their swords they opened a passage for themselves that led by an easy ascent to the side of a hill where they first halted As soon as the advantage of the ground had given them leisure to respire and recover from the shock of so great a surprise they beat back the assailants and by the convenience of their post small as their party was were getting the better of them when the Vejentes by fetching a compass possessed themselves of the top of the hill Thus the enemy became again superior The Fabii were all killed to a man and the fort taken It is universally admitted that three hundred and six fell there and that there only remained a youth of about fourteen years of age as a stock to the Fabian family which in future times was to be the prop and stay of the Roman people both by their counsel and their sword upon the most trying occasions  CHAP LI The Vejentes punished J HIS disaster happened in the consulship of C Ho ratius and T Menenius The latter was immediately dispatched to chastise the insolence of the Etrurians which their victory had created but he was defeated and the Janiculum taken Moreover as the city was in want of provisions and the Etrurians already on this side the Tiber the city would certainly have undergone a siege had not the consul Horatius been recalled from the expedition against the Volsci So close to the walls of Rome was this war brought that the first battle was fought at the temple of Hope with no advantage on   either side and the second at the gate there although CHAP 52 ROMAN HISTORY 183 the Romans could boast of no great advantage yet that engagement gave them new spirit and encouraged them to behave better in every future action A Virginius and Sp Servilius succeeded as consuls after the check the Vejentes received in the last engage ment they declined coming to another But they plunder ed the country and from the fort Janiculum they made incursions upon the Roman lands all around Neither the farmers nor their cattle were any where safe But they were at last taken in the same trap they had laid for the Fabii For pursuing some cattle which had been sent out on purpose to decoy them they fell headlong into the ambuscade their numbers only served to in crease the slaughter Their extravagant resentment for this loss laid the foundation of a much greater For passing the Tiber in the night they attempted to storm the camp of Servilius the consul But there they met with so warm a reception that after a prodigious slaugh ter with great difficulty they got back to the Janiculum The consul immediately crossed the river and fortified his camp at the foot of the hill F rly next morning a kittle flushed with success the day before or rather impelled by the want of provisions to take the shortest course however dangerous to procure them he incon siderately led his army up the hill to the enemy s camp where he received a more shameful repulse than he had given the day before But his colleague came up and saved both him and his army Between the two armies a dreadful havock was made among the Etrurians as they were endeavouring to escape first from the one and then from the other Thus by a fortunate impru dent step the war with the Vejentes got a finishing stroke U CHAP Lll Trial of Menqnius and Servilius PON the return oF peace provisions became cheaper in the city for they had corn from Campania and there being now no apprehensions of future scarcity the citizens brought out what they had concealed and 194 TITUS LIVIUS Book II hoarded tip Peace and plenty soon produced dissipa tion and now when they had no disturbance abroad they began to revive their old contentions at borne The tribunes set the populace in a ferment by their favourite topic the Agrarian law They inflamed them against the senators in the opposition and in this they not only pointed at the whole body but at individuals also Q Confidius and T Genucius who revived the plea of the Agrarian law at this time cited T Menenius to take his trial He was charged with the loss of the garrison at Cremera when his camp lay but a small distance from it They condemned him although the fathers had interested themselves no less for him than they had done for Coriolanus and the popularity of his father Agrippa not yet totally forgot The tribunes restricted his punishment to a fine for though they had sentenced him to die after his condemnation they only fined him in two thousand asses of brass This cost him his life for it is said that being unable to bear the disgrace and the grief it occasioned he soon fell a vic tim to a distemper brought on him by it Another senator Sp Servilius was also impeached immediately on the expiry of his office in the consul ship of C Nantius and Publius Valerius the tribunes L Caedicius and T Statius having in the beginning of the year appointed him a day for his trial He did not like Menenius by himself or the fathers descend to make mean supplications to the people but confiding in his own innocence and personal interest he boldly opposed himself to all the attacks of the tribunes The charge against him was the action with the Etru rians at the Janiculum But being a man of a daring spirit he was as intrepid before their tribunal as he used to be on a day of action confuting in a bold speech both tribunes and commons upbraiding them with the condemnation and death of Menenius by the good offi ces of whose father the populace were brought back to the city and enjoyed these laws and those magistrates the ministers now of their illiberal prosecutions and thus by his bold and determined behaviour outbraved  Fire poundi sterling CHAP 53 ROMAN HISTORY 185 tlie danger The testimony of his colleague Virginius too had its own weight as he generously shared with him the honour of the success but what turned the scale entirely in his favour was their shame for the sentence they passed on Menenius so much was their disposition changed upon reflection CHAP LIII War with the Vejentes and SubintSi  O sooner were their domestic trouble over than a â war broke out wiih the Vejentes with whom the Sabines had joined in a confederacy The consul Publius Valerius having called in the Latins and Hernici as auxiliaries was ser t against Veii with an army and immediately opened the campaign by attacking the camp of the Sabines which they had set down before the walls of their allies This struck them wiih such consterna tion thai whilst they run different ways in broken com panies to repel the assailants the gate where the grand attack began was carried by the Romans Within the rampart it was not a contest but a massacre The confusion from the camp found its way to the city and put the Vejentes in such terror that they run to their arms asif their city had been taken Some of them fly to tite assistance of the Sabines whilst others fall upon the Romans with all their force who were totally engaged in Carrying the camp They fell back a little in some confusion but recovering themselves faced about and forming a double front made head against both armies The horse too by orders of the consul charging the Etrurians broke and routed them entirely Thus were two armies defeated and two of the most opulent and powerful of all the neighbouring states sub dued in the same instant of time Daring these opera tions at Veii the ffiqui and Volsci had encamped in the Latin territories and were ravaging the country With out a general or any other assistance from Rome the Latins in conjunction with the Hernici forced their camp and possessed themselves of a va t booty besides what had been taken from them Tlie consul C Nan 186 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II tins was sent from Rome against the Volsci at the head of an army because as 1 imagine they did not choose it should become a precedent for the allies to carry on war upon their own footing only without a Roman general at their head and an army to support them The Volsci were harassed with all the calamities of war and loaded with the most bitter reproaches but neither could induce them to risk an engagement CHAP LlV A new check to the Tribunitian power L j Furius and C Manlius succeeded to the consulate The Vejentes fell to Manlius as his province but the war did not continue At their request a truce for forty years was granted them on condition of paying a yearly tribute and a certain quantity of corn Peace abroad only served to revive their contests at home Spirited up by the tribunes the people raged about the Agrarian law The consuls neither intimi dated by the fate of Menenius nor the danger of Ser vilius were equally keen in the opposition As they were retiring from office they were even impeached by Genucius the tribune In the consulate they were succeeded by L jEmilius and Opiter Virginius though some authors mention Vopiscus Julius instead of Virginius But however that be it is certain that Furius and Manlius were impeached that year and went about in a miserable plight supplicat ing the people nor them only for they were equally assiduous and importunate with the younger senators advising them by all means  From thenceforth to re nounce the honours and government of the state and look upon the fasces of the consuls the praetexta and curule chair as neither less nor more than the pomp of their funerals and that they were only adorned  with these ensigns of dignity to be destined as victims for the altar That supposing the consulship had charms to attract their attention they ought to reflect that it was now no more than a name the power of the tribunes having swallowed up and enervated its t CHAP 55 ROMAN HISTORY m efficacy That the consul like one of the tribune s Serjeants could only act by their order and at their pleasure If they entertained the least thoughts of throwing off those chains of restoring the power of the senate or establishing any other authority in the Republic than that of the people they should set be fore their eyes the banishment of C Marcius and the condemnation and death of Menenius The fathers animated with speeches to this purpose no longer concerted measures publicly but in secret making very few privy to their designs As there it was concluded that right or wrong the accused must be secured the most violent measures were relished most and it was easy to find persons ready for any undertak ing Wherefore upon the day of the trial the people stood in anxious expectation in the forum surprized that the tribune had not appeared but at length when their pa tience was wearied out with waiting their suspicions were raised that intimidated by the Patricians he had deserted and betrayed the public cause Af last they who had remained at his door brought word that he was found dead in his bed The news having spread among the people they dis persed on all sides trembling and terrified like an army after the loss of their general â But the tribunes were particularly affected being instructed by the event that even the laws which made their persons sacred were not sufficient for their protection The senators on this oc casion took no care to moderate their joy nay they were so far from shewing any remorse for the crime they had committed that even those who had no hand in H were proud to be thought the perpetrators declaring in every company that nothing but an extraordinary blow could subdue the power of the tribunes CHAP LV The Senators exult on their victory but meet with a check IMMEDIATELY upon this victory obtained by a jnost pernicious precedent the levies were appointed 1 88 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK If which the tribunes having lost all courage the consuls completed without any interruption The people were more provoked at the silence of their tribunes than the imperious behaviour of the consuls crying out That there was an end of all liberty now That they were fallen again intd their ancient state â That the trihu nitian power had expired and was laid in the grave with Genntius â That they must now fall upon other measures to oppose a barrier to the violence of the senators â That they had still one resource left and that was in themselves since every other means of protection had failed them â That the consuls had no other guard but twenty four lictors and these too  plebeians a weak and contemptible aid indeed if there were but men who knew hov to despise them Such was the power wl ich imagination only magni lies and represents as terrible By such discourses as they were spiriting up each other a lictor was sent by the consuls to one Volero Publius a plebeian who insisted that he could not be compelled to serve as a single centinel having formerly had the rank of centurion Votero called to the tribunes but none of them moving to protect him the consuls or dered the lictors to strip and scourge him with rods I appeal says Volero  to the people since the tri bunes choose rather to see a Roman citizen scourged before their eyes than be strangled in their beds by Â you The more vehemently he cried out the more eager the lictor was to tear and take off his clothes But Volero being robust of himself and having got others to assist him beat off the lictor and got into the thickest of the crowd where he saw the greatest ferment and indigna tion raised on his account crying out I appeal to the people â I implore their protection stand by me citi zens stand by me fellow soldiers you have nothing to expect from your tribunes alas they have occasFon themselves for your aid The ferment spread among the people they prepared as for a battle and there seemed not a doubt but mat ters would be carried to the most violent height without regard to birth age or dignity CHU 56 ROMAN HISTORY 189 Tlie consuls attempted to dispel the storm but they soon found that the dignity of their ofljce was but a fee ble support without force Their Iictors being beat and their fasces broke to pieces thcv were driven out of the forum into the senate house uncertain how far Volero would carry his victory When the storm had blown over the consuls ordered the senators to be summoned to the house where they made loud complaints of the bad treatment they had re ceived from the people and the intolerable insolence of Volero After many violent speeches the elder senators prevailed who by no means approved that the Patricians should oppose passionate measures to the rashness of the commons CHAP LVJ Great disputes about the mode of electing Tribunes V OLERO became a mighty favourite with the people who at the next election created him tribune L Pi narius and P Furius were consuls that year Everv body imagined that by his means the whole weight o the iribunitian power would have fallen upon the consuls of the preceding year but forgetting his private resent ment in order to promote the public interest used not a single expression to their prejudice and only preferred a bill that the plebeian magistrates should be chosen in the Comitia by tribes This though at first it did not seem to affect the se nate much was a motion of no small importance as in that case the Patricians could not choose whom they pleased for tribunes by the votes of the client The fa thers strained every nerve in the opposition of a law that was so acceptable to the commons but neither the autho rity of the consuls nor the interest of the Patricians could prevail on any one of the college of tribunes to en ter their dissent though that was the only valid obstruc tion against it The weight however and importance of the bill itself created disputes Which put it off for the course of the year Volero was chosen tribune a second time and the 190 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II fathers imagining that all their force would be exerted now they chose Appius Claudius for consul the son of that Appius who by long family disputes was an open enemy to the commons and was equally hated by them Titus Quinctius was given him for his colleague The first thing brought on the carpet in the begin ning of the year was the law and as Volero who first moved it continued firm in its interest his colleague Laetorius being a later advocate for it for that reason exerted himself more strenuously He was a man of known valour and the glory he had purchased in war furnished him with resolution and assurance Volero was not severe in any of his discourses against the consuls but confined himself entirely to the law but Lai tori us insisted on the excessive pride and cruelty of Appius and his family to the peopte affirming that the senate in him had not created a consul but a butcher to cut the people s throats and tear them to pieces Bred in the camp he had not words to express his sen timents adequate to the freedom which he took Where fore being at a loss for expression he cried out  As I do not speak with the same ease as I act Romans come hither to morrow I will pass the law or die in vour presence The tribunes placed themselves in the temple next day and the consuls with all the Patrician order as sembled to oppose the law Laetorlus ordered the forum to be cleared of all who had no right to vote and as some of the young nobility refused to obey he ordered some of them tote seized The consul Appius insisted that the authority ot a tribont extended ouly to the com mons for he was not a Patrician but a Plebeian magis trate and that he himself had no power to remove them ty any former precedent the form of addressing tlum being  Depart Romans if it be your pleasure lt was easy confound Laeionus by talking fluently anJ contemptuously of the forms of court Transported however with passion he sent his serjeant to the consul who in return sent his lictor to the tribune crying out that he was only a private person that he was no ma gistrate and had no right to command and without doubt the tribune would have suffered violence had CHAP 57 ROMAN HISTORY 191 not the whole assembly highly incensed at the beha viour of Appius taken part with their tribune against the consul great numbers of their body upon the alarm flocking thither from all parts of the city Appius how ever did uot flinch but stoutly stood the storm which would certainly have ended in blood had not Quinctius the other consul given it in charge to the senators of consular dignity to remove his colleague from the forum by force if persuasion should be ineffectual whilst he himself endeavoured to mollify the people by the warm est intreaties and conjured the tribunes to dismiss the as sembly and give their passion time to subside  That a few hours delay would not diminish their power but would add wisdom to direct it That the consul would be advised by the fathers and the fathers would com ply with the people CHAP LVII Peace restored by means of Stuinciius Obstinacy of the army under Appius JLT was with some difficulty that Quinctius composed the people but in bringing the other consul to himself the senate found still more At length when the assem bly of the people was dismissed the senate was conven ed by the consuls Anger and fear dictating by turns produced a variety of sentiments but the longer they deliberated the more they saw the folly of continuing these contests insomuch that Quinctius had the thanks of the house for interfering so seasonably to suspend the daemon of discord On the other hand they conjured Appius  Not to carry his zeal for the dignity of the con sulship beyond what was consistent with the peace and harmony of the state That whilst the consuls and tribunes were dragging every thing to themselves the state was left naked and impotent between them each side seeming less intent upon its safety than upon making themselves its masters On the other hand Appius  called gods and men to â witness that they abandoned and betrayed the com monwealth through mere pusillanimity â That the IP2 TITUS LIVIUS BooK Il â consul was hot wanting to the senate but the senate to the consul That they were going to accept laws more pernicious than those of the Mons Sacer He was prevailed upon at last by the unanimous authority of the senate to he silent and the law accordingly passed without contradiction CHAP LVIII Claudius being chosen Consul sent against the Volsci 1 HEN for the first time were the tribunes chosen in the Comitia by tribes According to Piso three addi tional tribunes were added to the college their number hitherto having been only two He also mentions their names viz C Sicinius L Numitorius M Duilius Sp Icilius and L Maecilius Encouraged by these disturbances at Rome the Volsci and Et ui once more renewed the war They had laid vaste the country expecting that in case of a secession the people would fly to them for refuge but fmding every thing was settled they decamped and led back their army Ap Claudius was sent against the Volsci and Quinc tius against the JEqui Appius discovered the same wildness in his temper abroad as he had done at home and he acted with the greater liberty as he was under no restraint from the tribunes He hated the people still more than his father had done â They had triumphed over him They had got a law passed during his con suiaie which his predecessors in office from whom the senaie had not such high expectations had the address to get suspended although he had been elected for the sole purpose of opposing it This secret vexation that engrossed and preyed upon him set him upon torment ing his army by the greatest severity of discipline but he was not able to break their obstinacy so much was their aversion steeled against him In all things they acted with slowness indolence carelessness and a spirit of contradiction They were neither affected with shame nor fear If they were ordered to march with expedi tion they moved slower on purpose If he stood by to CHAP 59 ROMAN HISTORY 193 encourage the work every thing slackened that instant When he was present all held dpwn their heads and as he passed them they muttered curses against him his haughty soul till now proof against the popular odium began to be sometimes affected Having spent all his ill nature upon the soldiers t6 no purpose he said the army had heen corrupted by the centurions whom in derision he sometimes called tribunes of the people and sometimes Voleros CHAP LIX Appius decimates his army for cowardice A HE Volsci had information of every thing that pas sed in the camp for which reason they pressed the Ro mans mote closely expecting their army would behave to Appius as they had done before to Caeso Fabius But their hatred to Appius was much more inveterate than to Fabius For the army under Fabius had only resolv ed not to conquer hut they carried matters farther and resolved to be conquered The moment they were led on to battle they shamefully fled back to their camp and did not stop till they saw the Volscians ready to force their entrenchments and making prodigious havock on their rear Then it was that they were obliged to fight to drive the exulting enemy from their lines But it was evident they meant no more than to save the camp To some of them their defeat and disgrace gave pleasure Notwithstanding all this the ferocity of Appius spirit continued inflexible and being determined to chastise the whole army without mercy he summoned an assem bly The lieutenant generals and Tribunes made haste to wait on him and cautioned him not to make an un seasonable experiment of his authority because its whole force depended on the consent of those who obey that in general the soldiers refused to attend the assembly and many of them insisted that he should decamp from the territories of the Volsci That the victorious enemy â had a very little before not only advanced to the gates of the camp but made an attack upon their lines and  194 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II there was the greatest reason to conclude from many concurring circumstances too evident to be doubted that some remarkable calamity was ready to fall upon them Compelled at last by necessity he put off the assembly which did nothing more to the army than procure them a reprieve from punishment he gave orders for marching the next morning and accordingly gave the signal by sound of trumpet the moment light began to appear When the troops were drawn out of the camp the Volsci who had been put in motion by the Roman sig nal fell upon their rear guard Terror and tumult spread like lightning and reached the foremost ranks so that neither the orders of the commanders could be heard nor the troops be drawn up in order of battle None thought of any thing but how to escape so that they tied in the greatest disorder over heaps of dead bo dies and arms nor did the Romans cease to fly even when the enemy gave over the pursuit At length when the soldiers were drawn together af ter this scattered rout the consul who had stuck close bv them calling upon them in vain to do their duty en camped where there was no danger of aij attack and summoned the assembly He reproached them with great reason for their perfidious cowardice and criminal treason asking the soldiers and ensigns one by one what had become of their arms and colours The cen turions and Serjeants who had quitted their ranks he scourged and beheaded and one out of every ten to whose lot it fell of the rest of the army was put to death CHAP LX Quinctius more successful and beloved Voleio s law passed X HIi conduct of the other army sent to chastise the JEqui was very different Between the consul and the soldiers there was a generous emulation in courtesy and acts of kindness Quinctius was formed by nature to gentleness and mildness  and the fatal effects of his col league s ferocity gave him reason to congratulate him self on his own turn of mind In consequence of the CHAP 61 ROMAN HISTORY 195 good understanding that subsisted between the general and the army the jEqui were afraid to shew themselves in the field and suffered their country to be ravaged at pleasure whence it followed that the booty was more considerable than they had taken from the Equi in any former war and it was all given to the soldiers and with it the praises they merited which gave them a pleasure no less sensible than more substantial rewards The army returned to Rome with the warmest sen timents of regard to their general and on his account in a great measure to the whole order of the Patricians telling every body that the senate had in their general given them a father but in Appius to the other army a cruel master In the course of this year there was various success in war and violent commotions at home and abroad It was peculiarly memorable for the election of the tribunes by tribes a circumstance which derived its importance rather from the victory gained over a violent opposition than any real advantage that attended it for the Comitia suffered more in point of dignity by exctuding the fa ihers from that assembly than the power acquired by the people or lost by the senate was really worth CHAP LXI Trial and death of Appius I  VALERIUS and T Emilius were consuls the fol lowing year when the commotions ran higher than ever both on account of the contests between the orders of the senate occasioned by the Agrarian law and also on ac count of the trial of Appius for which M Duilius and C Sicinius appointed a day because he opposed the law and supported the pretensions of the possessors of the public lands with the same violent and inflexible spirit as if he had been chosen consul for the third time Never was a criminal cited before the people more generally detested than he To their tribunal he brought with him all the grievances charged against his father as well as the crimes objected to himself nor did the Patricians on any former occasion interest themselves 196 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II more warmly to save any one of heir order They could not see without extreme concern the guardian of the senate the avenger of their dignity and the invin cible bulwark of their rights against the attacks of the tribunes and their abettors given up to the rage of the populace and that only because his passion had carried him a little beyond the bounds of moderation in the heat of the dispute Of all the senators Appius was the only one that held the tribunes the people and the judgment they were about to pass in sovereign contempt Neither the threats of the commons nor ail the entreaties of the se nate couM ever prevail upon him even to change his dress or humble himself to solicit the favour of his judges nay nor in making his defence to abate anything of his usual haughtiness or sharpness of stile In every thing lie retained the same externals the same air of confidence and the same boldness of speech so that the people for the most part were no less awed by him wheti cited before them as a criminal than they were before when he was consul He pleaded his cause once but then it was with his usual tone and the authority of an accuser and so much were the people and tribunes astonished at his resolution that unsolicited they put off his trial to a future day and thereafter were prevailed on to renew the prorogation But before that day arrived he died of a distemper The tribunes attempted to hinder the pro nouncing his funeral oration but the people would not consent that so great a man should be deprived of an honour so justly his due They heard his praise after his death wiih as much pleasure as they had his accusa tion when alive Nay many of them assisted at his fu neral CHAP LXII The country of tlie jEqui and Sabines plundered J HIS same year Valerius the consul led an army against the Equi and fmding it impracticable to draw them to a battle attempted to storm their camp A ter rible tempest accompanied with thunder and hail put a CHAP 63 ROMAN HISTORY 197 stop to his design What increased their wonder was the sudden calm and serenity that ensued the moment he sounded the retreat For they imagined some deity had interposed to save the camp and their religious scruples prevented them from making a second attempt wherefore all their fury was discharged upon the coun try which they plundered without opposition The other consul Emilius conducted the war against the Sa bines who confmed themselves within their walls for that reason he laid waste their country burning not only the farm houses but also large and populous villages This forced the Sabines out of iheir strong holds who meeting with a foraging party had an engagement with them hut victory declaring for neither party when they retired from the field they marched oifnext day to a place of greater security This the consul considered as a sufficient victory in his favour and upon their re treat returned home leaving the war unfinished D CHAP LXIII War with the Volsci and jEqui URING these wars abroad and civil commotions at home T Numicius Priscus and A Yirginius were chosen consuls The commons seemed now resolved to admit of no evasions with respect to the Agrarian law anci were accordingly preparing to set every engine to work when the flight of the country people and the smoke of the houses all in flames informed them that the Volsci were at hand This invasion suppressed the sedition which was now ripe and on the point of break ing out  The senate obliged the consuls to march immediately against the enemy and when the youth had once quit ted the city the rest of the people made no more noise But the Volsci contented themselves with the pleasure of having put the Romans in a needless fright and without attempting any thing further made all the haste they eould out of their territories Numicius pursued them to Antium and Virginius marched against the Lqui There the army fell into an ambush and narrowly escap ed being cut to pieces 198 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II They were however rescued from the danger into which the consul s carelessness had led them by their own noble exertions The war with the Volsci was conducted with more address for in the first baule they were routed and driven to Antium a very rich city Numicius not daring to besiege it took Cenon another city belonging to the Antiates but not so opulent as An tium  Whilst the Romans were thus employed against the SLqui and Volsci the Sabines entered their territories and advanced to the very gates of the city plundering the country They did not pass unpunished for in 8 few days after both the consuls with their two armies entering their country and breathing nothing but ven geance made large reprisals Ai CHAP LXIV War with the Volsci Device of Suinctius L BOUT the end of the year the city had some re spite from war but as usual it was disturbed by the contests between the patricians and plebeians The commons were so much incensed that they would not countenance the election of the consuls so that it was held by the patricians and their vassals who made choice of T Quinctius and Q Servilins The beginning of the year was disturbed by domestic factions but these were stifled by the eruption of a fo reign war The Sabines having made a hastv march through the territory of the Crustumini ravaged all the country about the banks of the Anio with fire and sword and though they were repulsed after they had pene trated almost to the walls of the city a nd the gate Colina yet they carried off a vast booty in men and cattle But the consul Servilius pursued them with an army sufficiently exasperated and when he could not get up with them so as to bring them to an action on fair ground he spread desolation in their country where ever he went insomuch that he suffered nothing to es cape the calamities of war and returned to Rome with prodigious spoils CHAP 64 ROMAN HISTORY 199 The good conduct of the general and valour of the troops were equally conspicuous in the war with the Volsci They engaged first in a plain the battle was bloody and the slaughter great on both sides which being more sensibly felt by the Romans as they were less numerous a defeat would have followed had not the consul by a well timed fiction inspired them with fresh courage crying out that the enemy was routed in the other wing Wherefore the army making a fresh attack and believ ing themselves victorious became really so The con sul afraid to push his success too far lest they should rally sounded a retreat For some days both armies continued so quiet that one would have imagined they had privately consented to a truce During this respite the army of the Volsci was con siderably reinforced by numbers of their own country and that of the 3Lqui imagining that the Romans the moment they were advised of this Secession would march oflfin the night impressed with this opinion they came before the third watch to storm the camp Quinc tius having dissipated the terror occasioned by this sud den alarm gave orders that all should remain quiet in their tents and led out of the camp a body of the Her iiici fer an advanced guard and to keep the enemy in a constant alarm till day light he set the trumpeters and blowers on the horn on horseback with orders to play from time to time before the rampart For the rest of the night every thing was so quiet in the camp that the Romans were sufficiently refreshed The appearance of a body of infantry in arms whom the Volsci took for Romans superior in number to them selves the noise and neighing of the horses which un accustomed to this kind of riders and frightened with the sound of their instruments were very attractable kept the Volsci as much upon their guard as if they had Ijeen every moment to be attacked by the enemy 200 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II CHAP LXV The Volsci defeated and their camp taken W HEN the light appeared the Roman army quite vigorous and refreshed with sleep marched out 10 bat tle and at the first charge obliged the Volsci to give way being already exhausted with standing under their arms and watching all night They were not how ever entirely routed they only fell back to some steep places behind the centre whither without breaking their ranks they retreated in safety  The consul when the army had advanced fo the rising ground gave orders to halt These orders were obeyed with the greatest relucmncy the soldiers crying out and urgently requesting to be permitted to pursue the enemy already giving ground The cavalry were par ticularly urgent crowding round the general expressed the greatest ardour declaring loudly that they would go before the ensigns to the charge While the consul was balancing between the ardour of his troops and the disadvantage of the ground they all by a general shout expressed their resolution of going on and im mediately began to march To help them over the steep places they fixed their javelins in the ground and these surmounted run towards the top of the hill Whilst they were advancing the enemy having spent all their darts atthe first attack tumbled down the stones upon them which lay scattered among their feet of which they discharged such numbers that their ranks were broke and they forced to fall back from the emi nence they had gained The left wing of the Romans was so overpowered that it was on the point of giving way when the consul reproaching them with their rash ness and want of resolution made shatne get the bet ter of their ear Upon this then they renewed their exertions with the most determined ardour and as they could gain a little ground still continued to advance and setting up the other shout encouraged the whole army by repeating their efforts they got over the diffi culty of the place They were now within a little of CHAP 65 ROMAN HISTORY 201 the top of the eminence when the enemy took to their heels and scattering in their flight the pursuers and fu gitives entered the camp much about the same time when in the midst of the contusion the camp is taken such of the Volsci as could make good their escape fled to Antium whither Quinctius followed with his army and after it had been invested a few days it sur rendered

taking of Antium T jEmilius and Q Fabius were elected consuls This was that Fabtus who alone of all the Fabian family survived the slaughter at Cremera Emilias in his former consulship had declared for the partition of the lands among the people Wherefore in his second consulship the friends of the Agrarian law were encouraged to hope that they might now get it passed and the tribunes persuaded that by having one of the consuls in their interest they might now accomplish what they had in vain attempted when both were in the opposition brought the affair once more upon the carpet jEmilius had not shifted sides They who were in possession of the lands and the majority of the senators complained much that a chief magistrate of the city should be active in promoting the claims of the tribunes CHAP 2 ROMAN HISTORY 2oS making his court to the peop e at the expence of others and turned the whole odium from the tribunes upon the consul The contest would have been very warm had not his colleague Fabius proposed an expedient which seemed disagreeable to neither party That Titus Quinctius who commanded the army against the Volsci last year had taken from them some lands That a colony might be sent to Antium a neighbouring and commodious city situated on the sea coast by which means the people might be provided in lands without interfering with the possessions of others or giving any disturbance to the state This proposal was received with applause and T Quinctius A Virginius and P Furius were CAtnmissioued to settle the partition accordingly The candidates were called to give in their names But as it generally happens what can be easily attained has no charms Wherefore so very few appeared to be enrol led that to make up the complement they were obliged to admit the Volsci the people chusing rather to con tinue their clamours for lands at Rome than be put in possession of them elsewhere Q Fabius led an army against the Equi and at their request granted them a peace but it was of no long standing for they soon after made an irruption into the territories of Latium CHAP it The jEqui drfeated JL HE next year Q Serviiius who had been elected consul with Posthumius was sent against the 2Equi and encamped in the country of the Latins A distemper which raged among the troops confined them to the camp so that the war was protracted till the third year when Q Fabius and T Quinctius were consuls By an extraordinary commission the province of the JEqm Vvas assigned to Fabius who had conquered and at their request granted them a peace He set out accordingly not doubting in the least but the very mention of his name would bring them to submission and accordingly sent deputies to represent in their supreme council 20 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK II That they had it in commission from Q Fabius the â â consul to inform them that he once carried peace â  from the Equi to Rome and that from Rome he was now carrying war to the jEqui the same right hand being armed against them which before he had given them in token of peace By whose perjury and perfidious conduct this reverse had happened the gods were the witnesses now and ere long would be the avengers For his own part however with out descending to particular he would even at this moment rather wish they would by a voluntary submission express a conviction of their error than oblige him to subject them to all the calamities of war Were they only to repent they should be re ceived into the protection of that clemency they had formerly experienced but if they exulteS in their perjury they would do well to remember they had the wrath of the gods rather than the arms of an enemy to contend with So far was this embassy from influencing the E jui that the deputies were in danger of being insulted and an army was sent to the Algidus to oppose the pro gress of the Romans The moment advices of these transactions were trans mitted to Rome the other consul left the city roused rather by indignation than any fear of danger Thus two consular armies approached the enemy drawn up in form determined to make an immediate attack But as it happened that the day was far spent one of the enemy s advanced guard cried out  Romans this is not fighting but an empty parade vou draw up in battalia for the approach of night More sun will be necessary to render the action before us decisive To morrow the moment light appears return to the field and you shall have enough of fighting I will be bound for it Stung with this reproachful commentary the Roman soldiers were led back to the camp to wait till next morning and the hours of the night seemed to pass heavity on which kept them from measuring swords with the enemy They refreshed themselves with vie  A bill twelve miles from Rome CHAP 3 ROMAN HISTORY tuals and sleep and next morning as soon as it was ight the Roman army was drawn up a little before the Equi made their appearance who at length ad vanced in battalia The battle was obstinate on both sides Revenge and passion animated the Romans whilst the ffilqui conscious of having involved themselves in this difficulty by their perfidy and despairing of future credit were stimulated to make the boldest efforts They could not however stand the charge of the Roman army but were defeated and obliged to retire into their own country Notwith standing of this chastisement they were as little as ever inclined to peace the licentious populace upbraiding their leaders with risking their cause to a pitched battle in which the excellency of the Romans consisted That the Equi succeeded best when disposed in plundering â parties by making inroads and that it was much safer to trust to an irregular Vvar by skirmishing parties pro perly disposed than to their whole force in one decisive action CHAP III  New attempts of the Mqni who are discharged VV HEREFORE leaving their camp under a guard they sallied out with such fury upon the Roman territo ries that they spread terror even to the city The terror of this invasion was greatly heightened by the surprise for an enemy already conquered and as it were besieged â in their camp could not be in the properest trim for plundering excursions and consequently no formidable object The country people struck with a panic run up to the very gates and their fears shewing them every object in a magnifying glass cried out that it was not small foraging parties but a regular army and whole legions of enemies advancing with every hostile purpose to storm the city They who were nearest the gates retailed this intelligence to others and the farther it spread the more it was magnified Such was the con fusion and noise whilst they called to arms that had the city been taken the terror could not have been much K 206 TITUS LIVIUS Book III greater Luckily indeed the consul Quinctius had just returned from the Algidus which served to allay their fears Having brought them to reason he rebuked them for being afraid of conquered enemies and posted guards at the gates Then having convened the senate and proclaimed a general vacation in the courts of justice by the authority of the fathers he consigued the govern ment of the city to Q Serviiius and marched out to protect the country but then no enemy was to be found The other consul had been very alert Having got intelligence of the enemy s rout he fill upon them load ed with booty and by that means encumbered in their march so that this plundering match cost them very dear tew of the enemy escaped the trap he had laid for them and all the booty was recovered Upon Quinctius s return to the city the courts of justice which had been shut for lour days were opened again Then a census was held and when Quinctius had finished the lustrums the number of citizens enrolled is said to have amount ed to one hundred and twenty four thousand two hun dred and fifteen besides orphans of both sexes After this the iEqui made no great figure They kept them selves within their walls whilst their effects were burnt or plundered with impunity The consul Fabius when he had repeatedly spread desolation in the enemy s country with fire and sword returned to Rome full of glory and loaded with spoils Ai CHAP IV Fabius over reached by the JEqui L FTER this A Posthumius Albus and Sp Furius Fusus were elected consuls The Furii are by some authors called Fusii I mention this that none may be led into a mistake as to the persons by this change of  names It was fully expected that one of the consuls would prosecute the war against the Squi for which reason the iEqui solicited aid from the Volsci who o habited Ecetra Their request was cheerfully granted so inveterate wa the hatred of these states against the Romans wherefore they made the most vigorous pre parations for war  3 ROMAN HISTORY 207 The HÂ rnici got intelligence of these motions and advised the Romans accordingly that the Ecetrans had joined in a confederacy with the Equi The colony of Antium was likewise suspected because when that city was taken many of the inhabitants had fled to the jEqui and during the war had signalized themselves in their service When after this the M m were com pelled to take refuge within their walls these troops retiring privately had retired to Antinrn and encou raged the colony naturally averse to the Roman go vernment to shake off the allegiance entire y Asthey were not yet in a condition to throw off the mask when the senate was informed of their designs they re commended to the consuls to send for the principal men of the colony and demand an explanation They rea dily obeyed the summons and being by the Consuls introduced to the senate returned such answers to vheir tjuestions as rather confirmed than lessened the suspi cions entertained of there After this the war was looked on as certain Sp Furius one of the consuls whose province it was marched against the SLijui and found them busy in lay ing waste the territories of the Hernici Unacquainted with their numbers as they had never appeared hi a body he rashly gave them battle when his army was much inferior and consequently been routed at the first charge fled back to his camp Nor did the dan ger stop here for all the succeeding night and day after his camp was so closely blocked up and so fu riously attacked that to send intelligence to Rome of his situation was quite impracticable The news however of the loss ofthe battle and the manner in which the consul and the army were blocked up in the camp were transmitted by the Hernici So much was the senate alarmed at this intelligence that they gave it in charge to the other consul Posthumius To take care that the republic suffered no detriment a clause in acts of the senate expressive of the utmost danger It was judged most prudent that the consul himself should remain at Rome to enlist ail who were able to bear arms and to dispatch Titus Quinctius in 208 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III quality of pro consul  with an army of the allies to the relief of the camp The Latins Hernici and co lony of Antium were ordered to make up his compli ment with subitarii for so auxiliaries raised on a sudden were called in those days CHAP V Relieved by Suinctius Great slaughter of the 2Equi AN the mean time the enemy were every wherein mfc tion making different attacks in different places at one and the same time for being superior in point of num bers they endeavoured by dividing the Roman forces insufficient for the defence of every place at once to cut them off in small parties At the same time that they endeavoured to force the camp they sent out parties to lay waste the country and to carry desolation to the city itself should they find a favourable opportunity L Valerius was left to guard the city whilst the con sul Posthumius was sent to drive the plunderers from the frontiers Nothing was omitted in any instance in point of care or vigilance Guards were placed in the city centinels at the gates and strong parties to defend the walls and what became necessary in such confusion a vacation of all courts of justice was appointed for se veral days In the mean time the consul Furiu although he had suffered himself without bustle to be blocked up in his camp made a sudden sally from the back gatei upon the unguarded enemy and although he might have pursued his advantage he stopped short fearing his camp might be in danger from some other quarter His brother Lucius who was also his lieutenant gene ral went too far his eagerness in the pursuit prevent ing him from observing the return of his friends or the enemy s atack on his rear Being cut off in this man ner from the body of the army after he had often at tempted to open himself a passage to the camp he fell  The pro consul acted in all respects as consul in the province Committed to his care but nowhere else CHAP 5 ROMAN HISTORY 209 having sold his life as dear as possible Upon the news of his brother s disaster the consul returned to the en gagement and rushing with more haste than caution among the thickest of the epemy he was wounded and with difficulty carried off the field by those about him a circumstance which dispirited the Roman army not a little and inspired the enetny with a greater degree of confidence who proud that they had dispatched the lieutenant and wounded the consul carried all before them drove the Romans back to their camp and there besieged them again inferior in strength and without the least ray of hope to support them Such was their miserable situation when Quinctius came to their relief with an army of tfce Latins Her nici and other foreign troops Whilst the jEqui di rected all their force against the Roman camp and in sulting the besieged by exposing to their view the head of their lieutenant general Quinctius attacked them in rear whilst upon a signal from him at a distance a sally was made from the camp so that the enemy was in a great measure surrounded No great slaughter en i sued as they fled in straggling parties through the RoÂ man territories Whilst they were straggling thus and plundering by the way P osth umius with some detachments which he had posted in proper places gave them a very warm reception  and after they had escaped the fury of Post humius they fell in with Quinctius who after his victory was returning with the wounded consul Here the con sular army took full revenge for their lieutenant general and his cohort as well as the wound received by the consul The slaughter was great on both sides for those tiroes It is indeed next to impossible to ascertain with pre cision at this distance of time what numbers were en gaged or fell although Antias Valerius finds no dif ficulty in condescending on the exact number Accord ing to his account there fell of the Romans in the coun try of the Hernici five thousand three hundred Of those jEqui who in scattered parties pillaged the Ro man territories Posthnmius dispatched two thousand four hundred but it was Quinctius vÂ ho gave them the fatal 210  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III blow as he met with them carrying off their booty for by this minute reckoning four thousand two hundred and thirty of them were cut to pieces After this they returned to Rome when all the conns of justice were opened At this time the heavens seemed to be all in flames Many other phenomena were real ly seen or seemed to be so by people overcome with their fears To avert these dreadful omens three so lemn fast days were appointed during which the tem ples were crowded with multitudes of both sexes implo ring the protection of the gods Then the Latin and Hernician troops were dismissed by the senate who re turned them their warmest acknowledgments â for their signal services in the war but a thousand soldiers from Antium who came too late to share in the glory of the day had not so honourable a discharge CHAP VI A pestilence at Rome A R 291 I PON this followed an election when L SJbutius and P Servilius were chosen consuls and entered on their office the first of August which at that time was the beginning of the year This was a melancholy year rendered so particularly by a plague which raged in town and country and carried off both man and beast The fear of a n invasion contributed not a little to spread the infection the peasants and their cattle being all received into the city This medley of animals of every kind raised an intolerable smell which became nauseous to the citizens and stifled the country people whilst they were pent up in close rooms with heat and want of sleep Besides their attendance on each other with the infections nature of the distemper propagated it every where When they were scarce able to support themselves un  The beginning of the consular year was at this time and long after quite fluctuating and uncertain sometimes commencing in March sometimes in October August July and December but at tast A R 599 it was fixed to commence in January which ever aftej it continued to do till the ruin of the republic CHAP 6 ROMAN HISTORY 211 der the pressure of these calamities advices all of a sud den were brought from the Hernici that the confederate forces of the Lqui and Hernici had encamped in their country and were proceeding with a huge army to pil lage their lands A thin senate easily discovered to the allies how much the city had been reduced by the plague and besides carried back this uncomfortabte answer That the Hernici in conjunction with the Latins must for this time depend entirely upon their own internal resources for the anger of the gods had depopulated Rome by a sudden plague Should the rage of the pestilence subside they would not be wanting to give their allies the assistance they had afforded them last year and on other occasions Upon this they de parted more disconsolate than they had set out for they could not of themselves support a war which they could only maintain with difficulty sustained by the Roman ensigns The enemy did not make a long stay in the country of the Hernici but marched in a hostile manner into the territories of Rome which were desolate enough without the calamities of war Meeting nobody with or with out arms and finding every thing defenceless and even uncultivated they penetrated by the Gabinian way within three miles of Rome Ebutius one of the con suls was dead Servilius his colleague was scarce alive and most of the nobility were affected as were the great er part of the fathers and also every one else fit to bear arms insomuch that so far from having forces to stem the torrent of the war with which they were threatened at present they had not a sufficient number of guards for common duty The senators whose age and health permitted them mounted guard in person and stood sentry The ffidiles went the rounds and gave orders For on them the administration of government together with the consular authority had totally devolved 212 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III CHAP VII t  Ill success of the Hernici Tlie plague rages Recourse to â deration Wi HILE thus abandoned without a head to conduct or strength to execute the tutelar gods and fortune of the city preserved it and converted the hostile intention of the JEqui and Volsci into a plundering scheme Fop they were so far from entertaining hopes of carrying the city that they never once thought of marching up to it walls The sight of the houses at a distance and the threatening tombs had such an effect on their feelings that they began to murmur throughout the whole camp That they were wasting their time without plunder in a wild and depopulated country where they could meet with nothing but rotten carcases of men and beasts while they might have gone to healthy places to the rich plains of Tusculum That they ought im mediately to pull up their standards and by march ing thro ugh the Lavican territories proceed to the hills of Tusculum Thither therefore did they carry all the force and fury of the war In the mean time the Hernia and Latins not only â from a principle of humanity but of shame that they had suffered their common enemy to march to Rome without the least interruption and had brought no assis tance to their allies when besieged marched with their confederate army to Rome When they found the ene my had disappeared they got intelligence of their mo tions and pursued their track till they met them com ing down from the Tusculan hills into the valley of Alba There they fought with great disadvantage and for the present their success was not equal to their fidelity

In some historians the last is called Vetusius They entered upon their oflicc on the ninth ef August at which time the citizens were so much recovered that they were in ft condition not only to act upon the defensive but to carry the war into the heart of the enemy s country In consequence of advices from the Hernici that their country was invaded the Romans readily promised them  assistance Two consular armies were levied Veturius was sent to attack the Volsci in thoir own country and Tricipitinus havkig posted himself so as to prevent the country of the allies from being plundered went no far ther than the territories of the Hernici In the very first action Veturius obtained a complete victory over the Volsci The pillagers escaped the vigilance of Lucre tius as he lay encamped in the country of the Hernici and marching along the tops of the hills of Praneste rnade a descent upon the plains There they Tavaged the lands of Prseneste and Gabii and from Gabii marched round the hills

the consul Lucretius pre viously informed of their route by his scouts and every way prepared for action Wherefore the courage of the soldiers being already wound up to the highest pitch they charged the confederates who were struck with a sudden panic and though somewhat inferior in point of numbers gave them a total overthrow They fled into the valleys whence the outlets were difficult and so were surrounded on all sides There the whole nation of the Volsci was almost all cut to pieces Some annals ascertain the number of the slain in the action and the flight to be 14 470 the number of pri

people He thinking the CHAP 9 ROMAN HISTORY 215 absence of the consuls a proper opportunity for intro ducing the claims of the tribunes had for some days been inveighing against the pride of the senators before the people and particularly against the consular power as too despotic and intolerable in a free state representing That it differed from regal despotism only in name for in effect it had in it something still more odious That instead of one king they had got two whose power was boundless and immoderate and being themselves neither confined nor restrained by any law turned the whole terror and severity of the laws against the common people That this licentiousness might not be perpetual he intended to prefer a bill for get ting five commissioners appointed to draw up laws for regulating the consular authority That in conse quence the consul should have no other right over the people than the people themselves should think proper to give them nor substitute their own passion and caprice in place of law This law being proposed the Patricians were not a little afraid that in the absence of the consuls this yoke might be wreathed about their necks when Q Fabius assembled the senate as governor of the city There he gave full scope to his indignation in inveighing against the bill and its author insomuch that had both consuls been present determined to pull the tribune to pieces they could not have opened on him with greater fury or employed more dreadful menaces This fellow says he lies in wait and takes advantage of the ab sence of the consuls to strike a blow against the com Â monwealth Had the gods in their wrath only the year before given Rome such a tribune in the midsr of the plague and the war his villainy might have been then triumphant The two consuls being no more and the city labouring in siekness and general confusion he would have proposed the abolition of the consulship and placed himself at the head of the l qui and Volsci to attack the city What can he plead in excuse for such licentiousness If the consuls in the abuse of their authority oppressed any citizen thÂ y might be cited before the people at whose tri â bonal

be on fire and there was a terrible earthquake and what seemed incredible the year before that a cow had spoke now passed cur rent Among other prodigies a dreadful shower fell of raw flesh which it is said was catched as it fell by swarms of birds fluttering around it what escaped them  lay scattered on the ground without changing its smell The duumvirs who presided over sacred things consult ed the Sybilline books They declared that the city was threatened with an irruption of strange enemies and to prevent any attack upon the higher parts of the city and the slaughter that might ensue among other things it was strongly recommended to give sedition no coun tenance The senators were accused by the tribunes of contriving this to obstruct the passing of the law and in consequence the dispute ran very high In the mean time advices are brought from the Her nici that the Volsci and SSqui for all the fatal blow they had received were recruiting their army just as if the war were every year to take the same turn That the Antiates who openly held their councils at Ecetra were the principal support of the enemies of Rome That the head of the confederacy was At tium which furnish ed troops for the war When these things were laid be fore the senate they ordered an army immediately to be levied The management of the war was committed to the consuls conjunctly the one to march against the Volsci and the other against the jEqui The tribunes in the mean time exclaimed loudly in  A lesser kind of triumph decreed to those who obtained a vic tory of smalt importance where the opposition was not formula J te In this case the general did not enter the city in a chariot nor was he crowned with taurel   218 BOOK III TITUS LIVI US the forum  That the war with the Volsci was a mere bugbear and that the Hernici had been previously instructed to act their parts That at present no open attack was made upon the liberties of the people but they were undermined by artifice That the Volsci who had been almost exterminated should in conjunction with the jEqui without any provoca tion put their troops in motion was inconsistent with common sense They must therefore look for new enemies A faithFu 1 a neighbouring colony is de famed War must be denounced against the innocent Antiates but carried on against the commons of Rome whom they were dragging headlong out of the city loaded with arms that by banishing the citizens or sending them out of the way they might have the tribunes at their mercy But that they might not be deceived they could assure them there was no other point in view but to evade the law which would be the case if now whilst it was on the carpet and whilst they were in their gowns they did not take care how they were dragged out of the city or received a yoke of slavery If they had only resolution they should find assistance The tribunes were unanimous There was no fear of an invasion nor prospect of danger The gods had last year taken care that their liberty should be safely protected CHAP XI Struggles of the ynwt Patricians â with the Tribunes Impetuosity of Caso who is appointed a day IjUCH were the remonstrances of the tribunes On the other hand the consuls erected their tribunals in their presence and began to make the levies The tribunes repaired thither wi h all haste and the whote assembly in their retinue A few were called on by way of expe riment which produced a tumult yi an instant When ever by order of the consul a lictor laid hold of any one that moment a tribune ordered him o be released Nei ther party took their measures trom he laws their sole impendence lay in force and violence to compass their designs The same activity which the tribunes showed CHAP H ROMAN HISTORY 219 in opposing the levies did the Patricians exert in oppos ing the law which wasconstantly proposed every comi tial day A quarrel arose when the tribunes ordered the people to leave the forum from which the Patnciaus would by no means suffer themselves to be removed As the debates in these assemblies were not managed with temper the aged senators seldom appeared there leaving the conduct of the opposition to the rash and audacious young nobles For some time too the consuls kept away for fear of exposing the dignity of their office to insult in such a mixed convention There was one Caeso Quinctius a young nobleman of high spirit with which his high birth extraordinary size and great strength inspired him To these advantages the gods had bestowed upon him he had added many honours gained in war and was an excellent speaker so that the  republic could not boast of a better soldier or a greater orator This youth when enriched by his band of nobles was always most conspicuous and as if his strength and eloquence had mvested him with all consular and even dictatorial power he boldly sustained the storms of the tribunes and fury of the mob Under his conduct the tribunes had been frequently driven out of the forum and the rabble dispersed and put to flight Whoever offered to resist did not fail to be roughly handled and stripped naked Hence they easily saw that unless he got a severe check their exertions to promote the law would signify nothing When the other tribunes had given over all for lost one of their number A Virginius summoned Caeso against a certain day to be tried capitally This step far from abating served only to enflame the courage of this impetuous youth He still persisted in opposing the law with more vehemence than ever redoubled hisin sblts of the plebeians and attacked the tribunes without any reserve as having then a just cause for making war upon them His accuser after his impeachment suf fered him to go every length that by his outrages he might increase the odium against him and furnish them with new matter of grievance In the mean time he continued to push the law not so much from any hopes he had of carrying it as to 220 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III provoke this rash young nobleman Many things that had been said and done without consideration by the young nobility were all charged upon Caeso who was now become odious Notwithstanding of which he per sisted in his opposition to the law  A Virginius was every now and then trumpeting to the people to this effect  Are you not sensible fellotft citizens that you cannot retain Caeso and carry the law you are so much set upon But why do I rnen tion the law He is an enemy to your liberty and â in pride exceeds all the Tarquins put together Only wait till he is made consul or dictator You see w rth what force and violence he lords it now while only a private citizen Many approved of the tribune s speech coirfpiaining that they had been roughly hand kd by him and urged the tribune to strain every nerve to bring him to condign punishment CHAP XII Caio deprecates the wrath of the people JL HE day for the trial came and the people in gene ral seemed to think that their liberty depended on the condemnation of Caeso Urged therefore by necessity with much inward indignation he went about soliciting their favour one by one his relations and friends the principal men of the city attending him T Quinc tius who had been thrice consul after recounting the honours which he himself and others of his family had acquir ed by their gallantry affirmed  That neither the Quinctian name nor even the whole Roman state had ever produced a more excellent genius or a sol dier of more consummate bravery Lâ that he had marked him a the first soldier in the army as he had often seen him signalize himself when engaged with the enemy Sp Furius bore testimony That when he was in the most dangerous situation Quinctius sent Caeso to his relief and that his valour upon that critical occasion was peculiarly essential to the pros perity of the state Lucretius one of the last year s consuls covered with fresh laurels divided his glory with Caeso enumerating his combats and glorious CHAP 13 ROMAN HISTORY 221 atchievernents in pitched battles as well as detached parties and with the most persuasive arguments he exhorted the people To make it their choice that a Â youth possessed of so many excellent endowments â which must render him a valuable acquisition to any state whither he might retire should rather be a citizen of Rome than of any other city whatever The fire and spirit which they found fault with would evaporate with an increase of years and give him prudence in exchange which was the only thing he wanted his faults declining whilst his virtues were perpetually advancing to maturity they would fmd their account in suffering so great a man to improve and grow old in his country Among the rest L Quinctius sirnamed Cincinnati pleaded also for his son not by extolling his merit fpr fear he would thereby only exasperate his enemies but by entreating the assem bly to impute his errors to his youth and for his father s sake to forgive them whom none of them could accuse of having injured them in any instance either by word or deed Some of the assembly made no return to their submissions either through modesty or fear whilst others complaining that they and their friends had suf fered by his blows by the rashness of their return plainly discovering what their sentence was to be CHAP XJII â aso arrested finds bail and banisJies himself JL HERE was one charge brought against Csso which hung heavier on him than all the public odium besides in support of which M Volscius Fictor who had been tribune of the people some years before rose up to give evidence He averred  That soon after the city was freed from the plague he had fallen in with a set of libertine young Patricians rioting in the Subura and a quarrel ensuing his elder brother who had not then got entirely over his complaints was knocked down by Cawo and left almost expiring being carried home between men s hands he died and he had reason to think that it was in consequence of that blow Bui 222 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK III the consuls for the preceding years would not permit him to prosecute Coeso as the author of this inhuman murder The people were so exasperated at this charge that in their fury they were not far from taking immediate vengeance on the spot Virginius ordered him to be seized and carried to pri son but the Patricians prevented the execution by force His father T Quinctius insisted  That it was quite in consistent with all law to do violence to the person of any citizen accused of a capital crime for which he was to be tried before he was heard in his own de fence and condemned The tribune replied  That he had no intention of hurting his person till he should be legally condemned but only to secure him in pri son till the day of his trial that as he had been guilty of murder the Roman people might have it in their power to punish him for it When an appeal was made to the tribunes they exert ed their right of relieving the oppressed by taking a middle way They agreed that he should not be im prisoned but should find bail for his appearance iu judgment on the day appointed under a penalty to be forfeited to the people in case of non appearance There was a dispute about the extent of the penalty which was at last submitted to the nomination of the senate and during the deliberation of the fathers on that point Caeso was kept under arrest in the forum They fixed the sum in which each surety should be bound at three thousand asses of brass but left it to the col lege of tribun s to determine the number They de manded ten and ten were bound for Cseso s appearance accordingly This was the first instance of a state crir minal s finding bail Being now at liberty the very next night he left Rome and retired in exile among the Etrurians When the day fixed for his trial came it was pled that Caeso having banished himself he was not amenable to their assembly but Virginius held the Committa notwithstand ing and an appeal being entered to the other tribunes tlie assembly was dismissed The penalty was however  Nine pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence CHAP 14 ftOMAN HISTORY 2 23 rigorously exacted of the father so that having sold the better part of his estate he lived for some time like an exile in a retired and solitary cottage on the other side of the Tiber CHAP XIV The young Nobility by their complaisance get the better of the Tribunes J HIS trial and promulgation of the law kept the whole city employed for there was no foreign war to disturb them The tribunes as if they had really ob tained a victory concluded that now the Patricians be ing effectually intimidated by the banishment of Caeso that they were at last secure of getting the bill passed and thai the elder senators having withdrawn them selves in a great measure from the administration seem ed to yield to them all authority in the state The young nobility especially the late companions of Caeso without any diminution of their courage be came still more incensed against the plebeians But in one respect they were much improved for they had learned to manage their fury with more caution The moment the law was proposed after the banishment of CaEso being quite prepared and supported by a great number of their clients whenever the tribunes furnished them with an excuse for violence by attempting to re move them from the assembly they attacked them in such a manner that no one of the assailants could be singled out as the author to incur the odium or the ho nour The people complained that instead of one Caeso they had now to straggle with a thousand In the intermediate days when the law was not in question no men were more composed or complaisant than these young nobles They addressed the commons with the greatest shew of affability entered into the most familiar conversation with them inviting them to their houses assembling with them in the forum and in other matters suffering the tribunes to hold their plebeian councils without the least interruption Neither in pub lic nor in private did they discover any rancour ex 824 TITUS LIVIU BOOK III ceptiug when the law was in question On all other oc casions they were all affability and complaisance to the commons Nay the tribunes had not only full liberty to do their other business quietly but without a contra dictive word or the least violence offered them were re chosen to their office for the ensuing year condescen sions and compliances by which they gradually soothed the multitude and effectually defeated every attempt in favour of the laws for all that year â CHAP xv Herdonius attempt upon Rome A R 293 VHEN C Claudius son of Appras and P Valerius Publicuia succeeded to the consulship they found great er harmony in the state than it had enjoyed for some  time before The new year produced nothing remark able as to getting the bill passed and to prevent it continued to be the sole object of public attention The more the young nobles insinuated themselves into the good graces of the Plebeians the more vigilant were the tribunes in setting every engine at work by loading then with calumnies to render them suspected They alledged  That there was a conspiracy on foot â â that Caeso was actually at Rome â that measures were concerted for murdering the tribunes and massacring the commons That the elder senators had given it in charge to the younger to suppress the tribunitian power and to restore the state to that form of govern ment which prevailed in Rome before the secession to the mons sacer Moreover they dreaded a war with the jEqui and Volsci which was now become com mon as it happened regularly almost every year but in the mean time another new and unexpected calamity became the object of their attention nearer home The capitol and fortress adjacent to it was surprised and seized in the nightime by 4500 out laws and slaves with Appius Herdonius a Sabine at their head A1I that were found in the citadel who refused to join in their enterprise and take up arms with them were immediately put to death In the confusion some agi CHAP 16 ROMAN HISTORY 225 tated with fear ran precipitately into the forum where to arms â the enemy is in the city was the univer sal cry  The consuls at a loss to determine whether this sud den blow was struck by foreign or domestic foes whether it originated in the discontent and enmity of the com mons or in a plot of the slaves were equally afraid to arm the Plebeians and to leave them unarmed They endeavoured to settle the confusion but their endeavours sometimes only increased it The multitude struck with consternation and affright could not be brought under â any government whatever They however gave out arms tmt not to all indiscriminately only to such as they could confide in most and x f these only such a number as were sufficient to guard every place against the at tacks of an enemy of whom they had as yet no idea Therefore being totally ignorant what enemy or what number they had to oppose they passed the remainder tif the night in great perplexity posting guards wherever they were thought necessary At last day light made the wished for discoverv whence the war proceeded and by whom it was conduct ed Appius Herdonius from the capitol proclaimed liberty to the slaves declaring  That he had under taken the cause of the miserable to restore exiles un justly banished to their country and to deliver slaves from the oppressive yoke That he had rather the  Roman people would do this uncompelled but if he saw no hopes of relief from that quarter he would have recourse to the Equi and Volsci and leave no thing unattempted to effectuate his purpose CHAP XVI Obstructions of the Tribunes i Â HE mystery being now somewhat cleared up the consuls and senators besides what was publicly threaten ed became very uneasy with the apprehension that this enterprise had been concerted with the Vejentes and Sabines and whilst they had so many of the enemy already in the xnty the Sabine and Etrtirian legions 226 TITUS LIVIUS Book III might soon arrive according to concert followed by those of the Equi and Volsci the eternal enemies of Rome who would not come to ravage the country as formerly but to take possession of a city already half taken Among so many causes of distrust their principal terror was with respect to the slaves no man knowing but he had an enemy in his house in whom they neither could safely contide having no assurance of their fidelity nor seem to distrust for fear of making them enemies Such was their embarrassment that they did not imagine that a thorough reconciliation between the orders would be sufficient to save the state However among all the ca lamities that threatened them they had not the least ap prehension of danger from the people or their magis trates Their domestic dissensions they considered as evils of a gentle kind being ever the consequences of freedom from all other calamities and for the present seemed to be absorbed in this foreign alarm However it was this that bore heaviest upon them when totter ing this under the pressure of other troubles The phrenzy of the tribunes rose so high that they insisted the war was a mere bugbear â that the capitol had been seized with no other view than to make them forget the bill but were it once passed they would see those cli ents and creatures of the Patricians finding all their riotous exertions to obstruct it ineffectual steal away hi as great silence as they entered Then calling the peo ple from their arms they held an assembly to pass the law In the mean time the consuls convened the senate more afraid of the tribunes than of the enemy who bad alarmed them in the night CHAP XVH Animated speech of Valerius Obstinacy of the Tribunes VA HEN word was brought that the people had laid down their arms and quitted their posts Publius Vale rius leaving his colleague to keep the senate together left the senate house in a great hurry and flew to the temple to the tribunes What is the meaning of this said he tribunes Will nothing less serve you than CHAP 17 ROMAN HISTORY 227 a subversion of the commonwealth under the conduct and auspices of Herdonius Has he who had not suf ficient influence to entice our slaves to join him found the way to bring you over to his party How whilst the enemy are over our heads do you order the peo pie to lay down their arms that they may make laws Then addressing himself to the people he continued  If you should be under no concern for the city and should you be quite insensible of your own danger you ought at least to have some regard to the gods of your country who are m the hands of the enemy Jupiter the most high the most bene volent queen Juno Minerva and all the gods and goddesses are at this moment suffering a siege Slaves are encamped round your tutelar gods Do your pro ceedings evince that you are in your senses While so formidable an enemy is not only within our walls but in the citadel overlooking the forum and place of our assemblies yet we hold our assemblies with in difference and deliberate with as much unconcern as in times of the greatest tranquillity Ought we not rather Pa ricians plebeians consuls tribunes citi zens every man to take arms and lend their aid Ought we not to fly to the capitol to deliver and re gain that august habitation of the almighty

by the power of goM Move them to march the same way by which thou didst conduct thy army As for me I am ready as consul to be the foremost in following thee anrl tread thy paths as far as a mortal man can follow a god At the conclusion of his speech he declared That he would take arms and called upon every Ro man to do the same protesting if any one should dare to hinder them that without regard to consular authority tribunitian power or the sacred laws them seives that whatever was his quality or wheresoever  he should find him he would treat him as an enemy to the state That the tribunes if they pleasedj since  they had forbidden them to arm against Herdonius â 228 TITUS LmiJS BOOK 111 might now command them to take arms against Va lerius the consul  and he would not hesitate to act by the tribunes as the founder of his family had done by the kings Matters seemed now to be in that train that nothing but the utmost violence would have been the issue when a sedition of the Romans would have been exhibited as a spectacle to the enemy The tribunes could not proceed in passing the bill nor could the consul march against the capitol till night came on and suspended the dispute During the night fear of the armed citizens who were at the consuls devotion kept the tribunes quiet Wtrere fore when these Daemons of discord were out of the way the senators went round among the people and mixing with them in their crowds entered into conversation with them suitable to the times conjuring them To take care how they plunged the Republic into this extre mity of danger â That the contest now w as not be tween the Patricians and Plebeians but that both alike the citadel of Rome the temples of their gods the tu telar gods of the state the domestic gods of every citi zen were abandoned to their enemies â Whilst the senators were thus employed in bringing the multitude to reason in the forum the consuls in the mean time posted guards at the gates and wall to prevent any sur prize from the Sabines and Vejentes CHAP XVIII O Kindness of he Tusculeins The Capitol relieved but Valerius killed _L HAT very night the news of taking the citadel sur prising the capitol and of the confusion that raged at Rome reached to Tusculum where Mamilius at that time presided as dictator He immediately convened the senate introduced the messengers and warmly remon strated That they ought not to wait till Rome should demand their assistance in form j that the danger and hazard their confederate gods and the sacred obliga tion of treaties required the utmost dispatch The gods could never give them a better opportunity of evkien CHAP ISi ROMAN HISTORY â 229 t cing their zeal and attachment to so powerful a neigh  bouring city They cheerfully consented to send them assistance and their youth were immediately mus tered nnd armed They reached Rome early next morning and at a dis tance were taken tor the jfequi and Volsci coming a  gainst them When they were convinced of their mis take they received them mto the city where the Tmarch ed in a body to the arum and joined Valerius already drawing up his troops having left the guard of the gates to his colleague â â The character of Valerius had great weight with the people when he assured them  That whenever the oa pitol should be recovered and the tranquillity of the city restored if they would permit him then to in form them of the artful self interested views con cealed under the specious law in question he would neither be forgetful of his ancestors nor his sirname entailed upon him by his progenitors as an hereditary  obligation to support the interest of the people and for his own part would give no interruption to their â assemblies Accordingly they followed him in spite of all the tribunes could urge and gained the declivity of the Capitoline hill in conjunction with the Tusculan auxiliaries Here a noble emulation of being foremost in the charge animated the Romans and allies They were encouraged by their leaders on both sides The enemy then began to be afraid having no other resource hut in the strength of the place The epnfederates took ad vantage of their disorder and charged them briskly and had already broke mto the porch of the temple when P Valerius who fought at the head of his troops was killed P Volumnius a con sul ar gentleman saw him fall and ordering his men to cover his body fiewto take bis place The ardour and fury with which they fought kept them insensible of the melancholy eveut so that they had gained the victory before they perceived that they had fought without a general The temple was polluted with the blood of many of the exiles many were takjen alive but Herdonius himself was among the slain Thus then was the capitol recovered The pri â  230 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III  soners were punished according to their quality as free men or slaves The Tu culans had the public thanks The capitoi was cleansed and purified and the people are said to have cast farthings into the consul s house that he might be buried with the greater pomp CHAP XIX The Tribunes over ruled by the noble efforts of Cinrinnattu J HIS affair was no sooner happily terminated than the tribunes became importunate with the senators to perform the promise made them by P Valerius They pressed Claudius to deliver the manes of his colleagues from the imputation of treachery by suffering them without interruption to go on in the affair of the law Claudius told them that the question was inadmissible till once they had given him a colleague They con tinued to wrangle upon this point till the Comitia were held for the election of a new consul In the month of December L Quinctius Cincinnatus Cseso s father ow ing to the indefatigable application of the father  wasap pointed to the consular fasces This choice was a thunder stroke to the people as they were now under the government of a magistrate of great abilities great credit in the senate and higblv ex asperated against them and besides had three sons in magnanimity not inferior to Caeso and in prudence far surpassing him when they had occasion to display it He no sooner entered upon office than in the speeches which he daily made from his tribunal he applied him self no less to rouse the senate from their lethargy than to check the licentiousness of the people Addressing himself to the senators he told them  That it was owing to their constant facility and wantof resolution that the same men were continued in the tribuneship from year to year men who by their impeachments ami toul language lord it over the state as a set of bullies do over a brothel That courage constancy in fine every virtue civil and military ih it adorn youth was driven from Rome with his son Caeso Babblers batchers of sedition and divisions in the CHAP 19 ROMAN HISTORY  â 231 state prevail by their vile intrigues to be continued in the office of tribunes for two or three years and to  act in it wiih tyrannical wantonness What con tinued he  has this Aulus Virginius because he was not in the capital deserved less punishment than Ap pius Herdonius who seized it f I affirm if the circum stances be properly attended to it will be evident 4hat he deserved it more Herdonius in declaring himself your enemy did in some measure put arms into your hands but this tribune in maintaining with effrontery that there was no war â no enemy wrested your arms from you and gave you up defenceless to your slaves and exiles and did you march your troops with de ference to my colleague C Claudius and the dead Valerius be it spoken did you march I say up to the capitol before you had cleared the forum of these wretches the more dangerous enemies of Rome What a shame in the sight of gods and men Whilst the enemy were in possession of the capitol and cita del and a captain of a banditti composed of exiles and slaves after they had profaned every thing and taken up their quarters in the temple of the most high Jupi ter the Tusculans should have armed in our defence before we did it ourselves There is still reasoji to  doubt whether it was L Mamilius the general of Tusculum or the consuls Valerius and Claudius that delivered the citadel of Rome And that we who would not even permit the Latins to arm in their own defence even when the enemy was in their country should upon this occasion have been struck out of ex istence as a state had not these same Latins as a pure efl ect of their good will armed for our relief And is this what you tribunes call aiding ttie plebeians to give them up unarmed to be slaughtered by the enemy If any one the lowest of the people with whom you herd and of whom you have formed a country and republic distinct from the state peculiar to yourselves should come and inform you that his house was in vested with a body of armed slaves you might think it incumbent on you to run to his relief but the most high the most benevolent Jupiter was not worthy to be rescued by human aid when beset with armed TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III i   j slaves ami outlaws Shall they to whom the gods are not sacred have the impudence to insist after this that their persons are sacred and mviolable And do you flatter yourselves that covered as you are with crimes hoth betbre gods and men that you shall pass your bill this year By all that is sacred if you even itffer to prefer it the day in which 1 was chosen consul will prove more unfortunate than that on which the re public lost Valerius But my colleague and I have taken our measures and first of all we are to march the legions against the Equi and Volsci How it comes about I cannot say but the gods are ever more favourable to us in war than in peace â What would have been the consequence had it transpired among these nations that the capitol was taken by exiles However it is better to form suspicions of what might have happened when all is over than to put it to the â test by actual experiment CHAP XX  â â The Senate encouraged and the people depressed vigorous a discourse qnite stunned the people The senate pulled up their spirits and began to think that the republic was restored The other consul a better assessor than principal easily suffered his colleague to take the lead in this weighty business but claimed to himself a share in the execution which appertained his office as consul The tribunes treated all these me naces as idle vapouring asking with an air of contempt Where the consuls would get the army they meant to lead out for they might be assured they would not be suffered to make levies Ve have occasion for none replied Quinctius  the citizens when they took up arms to recover the capitol all swore to Valerius not to lay them down without the consuls permission  wherefore we strictly enjoin every sol dier who took that oath to appear in amis to morrow at Ihe lake of Rcgillus The tribunes cavilled al ledging  That the oath did not bind the soldiers to his obedience who was then only a prirate gentleman CHAT 21 ROMAN HISTORY 233 when the troops took the oath But the contempt of the gods which reigns so triumphant in our days was at that time quite unknown In these times men did not by artful interpretations contrive to make oaths and Iaws convenient for their own purposes but suited their practice to their oaths and to the laws The tribunes finding nowj that they could not prevent the consuls design consulted how to delay the army s march from the city more especially as it was rumour ed  That the augurs had been enjoined to attend at the lake of Regillus That the place was to be con â secrated  where the auspices once taken the consuls miglit treat wiih the people in order to repeal by their votes in the Comitia all laws that had been ex torted at Rome by the violence of the tribunes That there the people would be entirely at the devotion of the consuls the freedom of appeal did not extend beyond a mile without the city and the jurisdiction of the tribunes being confmed to the same limits should they go out to the place ol rendezvous they would also wiih the multitude be subject to the au thority of the consuls These considerations appeared terrible but what struck them most sensibly was that Quinctius frequently de clared  That he would hold no Comitia for electing the consuls that the state was too much distempered for the application of ordinary remedies That the commonwealth stood in need of a dictator who would make all disturbers of the peace feel the weight of an authority from which there was no appeal CHAP XXI A compromise â The Tribunes re elected 1 HE senate were at this time assembled in the capi tol Thither ran the tribunes with the multitude in a consternation at their heels Th e people with loud voices called sometimes upon the consuls and some times upon the fathers to compassionate their case but the consuls would listen to no intreaties till the tribunes had promised to abide by whav the senate hould judge fit to be done Theu he reported their 2S4  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III petition to the fathers who therenpon enacted  That the tribunes should give no more trouble about their bill for this year and that the consuls should not lead an army out of the city moreover that in the judgment of the senate to continue magistrates in their office after the expiration nf their year and to â re elect the same tribunes were unconstitutional and dangerous to the state The consuls submitted to the senate s award but the tribunes were re elected in spite of all the consuls remonstrances The Patricians to be even with the Plebeians put Quinctius in nomination for the consulate but on no occasion throughout the whole year did he exert him self with more force and vehemence than in opposing the measure Is it any wonder says he  conscript fathers that the plebeians make light of your autho rity when you trifle with it yourselves Because the people violate your decision in contmuing their nia gistrates you want to do so too that yoÂ may not be surpassed in impropriety as if the passports to power in the commonwealth were inconsistency and licen tiousness for certainly there is more of both in counteracting your own decrees than infringing those of others Do you conscript fathers set up the head strong multitude as a pattern for your imitation and wiil you who ought to be an example to others fol low the crowd to do evil rather than engage them to follow you by the propriety of your conduct For my own part I am determined that I shall not imi â tate the tribunes in contempt of your decree I will not suffer myself to be re eIected consul and I con jure you C Claudius to prevent the Roman people â from acting so unconstitutionally at the same time be assured that so far from taking offence at your opposition as a bar to my additional honour I shall always consider it as a mark of your friendship as en hancing my own glory in the proof of my disinterest edness ancl an escape from much envy a nd shame which the continuation in the consulship would un avoidably draw upon me Upon this the fathers issued an edict  Forbidding all persons to name L Quinctius at the next elections for the consulate CHAP 22 ROMAN HISTORY  255 declaring that if any did his vote would not be ad mitted CHAP XXII The Volsci dtfeated JL HE consuls for this year were Q Fabius Vibulanus and L Cornelius Maluginensis This was the third time Fabius had been raised to that dignity There was a census held this year but no lustrum owing to some religious scruples about the pollution of the capitol and fall of the consul Valerius In the beginning of this consulship state clouds quick ly gathered The tribunes still tampered with the peo ple and advices were brought from the Hernici and Latins that the Equi and Volsci were making vast pre parations for war The Volscian legions had already reached Antium and it was strongly suspected that the Antiates were meditating a revolt Besides it was with no small difficulty that the tribunes were prevailed on to suffer the progress of this war to be stopped in time The consuls shared the provinces between them It fell to Fabius to march the legions to Antium while Corne lius stayed to guard the city lest according to custom the Equi should detach parties to ravage the country The Hernici and Latins were ordered to furnish their respective quotas of troops stipulated by treaty  conse quently two thirds of the army consisted of allies and one of Romans These confederates having come up on the day ap pointed the consul encamped without the gate Capena from thence after the army had been purified by sacri fice he marched to Antium and encamped in its neigh bourhood not far from the enemy The Volsci as the ffiqui had not yet joined them not daring to risk a battle alone thought only of remaining quiet in their camp and defending themselves within their works Next day Fabius drew up his army not in a body composed promiscuously of allies and citizens bat into three distinct battalions of Romans Latins and Hernici each by themselves round the enemy s lines 236 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III At the head of the Roman infantry he posted himself in the centre He then ordered them to observe the signal that they might keep time to a moment in making the attack or in retiring if a retreat should be sounded The cavalry of each were posted in the rear of their re spective battalions In this disposition he invested their camp in three different places and attacking it with spirit on all sides drove the Volsci who could not stand the charge from their lines Then getting immediately over their fortifications where fear had crowded them together and cooped them np in a cjorner he drove them from their camp â As they fled in the greatest disorder the cavalry unable to cross the ditch and upon that ac count only spectators of the action having them now in the open plain came in for their share of the glory by making dreadful havork of them while they fled in the utmost fright Many were cut to pieces in the camp and majiy in their flight without the lines The booty was the more considerable because the enemy had enough to do if they carried their arms with them and y h id not the woods covered their flight not a man of them would have escaped CHAP XXIII The Mqui beat at Tusculum D URING these successes at Antiom he Equi bav ing detached the flower of their youth before them sur prised the citadel of Tusculum in the night and encamp ed the rest of their army in the neighbourhood to in tercept the enemy s forces This intelligence coming by express to Rome and transmitted thence to the camp at Antium affected the Romans as sensibly as if they had been told that the capitol was in the hands of the enemy The obligations they lay under to the Tusculans in a similar disaster were too gratefully remembered not to command assistance in return Wherefore FabiOs having conveyed the booty from the camp to Antium where he left a small garrison neglecting every thing else marched with all expedition to Tusculum allowing his soldiers to encumber themselves with nothing but CHAP 24  ROMAN HISTORY 2S â their arms and such provisions as were ready dressed Cornelius the oilier consul sent them provisions from Rome The campaign before Tusculum lasted several months With part of th e army Fabius invested the enemy s camp having dispatched the rest to assist the Tusculans in the recovery of their citadel which was deemed im pregnable by any force Famine however at last obliged the enemy to abandon it who being reduced to the last extremity were by the Tusculans obliged to pass naked and unarmed under the yoke The Roman consul pursued them in their shameful flight and com ing up with them at the Algidus put every one of them to the sword The victorious consul led back his army to Columen for so was the place called where he encamped Cornelius likewise now that the city was in no danger the enemy being defeated marched out of Rome with his army and the two consuls entering the enemy s territories in two different divisions contended who should do the greatest execution the one in the country of the Volsci â and the other in that of the Eqiii Most authors seem positive that the Antiates revolted this year and that they were reduced by L Cornelius who took their town Bat I do not choose to mention it for a truth as the more ancient historians are silent with respect to it CHAP XXIV Volscius impeached for perjury The Census finished J HIS war being over a contention with the tribune at home discomposed the fathers They exclaimed that the army was kept in the field by artful manbeuvres with a view to stave off the bill and declared that no thing should hinder them from going through with what they had undertaken Nevertheless Lucretius prefect of the city prevailed with them to defer the business till the arrival of the consuls There arose likewise a new ground of contention A Cornelius and G Serviiius who were at that time quaestors appointed M Volscius a day to stand trial for Â 3S TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III manifest perjury in his evidence against Cicso For from many concurring testimonies it was evident that Volscius s brother from the time he had been confmed to his bed had never left it far less been seen abroad and after he had languished for several months under the disease it had at last carried him off Neither was Cseso at Rome the time condescended on in the indict ment many of his camp companions affirming that he had been all that time attending his colours without ever leaving them the truth of which was vouched by many But he durst not venture to stand this trial for from so many concurrmg circumstance the condemnation of Voiscius was no more doubted than Cseso s upon his single testimony The tribunes however put off the trial refusing to sutler the Quaestors to hold the Comitia for that purpose till they were first assembled for enact ing the law Consequently both these points were de ferred till the return of the consuls When the consuls entered the city in triumph with their victorious army as no mention was made of the law it was generally believed that the tribunes were over awed by their presence But as the year was near an end anxious to get themselves elected for the fourth time they had dropt all disputes about the law to leave themselves at liberty to canvass for next election And although the consuls exerted themselves as strenuously to oppose the re election of the sau â tribunes as if a bill had been preferred to curtail their authority yet in the contest the tribunes prevailed This year the Equi sued for peace which was grant ed them and the census which had been begun last year was finished in this This was the tenth lustration winch had been made since the building of the city One hundred and thirty two thousand four hundred and nine citizens were enrolled The consuls by their con duct this year both in peace and war gained immortal honour for they made peace with all their neighbours and the state though the demon of discord was not to tally expelled was not so much embroiled as in ovhei consulships  25 ROMAN HISTORY 230 CHAP XXV   New disturbance from the   HESE consuls gave way to L Menucius and C Nautius who took under their consideration the two causes that lay over undetermined the former year The consuls would not hear of the law nor the tribunes of Volscius s trial but ihe new Qutestors were men of greater resolution and more weight There were in that office Titus Quinctius Gapitolinus who had been thrice con sul and M Valerius the son of Valerius and grandson of Volscius Quinctius since Ceeso the pride of the Ro man youth could neither be restored to his family nor the state thought it his duty to prosecute the man who had given false evidence against him and so deprived him of an opportunity of pleading his innocence as far as law or justice would go When Virginius particularly and the other tribunes were bustling about the law the consuls were allowed two months to examine it and explain to the people the mischief latent under it after which they were to suffer it to be put to the vote The concession of this respite produced a general tranquillity all over the city but it was soon interrupted by the JEqui who having broke the treaty they had made with the Romans the year be fore bad put themselves under the auspices of Gracchus Cltelius by far the most considerable man in their coun try Led on by him they passed through the Lavican territories entered the Tuscutan which they ravaged without mercy and laden with spoil retired to the Algi dus where they encamped Q Fabius Pubiius Volumnins and A Posthumius were sent thither ambassadors from Rome to complain of the injuries and demand restitution agreeable to treaty The general of the Jiqui in return ordered them  to deliver their commission from the Roman senate to the oak tree for at present he had other business to mind The oak tree alluded to was a large one hanging over liis tent and by its branches forming a cool shade Then one of the ambassadors as he departed said  Let 240  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III this sacred oak and whatever divinity resides in it bate witness to your breach of treaty may they pay more regard to our just complaints and by and by prosper our arms when we shall take you to a severe account for your violation of the laws of gods and men The moment the ambassadors were returned to Rome the senate ordered one of the consuls to march with an army to the Algidus against Gracchus and the other to lay waste the territories of the ffiqui The tribunes as usual opposed the levies at first and miglit have done so to the last but for a fresh aud sudden alarm CHAP XXVI Minucius besieged in his camp Cincinnatus created dictator A SWARM of Sabines drove like an inundation ravag ing all before them almost to the walls of Rome The Roman lands were laid waste and in the city there was great consternation The people then cheerfully took arms and in spire of all the remonstrances of the tribunes two formidable armies were levied Nautius led one of them against the Sabines and encamped at Eretum whence he sent out small detachments and these gene rally in the night by which he committed such terrible devastations that comparatively speaking what the Ro mans had suffered bore no proportion But Minutius in his expedition had neither the same spirit nor the same good fortune for having encamp ed not far from the enemy although he had met with no extraordinary check he kept within his camp for fear The enemy the moment they observed his cowardice began as it generally happens to pull up a prodigious low of spirits Thus animated they attacked his camp in the night but finding they could make no impression by open force drew lines round it the next day Before they had finished their circumvallation and blocked up every avenue five horsemen who had been dispatched on purpose escaped the vigilance of the enemy s cen tries and carried the news to Rome that the consul and his army were besieged in their camp This intclli CHAP 26 ROMAN HISTORY 241 gence of all others was least expected or looked for and the terror and consternation it occasioned at Rome was much the same as if the city itself and not the camp had been invested The consul Nautius was sent for but that their only confidence might not be placed in him they judged it proper to name a dictator to retrieve their embarrassed affairs and pitched upon L Quinctius Cincinnatus with on e consent for that purpose It is worth any one s while who makes light of every thing but riches and who imagines that without them there can be no real greatness no virtue â to listen at tentively to the following narrative This same Lucius Quinctius the prop and stay of the Roman people lived in the country on the other side of the Tiber and culti vated with his own hands a small piece of land of four acres called the Quinctian meadows opposite that very place where the ship docks now are The senate s de puties found him there trenching with the spade or at plough at least one thing is certain that he was busily employed about his farm After the usual compliments on both sides were passed they begged him  To put on his gown and hear the senate s message praying it might prove auspicious both to himself and the state Struck wifh admiration he asked them  If all was well Then turning to his wife Racilia  Go says he  make haste and fetch my gown  and wiping the dust and sweat from his face he put it on and re joined them The deputies straight saluted him Dictator with great demonstrations of joy invited him to the city and informed him of the critical situation of the army A barge belonging to the state was waiting to convey him to the city His three sons his other relations and friends and the greatest part of the senators were wait ing to receive him at his landing With this attendance preceded by the lictors he was conducted to his house Crowds of the Plebeians likewise put themselves in his train although his arrival to them was not over agree able for they thought his authority too extensive and himself too severe in the execution of it They kept watch in the city all that night 242 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK III CHAP XXVII   The Dictator marches to the Consul s relief JL HE dictator next morning went into the forum and named for his general of the horse L Taiquitius a Pa trician who had distinguished himself by his bravery above all the Roman youth but being too poor to keep a horse had till then never served but in the infantry With him he repaired to the assembly proclaimed a va cation in all judiciary proceedings ordered the shops throughout the city to be shut up a suspension of all la bour whatever and all the citizens able to bear arms to meet him before sun set in the field of Mars with their arms dressed provisions for five days and each furnish ed with twelve stakes for a pallisade Whoever through age was disqualified for the service was ordered to dress provisions for the soldier who lived nearest him whilst be famished himself with stakes and got ready his arms In consequence of this order the youth dispersed them selves up and down in quest of stakes taking them as they occurred without the least interruption They all assembled without the least delay as the dictator had ordered The dictator then at the head of the infantry and his general of horse at the head of the cavalry led out the troops drawn up not only for marching but for action should occasion require it Each corps was animated by arguments drawn from the present emergency They were requested to march with expedition in order to come np with the enemy in the night as the consul and a Roman army had now been besieged for three days That it was impossible to say what a day or night might bring forth as a single moment often de termined the greatest and most important event To gratify their leaders the soldiers addressing each other cried out  March out ensign follow soldier About the miiidle of the night they arrived at the Algi dus and when they perceived themselves not far from the enemy gave orders to halt CHAP 28 ROMAN HISTORY 243 CHAP XXVIII The consul relieved the Mqui beat and obliged to pass under the yoke JL HE dictator mounting on horseback rode round the enemy s camp and examined its form and extent with all the minuteness the night would admit he then or dered the tribunes to cause the baggage to be heaped up in one place and the soldiers to return with their arms and stakes into their ranks all which was instantly com plied with He made his army extend itself around their camp in the same good order as they had marched with orders to throw up a ditch and fortify it with pali sadoes and the moment the signal should be given to set up a great shout all together They waited not long for the signal and executed the orders with the utmost punctuality The cry was heard round the enemy on all si les and beyond the camp of the jEqui soon reach ed the consul s camp where it spread confidence and joy whilst it filled the Kqui with consternation and terror The consul s army when they heard the shouts of their fellow citizens congratulated each other and as sured that relief was at hand threatened the enemy with their advanced and picquet guards There is now no time to be lost cried the consul  the shout we have beard has not only announced the arrival of our friends but that they are already engaged with the enemy Nay it would be matter of wonder if the enemy s lines are not already attacked on the outside To arms therefore to arms and follow me soldiers Out sallied the legions in the night to the attack and their shouts informed the dictator that the enemy had also hot work on the inside The SLqui were just going to interrupt the works the dictator ha I begun to prevent their being surrounded when the alarm from the other side obliged them to turn the best part of their strength that way lest they should open a way through the heart of their camp and leave the dictator at liberty for the rest of the night to go on with his works 244 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III The engagement wiih the consular army continued till morning bv which time the dictator had drawn his works quite round them nor were they quite a match for one of the armies Then the dictator s troops ha3 no sooner finished their work than they run to their arms and attacked the enemy s lines Here was new work cut out for them without the least respite from the old which was still maintained with great vigour and being at last overpowered bv an enemy on each side they threw down their arms and begged quarter on the one side conjuring the dictator on the other the consul not to place victory in the utter destruction of their nation but to suffer them to depart unarmed The consul referred them to the dictator who being highly provoked ordered them to bring their general Gracchus Claelius and their other leaders in chains to him and immediately to evacuate the city of Corbio telling them at the same time  That as be did not want their blood he would let them go but that by passing under the yoke they should acknoW ledge in the face of the sun they were now a con quered people This yoke was constructed with three spears two whereof stood perpendicular to the plain and the third laid across them under which agree able to the dictator s order they all passed CHAP XXIX Cincinnaius triumphs MinutiuS degraded HAVING taken the enemy s camp which was plenti fully supplied with stores of every kind and indeed he had stripped them of every thing he gave all the booty to his own soldiers To the consul and his army he gave nothing but a sharp rebuke telling them  You shall not soldiers who were just about to fall a prey to your enemies have any share in their spoils And as for you L Minucius titl you begin to have the spi rit of a consul you shall only serve as a lieutenam ge neral in this army Minucius abdicated the consul ship and continued with the army as he was ordered So religiously was discipline observed at this time and CHAP 29 ROMAN HISTORY 245 such respect and ready submission did people pay to su perior merit and superior authority that the army less affected with the disgrace they had suffered than the benefit they had received decreed the dictator a crown of gold of a pound weight and at bis departure saluted him their preserver â The Roman senate having been convened by Fabius the city prefect decreed that Quinctius with the army he commanded should enter the city intriumph The generals of ihe enemy walked in chains before his cha riot the ensigns taken from them were carried before him and the army loaded with booty closed the proces sion Tables were covered at every door w here the soldiers stopping to regale themselves again followed the chariot making the whole city resound with songs of triumph and revelling as at their annual feasts The same day by the unanimous consent of the peo ple the freedom of Rome was conferred on L Mamilius ofTusculum Quinctius would have abdicated the dic tatorship immediately had it not been for the trial of Volscius for perjury which the tribunes would have put off long enough had not the authority of the dictator been interposed Volscius was condemned and after wards banished when he retired to Lanuvium Though Quinctius might have retained his high office for six months he resigned on the sixteenth day after his pro motion During these transactions the consul Nautius was car rying all before him at Eretrum against the Sabines whom he had not only distressed by ravaging their coun try but had also routed in a general battle Fa bius was sent to the Algid us to succeed to Minucius In the end of the year the tribunes began to stir again in the affair of the law but as two armies were abroad the senate carried it that n 3 bill should be preferred to the people Nevertheless in the election of tribunes the commons prevailed to have the same men continued in office for the fifth time About this time it was reported that wolves had been seen in the capitbl and that they were driven away by the dogs for which reason it was pu rified 24S â TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III  CHAP XXX Fire added to the college of Tribunes The Sabina de feated A R 295 J HESE were the memorable events of the year The consular fasces were now transferred to Horatius Pulvil Ius and Q Miuimus The beginning of their adminis tration was disturbed by no commotions abroad but the tribunes and their bill found them sufficient employment at home and so violent were they on the head that they would very probably have pushed it to the utmost if news had not been brought in the very nick of time that the JEqui in the night had surprized the Roman garrison of Corbio and taken the place by assault The senate assembled and without delay ordered an army to be raised and led to the Algidus Wherefore waving all disputes about the law for the present the whole bustle turned upon the levies Here the com mons supported by their tribunes prevailed over the authority of the consuls when they were still more alarmed from another quarter The Sabines had made a descent upon the Roman territory and were advancing to the wails of the city The terror struck by these motions had such weight with the tribunes that they suffered the levies to go on but upon the express condition that their number should be augmented to ten because they had been constantly baffled for five years successively which was a certain proof that their number was not sufficient for the pro tection of the people The necessity of the times oblig ed the senators to comply but conditionally that for the future the same tribunes should not be re chosen The comltia were immediately held for this new election for fear it might not as they had learned from expe rience be put in execution if delayed till the end of the war Thu in the thirty sixth year of the tribunitian pow er ten tribunes were created two out of each olasu a method observed ever after Troops were then raised and Minucios marched to chastise the Sabines but found  CHAP 31  ROMAN HISTORY 247 no enemy in the field The Equi having put the gar rison of Corbio to the sword and taken Ortona were attacked by Horatius at Alg uus Many of them fell in the action and the rest driven from the Algidus and the cities they had taken Corbio was levelled with the ground because its inhabitants had betrayed the garri son  CHAP XXXI Tlic consuls fined by the people A code of latei proposed JV1 VALERIUS and Sp Virginias succeed to the con sulship when Rome enjoyed peace both at home and abroad but the rainy season brought oh a scarcity of provisions A law was likewise passed for making mount Aventine common The same tribunes were re chosen who in the following year when T Romilius and C Veturius were consuls proposed the law in all their as semblies declaring they should be ashamed now that the number of their college had been doubled if they should be disappointed all the two years of their tribune ship as their predecessors had been for the five last years While the tribunes were wholly intent upon this matter an express arrived from Tuscnium with the alarming ac counts that the ffiqui were already in the heart of their country The late noble exertions of that people in fa vour of Rome challenged an immediate return for which reason both consuls were dispatched with an army who found the enemy as usual encamped at the Algidus There they were charged with such vigour that above 70OO fell in the action and the rest put to flight The spoils which were considerable were sold by the consuls and the proceeds put m the treasury as it had been totally drained This measure was very unpopu lar in the army and in the end furnished the tribunes with materials for censuring the consuls before the peo ple The moment they were out of office both had a day appointed for their trial when Sp Tarpeius and A Aterius were consuls C Claudius Cicero appeared as prosecutor against Romilius the ZEdile L Alienus against his colleague Veturius They were both coÂ 849  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III demned which exasperated the senators prodigiously Ronnlius was fined in 10 000 asses and Veturius in V5 000 brass asses Notwithstanding this example the succeeding consuls abated nothing of iheir usual activity but swore that were they also to be condemned they would never suffer the people and their demagogues to carry the law The tribunes then dropping their bill which had been so often tabled that it yas now worn to rags  and as suming a milder tone than hitherto when addressing the senators requested  that they would now put aa end to all contention and since Plebeian laws were disa greeable to them that they would suffer legislator partly Patricians and partly Plebeians to be created for establishing laws for the common benefit and cotn mon security of all ranks in point of liberty The senators made no other objection to this proposal but the admission of Plebeians into the number of the legislators When therefore they were agreed upon having taws the next point to be settled was the nomination of those to be put in commission to make them Spurius Post humius Albus A Manilas P Sulpitiul Camerinus were commissioned and sent to Athens to copy the celebrated laws of Solon and to learn the statutes

them all this year nor in the following consulship of P Horatius and S Quinctilius which was still more remarkable for the constant taciturnity of the tribunes occasioned by the deputation to Athens and their expectation of fo reign laws add to this that they were terribly afflicted with famine and pestilence equally destructive to man and beast The country became a solitude constant burials

illus the augur in whose place the college chose C Veturius the rather because he had been condemned by the people Quinctilius the consul and four of the tribunes fell also victims of the plague so that this year was tainted with a prodigious mortality â   In the mean time they had no disturbance from fo reign enemies In the next year in the consulship of P Sestius and T Menemus there was no foreign war but the daemon of discord once more began to rage at home The commissioners were now returned with the Athenian laws and the tribunes were very urgent that the great work of compiling a complete code of laws should be immediately entered upon It was at last determined that ten gentlemen should be delegated to act as sole magistrates for one earj Â tmi whose authority there shoutd be no appeal The debates ran high for some time about admitting Plebeians in the commission At last the senate prevailed under this restriction that neither Icilius law with respect to the Aventine mount nor the laws relative to the functions and privileges of the tri bunes should be repealed CHAP XXXIII The beginnmg of the Administration of the Decemvirt A disinterested instance 1 HUS in the year 30 after the building of the city there was a second revolution the administration being now transferred from the consuls to the decemvirs as it had been in the first instance from the kings to consuls This last revolution was less memorable as it was of shorter duration The joy thai this new form of govern ment diffused at first was rather extravagant and upon that account less permanent insomuch that consular go vernment both in name and authority came sooner to be in request  The decemvirs created by the people were Appius Claudius T Genucius P Sestius L Veturius C Ju lias A Manlius Ser Sulpicius P Curiatius T Romi Iin and Sp Posthumius This compliment was paid to 250 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK 111 1 Claudius and Genucius to balance the consular fasces to which they had been preferred this year and to Sestius one of the consuls the preceding year because he had brought that affair before the senate though his colleague was entirely against it Next to these were named the three commissioners who had been sent to Athens as a compliment due to them for their trouble in executing a commission at such a distance at the same time it was thought that men acquainted with foreign laws would be of some consequence in instituting a body of laws cal culated for their own meridian Those who succeeded in the list completed the number but they who were named last were too old as some say to oppose with a sufficient degree of resolution the sentiments of their col leagues Appius by the favour he had acquired among the people had the modelling of their magistracy For he had so far new modelled his temper that from being the most austere Patrician who crossed the Plebeians in all their claims and pretensions he suddenly became a very Poplicola solely intent upon pleasing the multitude and acquiring their affection Each of these new magistrates in his turn administer ed justice every tenth day when he bad the fasces borne before him  each of the oilier nine being that day only attended by a single officer The perfect unanimity that prevailed among them selves far from being prejudicial to particulars which is too often the case was attended with the strictest equi ty in regard to all the citizens We shall only men tion a single anecdote as an instance of their moderation By the tenor of their institution from their judgment there could be no appeal yet when a corpse was detect ed and dug up in the house of P Sestius by birth a Patrician and exposed in the public assembly in a case so glaring and atrocious the decemvir C Julius ap pointed him a day for his trial and though he was the legal judge himself in the cause yet he appeared as the public prosecutor before the people derogating from his own authority as decemvir to add to that of the people â This officer was called Accensus el acciendo HAP 34 ROMAN HISTORY 251 CHAP XXXIV Great satisfaction in the laws and practice of the Decemviri VV HILST all ranks were in raptures with an admi nistration which rendered justice with so much dispatch and impartiality the decemvirs applied themselves dili gently in preparing their code of laws At length they called an assembly of the people big with expectation and exposed to public view ten tables of laws  and pray ing  Jt might prove beneficial fortunate and auspici ous to the state themselves and their posterity re quested they would now read the laws they had pro posed That they had laboured to the utmost of their capacity to adapt them to the circumstances of all ranks high and low but the reflections and remarks of the whole body of the people might make many improvements They therefore exhorted the people to examine each article with attention in private and then communicate to each other their respective senti ments so that they may be prepared to declare in public what they conceived should be added or re trenched that in consequence the Roman people might have laws which they could not so properly be said to have accepted and confirmed as to have dic tated and composed themselves After the people had examined and commented upon every chapter of the laws and all necessary corrections and amendments made to the satisfaction of all concern ed the ten tables were ratified and confirmed in the Comitia by centuries and are at this day the foundation of ail right public or privaie however much systems of jurisprudence have been multiplied since It was now surmised that several regulations which would fill two other tables ought to be added to the former in order to make a complete code of Roman laws This opinion gained ground and occasioned a proposal to continue the decemviral government one year longer for by that expedient the people thought they would be delivered from the authority of the consuls now no less odious than that of kings and they found no occasion for the 252 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III protection of their tribunes since the decemvirs allowed causes which had been determined by one of tiiem to be re heard by another  â CHAP XXXV   Decemvirs chosen a neu A HE assembly for the election of new decemvirs being fixed twenty seven days after the canvassing for that office raised such a ferment that the principal men of the state fearing no doubt that an office of so great authority were they not to appear as candidates might lay open to persons by no means worthy of it used all their influence to get themselves returned in the nomina tion to a dignity of the establishment whereof they had been the wannest opposers although they now humbly solicited the favour of that very people agamst whom they had contended with so much vehemence before Appius seeing men so respectable for their years who had passed through all the dignities ot the state so warm in the pursuit of this began to be seriou iy alarmed It was difficult to say from his behaviour at thii time whether he was then in office or wanted to be so Only on some occasions he showed more of the candidate than the decemvir He spoke lightty of the nobitity but the lowest and most contemptible of the competitors he extolled to the skies strutting in the forum among the Dulii and Julii his advocates among the people with whom their influence was very considerabte At last his colleagues who till then had been entirety at his devotion began to mark him more attentively bemg at a loss to unravel the mystery of his intentions To them it appeared that he wus all a mask together  What said they  is i possible that a man who inherits all the pride of the Claudian family should all at once degenerate into such servile obsequiousness without views of the most interested kind To descend so much from his stateliness â to put himself so much under restraint â and to mingle m the face of the sun with private persons had not the appearance thai he was in haste to abdicate tut rather that he was pur suing every plan to be continued in his office  P 36 ROMAN HISTORY 253 They durst not however oppose his ambitious views in a direct manner but ihey endeavoured to counterplot him by a feigned compliance As the youngest among them by one consent they choosed him to preside in the assembly at the general election The design of this was to put it out of his power to put himself upon the list a thing quite unprecedented except among the tribunes and even then considered as an instance of the grossest impropriety However he declared he would hold the Comitia which he hoped would prove fortu nate and turned the obstacles laid in his way into the me us of success For having by his intrigues got the two Quinctii set aside with Capitolinus Cincinnatus his uncle C Claudius a man who had shewu himself always in the interest of the nobility and other citizens of the same distinction he created men decemvirs who were their interiors in every respect having moreover put himself first in nomination a circumstance that to every good man appeared so shameful that nobody imagined he would have carried his impudence to so extraordmary an height The other nine were M Cornelius Malugi nensis M Sergius L Minucius Q Fabius Vibulanus Q Pretelius T Antonius Merenda Caeso Duilius Sp Oppius Cornicen M Rubuleius CHAP XXXVI i â i Villainy of the Decemvirs A R 305 JTIERE Appius threw off the mask frora this date be began to aci more consistently with his real character and took care that his new colleagues even before they entered upon office should all be formed upon his own model They had private meetings every day in which they concerted schemes of tyranny which they conceal ed from all mankind and now far from dissembling their pride they became accessible to few and even those they treated with the utmost reserve till the ides of May at that time the usual term of entering upon office The very first day they made their official parade filled the whole city with terror and consternation They appear ed in the forum each with twelve lictors before hirri M 254 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK Ilk 4 whereas their predecessors had observed this rule that only one should have the fasces at a time which passed in rotation through them all to each of them regularly in his turn One hundred and twenty lictors now filled the forum carrying axes tied up in their fasces Nor did they think themselves entitled to withdraw the axe since by the decemviral constitution there was no appeal from their judgment They had the appearance of ten kings which not only filled the minds of the populace with uncommon terror but damped the principal sena tors not a liittei from a persuasion that they only want ed a pretence to lay the foundation of their authority in blood For should any one Cither in the senate or assemblies utter a syllable serving to revive the re membrance of liberty he would run the risk of his skin and perhaps his head to intimidate others from using the same freedom The right of appeal to the people was taken away so that no relief could be expected from that quarter and matters had been so concerted among the decemvirs that one of them would not receive an appeal from the deci sion of another which was very different from the prac tice of last year when they not only suffered appeals to one another but also transferred causes to the judgment of the people that properly belonged to their own tri bunal For some time they were equally formidable to all ranks but by degrees the whole weight of their power began to be pointed against the populace They spared the Patricians whilst their schemes a gainst those of lower rank were cruel and oppressive regarding the person not the justice of the cause inte rest with them constantly supplanting equity They advised all causes at home and only pronounced sen tence in the forum In cases of appeals the appellant was handled so roughly that he had reason to repent of his application fot a new verdict A report too began to be spread though no author was given that they had conspired among themselves not only to exercise their tyranny for the present but had entered secretly into a compact which they had confirmed by oath never to call a new election but now that they were once in possession to make their authority perpetual â CHAP 37 ROMAN HISTORY 255 CHAP XXXVII The Decemvirs introduce licentiousness J HEY then began to turn theiv eyes towards the Pa tricians to see if possibly they could discover any hope of liberty from those from whom they had before ap prehended slavery the dread of which had precipitated the commonwealth into this deplorable condition The principal senators detested the decemvirs but did not love the plebeians They were far from approving of the present proceedings but they thought the people only met with their deserts Wherefore they were in no haste to relieve those who through a blind passion for liberty had plunged themselves into slavery nor were they sorry to see their chains grow every day more heavy in hopes that a feeling of their miseries might awaken in them a desire of the re establishment of con suls and the ancient form of government The greater part of the year was already past when two tables of laws were drawn up to be added to the tenth as had been promulgated the year before and there now remained no pretext for continuing themselves in the decemvirate so that the ides of May were ex pected with the utmost anxiety and impatience when an assembly should be held for the election of consuls How the tribunitian power the bulwark of Plebeian liberty after the interruption it had met with was to be resumed was matter of great speculation to the peo ple In the mean time not a syllable was mentioned of a new election and the decemvirs who at first had been attended by the tribunes more effectually to gain the people were accompanied now by a band of young Pa tricians who appeared in their retinue as a guard and constantly surrounded their tribunals harassing and plundering the people insomuch that whatever occur red worth having became the perquisite of the strongest arm Nay they did not spare the persons of the citi zens some were whipped with rods like slaves whilst others perished by the axe like criminals and that cruelty might not go unrewarded a confiscation of estate 256 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IH immediately followed the murder of the proprietor The young nobility debauched by this sort of gain not onVy connived at these scenes of injustice but openly prefsr  oil a life of liceutiousness to public liberty CHAP XXXVIII The Sabines renew the war The Decemvirs at a loss 1 HE ides of May came and not the least appearance of any comitia fur an election of new magistrates The tyrants then who were in tact but private persons shew ed themselves bare faced and retained their authority without any other title but rapine and violence This was a manifest usurpation of regal tyranny Every one deplored in secret the loss of liberty but not oue in the whole republic had the spirit to attempt to break her chains The Roman people now seemed to have lost all courage and the nations who had submitted to their do minion began now to despise them as disdaining to be â subject to a state whose liberty subsisted no longer  The Sabines in formidable parties dispersed them selves over the Roman territories and having made a great booty in prisoners and cattle collected their scat tered forces and encamped at Ereturn placing all their hopes in the anarchy at Rome which they imagined â would be an effectual bar to the levies The news of these disasters were confirmed by the peasants who fled from the neighbourhood and spread terror through the whole city The decemvirs now de liberated upon the measures proper to be taken and whilst the hatred of the senate and people had shut every door of resource against them one storm followed close on the back of another The jEqui on the other side vere encamped at the Algidus Messengers were dis patched from Tusculum to Rome with advices that de tachments from their army were ravaging tlie Tu culan territories at the same time requesting assistance These accounts threw the decemvirs into the utmost consterna tion seeing themselves obliged amidst the dread of two wars of necessity to assemble the senate They there fore gave orders to cite the fathers to assemble in the  CHAP 38 ROMAN HISTORY 25V senate house at the same time that they well knew what a torrent of reproaches they had to encounter they were not ignorant that the ravages of the country and all the misfortunes that threatened the state would be stated to their account They foresaw that an attempt would then be made to wrest their authority from them if thev did not with united vigour oppose it and make examples of all who should presume to enter the lists against them When the voice of the herald was heard in the forum summoning the senators to meet the decemvirs in the se nate house the people were quite astonished so great a novelty was it now to consult the senate that custom having been long discontinued What can be the mat ter now said they that they revive a practice so long out of date We have our enemies and the war to thank for seeing the least vestige of our ancient li berty in the city They looked round the forum in every part for senators but few or none appeared From thence they repaired to the senate house where nothing appeared around the decemvirs but empty space which the usurpers themselves ascribed to an aversion at their government and the people to a contempt of their au thority who as private persons had no right to call a senate This they concluded was an opening for the admission of liberty provided the commons would go hand in hand with the senate and mind the summons for enrolment as little as the senators had done the pro  clamation for holding a senate Such were the private sentiments of the Plebeians There was scarce any of the senators to be seen in the forum and very few in the city Shocked at the pre sent administration they had retired into the country where since they could be of no service to the public they might look after their private affairs persuaded that the farther they were removed from the meetings and assemblies of those tyrannical monsters the more they were out of harm s way When they did not obey the citation officers were sent round to their dwelling houses to distrain their effects and to enquire whether they had absented themselves on purpose The officers reported that the senators were in the country which gave much more pleasure to the decemvirs than if they â 258 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III had been told that the fathers were in town but would not acknowledge their authority They were all order ed to be sent for and the meetmg was adjourned till the next day when it was more numerous than the decem virs themselves expected which damped the people not a little as imagining the cause of liberty abandoned by the fathers since they had submitted to the authority of those who ought to have been out of office as if they had had a legal title to compel them who but for the violence of their measures would be only private persons CHAP XXXIX The Decemvirs are told their real character IJUT it seems they showed more submission in coming to the house than they did in delivering their opinions for it is reported of Valerius Potitus that after Appiits Claudius had opened the cause of their meeting and be fore it came to his turn to give his opinion be stood up and demanded to be beard relative te the state of the Republic The decemvirs sternly ordered him to sit down and hold his peace but he declared he would go out and lay the matter before the people which raised a terrible storm M Horatius Barbatus also entered very warmly into the dispute and loudly called them  ten Tarquins the tyrants of their country at the same time reminding them in direct terms that the Valerii and Horatii were at the head of the party that expel  led the kings It was not the regal title that gave them uneasiness at that time for there could be DO harm in a title which was given to Jupiter which  Romulus their founder and his successors had enjoy ed and to this day retained in religious rites and so lemnities But it was the pride and tyranny of a king which they abhorred and if these in a sovereign or prince of the blood were intolerable where is the man that would tamely bear them in ten private persons Have a care then says he lest by restraining the liberty of speech in this house you draw not on your selves a more severe commentary without doors lean see no more impropriety in n y calling an assembly of CHAP 40 ROMAN HISTORY 259 Â the people when invested with no authority than in your convening the senate when divested of all au thority Only put it to Ike test and you will then see  to your cost whether the people s zeal in asserting their liberty or your ambition to maintain your usurp ed authority will be most strenuously exerted You talk to us of a war begun against us by the Sabines as if the Roman people had a war more formidable than with you who under the mask ot legislators have subverted all law and justice in the Republic You have suppressed the assemblies both of the senate and people you have abolished annual magistrates the right of election and governing by turns the only me thod which is consistent with liberty and though but private persons assume the ensigns and the power of despotism Upon the expulsion of the kings there were only Patrician magistrates after the secession plebeian magistrates were also created pray with which of these interests are you connected Is it with that of the people What then nave you done with their concurrence Are you in the Patrician interest And yet for very near twelve months have never convened the senate and now that you have done it pretend to debar them the privilege of speaking concerning the state of the Republic Trust not I ad vise you too much to our want of courage for wo are now convinced that our present oppression within the city is more intolerable than any thing we have t to fear without it CHAP XL  Cornelius Maluginensis vindicates the Decemvirs JT1ORATIUS haying thus expressed himself with grent vehemence while the decemvirs could neither give vent to their fury nor calmly put up with the treatment they bad met with being quite uncertain how the affair would terminate C Claudius uncle to Appius the de cemvir rose up to speak but he employed rather en treatie s than reproach conjuring his nephew by the ijtapes of his brother Appius the decemvir s father 260 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III  To consider rather the natural obligation by which he was bound to the country that gave him birth than the wicked and unjust compact he had engaged him self in with his colleagues That however much he was concerned for the state it was still more for his own sake he made him that request For he might depend on it the Republic would compel them to restore its rights should they be obstinate enough to refuse it But as great contests were generally productive of mnch ill blood he shuddered at the thoughts of what the event might be However much the tlecemvirs were determined that there should be no opinion delivered but upon the sub ject of their meeting yet they were ashamed to interrupt Claudia who therefore gave his opinion that the senate should by no means pass a decree which was declaring in plain terms thai he viewed the decemvirs in no other light bin that of private persons Many consular gen tlemen declared themselves of the same opinion There was another opinion in appearance still more harsh but in effect less conclusive viz that the Pa tricians should meet to choose an Inter rex For by this state of the vote they who held the senate were ac knowledged as magistrates but by the other which de clnred for no decree they were made privaie persons The interest of the decemvirs being now visibly on the decline Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis brother to M Cornelius the decemvir who had been reserved on pur pose to deliver his opinion the last of all the consular gentlemen stood up for his brother and his colleagues by pnrending a mighty concern for the war He was surprized he said by what fatality men who them selves hail been candidates for the decemvirate or partners in it should above all others be so keen in their opposition to the decemvirs And how it came about that during many months when all was quiet nobody made I he least objection to the justice of their title who then acted as supreme magistrates till now that the enemy is near our gates that they want to involve us in domestic broils if it be not that they imagine their real designs will be better concealed in the confusion But it was extremely proper while CIiAfe 4U ROMAN HISTORY  261 they had matters of the greatest consequence before them that considerations less weighty should be post poned till these be once discussed With respect to the charge brought against the decemvirs by Valerius and Horatius that their authority had expired on the ides of May he was of opinion that the moment the wars with which they were threatened should be brought to a conclusion and peace once more restored to the republic the senate should take the matter un der consideration whilst Appius in the mean time should be preparing for his defence being sensible he must answer for those comitia which in his first de cemvirate he had held for the election of new decem virs that the senate might judge with precision whe ther their office was to continue for one year only or till such aw as were then wanted should be com pleted At present it was his own opinion that the war was the only object they ought to have in view If they thought themselves imposed on by a false alarm both by the messengers and Tusculan deputies it was their bussiess to come at the certaisty by send  ing out scouts to make the strictest enquiry But if they saw no reason to treat with diffidence the intel ligence they had received a moment should not be lost in levying the army which the decemvirs should lead out against the enemy where they might see proper and previously to all other things this ought to be done CHAP XLI The Decemvirs carry the point for the present  J HE young Patricians supported this opinion with all their might and it passed by a plurality of voices Va lerius and Horatius then rose a second time with greater warmth than ever crying aloud  That they wanted to â speak relative to the state of the Republic declaring at the same time that if the power of faction should compel them to silence in the senate they would im mediately go out and address themselves to the peo pie That private persons had no power to shut their mouths either in the senate or an assembly of the peo 262 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK lit pie nor would they regard their imaginary fasces and pretended authority Appius now finding matters come to that pass that if he did not oppose impudence on his part to spirit on theirs there would be an end of decem viral authority you had better be silent say he than drop a sin gle word deviating from the question upon which we ask your advice When Valerius refused to he awed into silence by a mork magistrate Appius ordered a lictor to seize him Valerius then from the porch of the senate house called oat to the Romans for assistance but L Cornelius took Appius in his arms not out of re gard to Valerius as he pretended which put an end to the dispute By this interposition of Corneliu Valerius was at liberty to speak his sentiments but as this liberty extended only to words the decemvirs still gained their jiointi Moreover the consular gentlemen and elder se nators from an aversion to tribunitian power which was not yet eradicated as they saw the people more attached to it than to consular government rather wished that the decemvirs should afterwards resign their office uncom pelled than that the people from their abhorrence to decemvirs should get head again For should the go vernment without a bustle or popular commotion re turn into the hands of consuls it was not impossible but either by the intervention of wars or a mild exercise of the consular government the people might be brought to think no more of their tribunes Thus was an edict issued for levying an army with out farther interruption from the fathers and as there had been no appeal from the decemviral authority the younger citizens answered to their names After the en rolment was fmished the decemvirs concerted among themselves who should go out to the war and who should head the armies Q Fabius and Appius Claudius were at the head of the decemvirs and as there appeared more danger from the citizens at home than the enemies abroad they thought Appius from the violence of his temper was best calculated to quell any commotions that might arise in the city The disposition of Fabius prompted him rather to be active in a bad cause than steady in a good Gn r 42 ROSTA flF BISTORT  263  â   ofie For so prevalent had the influence of his col leagues in the decemvirate been on Fabius who former ly had acted with great propriety Jioth in peace and in war that he now thought it a greater honour to be thought like Appius than like his former self He had the management of the Sabine war assigned him in which commission Man Rabnleius andQ Pcutilius were joined M Cornelius was sent to the Algidus with L Miiuicius T Antonius CIESO Duilius and M Sergius Sp Oppius was appointed to assist Appius in defending the city  and for that purpose they were left equally in vested with the whole extent of decemviral authority CHAP XLH Ill conduct of the Roman armies JL HE republic suffered no less by mismanagement abroad than at home The generals were indeed no otherwise to blame than in having rendered themselves odious to the citizens for in all other respects the sol diers were totally culpable For that nothing might succeed under the direction and management of the de cemvirs they suffered themselves to be beat to their own disgrace and that of their commanders Their armies were routed by the Sabines at Eretum and by the Equi at the Algid us The army at Eretum took the opportunity of the darkness of night to make their escape to a rising ground nearer the city between Fidenae and Crustumeria where they immediately threw up entrenchment Thither the enemy pursued them but could never bring them to a battle on fair ground as they chose rather to trust to their situation and ramparts than to their valour and arms The army at the Algidus behaved still worse and in consequence received a more terrible overthrow for having lost their camp and deprived of all their military accoutrements they made the best of their way to Tus culum trusting for subsistence and protection to the fidelity and generosity of their allies in which they were by no means disappointed Rome was so alarmed withj these dreadful accounts that the senators without mind 264 tit JS LiVitrS BOOK III ing their hatred to the decemvirs passed a vote that guards should patrole the city and that all who were capable of bearing arms should be posted to guard the walls and the gales They likewise decreed that the troops at Tuscuium should be reinforced and a supply of arms sent them besides they ordered the decemvirs to leave the citadel and encamp the troops in the open plain whilst the army at Fidenae should march iuto the Sabine territories that by carrying the war into the ene my s country they might be diverted from all thoughts of attacking Rome Bi CHAP XLIII Base treatment of Siccius lESIDES these calamities inflicted by the enemy there were two very enormous actions committed by the decemvirs the one in thecamp and the other in the city In the army sent against the Sabine L Siccius instigat ed by his aversioirto the decemvirs had in private con ferences with the soldiers mentioned the expediency of creating triburres and making a secesssion for which rea son he was sent before the army by the generals to look out for a place proper for their camp The soldiers who attended him in this expedition had secret ovdt rs when ever they had got to a convenient place to fall upon Sic cius and dispatch him He sold his life dear For being strong and vigor ous he made a noble resistance and though surrounded by the assassins he defended himself with a courage equal to l is strength so that some of the ruffians lay dead around him The survivors returned to the camp where they reported that Siccius had inconsiderately fallen in to an ambuscade and that he had lost his life fighting valiantly as did also some of his party This account of the matter was ut first believed but afterwards when by permission of the decemvirs a cohort was detached to bury thttdead and finding on their arrival none of the bodies stripi Siccius lying in the middle in his ar mour all the dead with their faces towards him not an enemy among them nor any vestige of their leaving th  CHAP 44 ROMAN HISTORY 265 place they brought back his corpse affirming that Sic cius had not been killed by the enemy but by his own party The indignation of the army was inconceivable They were determined to carry the body forthwith to Rome had not the decemvirs prevented them by hasten ing to bury him at the public charge with all the ho nours of war The soldiers accompanied his funeral in tears and openly threw out the bitterest invectives against the decemvirs     â CHAP XL1V w I The villainy of Appius J HE other act of villainy originated in a criminal pas sion which was perpetrated in the city as deplorable in the event as the rape and murder of Lucretia which expel led the Tarquins both from the city and kingdom that the last blow to the power of the decemvirs might not only be similar to that of the kings but that their catas trophe might proceed from the same kind of cause Appius Claudius was struck with the charms of a ple beian beauty and thought of nothing but the means of gratifying his criminal desires Her father L Virginias held an honourable pos ia the army at the Algidus and besides was much respected as a man of integrity and courage His wife s priaciples had been strictly virtuou and his childrens education was completely so He had promised her in marriage to L Icilius who had been a tribune a man of spirit and had given proofs of his courage in the cause of the commons Deeply impressed with the exquisite beauty and the blooming graces of youth he discovered in this fair one Appiu attempted to make his way by means of presents ami fair promises But fmding that her virtue was proof against these arts he resolved to have recourse to force however cruel and insolent it might appear Thmking he never could have a better opportunity to execute his wicked purposes than when her father was absent he ordered M Claudius a creature of his own to claim her as his slave and by no means to leave her at liberty upon bail till the cause should be determined 886 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK HK This minister of the decemvir s pleasures laid bold of her as she was going into the forum where schools were kept in a kind of shops and calling her his slave as hav ing been born of one of his bond women desired her to follow binr immediately otherwise he would oblige her to do so by force The poor girl was struck with amaze ment and trembled with fear but her governess raising a great cry imploring the assistance of the people brought a great crowd about them The names of her father Virginius and of Iciiius her intended husband ware heard on all sides Regard to them brought their acquaintance to the place and the scandal of the action engaged the most indifferent in her quarrel This secured her against violence â The claim ant then cried out that there was no occasion for so much noise for force was entirely out of the question with him since the usual steps of law were open to him and im mediately cited her before the magistrate whither by the advice of those about her she followed him When they came to Appius tribunal the plaintiff opened his claim to the judge in a story with which he was previously acquainted having himself instructed him in the plan or prosecution He said that Virginia was born in his house whence she had been stolen and car ried to Virginius where she passed for his daughter This he insisted he would prove by incontestible evi dence to which were Virginius judge who had been the greatest sufferer he could have nothing to object In the mean time it was but reasonable that the girl should follow her master The counsel for the young lady pleaded that seeing Virginius was ab roail in the service of his country and might if he were advised be present within two days it was unfair in his absenee 10 raise any dispute about his children and insisted that judg ment should be suspended till Virginius should be pre sent And agreeable to the law made by Appius him self she should be allowed to continue in the possession of her freedom till a definitive sentence in the case that being a virgin arrived at maturity she might not run the risk of her honour before she had lost her liberty  CBAP 4 5 ROMAN HISTORY 2 T CHAP XLV Appim is opposed by Icilius X PPIUS previously to bis passing sentence told thenii That the law which had been cited by the friends of Virginia was a proof of his zeal for liberty but ft could only be a protection to liberty when the per sons and circumstances answer the description For with respect to those who are claimed as free though reputed slaves the plea is tenable because the law is open to every man But as far as the subject in question was in the possession of a father to him alone was the plaintiff obliged to yield the retention Wherefore he decreed That the father should be sent for and that the plainiiffs right in the mean time might not suffer he might take home the girl to his house on condition that he shall produce her in court when her reputed father shall appear Though many were shocked at the injustice of this sentence yet nobody ventured to speak out till her un cle Numitariuii and Icilius her mtended husband came into court The crowd opened to receive them imagin ing especially after Icilius appeared that Appius de cree would not be put in execution But a lictor proclaimed  That sentence was passed  and pushed back Icilius who complained loudly of the injustice done him So injurious a treatment would have provoked patience itself â You must remove me from hence Appius said he  with the sword if you would stifle the knowledge of your infamous de signs Lam to marry this young lady but I am to murry her chaste and a virgin Therefore assemble all your liotors and if you please those of your col leagues too let them have all their rods and axes ready but Icilius bride shall not stay out of her fa ther s house No though you and your colleagues hav e deprived the Romans of the protection of their tribunes and the right of appeal the two pillars of their liberty we are not yet so degenerate as to suffer our

violence be offered to ibis young lady in behalf of my bride I will implore the assistance of the Romans here assembled Virginius will implore the aid of his fellow soldiers for his only daughter in short we will beg assistance from every body and implore both gods and men You shall never put this sentence in execution till I am num bered among the dead Wherefore let me intreat you Appius to consider well what you do and to weigh the consequences When Virginius comes he will see what is the most proper step to be taken with respect to his daughter Let him only be told with a certification that if he yields to this scoundrel s claim Ihave no more to say to his daughter With respect to myself as long as I have life I will retain the courage and constancy with which a generous passion for my bride s liberty and honour justly in spire me CHAP XLVJ Appius decree A HE whole multitude were in great emotion and ready to proceed to the utmost extremities The lictors came round Icilius but they proceeded only to threat Then Appius spoke to this effect The spirit which Icilius dis covers upon this occasion is not exerted in defence of Virginia but naturally turbulent and full of the pride and violence of the tribune he makes that a pretext for exciting a tumult but for the present I am resolved to disappoint him At the same time I would have him to know that it is not on account of his insolence but of the absence of Virginius and a ten der regard to the name of father and to liberty that I will defer judgment and not put my decree in force for this day I will prevail upon Claudius to give up somewhat of his right in permitting the girl to remain in liberty till next day But should Virginius fail to appear to morrow I certify to Icilius and all such se CHAP 46 ROMAN HISTORY 269  ditious persons that they will find resolution in a de cemvir and legislator to inforce his own decrees Nor shall I have occasion for my colleague s lictors my own will be sufficient to chastise the insolence of the turbulent and seditious The time for perpetrating this act of villainy being thus put off and the counsel for the defendant retired they first of atl resolved instantly to dispatch Icilius brother ami Numitorius son two active young men to the gates to bring Virginius from the camp vith all expedition for the preservation of his daughter depend ed entirely upon his being present exactly at the ap pointed time They set out as directed and posting it all the way carried the news to Viginius In the mean time the plaintiff insisted that Icilius should give security for producing her in court Icilius told him that he was just then about it designedly spinning out the time till the messengers dispatched to Virginius had made some progress in their journey the people all around held up their hands every one otter ing eagerly to be surety for Icrlius Touched with the aftection of his fellow citizens Icilius burst into tears while he returned them thanks To morrow said he I will make use of your assistance to day we have abundance of securities Thus was Virginia set at liberty her relations having given bail to present her Appius to avoid suspicion that he had sat in judgment on account of this cause alone did not leave his tribunal directly but as no other cause was called Virginia hav ing so much engrossed the public attention that nobody applied to him he returned home and wrote to his colleague in the camp intreating  They would give no leave of absence to Virginius but on the contrary lay him under arrest This wicked advice deservedly came too late for Virginius having obtained a furlough had set out by the first watch in the night whereas the letters for detain ing him were only delivered next morning early when he was out of their reach yK TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III CHAP XLVU â The Opposition to the Decree VIRGINIUS arrived at Rome by break of day where lie was eagerly expected by the people already assem bled in the forum Virginias clad in mourning led his daughter into the forum in a tattered gown accompa nied by several matrons and many friends As he pas sed along he solicited the favour of all with an air of dignity that seemed to demand their assistance rather than to implore it He told ilium  That upon no oc casion had he been backward in exposing himself to danger when the safety of their wives and children required it nor could any man in Rome recount a greater number of great and gallant actions than him self But what did the noblest exertions signify to save the city if our tyrants exercise upon our children at home all the violence that can be dreaded in a city taken by assault  He went round the assembly ha ranguing them to this purpose and Icilius spoke to the people in much the same strain But the silent tears of the women who accompanied them spoke with more feeling than any words could express In spite of all which Appius who had steeled his heart now rather distracted with an extravagant madness than overcome with a spfter passion mounted his tribunal The plain tiff then remonstrating  That sentence ought to have passed in his favopr the day before had it not been out of complaisance to the people before he could proceed or Vfrginius make any answer Appius inter fered The preamble w ith which he opened his decree may be justly enough taken down by ancient authors but as I can find none that appears even probable con sidering the unaccountable nature of the sentence itself I shall content myself with the bare words of the decree since so much is certain He adjudged her to be a slave The injustice of this sentence surprised and confounded all present â For some time there was an universal silence But when M w ent to seige Virginia surrounded by a crowd  CHAP 48 ROMAN HISTORY 271 of matrons be was received with doleful wailings and Virginias shaking his fist in the face of Appius cried out  It was to Iciliu s not to thee Appius I promised my daughter To honourable marriage I have brought her up and not foe the brutal passion of an infamous ravisher What is the lawless and promiscuous lust of wild beasts to be introduced amongst us How the citizens here will bear this I will uot pretend to say but I hope those who are in arms will never endure it The claimant was repulsed by the crowd of wo men and friends that stood round Virginia when silence was proclaimed by a herald CHAP XLVIIt â Virginius stabs his Daughter to save her virtue J HE decemvir now intoxicated with his criminal passion told them  That he had sufficient reason to suspect from Icilius invectives yesterday and Vir ginius insolence to day whereof the Roman people had been witnesses that they only sought to excite a tumult but that was not all for he had got certain information that they had been forming cabals in the city all the night long for that purpose That there fore being apprized of the design he had not come thither without a guard Not that he meant to give V the least trouble to those who were peaceably dispos ed but to keep those in awe in virtue of his office who should dare to interrupt the peace of the city For which reason they had better make no further disturbance Go lictor pursued he  put aside the crowd and make way for themaster to seize his slave When swollen with rage he had expressed himself thus with a tone of authority the crowd gave way of their own accord leaving the poor girl standing alone a victim to lawless lust â Virginius then when he saw no appearance of relief intreated Appius in the first place  To impute it to a father s grief if he had un guardedly expressed himself unbecoming the dignity of Appius and in the second place to indulge him  with a moments conversation with the nurse in the 272 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III young woman s presence with a riew to clear up some points and if he found that he had realty been imposed on he might then depart better satisfied in his own mind He was allowed that liberty and accordingly led his daughter and her nurse aside to the booths near the temple of Cloacina now called the new booths and their snatching a butcher s knife By this the only means in my power my dear child said he I preserve thy honour and liberty and then plung ed it into her heart turning instantly full upon Appius crying out  By this innocent blood Appius L devote thy head to the infernal gods A clamour being raised on the commission of this a trocious deed the decemvir was dreadfully alarmed and immediately ordered Virginius to be seized  but he open ed a passage to himself with the knife wherever he went till by favour of the multitude he reached the gates Icilius and Numitorius lifted up her breathless body and  exposed it to the people deploring the guilt of Appius the fatal beauty of Virginia and the cruel necessity to which her father â vas reduced of taking away her life with his own hand The matrons following the corpse cried out Is it for th is purpose we bring children into the world Is this the reward of chastity â Adding a thousand other moving complaints which grief par ticularly lively and tender in their sex generally inspires them with on such occasions The men hut especially Icilius complained only that the people had been de prived of their tribunes and the right of appeal and that the grossest villanies were committed in the face of the sun GHAP XLIX Appiua authority sinking HE multitude now were in the highest ferment both on account of the enormity of the crime and the hope of recovering their liberty Sometimes Appius ordered Icilius to be cited and sometimes to be carried to jail for his obstinacy At last finding the officers could not get through the crowd he came himself attended by a    CHAP 50 ROMAN HISTORY 27 baml of young Patricians and having made way through the crowd ordered him to be carried to jail But by this time Icilius had not only a numerous populace about him but their patrons L Valerius and 3V1 Horatius at their head  who pushing away the lictor told him  If he had a legal action against Icilius they would be bail to defend him against the decemvir who was only a private person but if he dared to use force he would soon find the difference This raised a terrible tumult The decemvir s lictor fell upon Va lerius and Horatius and the mob broke his fasces Appius went up to the Rostra to harangue the people Vaterius and Horatius followed When they spoke the assembly wÂ re all attention but the decemvir could not be heard for noise Matters were carried so high by this time that Va lerius took upon him to order the lictors to be gone from Appius who being only a private person had no title to lictors Appius in the mean time terrified for the consequences and in fear of his life escaped with his head covered with his robe unknown to the opposition into a house adjoining the forum Sp Oppius from the opposite side rushed into the forum to support his col league But there he saw his authority quite overpower ed After much deliberation and urged on all sides to comply at last in much consternation he ordered the senate to be assembled This step in a great measure quieted the people in hopes that as many of the Patri cians seemed dissatisfied with the conduct of the decem virs the senate would put an end to their authority The senate were not for exasperating the people but they thought particular care should be taken to prevent the sedition which Virginius might raise in the army A CHAP L Virginius remonstrance in the camp A Secession ACCORDINGLY some young Patricians were dis patched to the camp which was then upon mount Veci tiofi to acquamt the decemvirs with the necessity of us ing every means to prevent a mutiny of the soldiers 27 TITUS LIVIUS book III But Virginius had excited a greater tumult in the camp than he had left behind him in the city For besides that the troop of almost 400 citizens who accompanied him from the city in condolence for his misfortune made his arrival more â conspicuousi the knife which he carried in his hand and the blood with which he was covered drew on him the eyes of the whole army The gowns which were observed in many different parts of the camp made the number of citizens appear greater than it really was Whilst every body asked him what had happened he continued silent for some time and answered only with tears At length recovering himself a little from that confusion which the sudden concourse had occasioned there was silence all over when he repeated every circumstance in order as it happened Then lifting up his hands to heaven and addressing himselfto his fellow soldiers beconjured them â not to ascribe to him a crime the impuiation of which was due to Appius Claudius alone nor to look upon him with abhorrence as the murderer of his own child The life of his daughter was dearer to him than his own if in preserving it she could also have preserved her liberty and her honour but seeing her just about to be dragged away as a slave to be made the victim of a decemvir s wild desires he thought it more honourable to lose his child by death than in famy It was pity and tenderness alone that showed him in a savage point of view nor would he have survived her but for the hope of revenge in the as sistance of his fellow soldiers They have also daugh ters â sisters â wives The lust of Appius had notex pired with his daughter but the more it was suffered with impunity would be still the more outrageous They ought to take warning from another s misfor tune and guard against the like injuries For his own share he had lost his wife and his daughter as she could have preserved her virtue only by the loss of her life and had suffered an unhappy but an honourable death  he had now nothing to fear from the b rutality of Appius in his own family and from any injurious  attempts against his person he knew how to deliver himself with the same spirit he had done his daughter  CHAP 50 ROMAN HISTORY flfri It was their business to take care of themselves and â  children These complaints of Virginias were followed by the acclamations of the whole multitude who assured him they would neither be wanting to avenge his grief nor to assort their own liberty The citizens too mingling in the crowd with the soldiers confirmed what they had heard from Virginius representing at the same time that to be spectators of a scene so distressing was much more affecting than the minutest relation At the same time they told them that the interest of the decemvirs was entirely suivk at Rome and that those who bad come after them brought accounts that Appius having narrowly escaped with his life had absconded Such an impression had these accounts on the soldiers that to arms was the universal cry the standards were pulled tip and thre troops took the route of Rome The decem virs terrified with what they saw and the accounts they had heard of what passed in the city run to all sides of the camp to appease the tumults If they spoke mildly they were answered with silence if they spoke with au thority the soldiers told them  that they were men and had their arms in their hands They marched to Rome in a body and posted themselves upon mount Aventine m their way exhorting all they met to re cover their liberty and to create tribunes but they used neither violence nor menaces Sp Oppius assembled the senate All violent mea sures were exploded The decemvirs themselves were the cause of the sedition Sp Tarpeius Caius lulius P Sulpicius three donstilar gentlemen were deputed to the soldiers to demand in name of the senate by whose orders they had abandoned the camp or what they pro posed to themselves by seizing the Aventine in arms What they intended by turning their backs upon the ene my and their arms against their country Their answer was ready but they wanted one qualified to deliver it Having yet appointed no chief nobody ventured to take it upon himself nor to expose himself to the danger with which it might be attended Only there was a general cry to send Valerius and Horatius to them and to them they would give their answer 278 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III CHAP LI The Secession in continuation VV HEN the deputies were withdrawn Virginius re presented 10 the soldiers  That they had juijt before been at a loss in a matter of no great difficulty only for this reason that they were a body without a head Thai they had indeed given an answer quite to the purpose but it was rather the effect of chance than the result of public deliberation That it was his own opmion they should elect ten person  whom they shoulu invest with the chief command under the mar tial title of military tribunes When they put him at the head of the list Reserve said he your gener ous intentions for me for times more favourable to us both No dignity can sit easy on me whilst my daughter is unrevenged and at this time of public embarrassment it would be imprudent to confer offices of authority upon persons most exposed to the barred of those in opposition If you think me capable of serving you my endeavours will be no less exerted in continuing a private person Ten military tribunes were accordingly created The other army employed against the Sabines soon took the hint and at the instigation of Icilius and JS umitorius threw off all allegiance to the decemvirs The murder of Siccius now appeared to them in the most glaring colours and incensed them no less than the late accounts they had received of the base attempt upon Virginia s honour Whenever Icilius heard that military tribunes were created on the Aventine hill lest the city Comitia should set a precedent in electing those who were military tribunes to be tribunes of the people especially as he was a man much versaut in popular af fairs and had an eye to the tribunitian power himself be took care before they set out for the city that the same number of military tribunes should be appointed by that army and invested with the same authority They entered the city with colours flying by the gate Collina and marched in a body through the middle of  CHAP 52 ROMAN HISTORY 277 it to the Aventine Mount There having joined the other army they gave it in charge to the twenty tribunes to chuse two of their number to the supreme command Their choice fell upon M Oppius and Sex Manilius The senators anxious for the commonwealth sat every day but the time which ought to have been employed in concerting prudent measures was wasted in strife and wrangling The decemvirs were incessantly reproached w ith the murder of Sicinius the lust of Appius and the miscarriages in the war They resolved however to send Valerius and Horatius to the Mount Aventine but they refused to undertake the embassy till the decem virs should divest themselves of the ensigns of their au thority which they ought to have done twelve months ago The decemvirs complained that they were to be reduced by force to the condition of private persons declaring they would not lay down their authority be fore jhe laws were passed for enacting which they had been created which was the only term fixed for the ex piration of their magistracy CHAP LII The Decemvirs are prevailed on to lay down their authority  HE people having got intelligence by means of M Duilius who had been a tribune that the senate had come to no decisive resolution owing to their constant wranglings they left the Aventine and retired to the sacred Mount Duilius assuring them that the fathers would never think seriously of the matter till they should see the city totally deserted But the Mons Sacer will remind them ol the steady resolution of the commons  and convince them that unless the tribunes be restor ed they will find a re union impracticable Marching therefore by the Nomantine way then called Ficulensis they encamped on the sacred Mount observing the same good discipline for which their an cestors had been so much admired Thither they were accompanied by the people none staying behind whose age would permit him to go Their wives and children came after them asking them mournfully to whose care N  2 Â TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III they had consigned them in a city where neither the honour of women nor public liberty was sate Rome saw herself now changed into a frightful soli tude and not a creature to be seen in the forum but such as were worn out with years When the fathers after they were assembled in senate observed nobody in the forum several besides Valerius and Horatius boldly remonstrated to this effect  What is it you wait for venerable fathers II the decemvirs will persist in their obstinacy will you suffer all to go to perdition And pray Messieurs Decemvirs what is that sovereignty of which you are so tenacious â a sovereignty over empty houses and bare walls Do not you blush to see that all the citizens in the forum scarce equal the number of your lictors Should the enemy come to attack us what could you dor Should the people see ing us so unconcerned about their removal advance hither in arms against you what would be the conse quence  Are you determined to make the period of your authority of the same date with the ruin of the republic Is it not evident that you must either have no people or they must have tribunes We shall sooner give up our Patrician magistrates than they their Plebeian They extorted from our fathers that Plebeian magistracy of which at that time they had not experienced the benefit and it is not very probable now that they have tasted the sweets of it they will ever consent to part with it especially as your government has been such as to make them feel the want of protection Discourses of this kind saluting the ears of the decem virs from all sides they were overcome by so unanimous a concurrence and declared that since it must be so they should be wholly governed by the senate But there was one thing they begged leave to request xwhich was not unworthy of attention that they might not be exposed as victims to the rage of their enemies for it concerned them nearly not to accustom the people in the punishment of the decemvirs to dip their hands in the blood of the Patricians â CHAP 53    ROMAN HISTORY 279 CHAP LIH A coalition of the two Orders V ALERIUS and Horatius were then deputed with full powers to conclude a treaty of pacification with the people and it was recommended to them to take pro per precautions that the decemvirs might not suffer from the rage and violence of the populace As they were approachmg they were met and ushered into the camp with universal joy as the deliverers of their country by their exertions in this affair both in setting it on foot and bringing it to a happy conclusion For all which they had public thanks returned them Icilius spoke for the multitude When they came to an explanation the deputies desiring to be informed with respect to the people s demands Icilius s answer which had been concerted before their arrival plainly evinced that the people founded their pretensions more in equity than in the arms which they had in their hands They insisted on the re establishment of tri bunes and the right of appeal which had been the pil lars of their liberty before the creation of the decemvirs together with an amnesty for all those who had been concerned in advising the revolt and the secession On ly they insisted to have the decemvirs punished with great severity making it a point that the decemvirs should be delivered into their hands and they threaten ed to burn them alive The deputies replied  Your claim gentlemen which we suppose has the general approbation is so fair and equitable that we come prepared to grant it of our own accord For it only tends to protect your liberty and not to promote licentiousness to the pre judice of others Your resentment against the decem virs we must rather pardon than comply with From an abhorrence of cruelty you want to give an example of it in your own conduct and are for lording it over others before you have made sure of your own free dom Shall this city never see an end of our eitmity and declared war between the senate and people  280 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III You have more occasion for the shield  than the sward He is brought low enough who degraded from his authority must live on a level with others without the power of committing or the trouble of re senting injuries If at any time you would wish to appear formidable it must be when you have re covered your magistrates and your laws when you will have the power in your own hands and our lives and fortunes at your disposal Then and not tilt then can you determine the fate of any one For the pre sent be satisfied with the recovery of your liberty CHAP LIV Restoration o the Consulate and tribunitian power A HE whole assembly having unanimously submitted their pretensions to the deputies they promised to return soon with the ratification of their demands When on their return they laid the people s claims before the senators the rest of the decemvirs beyond all expecta tion finding no mention made of punishing them ob jected to nothing but Appius the most cruel and odi ous wretch of the whole measuring the people s hatred of him by his to them said I am not ignorant of the fate that awaits me I see ihat we are only reserved for a greater condemnation when our enemies have got arms in their hands Nothing but blood will sa tisfy their malice I am ready nevertheless to divest myself of the decemvirate and the sooner the bet ter The senate passed a decree  That the decemvirs should instantly depose themselves that the high priest Q  Funus should create tribunes of the people and that none should be liable to prosecution upon account of the desertion of the soldiers or re moval of the people to Mount Aventine These matters being fmished and the seuate broke up the decemvirs repaired to the forum and in the assem bly of the people abdicated their office to the great joy of the citizens The news was immediately carried to the camp by the deputies who had all the people that were left in  CHAP 54 ROMAN HISTORY 281 the city in their retinue Another pa t of the people went out from the camp to meet them They congra tulated each other upon the recovery of peace and li berty Then the deputies having called an assembly delivered themselves to this purpose Return soldiers to your country your household gods your wives and children and may your return be attended with all the prosperity success and felicity to yourselves and the republic which your hearts can desire Return however with the same moderation to the city you have hitherto observed when so great a multitude in a necessity so urgent and so general have not in jured a single field March back to the Aventine whence you came There in that place of happy augury where you laid the first foundation of your â liberty create tribunes of the people The high priest will be there to preside in your assembly The joy upon this occasion was general and exces sive and expressedjn the loudest acclamations Imme diately the army snatched up their ensigns and march ed to Rome congratulating all they met and receiving their congratulations They passed through the city with profound silence and halted upon Mount Aventine where the high priest immediately holding the assembly they elected their tribunes A Virginius was first nam ed then L Icilius and P Numitorius Virginia s uncle as the chief promoters of the secession After them C Sicinius a descendant of that Sicinius who is said to have been created the first tribune upon the sacred  Mount and M Dnilius who had distinguished himself in the office of tribune before the institution of the de eemvirate and ever after had stood firm against them in the interest of the people five others were chosen M Titinius M Pomponius C Apronius P Villius C Oppius more in expectation of future than for past services I As soon as they entered upon office on a motion of Icilius they enacted that no person should be prose cuted for separating from the decemvirs Duilius at the same time passed a bill for the election of consuls with ti e right of appeal to the people All these things were   282  TJTUS LIVIUS BOOK III transacted in an assembly of the people in the Flami nian meadows now the Flaminian circus y V  CHAP LV    Popular laws introduced by the new consuls LUCIUS VALERIUS and M Horatio were theo elected consuls by an inter rex and immediately en â tered upon the duties of their office The popular ad ministration of these consuls though it did no hurt gave no small offence to the Patricians who considered every precaution which was taken to secure the liberty of the people as a derogation of their prerogative In the first place wherea s it was a disputable point in law whether the senators were amenable to the decrees of the Commons the consuls now passed a law in the co reitia by centuries ordaining that whatever the com ijions should enact in ithe comitia by tribes should be Vmdiug on the whole body of the people by which law the bills of the tribunes were armed with a very dan gerous weapon After this thev revived the other con sular law concerning the right of appeal the chief pillar of their liberty which had been overturned by the de cemvirs but for the time coming gave it new force by an appendix  Prohibiting the future creation of any magistrate from whom there should be no appeal and whoever should attempt it might be put to death with impunity or even a prosecution on that account The people being thus sufficiently secured by the right of appeal on the one hand and the protection ef their tribunes on the other that the persons of the tribunes might be sacred and inviolable they revived some ani cient ceremonies now almost forgot And that they might not only have religion for their defence but an expiess law in their favour they enacted  That who ever should maltreat the tribunes of the people Ediles and judges or decemvirs his head should be devoted to Jupiter and his family exposed to sale at the tem pie of Ceres Liber and Libera The lawyers con tend that by this law no man s person is rendered sa cred but that the man who does any of them a manifest  CHAP 56 ROMAN HISTORY 283 injury is liable to the pains of law For which reason an Edile may be arrested and imprisoned by a superior magistrate which though not expressly warranted by law for it is hurting a man who by this law is secured  yet it is an argument against it that the person of an jEdile is not sacred They likewise maintain that the tribunes were declared sacred by an oath of the people at the first institution of their office It is also asserted by some that the consols and the praetors also chosen tmder the same auspices with thenv have the privilege of this law as the consul comes under the denomination of a judge But as the praetors at that time not the consuls were considered as judges this explanation of the law is madmissible The same consuls also ordained that the decrees of the senate which before that the consuls could suppress or alter should for the future be deposited in the temple of Ceres and kept by the Ediles Duilius then brought in a bill which the people passed into a law  That whoever should deprive the people of their tribunes or create a magistrate without appeal should be scour ged with rods and lose his head Though the Patri cians opposed none of these laws as none of them had been personally injured yet they did not receive them without regret CHAP LVI Appim brought to his trial by Virginius 1 HE authority of the tribunes and the liberties of the people being thus established they thought it was high time now to call the decemvirs to account but not by the lump only one by one in consequence of which Virginius was pitched on as the first prosecutor and Appius in course was the defendant When the day or Appius s trial was come he stept into the forum escorted by a band of young Patricians which gave every one a retrospect of those melancholy days when the same Patricians like so many guards made up his train Virginius then addressed himself to the people to the  28 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III following effect Speeches are only necessary to sup port causes that are doubtful I shall not therefore take up your time in enumerating the crimes of a man whose cruelty laid you under the necessity of taking up arms to rescue yourselves from it nor will 1 give him leave to aggravate his crimes by the impudence of defending them I shall not therefore Appius Claudius touch upon your flagitious practices for the whole space of two years There is one crime only to which I shall confme my charge and of which if  you do not instantly clear yourself I order you to be led to prison Why did you contrary to law refuse a person whose liberty was brought into dispute the possession of that liberty till the trial was over  Appius had no hope of assistance from the tribunes noi from the voices of the people nevertheless he cal led upon the tribunes and finding none of them inter posing when the officer laid hold of him to drag him awav he called out  appeal That word the pillar of popular liberty from a man who had so lately violated ine laws of liberty caused an universal silence The v uiloquy of every one was â It is plain there are gods who make human affairs their care The punishment of cruelty and pride is slow but severe Is the man who abolished all appeals now reduced to have re course to them and to implore the protection of that  very people of whose rights he was the subverter â Is the unjust judge who gave up a free person to sla very now himself abandoned to chains and prison without the least sOpport from his privilege of liberty Amidst the murmurs of the people Appius was heard imploring their protection He enumerated the great services his ancestors had done to the state both in peace and in war He deplored his unhappy zeal for the interests of the people which had induced him tore nounce the consulship to establish an equal right a mong all the citizens by a scheme of new laws though by that mean s he had drawn the displeasure of the whole senate upon him and though the laws ihem selves he had lately instituted were still in force their  author was now to be dragged to prison With reâ spect to other matters he would render an account of  CHAP 57 ROMAN HISTORY  285 his conduct when leave should be granted him of making a legal defence and in the present case he only wanted permission as a citizen of Rome to make his defence and to have the judgment of the Roman people For he was not so much afraid of all that malice could lay to his charge as to despair of the equity and clemency of his fellow citizens If he was led to jail without the privilege of making his defence he would again appeal to the tribunes and would advise them not to follow the example of those they hated That if the tribunes confessed they had con certed among themselves to abolish the right of appeal from them he would appeal to the people and implore the protection of the laws just made by joint consent of consuls and tribunes to confirm that privilege What citizen of any rank can find his account in these laws if Appius Claudius cannot Your conduct with regard to me will really evince whether the right of appeal be only an empty name or whether oppression will find relief in them against the cabals and injustice of magistrates CHAP LYH Appius imprisoned War with the jEqui and Vbtscil War with the Sabines V IRGINIUS in return said That Appius Claudius of all mankind had nothing to do with laws or any social compact nor ought he to derive any benefit from them Only look at yonder tribunal where this perpetual decemvir the declared enemy of the lives fortunes and liberties of the citizens threatening all with rods and axes regardless of gods and men and always surrounded with hangmen instead oflictors passing from rapines and murders to brutal lust de livered up to his infamous pander in the presence of the Roman people a maid of free condition tearing her from the arms of her father like a slave who had become the perquisite of the conqueror where by a cruel sentence founded on the most flagrant injustice armed the hand of the unhappy father against the life  286 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III  of his child Nay when her uncle and intended husband were taking up the body of the expirmg vir gin he ordered them both to prison being much more affected for the loss of his game than the tragical scene before him And he saw no reason why the prison which he had built an d insolently called the Habitation of the commons of Roaie should not also be a mansion house for himself Where he might appeal as often as he pleased and so offen would he impeach him on this single article that tie had unjustly con denmed a person free born and in free condition to sla very And if lie does not instantly plead I order him to jail as a criminal condemned He was therefore conducted to prison  and though no body opposed his commitment yet it made a very strong impression upon the minds of the populace who thought that the rigorous treatment of so great a man was an ex cessive stretch of tribunitian power The tribune ap pointed him a day for making his defence In the mean time ambassadors arrived from the La tins and Hernici to congratulate Rome on the reconcN 1iation between the two orders of the state on account of which they lodged in the capito a crown of gold as a present to Jupiter the best and greatest Their finances did not permit them to go far as to the weight but the ceremonies of religion were more regarded in those days for their piety than their pomp They likewise brought advices that the JEqui and Volsci were making mighty preparations for war upon which the consuls were or dered to share the provinces between them It fell to Horatius to march against the Sabines and to Valerius to march against the confederate forces of the 5Lqui and Volsci When they were making the enrolments for these services such respect did the people pay to there patriot consuls that not only the vouth but those who had served the legal time were ready to give in their names and most of them too as volunteers by which means the army was not only increased but rendered much more formidable by the mixture ot those veterans among the new raised recruits Before they left the city the two last of the twelve tables of laws were engraven on  CHAP 58 ROMAN HISTORY â 287 brass and hung np in the forum According to some historians it was the ffidiles who at the instance of the tribunes performed that office CHAP LV1II Application in favour of Appius fruitless â Oppius also tried and both die in prison The rest of the Decemvirs banished C AIUS CLAUDIUS having always disliked the prin ciples of the Decemvirs and particularly detested the pride and insolence of his nephew had withdrawn to Kegillum his native country j but though he was now very old he returned to Rome to assist him with all his credit at this dangerous conjuncture however much he had been a declared enemy of his vices and for that purpose appeared in the forum in a mourning habit at tended by his whole family and a great number of clients soliciting the favour of every one he met conjuring them  not to entail on the Claudian family a disgrace which would cause them to be considered by posterity as citizens that merited chains and prisons â iSot to snFr fer a man whose memory posterity ought to revere as the legislator of Rome and the founder of their civil rights to lie in a dungeon with thieves and robbers but rather to suffer their just indignation to give wcy  to the more natural feelings of compassion which arise from reflection and rather forgive one of the Claudii for the sake of so many of the name as interceded for him than out of hatred to one to reject the prayers of so many â At the same time he begged leave to as sure them that this solicitation on his own part was not the result ofâ a reconciliation with or partiality for the delinquent but merely on account of his re lation and honour of the Claudian name and as they had now recovered their liberty by their bravery they should also strengthen the union between the two or ders of the state by their clemency Many who had no regard for Appius were affected with the intreaties of this venerable old man but Vir ginius on the other hand  begged them rather to hav  288 TITUS UVIUS BOOK III compassion on him and his daughter and to have re gard to the prayers  not of the Claudian family which had exercised a cruel tyranny over them but of Vir ginia s relations and three tribunes who being created for the protection of the people were now imploring their aid and protection These tears prevailed Appius in consequence having Iost all hopes put an end to his own life before the day appointed for his trial arrived Sp Oppins who after Appius was of all the decemvirs most detesied was pro secuted soon after at the instance of Numitorius as an accomplice of Appius in the affair of Virginia because he was in the city when that infamous judgment was passed But a crime charged personally against himself cat deeper in his condemnation than his conniving at Appius s baseness A witness was produced who had served twenty seven years and had been eight times ho noured with military rewards which he had with him â Stripping off his robe he exposed his shoulders which had been torn with rods by the decemvirs lictors offering to submit himself to the same treatment again if Oppius could assign any good reason for his cruelty Oppius was also sent to prison and before the day of his trial he was no more The estates of both were confiscated by the tribunes The rest of the decemvirs were banished and their estates confiscated Claudius who hail claimed Virginia was condemned on the day appointed for bis trial but Virginius remitted his execution and convert ed the sentence into banishment when he retired to Ti bur â Thus the manes of Virginia more happy after her death than in her life having wandered through so many houses in pursuit of just vengeance were at length ap peased by the punishment of ull the guilty CHAP LIX Seasonable interposition of Duillus The Fathers dissatis fied with the popularity of the consuls l HE senators were now under no small apprehensions seeing the tribunes had become as sanguinary as the de cemvirs had been before when Duilius who was orre  CHAP 60 ROMAN HISTORY 289 of their tribunes gave a very seasonable check to the immoderate stretch of power  declaring that enough had been done both for the security of their liberties and the punishment of their enemies and therefore he wouM sutler no person to be cited to a trial nor committed to prison during the remainder of the year With respect to the past to revive the remembrance of old faults which ought to be buried in oblivion now that the decemvirs in their punishment had expiated new ones would be highly improper With respect to the future the steady and unanimous zeal of both consuls in guarding the liberty of the people would be sufficient security that nothing will happen to require the interposition of the tribunes This moderation of the tribunes served in the first place to dispel the fears of the senators but on the other hand increased their aversion to the consuls who had declared so openly and so entirely for the people that a Plebeian magistrate should see cause to take upon him the interest and safety of the senate before a Patrician and that their enemies had been satisfied with revenge before the consuls took any measure for opposing their licentiousness Many blamed their own negligence and facility in giving their sanction to the laws passed by those consuls in favour of the people and it was suffi ciently obvious that nothing but the distracted state of the Republic had obliged them to comply with the times CHAP LX  An action with the JEqui and Volsci X HE domestic troubles being thus settled and the li berty of the people firmly established the consuls went each into his respective province Valerius by a master ly stroke of policy supported the war against the 55qui and Volsci whose armies were joined at the Aigidus Had he immediately risked a battle it is hard to say considering how the courage of the parties stood aflect ed after what happened when the decemvirs command ed whether it would not have been of dangerous con sequence He kept the army close within their lines 290 TITUS LIVRTS   BOOK IR which he had formed at the distance of a mile from the enemy The vacant space between the camps served the enemy for ranging themselves in order of battle When the enemy advanced to bid them defiance they were answered with silence At length the JEqoi and Volsci wearied with standing under arms and expecting battle to no purpose thought the victory was fairly given up to them and accordingly sent out detachments of their troops to ravage the country of the Latins and Her nici In consequence of which the few that remained might rather be considered as a guard to the camp than a force sufficient for a general engagement The consul perceiving their weakness gave them the alarm i n his turn and his trcfops being drawn up in or der of battle challenged them to come out Conscious of their inferiority they did not accept which inspired the Romans immediately with ap extraordinary degree of courage concluding their enemies now trembling within their camp already in their power They con tinued the rest of the day under arms but night obliged them to retire full of hopes to rest and refresh them selves Very different was the situation of the enemy s spirits Expresses were posted away in all haste to recal those who had been dispersed to plunder The parties at no great distance returned but they who had made a greater excursion were not found Early next morning the Roman army marched out of their camp in order to attack the enemies lines should they decline coming to battle and when the day was far spent and no ap pearance of the enemy s stirring the consul gave the signal for the attack Seeing the Roman army in mo tion the jEqui and Volsci ashamed that victorious as they had been they should now defend themselves ra ther by their works than their swords they applied to their generals and with much importunity obtained the signal When some of their battalions had already njarched out at the gates of the camp and others foUowed in pro per order each man in his rank the consul advanced against them before they could be supported by the v hole army Wherefore charging them before all the   H ROMAN HISTORY 291 troops were marched out and had time to form them selves and to intimidate them the more raising a great shout they appeared before the Roman consul like an unweildy mob assembled without design and looking at one another At first they gave way but being re proached by their generals for losing ground before ene mies they had beat they resumed their courage and re newed the fight CHAP LXI Victory over the 3Lqui and Volsci  JL HE consul on the other hand put the Romans in mind  That this was the first opportunity since they became free that fortune had given them of distin guishing themselves for a free country â That they would now conquer for themselves and not for decem virs â That Appius was no longer their commander but Valerius the consul who being descended of pa triots had himself established the liberty of the peo ple â That they should now demonstrate it was not owing to the soldiers but to the generals that in for mer battles they had not been victorious To have it aid that they had signalized themselves more against iheir fellow citizens than now against the ene my and that they were more afraid of slavery in Rome than in the field of battle would be infamous to the last degree That Virginia was only one indi vidu il whose chastity was in danger in time of peace  and in the criminal passion of Appius alone this dan ger totally centered But were the fortune of war to declare against them the danger from so many thou sand enemies would not even be confined to them selves but descend to their posterity But he would not di aw conclusions from events which he hoped Jupiter and their father Mars would never suffer to  befal a city founded wii it such glorious prospects Then putting them in mind of the Aventine and sacred Mounts he told them  That as but a few months  before they had there regained their liberty hither Â it became them to carry back their power 292 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III ed It was their business now to evidence that Ro man bravery had neither expired with the institution nor abolition of the decemvirate and that the laws which established an equality among the citizens had not diminished their valour Having thus harangued the foot amidst their ensigns he turns to the horse addressing them to this effect Come on my brave fellows you are now to vie with the foot in support of your honour and superior rank To the bravery of the foot the enemy gave way at the first charge Ho you complete the disorder by giving the reigns to the horses and drive them out of the field of battle They will not stand your attack  See â they are too much at a stand even to act on the defensive Now they put spurs o their horses and furiously charged the enemy already put in confu sion by the foot and having broke through their ranks penetrated even to their rear Sonie of them rid ing round the open space blocked up every passage to the ene my s camp and as they were flying on all sides rode up to intercept them The foot with the consul at their head and in short the best part of the army turned upon the camp where many of the enemy fell whilst the Ro mans remained masters of their camp and a considerable booty The news of this victory was SoO11 carried to Rome and the other army that acted against the Sabines In the city it was solemnized with great rejoicings and in the camp it excited the greatest emulation Horatius by skirmishing and slight engagements had accustomed his troops to confide rather in their present valour than to remember their past defeat under the decemvirs and these little encounters had made them confident of vic tory whenever they should come to a general engage ment Nor did the Sabines encouraged by the successes of the former year fail incessantly to provoke them asking them reproachfully  What they meant by wasting the time in petty depredations like a banditti and thus spinning out a war in skirmishes with straggling par ties which might be determined in one decfsive ac  CHAP 02 ROMAN HISTORY 293 â tion Why were they afraid of a general battle which would at cuice decide the controversy CHAP LXII Battle with the Sabines l HE Romans had by this time sufficiently recovered their coprage and they were now fired with indignation What said they shall the other army return with lau rels to the city whilst we are perpetually abused and in sulted by the enemy If ever we shall be a match for our enemies â it is now The consul perceiving these murmurings of the soldiers in the camp he called an as sembly and addressed them to the following effect  1 suppose soldiers you have heard of the battle at the Algidus where the behaviour of the army has been such as became the sons of liberty The mas terly conduct of my colleague and the noble exertions of the troops under his command have obtained a complete victory With respect to me I shall take such measures and pursue such plan of operation as shall appear most agreeable to you We have it in our power to protract the war with advantage or to finish it immediately If the war must be protracted I will follow the same plan 1 adopted in the begin ning for increasing youi hopes and confirming your valour If you think that sufficiently done already as a sign of your inclination and bravery raise such a shout as you would do were you instantly to make Â an attack The soldiers with great cheerfulness set up a terrible shout when he assured them He would comply with their wishes and lead them to battle next day which he prayed miglit be auspicious They spent the rest of that day in preparing their arms Next morning the Sabines  who were no less eager to engage the moment they perceived the Roman army drawn up in order of battle marched out likewise The exertions on both sides were such as might be expected of two armies con fident of victory the one animated with theirancientand perpetual glory and the othtr flushed with their recent  29 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK III victory The Sabines however were not so confident of their strength as to exclude stratagem For in drawing up in battalia they reserved two thousand men without their ranks who were to charge the left wing ofÂ the Romans in the heat of action This corps de reserve charging furiously in flank had almost sur rounded the left wing when two squadrons of Roman cavalry consisting of about six hundred dismountmg flew toi the van to support those who seemed already to be giving way and boldly charging the enemy they not only shared the danger in common with the foot but inspired them with ardour through a sense of shame They blushed to see the cavalry doing double duty and behaving more gallantly when dismounted than they themselves had done CHAP LXIII Tlie Sabines beat The Consuls voted a triumph by the people LJ PON this they rallied and returned to the post they had abandoned when the battle was not only renewed but the opposite wing of the Sabincs gave way The horse covered by the foot remounted and galloping to the other wing of the army informed them of the vic tory at the same time charging the enemy who were not a little confounded to find that the flower of their army was broke Thus the Roman horse distinguished themselves by prodigies of valour The consul was all alertness he neglected nothing The brave he com mended  those whose ardour seemed less conspicuous he reprimanded which had a proper effect for they did not fail to redouble their effort a sense of shame operating on the one as much as commendations did on the other Now loud huzzas were raised and charging on all sides in close battalia the enemy who were no longer able to stand the impetuous ardour of the Romans were put to flight The Sabines thus routed and scattered through the fields left their camp a prey to the enemy where the Romans found not only the spoils which had beep tnteo  CHAPJ 63 ROMAN HISTORY 295 from their allies as in the camp at the Algidus but the booty which had been taken from themselves in ravag ing their own lands For both these victories gained over diffefeiHeneroieSj the senate out of a grudge to the consuls decreed only one day of supplication and public thanksgiving but the people by their own authority acquitted thejnselves of the same duty the day following with more pomp and solemnity and with a much greater concourse of people than the day before The consuls by concert came to Rome the one on the first the othef on the se cond of these days and assembled the senate in the Cam pus Martius where they were rendering an account of the success of the campaign The principal senators complained that they were assembled in the midst of the soldiers on purpose to over awe them and the consuls to save reflections adjourned it to the Flaminian Mea dows where a temple of Apollo now stands aml at that time called the Circus Apollinaris Here they were re fused a triumph by almost the unanimous voice of tin senate upon which L Icilius the tribune carried it be fore the people Many of the senators appeared on the side of opposition but none more warmly than C Clau iiios who exclaimed against it to the following purpose It is not over the enemy but overthe senate that the consuls would triumph  it is for a gratification of some signal service done the tribune and not an honourable reward of their bravery that they sue for To submit the merit of a triumph to the judgment of the people had no precedent as that had always been a preroga tive of the senate alone The privileges of that high order had never been abridged even by their kings Why then should the tribunes pretend to engross all power to themselves even to the excluding a council of state In short the state will never be at peace nov enjoy liberty till the two orders forbear to encroach upon the rights and privileges of each other Many more of the old senators spoke to the same effect but the tribunes unanimously agreed to the motion This was the first triumph voted by the people without a of the senate 896  TITUS LIVICS BOOK III CHAP LXIV Aoo elections Candour of Duilius J HIS victory of the people and their tribunes had almost been productive or very serious consequences owing to a combination amongst the latter to get them selves re elected for the ensuing year and to keep their ambition in countenance to continue the same consuls in office for another year In support of this scheme they pretended that the senate had engaged in a plot out of pique to the consuls to destroy the rights of the people For what would be the consequence should the con suls before the laws were firmly established by their factions make an aitempt on the new tribunes For they were not always to have consuls of the same dis position with Valerius and Horatius who preferred the liberty of the people to their own emolument It happened fortunately to fall to Duilius lot to pre side at that election He was a man of sense who fore seeing the mischievous consequences that the proposed continuation would produce declared openly that he would make no account of votes in favour of any of his colleagues He was warmly opposed his colleagues contending that he ought either to leave the assembly free or give up his presidentship to one of the college who would make the law and not the pleasure of the senators his rule He begged of the consuls to favour him with their presence at his tribunal and asked them what they intended to do at the next Comitia for elect ing consuls Their answer was that they would create new ones The president fmding that these magistrates popular in other respects but no friends to this scheme advanced with them into the assembly and introducing them to the people then begged they would declare what they would do if the Roman people from a prin ciple of gratitude for the generous part they had acted in recovering the public liberty and mindful of their other services both at home and abroad should re elect  them to the consulship They expressed the same in tention as before Duilius then praised them highly for  qpp 65 I OMAN HISTORY 297 their disinterestedness in having shown themselves to thÂ last the very reverse of the decemvirs and then pro ceeded to the election Afier five new tribunes had been chosen the president perceiving that the other candidates would not be able to engage a majority in their favour because of the busy opposition of his nine colleagues dismissed the as sembly without appointing another day to complete the election alledging that he had satisfied the lave which no where required that the whole number of tribunes should be chosen at once provided room was left for completing the number to those who had been chosen he gave authority to name their colleagues Then he read a copy of the act which runs thus  If I file a bill for the election often tribunes of the people and the whole number should not be chosen on the day of election those nominated shall themselves fill up the v acant places and the persons so chosen shatl be deemed tribunes as legally elected as themselves Thus Duilius continuing steady to the last in maintain ing that the republic could not have fifteen tribunes defeated the ambitious views of his colleagues and laid down his office equally dear to senate and people CHAP LXV JJomestic broils Depredations of the jEqui and Volsci JL HE new tribunes in the choice of their colleagues paid great respect to the recommendation of the senate they even chose two Patricians Sp Tarpeius and A  Haterius who had been consuls The fasces were now transferred to L Hermonius and T Virginius Ccelio moiuanu who being no great zealots in the cause of ei ther party their government was entirely pacific L Treboirus one of the tribunes being much dissa tisfied with the Patricians alledging they had over reach ed him in the co optation of the tribunes when at the same time he had been betrayed by his colleagues pro  An election of tribunes by the college was said to be made by co optation 298 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK 111 posed a bill importing  That whoever should here after hold the Comitia for electing tribes should not dissolve the assembly till the number of ten tribunes be completed by the votes of the tribunes He passed his whole year in crossing the senate which procured him the title of crabbed Then M Geganius Macerinus and C Julius succeed ed to the consulate They quelled the cabals of the tri bufies which they were beginning to form against the young Patricians without inveighing against the excess of their power or sinking below the dignity of their or der They kept the people quiet by decreeing levies for the war against the jEqui and Volsci which prevent ed any sedition from taking place assuring them that the only way to secure peace abroad was to be quiet at home for nothing contributed so much to raise the spirits of foreign nations as domestic broils Thus by their care to secure peace abroad they had the good fortune to maintain tranquillity at home though the one order never failed to take the advantage of the moderation of the other When the young Patricians began to be petulant the people were giving no trouble When the tribunes began to support the weakest they were little regarded at first and at last did not them selves escape without insults especially about the close of the year when during the meetings of the nobility licentiousness prevails and the exercise of magisterial authority generally becomes more languid The people s whole hopes centered in choosing tribunes like Iciiius for during the two last years their tribunes were no more than a name The elder senators on their part were not insensible that their youth were turbu lent ami carried things too far but if the bounds of mo deration were to be exceeded they thought it better to have pride and spirit on their side than on that of the opposition So difficult is it to act with moderation in supporting liberty as every one under pretence of level ling raises himself in proportion as he depresses another While we endeavour to have nothingfb apprehend from others we render ourselves terrible to avoid oppression we oppress as if we could not help doing or suffering injustice  CHAP 67 ROMAN HISTORY 299 Titus Quinctius Capitblinus a fourth time and Agrip pa Furius weie then made consuls who found no sedi tion at home nor war abroad but Rome was threaten ed with both The torrent of discord could be no long er stemmed the tribunes and people being so much ex asperated against the senate that the assemblies resound ed every day with accusations agamst some one or other of that order On the first rumour of these domestic broils the 2E ym and Volsci as if they had been the signal of war took arms Their chiefs prompted by the love of plunder persuaded them  That the people had thrown off all authority and that the levies could noteven now be made which had been appointed two  years before That it was for this very reason an army had not been sent against them the vigour of their discipline had now degenerated into licentiousness and Rome was no longer considered as the native country common to both orders and the resentment and re venge they formerly practised against other nations they now turned against one another Now now was the time to extirpate these wolves whilst they were tearing one another Having joined their forces the first ravaged the coun try of the Latins and meeting with no resistance ani mated by the authors of the war who were exulting with joy they advanced to the very walls of Rome plunder ing the country on the side next the Esquiline gate and laying waste all before them m the face of the city by way of insult  Then driving off their booty with impunity they returned to Corbio in good order when Qninctius called an assembly of the people where he spoke to the following effect CHAP LXVII Speech of Qninctitts T  HOUGH I can charge myself O Romans with no  crime by me committed it is with the utmost shame and confusion that I

speech J EVER were the commons better pleased with the embellishments of a sweet lipped tribune than they were with the severe commentary of this generous consul The youth whose refusal iu contests of this kind was a powerful resource against the endeavours of the se nate breathed nothing but arms and war The sight of the farmers who had fled to the city for refuge many of them despoiled o their lands and their wounds still bleeding whilst they p inted scenes of distress still more affecting filled all the citizens with a just desire of revenge When Quinctius entered the senate the eyes of all were fixed on him admiring him as the only asserter of the majesty of the Roman name The principal se nators observed  That his speech did honour to the office he filled to the former consulships he had held  and in fine to his whole life illustrious by the most glorious offices of the state which he frequently had bore and more frequently deserved That other con 304 TITUS LIVIUS â BOOK III â suls by betraying the dignity of their order had made their court to the peopte or had made them â still more obdurate and untractable by supporting the rights of the senate with too much haughtiness and austerity But that Titus Quinctius had adapted his discourse to the times and without losing sight of the  dignity of the senate had constantly kept iu view the union and reconciliation of parties They unani mously requested him and his colleague to provide â for the safety of the state at the same time recom  mending to the tribunes to act in concert with the  consuls for driving the enemy from the gates and walls of the city and to engage the people to act with â cheerfulness and submission in every thing ordered by the senate in so dangerous a conjuncture That it was the genius of Rome that upon this extraordi  nary occasion implored the aid of the tribunes wben  their lands were laid waste and the city in danger of being taken The levies were decreed without a dissenting voice and made without opposition Then the consuls addres sed themselves to the multitude in substance as follows At present their time was too sacred for examining the excuses of those who had not given in their names The youth must all be ready by day break to morrow in the Campus Martins At the conclusion of the war they would then enquire into these matters and treat all as deserters whose excuse should be found un tenable Next day the youth assembled accordingly when each cohort chose its own centurions and hail two se nators placed at the h e d of it All this we find done with such expedition that the ensigns were readv and brought from the arsenal by the ijusestors and the troops fairly oa their march by the fourth hour of ihc day This new army joined with a few veteran cohorts who followed air volunteers halted after a march often miles from Rome The next day they came iu view of lie enemy and encamped hard by tliem at Corhio On the third day both sides were eager to come to an en jgagement the Romans prompted by resentment and the enemy liy a conviction that they could expect no  â CHAP 70 ROMAN HISTORY  303 quarter from an enemy from whom they had so often re volted CHAR EXX   The jEqui and Volsci severely chastised HEN both consuls are in the same Roman army VV they are vested with equal powers But Agrippa at this time yielded his authority to his colleague con vinced that nothing is more contrary to the prosperity of great undertakings than a divided command Quinc tius repaid this compliment as he ought to have done by communicating to his colleague all his counsels act ing in concert with him in every instance giving him a share of the glory in all successes and making him his equal in all things without exception In the action Quiuctius commanded the right wing Agrippa the left Sp Posthumius Albus the lieutenant the centre and Ser Sulpicius another lieutenant gene ral commanded the cavalry The foot on the right fought with extraordinary bravery and found a vigorous resistance On the part of the Volsci Ser Sulpicius with the horse broke through the ene my s main body and might have returned the same way before the enemy had time to rally and put them selves in form but he thought it better to charge them in the rear and had not the Equian and Vohcian ca valry come up and attacked him in his own way and by that means suspended the fortune of the day he would in a moment have put them to flight as by his attack they were greatly disconcerted both in front and in rear Sulpicius then cried out to his troops  That now was their time â that they would be immediately surrounded and all communication with their own army would be cut off if by a vigorous effort they did not dispatch the enemy s horse To put them to flight and let them live was doing nothing they must dispatch both men and horses that neither might return to renew the battle They will never be able to stand before you now that you have already broke  through the main body of theiv foot 306 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK 111 These orders were not given in vain The whole Roman cavalry charged the enemy at the same mstant and put them to flight Many of them were tumbled from their horses and both together transfixed by the spears of the Romans The enemy s cavalry were thns entirely defeated They turned then upon the foot having dispatched an aid de camp with the news of their success to the consuls who had al o made some impression on the wmgs that opposed them This intelligence redoubled their ardour and occasioned a great consternation among the SLqui who were already giving way The centre of the enemy s army which had been thrown into disorder by the Roman horse was the first that broke Quiuctius bore down the left wing but on the right there was much hotter work Then Agrippa who was brave and full of fire seeing the Romans carrying all before them excepting where he commanded snatched the standards from the ensigns and advancing with them in person threw some of them into the midst of the enemy s battalions The soldiers through fear of losing them which would have been a great disgrace fell upon the enemy like lions Thus was the victory rendered complete on the side of the Romans By this time Quinctius aid de camp came to inform them that he had beat the enemy and was ready to fall upon the enemy s camp the moment he knew they had done their business in the left wing and if they were already masters of the field he ordered then to join him immediately that all the army might share alike in the spoil Agrippa now victorious ad vanced to his colleague and after mutual congratulations on their mutual successes began the attack The few that guarded the camp being easily managed they broke through the works without opposition The consuls marched back the army to Rome laden with the spoils they had taken from the enemy exclusive of all they had lost in the plunder of their country which they now totally recovered It does not appear that they either demanded or that the senate decreed them a triumph nor is there any reason assigned for their neglecting or despairing to obtain that honour  CHAP 71 ROMAN HISTORY 307 As far as conjectures can be formed at this distance df time I am apt to imagine that as the senate some time before had refused the honour of a triumph to the con suls Valerius and Horatius who besides the war with the SLqui and Votsci had the honour of finishing th e war with the Sabines the present consuls had too much modesty to demand a triumph lest if they had obtain ed it men would have been apt to conclude that the se nate paid more respect to persons than to merit CHAP LXXI   â  The Roman people made Arbitrators â A HIS victory so honourably obtained over their ene mies was disgraced by a selfish award of the people re lative to some contested lands of their allies The Ar cinii and Ardeates had long disputed the right to a small territory for which they had fought many a battle Tired at length of the calamities of war they agreed to submit the whole to the decision of the Roman people When the cause came 10 be pled both parties exerted their utmost in an assembly of the people authorised by the magistrates The proof was taken and the vote ready to be put round when P Scaptius an aged ple beian rose up and addressing himself to the consuls said  That were he only allowed to speak in behalf of the state he could set the Roman people to rights in this matter When the consuls refused to listen to him and ordered him to be removed as a troublesome fellow he still insisted that the public interest was be trayed and appealed to the tribunes These gentlemen rather governed by the multitude than the multitude by them gave him permission to speak what he pleased to the people who were very willing to hear him  He then told them That he was now eighty three years of age that he had carried arms on that very spot which was now the bone of contention that he was not then a young man having made twenty cam paigns before the battle of Corioli that therefore he would give a candid account of the matter which at so distant a period might have escaped others but was  308 BOOK III TITUS LIVIUS still fresh in his memory That the territory in ques r tion was a pertinent of Corioli which being subjected to the Romans the land of course became the property of the Roman people That it surprised him how in all the world the Arcini and Ardeates who bad never claimed this territory while Corioli existed as a state could expect to ascertain their claim to it by making â the Romans who had the legal right arbitrators in the case That for his own part he had not long to live and since he could do po more now when he was old he could not help claiming possession by his feeble voice of a property to the acquisition of which he had con Â tributed all in his power when young And that it â was his earnest advice to the people that they should not by a mistaken and foolish modesty pass judgment against themselves CHAP LXXII T ie People adjudge in their own favour 1 HE consuls nmding that the multitude listened to Scaptius with every mark of attention and satisfaction called gods and men to witness their dissent from the no torious injustice just about to be committed and calling the chief men of the state with them went about implor ing the tribunes  To use their best endeavours to dis suade the people from introducing the practice among arbitrators of adjudging to themselves a subject sub mitted 10 their decision which is not only infamou in itself but of the most pernicious tendency for suppose in thia case their claim was well found ed and for that reason a concern for their own inte rest became justifiable yet it would be highly iropo litical for the acquisition of this territory would be but a poor compensation for the imputation of injus tice and the loss of the friendship of their allies Moreover in point of character and credit the loss was irreparable Shall the deputies of the states carry home the news shall it be told to the allies and the enemies of Rome The first will be sorry 1â the last will rejoice Is it possible to imagine that the neigh  CHAP 72 ROMAN HISTORY t bauring states would ascribe to the reveries of old Scap7 tiu so infamous a judgment He will indeed be al â ways remembered when this alFair is mentioned but â the Roman people will be for ever branded with chi canery and barratry in making a booty of other mens law suits For would any judge on earth even in a private affair seize the property in question as a per quisite of his own No Scaptius himself although it was plain he had out lived all shame could scarce be guilty of so gross a deed Thus did the consuls atid principal senators remon strate with all the warmth in their power but avarice and Scaptius prevailed and the tribes being called over adjudged the territory to themselves Had the affair been referred to other judges that the claim of the Roman people could not have been set aside is not denied but the justice of their pretensions in the p esent case d6es not lessen the infamy of their sen tence It gave the senate more concern and to them appeared in a more iniquitous point of view than it did to the claimants themselves For the remainder of the year Rome had no disturbance either at home or abroad TITUS

tribunes that the people should be at liberty to choose one of the consuls out of their own order was afterwards carried so high that niue tribunes preferred a bill  Empowering the people to elect the

commoner but would effectually wrest every shadow of power from them to entail it upon the commons Wherefore they received the news with joy that the Ardeates in resentment of the judgment given against them in the property submitted had abandoned thepartv of the Romans that the Vejentes were laying waste the frontiers of the Roman domains and that the Volsci and JEqui were in motion on

had breath they would not enlist a man until the law proposed by him and his colleagues were received and then went out directly and assembled the people CHAP II  The Consuls remonstrate T this time the consuls used every argument to ex asperate the senate against the tribune who on his part inflamed the people against the consuls The consuls contended â That the madness of the tribunes was no â longer to be endured That matters were now come to an extremity That the enemies without doors were nothing compared to those in their bosom That thi evil was not to be imputed to the people and their tri  hunesonly the senators and consuls were even morecul pable â That whatever is countenanced and rewarded ire â a city gains ground and increases prodigiously That it was in this manner our greatest statesmen and Â generals were formed â That in Rome nothing was now considered or rewarded but sedition which never 312 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV failed to procure Iionourand respect to all and sundries its authors and abettors That they might look back upon the majesty of the senate when they received it from their fathers and compare it with the state in which they were like to transmit it to iheir children they would then see whether they had reason to boast with the people that their privileges were exceedingly improved and enlarged That the same evils would  constantly prevail whilst sedition carried all before it and its authors so highly distinguished What a de  testable project is this which C Canuleins has attempt ed He is for mingling the blood of the nobles with the scurn of the people â confounding the public and private auspices â leaving nothing pure nothing un corrupted in the state that distinctions being put out of the way a man might be equally a stranger to him self and his relations For what else could possibly be the design of such preposterous marriages but that the fathers and people should couple together with as little ceremony as wild beasts  So that a child born of such marriages half Patrician and half Plebeian would be in a kind of war with himself being totally ignorant of his rank and family and the sacrifices pro per for his state  and as it were not enough to con Â found all rights human and divine these disturbers of the public peace have the imprudence to lift their eyes to the consulship itself That at first they had only talked of electing one Plebeian consul but now they rise in their demands and insist that the people may elect consuls out of either order as they please and can any one entertain a doubt that they would no  minate the most turbulent of their own order Then  would the Canulei and Icilii strut about with the fas  ces They trusted however that the most high Ju piter would never suffer the majesty of the consulship to fall into such contempt and for their own parts  they had rather die a thousand deaths than concur in so infamous a disgrace That it was a certain fact if their ancestors could have divined that by making so  many concessions the people were not to become more  tractable but on the contrary more assuming bymak ing demand upon demand every one of them more un CUAP 2 ROMAN HISTORY reasonable thain the former they would at the begin ning have fought it fairly whatever their disadvan tages rather than have such laws wreathed about their necks Because they had been indulged at first in tri bunes they must be again indulged To see an end of their dissensions was impossible so long as senators and tribunes existed in the same state Either the Pa trician order or these demagogues must be kicked out of the community It is better late than never at all to stem the torrent of their insolence and temerity Shall they sow dissension at home and thereby arm the neighbouring nations against us whilst at the same time they prohibit the citizens from repelling an invasion they had brought upon them and not smart for their impudence  Shall they give every encourage ment to the enemy but the ceremony of an invitation and not permit an army to be levied to make head against them But this Canuleius has the effrontery to declare in open senate that if the Patricians will not receive his laws as those ot a despotic conqueror he will not suffer a single man to enlist Ls not this an open declaration a plain menace that he will betray his country â That he will suffer it to be invested and calmly stand by and see it takeu Such a sentiment with what courage must it inspireâ not the Roman peopleâ but their declared enemies the JEqu Volsci and Vejentes Conducted by this demagogue can they look for any thing less than the possession of the citadel and capitol if the fathers together with their dignity and civil rights do not also surrender to the tribunes their courage and resolution But they would have them to know that the consuls were determined to take the lead in extirpating wickedness at home be fore they stirred to oppose the incursions of the enemy CHAP IIL Speech of Canuleius Vv H1LST these things were warmly insisted on in the senate Canuleius in defence of his laws and in opposi tion to the consuls spoke to the following effect I 3I TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV think I have frequently upon former occasions ob served O Romans in what contempt the fathers hold you and how unworthy they think you of living with in the same walls with them but at no time so strong ly marked as this day in the violence and fury they discovered in their opposition to our laws in which to what more do we pretend but only to remind them that we are their fellow citizens and though we have not the same fortunes we however have the honour to be inhabitants of the same country By one of these laws we demand the liberty of marriage with their order a liberty seldom refused to neighbours nay even strangers Nay more we have given the right of citizenship a circumstance of greater consider ation than family alliance to enemies â even conquer ed enemies By the other we claim nothmg new but what has always been the prerogative of the people to bestow honours on whom they shall think proper What occasion then for all this uproar as if heaven and earth were falling to ruin that they are ready to tear me to pieces in their senate house â that they threaten to have no regard to our persons and to vio late the power of the tribunes all sacred as it is If the Roman people be allowed to vote as they please and confer the consulship on whom they think proper and if a Plebeian has room to hope that by his merit he may rise to the highest honours of the state nftst Rome of necessity sink at once Must this empire be unavoidably overturned And does the same idea of impropriety attend the electiou of a consul from among the people thai would attend the promotion of a slave or a freed man to that dignity Have you any conception Romans of the contempt in which you are held If they could they would deprive you of the common light You should not breathe speak nor ap pear in the human form Nay but that a Plebeian should become a consul â Good gods what a prepos terous supposition Though we are not admitted to in spect the Fasti and the annals of the pontiffs pray do not we know what every stranger knows that the con suls succeeded the kings in their office and that ihey bad neither power nor pre eminence but what thi CHAP 3 ROMAN HISTORY 315 latter had before them  Do you imagine we are so ig  norant of our own history that we never heard that  Numa Pompilius who was neither a Patrician nor even a Roman citizen was called from his farm in the  country of the Sabines and by order of the people  and the authority of the fathers made king of Rome Â â That thereafter L Tarquinius by birth so far from being a Roman that he was not even an Italian the  son of Demaratus of Corinth a temporary citizen of Tarquinii was nevertheless in the life time of Ancus children placed upon the throne That Servius Tullius after him the son of a captive woman of Corniculum whose father no mortal knew whose mother was a  slave attained the sovereignty by his excellent quali ties and extraordinary merit Why should I mention  Titus Tatius the Sabine whom Romulus the founder  of this city thought proper to associate with himself in the administration Wherefore whilst no man in whom virtue shone conspicuous was despised on account of his  descent Rome flourished and grew great You may now if you please blush at the very idea of a Plebei an consul but our ancestors were not ashamed to have strangers for their kings nor has this city been shut  against foreigners who had merit to recommend them even since the extinction of regal power Have we not since that time received the family of the Claudii among us from the country of the Sabines and not only admitted them to the freedom of the city but also into the order of the Patricians Shall a foreigner be  come a Patrician and afterwards consul and a Roman  citizen be excluded the consulship because he is aPle  beian Do we believe then in the name of wonder that  it is impossible for the people to produce a man of  merit and courage qualified to discharge the duties of  the cabinet and the field resembling ISfuma Tarquin  and Servius And if one of this character happen to  be born among us shall we never suffer him to ap  proach the helm of state Shall we rather choose to  have men for consuls of the complexion of decemvirs  the most wicked of mankind and all of them Patricians  rather than men resembling the best of our kings wha could not boast of their high descent I 316 TITUS LIVUUS  BOOK IV CHAP IV In continuation 1 GRANT you that no Plebeian has been made con sul since the expulsion of the kings and pray what then Are we never to think of any new institution In an infant state as this is how many regulations must still be wanting and must these however necessary and essential be for ever excluded In the reign of Roruulus whoever heard of priests or augurs but they ware instituted by NumaPompilius In the city there was originally no census no distribution of the people into centuries and classes till they were appointed by Servius Tullius The title of consul never existed till consuls were created after the expulsion of kings Was there ever a dictator either in name or authority till the senate brought that office into existence There was a time when tribunes ediles and quaestors were un known but it was determined that they should b e Within these ten years we made decemvirs for com piling laws and we have also unmade them Who can imagine in a city which is to endure for ever and is increasing to infinity b ut that new offices priest hoods privileges and laws will be instituted both for families and individuals This very law which prohi bits intermarriages between the two orders of the state was it not passed by the decemvirs a few years ago to the disgrace of the public and the detriment of the people Can any thing in effect be more expressive of contempt more scandalous and disgraceful than to de clare one part of the city so impure and unclean that it is unworthy to be allied with the other in marriage What is it else than to be subjected to a sequestration a banishment within these walls They are all upon the watch to prevent every connection with us by af finity or relation and particularly that there may be no mixture of blood What is the meaning of all this If this nobility of yours has been polluted in this way which after all the greatest part of you who are de scended of the Albines or Sabines owe neither to your  CHAP 4 ROMAN HISTORY 317 birth nor your families but to your admission into the order of senators an honour to which you were either promoted by the kings or after their expulsion by the suffrages of the people Why do not you lay your wise heads together to preserve ihe pretended purity of your blood by chnsing neither wives among us your selves nor permitting your female line to marry any man but a Patrician No Plebeian will force a Patri cian lady That is an orbit in which a Patrician can only move Nobody will force you to enter into a marriage contract unless it be agreeable to yourselves But to prohibit it by law and to make the marriage of a Plebeian with a Patrician felony is affronting us in the highest degree Why have you not passed the same interdiction with respect to the rich and the poor At all times and in every nation upon earth it has been left to the choice of parties to settle upon the family into which a woman should be disposed of in marriage and upon that out of which they should take a vife but this liberty you restrain by the sanction of a law the most insulting in the world that you may make a breach in civil society and split one community into two Why do not you also forbid the Plebeians to live in the neighbourhood of the Patricians to walk in the same streets with them to eat at the same table or to assemble with them in the forum And what is the difference pray in all these things in the mar riage of a Patrician with a Plebeian or of a Plebeian with a senator s daughter Would the privileges of the orders be invaded or infringed by an instance of this kind Not at all For the children will always be of the rank with the father In short we have no other view in moving this affair but to be treated as men and citizens and the man who will set up his face to oppose so just a requisition can have no other mo tive but to make us appear in the light of scoundrels and vagabonds 318 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV t CHAP V Conclusion JjUT to conclude only let me ask you is the sove reign power in epfopleof Rome or in you Patricians Did we expel the kings to render you absolute or to Â purchase a liberty which should be common to and equal in all I hope it will not be denied that the people can at their pleasure make a law and will you then ihe moment a law is proposed pretend to â list them immediately for the war and the moment  that I in virtue of my office as tribune begin to call upon the tribes for their suffrages shall you by your consular authority oblige the youth immediately to take the military oath and march them to the camp threatening both the people and their tribune Have you not twice already felt the effects of cudgelling the people into an involuntary obedience Perhaps yoa  dropped the argument out of regard to our safety or rather did you keep your temper because the stronger party was also the more moderate Believe me Ro mans there will be no bloodshed on this occasion neither Your temper they will always try but as for your strength that is quite adifferent affair Where fore hear me consuls whether these wars you talk of be real or fictitious the people shall be ready at a call if by the ties of marriage and mutual affinity these ancient privileges the two orders be again united re stored to their natural tights and be made one people and if by real merit the citizens may look up to offices of distinction in the state without regard to adventitious circumstances5 if such in conjunction with you are admitted i a share in the administration of public affairs to demonstrate that they are equally called upon in the annual magistracy to command and obey in which alone true liberty consists But if â these laws are opposed talk for ever of wars exag gerate the danger as much as you willâ not a man shall enter the serviceâ not a man shall take armsâ not a man shall expose his life for such imperious lords  CHAP 6 ROMAN HISTORY 319 with whom he can neither share the public honours of  the state nor private alliance by marriage CHAP VI Military Tribunes of either order proposed to supersede Consuls HE consuls having also gone out to the assembly of the people from long speeches the parties now fell to altercation The tribune put the question why a Plet beian might not attain to the consulship It was answer ed perhaps with some truth though to little purpose on the present occasion that no Plebeian had a right to the auspices for which reason the decemvirs had declared such marriages void as in a heterogeneous race the auspices might be rendered uncertain It is impossible to express the indignation of the peot pip when they heard that they were to be denied the auspices as men bateful to the immortal gods And as in their tribune they had a most intrepid cham pion and were themselves no less determined the fathers were at last obliged to suffer the law concerning marriages to pass persuaded that fronp this concession the tribunes would be induced to drop entirely the other bill respect ing the Plebeian consuls or at least suspend it till the conclusion of the war and that the people satisfied with obtaining a repeal of the marriage act would cheerfully agree to the levies But as Canuleius victory over the fathers had raised his credit and influence among the people to an extraordinary height the other tribunes emulous of his glory exerted all their influence to carry the law they had proposed and though the reports of the impending war became every day more flagrant they still obstructed the levies  The consuls fmding that nothing effectual could be concluded in the senate by reason of the interruption they met with from the tribunes held meetings of the nobility in their own houses to whom it appeared evi dent that matters were now come to that pass that they must yield the victory either to the enemy abroad or to the people at home Valerius and Horatius were the 320 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV Only gentlemen of consular dignity who were not present at these meetings Claudius s advice armed the hands of the consuls against the tribunes r but the Quintii Cincinnatus and Capitolinus declared against blood and slaughter or even ottering violence to the persons of those whom by a solemn engagement with the people they had obliged themselves to hold sacred and inviola ble In these private assemblies it was at last agreed that they should allow military tribunes with consular power to be chosen indifferently out of either order but that the mode of election with respect to consuls should suffer no alteration This measure was received and cordially embraced both by the people and their tribunes The Comitia was then summoned tor the election of three military tribunes with consular power upon which all those who had distinguished themselves most in the cause of sedition either in speaking or acting especially the tri bunitian gentlemen ran on all sides of the forum dres sed in white robes soliciting votes The Patricians see mg them so active and despairing of obtaining any office of distinction from a people so exasperated at the same time were there hopes of succeeding unable to bear the thoughts of associating with colleagues of Ple beian rank they were at first determined not to stand for the office At last however yielding to the remon strances of the leading men of their party they offered their services fo fill the new offices that they might not seem to have abandoned their country with their share in its government The result of this assembly shewed that there is a material difference between a people in the heat and fury of disputes for liberty and honour and when they act with dispassionate coolness afte r these dis putes are over The people elected none to the office of military tri bunes but Patricians only being fully satisfied that regard had been shown to their demand Where shall we now find in any one man that moderation that equity that greatness of soul which were then so cou spicuous in a whole people CHAP 7 ROMAN HISTORY 321 CHAP VII Creation of Military Tribunes who soon lay down their office because there was an informality in their election AN the year 310 from the foundation of Rome A Sempronius Atratinus L Atilius Titus Caecilius being chosen military tribunes lor ihe first time in the room of consuls entered upor their office accordingly and the unanimity vhiah subsisted at home during their administration contributed not a little to maintain peace abroad Some authors are silent with respect to the bill for electing consuls from among the people assigning as a reason for the election of three military tribunes in vested with the authority and ensigns of the consols that besides the revolt of the Ardeates the Romans had at the same time upon their hands a war with the JEi i the Volsci and Vfjentes too much for the management of two consuls at the same time The establishment of this office however was not permanent for by a decree of the augurs they laid down their office in three months after they had enter ed upon it because some essential formality had been omitted in their election C Curtius the preses at the Cumitia having made some mistake in pitching the tent About this time ambassadors came from Ardea com plaining of the injustice done them but in such terms as showed no intention of renouncing their treaty and alliance with the Romans provided a restitution of their territory could be obtained The senate returned them for answer  That from the judgment of the people there was no appeal to their tribunal and as they had  the sanction of no law nor precedent for reversing the  sentence of the people such a proceeding might be of  dangerous consequence to that harmony which ought  to subsist between the two orders of the state But if  the Ardeates would be good enough to wait for a favourable opportunity and leave it to the wisdom of  the senaie io find means of redressing their grievance they would have no reason to repent on a future day â  ci their condescension nor to imagine that the senate 322 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV were not hearty in their endeavours to prevent their being injured and careful if at any time they had reason of complaini to remove the cause with a the dispatch in their power The ambassadors promised to lay the matter before their council of state and were dismissed with marks of respect As the city now had no supreme magistrates the se nate met and named an inter rex The main question now during this interregnum was whether consuls or military tribunes should be appointed to the government which was the subject of debate for several days The inter rex and senate insisted to have a Comitta for elect ing consuls but the people and their tribunes for mili tary tribunes The senate prevailed because the peo ple being determined at all events to chuse Patricians  grew indifferent about a question that could answer no end And their leaders themselves preferred an election Where they could not appear as candidates to that where they were sure to be cast as unworthy The tribunes too out of respect to the principal senators gave up a point which they saw they could not maintain T Quinctius Barbatus the inter rex created L Paperius Mugilanus and L Sempronius Atratinus consuls Dur ing their administration the treaty with the Ardeates was renewed which is an incontestible proof that they were consuls that year though the ancient annals as well as the register of magistrates make no mention of either It would seem that military tribunes having been created in the beginning of the year the names ol the consuls who succeeded them were omitted as if the military tribuneship had continued in force to the end o the year Lic inius Murer declares that their names are recorded in the treaty with the Ardeates and also f und in the linen records in the temple of Monita Notwith standing of all the alarms from the neighbouring nations  Rome enjoyed peace both at home and abroad   â Chap 8 ROMAN HISTORY 323 w CHAP VIII Censors created HETHER military tribunes only during this year or consuls chosen in their stead had the manage ment of public affairs it is admitted by all that in the next M Geganius Macerinus for the second and T Quinctius Capitolinus for a fifth time were consuls Under these consuls the office of censor was instituted which though it seemed but of small importance at first rose in time to so great a height that the morals and discipline of the Romans fell under its cognizance it was charged with the superintendance of the senate and centuries of the kmghts i in it was vested the right of promotion and degradation the disposal of all places public and private and an absolute jurisdiction with respect to the revenues of the republic The following circumstance gave rise to this office For many years the people had never been rated and though the census couid be delayed no longer by reason of so many impending wars it was out of the power of the consuls to overtake it It was observed by the se nate that a matter which required so great attention and at the same time below the dignity of a consul required a peculiar officer to whom the clerks ought to be ac countable who should have the conversation of the tax rolls and should prescribe the mode of taking the census However insignificant this office might have appeared at first the fathers grasped at it with joy as it had a tendency to increase the number of offices occupied by their order with a view as I imagine and a it really happened that the influence and power of those who filled it would soon procure authority and respect to the office itself The tribunes viewed4t rather in a neces sary than an honourable light of which at that time it had no other appearance and for that Teason made no objection that they might not seem to make opposi  A Censeo This office though at first it seemed contemp tible came at last to have so much power annexed to it that the emperors took it upon themselves 224 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV tion when their only motive was the pleasure of couira diction As the principat men of the state looked on this office with contempt Popi nus and Serupromus were named by the people whose consulship the preceding year was found doubtful that the accession of this new honour might make ihem amends for the imperfection of the former and from the nature of their office they were called censors D CHAP IX Distractions at Ardca Proceedings of Gcgamus URING these operations at Rome ambassadors came from Ardea requesting the Romans on account of their most ancient friendship and of the treaty so lately renewed to assist the state now brought to the brink of ruin by a civil war which totally interrupted that peace they had very wisely kept with them Tlie rage of parties it is said was the source of these civil dissensions which has been of more fatal consequence to many states than foreign wars famine diseases and plagues of whatever kind ascribed to the anger of the gods as being the severest strokes that can befal a na tion Two young men had made their addresses to a voong lady of Plebeian extraction but extraordinary beauty One of the young gentlemen was her equal and sup ported in his pretensions by her tutors who were of the same order The other was a nobleman regardless of every consideration but the charms of his mistress His addresses had the countenance of the nobility who car ried the spirit of party into the young lady s family Her mother ambitious of a title to her daughter was clear for the nobleman The guardians even in this matter could not conceal their attachment to their own order When the dispute became too high to be settled within doors they went to law and the judge having heard the pleadings on the part of the guardians and the mother gave judgment in favour of the latter whose right to dispose of her child in marriage was clearly ascertained but the stoutest arm prevailed For the  CHAP 9 ROMAN HISTORY 325 guardians expatiated publicly on the injustice of the sentence among the people of their own order in the forum and having made up a party seized the young lady and carried her off from her mother s house In opposition to them a party of the nobility still more formidable joined the injured youth and bloody work ensued The people who bore no resemblance to the people of Rome were worsted and marched out of the city in arms posting themselves upon an eminence whence they laid waste the lands of the nobility with fire and sword and having by the hopes of plunder drawn a great many mechanics to their party they made prepa rations for besieging the city which hitherto had sus tained no damage from the insurrection War now ap peared in all its dreadful shapes and colours  the whole community being as it were infected with the distrac tion of two young men who were contending for a mar riage fatal to themselves and destructive to their coun try Neither thougTit their internal resources sufficient for the conflict for which reason the nobility applied to the Romans for relief while the city was besieged and the commons called in the Volsci to assist them in the reduction of the city The Volsci appeared first before Ardea under the command ot Cluiiius an E uian ge neral and shut up the city by a line of circumvallation drawn round its walls When these accounts were brought to Rome the consul Geganius lost not a mo ment in marching with his army ami encamped within three miles of the enemy where as the day was far spent he ordered the troops to refresh themselves At the fourth watch he proceeded and carried on his works with such expedition that at sun rising the Volsci found themselves blocked up by a fortification superior in strength to that wherewith they had invested the city whilst at another quarter the consul had carried his works to the walls of Ardea that his army might have a free communication with the town P 32 5 TITUS IVIUS BOOK IV CHAP X T7ie Volsci beat Peace restored to Ardea The consul triumphs JL HE general of the Volsci who till then had trusted for victualling his army to the corn got from day to day in ravaging the lands of the nobility having pre pared no magazines for that purpose when he saw him self all of a sudden blocked up and thereby deprived of every means of subsistence invited the consul to an in terview and told him That if he had come with an in tention to raise the siege that he was willing instantly to withdraw the Volsci The consul in answer gave him to understand that it was incumbent on the con quered to receive terms but not to prescribe them and since they had come to besiege the allies of Rome at their own pleasure they must only depart at his plea sure Wherefore he orders them to lay down their arms tor give up their general acknowledge themselves conquered and submit to his orders If they did not they might expect no quarter whether they raised or carried on the siege as he would much rather return to Rome crowned with victory than with the terms of a treacherous capitulation The Volsci now cut off from all hopes except what little they placed in their arms resolved to give it atrial but besides other disadvantages having engaged in a place improper for fighting and still more so for flying and being slaughtered at all quarters they put Â p their swords and fell on their knees when after they had de livered up their general and laid down their arms thev were obliged to pass under the yoke and dismissed with clothes only sufficient to conceal their nakedness cover ed however with s hnme and disgrace When they had halted at some distance from Tusculnm the people thers who had long been their declared enemies rose up on them fell upon them unarmed and scarce left one to carry home the news of their disaster The Roma consul re established peace and tranquil lity at Ardea having beheaded the principal authors of  CHAP M ROMAN HISTORY 327 the sedition and confiscated their estates for the benefit of the public treasury The Ardeates by so important a service thought themselves sufficiently indemnified for the unjust award of the Roman people But the senti ments of the senate were more generous they thought there still remained something more to be done to efface the remembrance of the shameful avidity which had so much dishonoured the Roman people The consul en tered Rome in triumph Chiilius the general of the Volsci being led in chains before his chariot together with the spoils of the enemy whom he had disarmed and obliged to pass under the yoke The consul Quinctius equalled by the virtues of peace the glory his colleague had acquired in arms which was no easy matter For he applied himself in such a man ner to preserve the peace and union of the city and act ed with such perfect impartiality between great and small that by a just mixture of severity and mildness his administration was thought by the senate rather sti ict aftd by the people sufficiently gentle He kept the tribunes in awe not by violent disputes but by a kind of ascendancy his known merit gave him over them In five consulships through which he had passed with the same character for probity or rather the consular dignity of his whole life rendered his person more ve nerable if possible thaji the office he bore for this rea son not a syllable was hinted about military tribunes during the whole course of this consulship CHAP XI Reparation made the Ardeates for the selfish award of the Roman People T HE consuls elected for the ensuing year were M Fabius Vibulanus and Posthumus Ebutius Cornice i These magistrates when they reflected upon the glorious administration of the preceding year both at home and abroad  for the Romans had shown such attention and alertness in relieving the Ardeates when their affairs vverel in a most dangerous situation that among their neighbours allies and enemies they were considered in 32S TITUS L1VIUS BOOK IV â a very respectable light concluded that they ought to exert themselves that the remains of the infamous sen tence formerly passed in relalion to the Ardeatfts might be buried in oblivion  and for that purpose prevailed on the senate to pass a decree for sending a colony to Ardea to defend them against the Volsci and repeop e the city much depopulated by the civil war This was publicly given out and recorded that the people and their tribunes might not discover the latent design of re versing their sentence For it was concerted that a far greater part of the colony should consist of Rutuli than of Romans that no territory should be divided but that which had produced the infamous sentence  and that no Roman should have a single acre of land till all the Ru tuli should be provided for Thus was the territority restored to the Ardeates Three gentlemen were chosen to lead the colony to Ardea Agrippa Menenius T Clcelius Siculus and Ebu cius Elua who by an unpopular discharge of their trust in assigning the lands to the allies which the Romans had adjudged to themselves fell into disgrace with the people nor were they high in favour with the Pa tricians because they had shown no respect to persons However they avoided a prosecution when the tribunes appointed them a day to answer for their conduct before the peop e by deserting the diet an 1 incorporating them selves with the colony who had been witnesses of the integrity and impartiality of their conduct Â  Be CHAP XII A Famine A Superintendent of Provisions chosen OTH this year and the following when Cains Furius Pacilius and M Papirius Crnssus were consuls passed in tranquillity bath at home and abroad The games which the decemvirs had vowed and the senate enacted daring the secession of the people from the fathers were celebrated this year In vain did Petilius attempt to raise a sedition wlio being made tribune of the people a second time couid not for all the blustering he miulv about the Agrarian law get the consuls to iÂ ov c it once CHAP 12 ROMAN HISTORY 329 in the senate  and when after a mighty bustle he pre vailed so far as to get the opinion of the fathers whether the comitia should be held for electing consuls or mili tary tribunes consuls were ordered to be elected His threats that he would obstruct the levies were matter of ridicule for when there was neither war nor prepara tion for it what occasion was there for levies This stat e of tranquillity was followed by a year che quered with a combmation of calamities occasioned by famine and sedition during the consulship of Proculua Geganius Macerinus and L Menenius Lanatns when the people by means of bribery had almost been sad dled with regal power Had one foreign war been  thrown into the scale the state must have inevitably sunk to perdition The first of these calamities was a famine either owing to a bad season or the neglect of agricul ture for dancing attendance to assemblies and the plea sures of the city For both these reasons are given The senators reproached the people with idleness and the tribunes blamed the consu sometimes for want of honesty and sometimes for inattention At last with the senate s concurrence the people made choice of L Minucius as prefect or snpeiinten dant of provisions who was more happy while in office in securing the liberty of the state than in the execution of his office although at last he had justly the honour of lowering the price of provisions and the thanks ef his country on that account For having dispersed agents by sea and land to no purpose through the neighbouring states excepting a stnall matter from Etru ria when no corn could be got he turned hrs attention to a frugal management of what little was to be found nt home by obliging every one to produce h rs corn to sell above one month s provision by reducing the daily aljnwance to slaves and by accusing the corn merchants and exposing them to the resentment of the people so that by the strictness of his scrutiny he rather exposed their penury than relieved it in consequence of which many of the people in a fit of despair chose rather to throw themselves blindfolded into the Tiber than suffer â any longer the miseries of so cruel a famine 330 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV S â â CHAP XIII i Designs of Malius â A Dictator created this time one Sp Mseiius of the equestrian order who was very rich for these times put a design in exe cutiou which however serviceable for the present iu its tendency and intention was execrable For having bought up corn at his own expence inEtruria by means of his agents and correspondents a circumstance which rendered Minucius endeavours to supply the markets quite ineffectual he began to distribute it among tlie necessitous with a liberal hand Touched with so much generosity the people attended him every where aod formed a retinue for him far above the condition of a private gentleman and gave him great grounds to hope that by their favour and good will he would one day be raised to the consulship But as ambition is ever insa tiable and still grasping at something beyond its reach he carried his views much farther and quite out of bis sphere He considered that he roust force himself into the cbnsulship in spite of every opposition from the fa thers and that therefore it was better to fix on sovereign power for his object at once as that alone was a prize worthy of the deep designs he must necessarily form and the opposition he had to conquer It was just upon the eve of the Comttia for electing consuls a circumstance that gave him no small trouble as his measures were not properly concerted nor his de signs ripe for execution T Quinctius Capitolinus was chosen consul for the sixth time a man of all others the most inconvenient to any person who wanted to play a game of this kind Agrippa Menenius surnamed La natus was given him for his colleague L Minucius was continued in his office either as being re elected or because his office did not expire till the occasion of it was superseded For we have no other proof of the matter but that his name stands registered among tjie magistrates of this and the preceding year iu the linen records The duty of the purveyor s office obliged luui to do the same in public which M lius took upon him  CHAP 13 ROMAN HISTORY 331 self to do in private and brought the sarae sort of people to frequent the houses of both By their means the whole plot was discovered and laid before ihe senate by Minucius who told them that arms were carried into Maeliu s house where he also held assemblies and there was not a doubt but he was taking measures to make himself king That the time for the execution of his design waÂ not yet fixed but every thing previous to it was concerted and the tribunes being brought up to betray their country the leading men among the com mons had the parts assigned them they were respective ly to act That he came with this information later perhaps than the safety of the republic required bat he wished to advance nothing of the certainty whereof he was not perfectly assured Upon this relation heavy reproaches were thrown by the principal senators from every part of the house on the consuls of the former year because they had suffered such largesses to be made and such meetings to be held in a private house nor did the present consuls escape them for waiting till so important a discovery shoufd be made by a purveyor general whereas it was the duty 01 the consuls not only to have been acquainted with an affair of such moment but also to have punished the de linquent Titus Quinctiu in answer told them that they had no reason to blame the consuls whose authority being cramped and in a manner annihilated by the laws of appeal whatever their courage and resolution might be to punish a crime of that nature according to its enor mity by no means furnished them with the power i In this case that a man of resolution was not sufficient his power must be unlimited he must be above the law That for this reason he would name L Quinctius Dicta tor a man whose soul was as capacious as the power  was extensive All approved of this motion  but Quin tius wished to be off asking them what they meant by exposing him at such an advanced age to so severe a conflict  But when the senators as it were with one voice declared that not only more wisdom but actually more real courage resided under his venerable form than could be found among them all put together and loaded 332 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV him with deserved praises whilst the consul still persist ed in his motion he acquiesced at length praying to the gods that the public weal might suffer no loss or re proach at so dangerous a conjuncture through his infir mities He was instantly declared dictator by the consul and named G Servilius Ahala general of Hie horse CHAP XIV Servilius cuts off Mxlius J N EXT day when he had posted guards in al proper places of the city he went out into the forum where an appearance so unexpected and unusual soon attracted the attention of the populace While Ma Iius adherents and himself too saw plainly that the power of that su preme magistrate was wholly pointed against themselves such as were ignorant of their designs to subvert the con stitution were asking one another what insurrection what unexpected war had made it necessary to create a dictator aod to invest Quinctius at upwards of fourscore with that supreme office Servilius master of the horse having been sent by the dictator to Mceiius tells him that he must wait up on the dictator Mselius in great disorder asked what lie wanted To make your defence replied Servilius in answer to an indictment laid against you by Minucius before the senate Upon that Maelius made for a crowd of his adherents and looking round him began to make the best of his way By order of the general of the horse an officer arrested him but he was rescued by the people about him and whilst he fled he implored the protection of the people crying out that the senate had concerted a plan for his destruction because of his generosity to the people who he begged might stand by him now that his life was at stake nor suffer him to be murdered in their presence Servilius Ahalacame up with him as lie was pronouncing these words and laid him dead at his feet Then all sprinkled with the blood of the slain encircled with a band of Patrician youth he presented himself before the dictator and tells him that he had cited Mselius to appear before him  but  Chap 15 ROMAN HISTORY  ISS as he bad deforced the officer and was endeavouring to raise an insurrection among the people he had received from him the punishment due to his crime Bravely done returned the dictator C Servians then Rome is yet a free state CHAP XV The Dictator accounts to the people for the pimiihmcnt of Malius A HE Dictator then called an assembly of the people who were in great commotion and quite uncertain as to the judgment they ought to pass on what they had seen There the dictator tells them  That Mailius had justly merited his fate had he even been innocent of the high crime charged against him for having disobeyed the dictator s summons delivered to him by the master of horse That he had taken his place on the tribunal on purpose to enquire into that affair after which he should have done Maelius the justice he deserved That as he had recourse to force to screen himself from judgment violent measures were used in correct ing his obstinacy He had no title to be treated as a citizen who though born among a free people in the midst of its laws and regulations in a city from whence kings had been expelled  who knew that in the very year of their expulsion the king s nephews sons also of that consul who was the deliverer of his country because they had conspired to receive the kings into Rome were condemned to suffer death by their own  father That in the same city the consul Collatinus Tarquinius out of hatred only to his name had been obliged to resign his office as consul and banish him self from his country where Spurius Cassius some years after had suffered death for a design of esta  Wishing tyranny and that very recently the tyranni cal haughtiness with which the decemvirs lorded it over the people had been punished with confiscation of their estates banishment and death itself and yet notwithstanding such examples had the impudence to lift his eyes to the sovereignty of Rome And after 33 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV all who is this Maelius For though neither nobility of birth nor dignity of office nor even personal merit ought to open a way to the tyranny yet Claudius Cas sius and the rest at the time they aspired to so crimi nal an elevation were sustained by their consulships their decemvirates the honours of their ancestors as well as their own and the splendour of their families But for Sp Maelins to whose wishes rather than his hopes the office of tribune might have become an ob ject a victualler who had amassed a fortune from the corn trade to have carried his speculations so high as to think of purchasing the liberty of Roman citizens for a morsel of brer d that a people victorious over all their neighbours would subject themselves to slavery for the temptation of a dinner as if the Romans would have put up with a king whom they would scarce have admitted to the rank of a senator to be invested with the authority and adorned with the ensigns of Romulus their founder who was descended of the gods and at his death received into their number was folly to an extravagant pitch full as much as a crime It was not sufficient that he had expiated his guilt with his blood  th e house and walls wherein such a mail attempt had been projected ought to be demolished and all his effects confiscated as having been intended to be laid out in the purchase of regal power and that therefore he ordered the quaetors to expose these goods at vendue and lodge the proceeds in the treasury CHAP XVI Mctlius house demolished and his effects confiscated LiIS house was instantly ordered to be demolished and that th e place on which it stood might be a monu ment of the disappointment of his criminal hopes it was called Esquimaelium L Minucius had the ho nourto be presented with an ox with gilt horns without the gate that leads to Ostia to which the people made no objection because he distributed Maelius corn among them at an ass the bushel Some authors affirm that Minucius went over from the Patricians to the Plebeians  CHAP IV ROMAN HISTORY 335 and that he was made the eleventh tribune and by that hieans quieted the tumult occasioned by the death of Maelius But it is hardly probable that the fathers would have suffered the number of tribunes to be aug mented or allowed such a precedent to beset by one of their own order nor that the people once a con cession had been made them would tamely have given it up again But what proves the inscription on Minu cius a statue to be entirely fictitious is the law made a few years before whereby it is provided that the tri bunes could not choose a colleague by co optation D Caecilius Q Junius and Sextus Titinus were the only tribunes that opposed the law for conferring ho nours op Minucius whom or Servilius they were con stantly accusing to the people and complaining of the unmerited fate of Maelius and so carried that military tribunes in preference to consuls should be elected for  that year being fully persuaded if six military tribunes the number allowed by law were elected some of the Plebeians by promising to revenge the death of Mslius would be among the number However multiplied and diversified the distractions of the city that year no more than three tribunes were elected with consular authority and among them too L Quintius the son of that Cin cinnatus in odium of whose dictatorship the confusion was projected Marcus SLtnilius a man of singular merit was first in the nomination Quintus second and L Julius third CHAP XVII Tlie Roman ambassadors murdered at Fidena JL URING their administration Frdenae a Roman colony revolted to Lars Tolumnius king of the Ve jentes This rebellion was attended with a crime of a more heinous nature  For by order of Tolumnius they put to death C Fulcinius Clcelius Tullus Sp Ancius and L Roscius who had been commissioned by the Romans to enquire into the reason of their conduct Some authors in extenuation of the king s guilt alledge that upon occasion of a lucky throw of the dice some 336  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV equivocal expression he generally made use of was con strueO by the Fidenates 11110 an order to murder the aru bassuviiM But it is hardly possible that the king would have been so very intent on his game as not to be diverted by the arrival of his new allies the Fidenates to consult him concerning a murder contrary to the law of nations or that afterwards he should not have ex pressed his detestation of so horrible a deed It is more probable that it was a digested plan to secure the Fide nates fftectaally to his interest by the guilt of so black a crime which must make a breach betwixt the Ro mans and them never to be made up The statues of the ambassadors who were murdered at Fidenae were erected in the Rostra at the public ex pence The prospect of a bloody battle won with the confederate troops of the Vejentes and Fidenates who besides their living in the neighbourhood had in effect commenced hostilities in au instance of the most shock ing barbarity kept the people and their tribunes from raising a disturbance or clogging the wheels of govern ment so that M Geganius for the third time with L Sergius Fidenas were chosen consuls without opposition It is very probable that Sergius got the sirname of Fi denas from the war which he conducted afterwards For he was the first who measured swords with the king of the Vejentes on this side the Anio and came off vic torious bu it cost him dear for which reason Rome was more afflicted for the loss of many citizens than elated with joy for the defeat of the enemy Upon this event as was usual in cases of danger the senate ordered Mamcrcus SSmilius to be created dictator For master of the horse he named L QuinctiusCincinna tus a young nobleman worthy of so great a father who the year before had been one of his colleagues in the office of military tribune with consular power At the levy made by the consuls the old centurions of great valour and experience entered themselves for the service and the places of those who fell in the last ac tion were totally filled up The dictator ordered Quin tius Capitol in us  and M Fabins Vibulanu  to atiend him in quality of lieutenants The enemy fmding they ha 1 now to do with a general invested with unlimited power  CHAP 18 ROMAN HISTORY 337 whose abilities were equal to the charge left he Ro man dominions and retired beyond the Anio possessing themselves of the eminences which lie between the Anio and Fidenae nor did they venture down upon the plains before they were joined by the legions of the Falisci The Etrunans4hea encamped before the walls of Fidenae when the Roman dictator posted himself at a small dis tance from them upon the banks of the two rivers near their confluence having drawn lines through the intermediate space as far as the ground was capable of fortification Tbe next day he drew out his army to battle but the enemy were not unanimous in their opi nioos CHAP XVIII Battle with Tolumnius  1 HE Falisci being at a distance from their own coun try growing weary of the fatigues of war and having sufficient confidence in their strength were clear for fighting but the Vejentes and Fidenates thought their only chance lay in protracting the war Tolumnius although he approved of the sentiments of his own sub jects that the Falisci might not be disgusted with the service so far from home gave out that he would lead them to battle next day The appearance of hesitation in the enemy gave new spirits to the dictator and his Romans and the next day whilst the soldiers threaten ed to storm the city and their camp if they did not give them battle both armies were drawn out to a plain be tween the two camps Tolumnius being superior in numbers detached a party behind the mountains to attack the Roman camp during the heat of the engagement Of the confederate army this was the disposition The Vejentes were posted on the right the Falisci on the left and the Fidenates iu the centre On the right wing of the Romans the dictator was opposed to the Falisd Quintius Capitoli nus to the Vejentes on the left and the master of the horse advanced with his cavalry in the centre For a little the armies remained without the least 338 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV noise or motion the Etrurians having no mind to come to blotos unless they were compelled and the dictator looking back to the capitol tor the signal from the au gurs which they were to set up as had been concerted the moment they had obtained a favourable omen Whenever it appeared setting up a great shout he sent the horse to begin the attack They were followed by the foot and fought wiih great fury The Etrurians were obliged to give way every where to the superior mettle of the Romans The horse kept their ground better and the king himself the life and soul of the whole riding from place to place whilst the Romans pursued him everywhere kept the victory in suspense CHAP XIX Gallantry of Cossus â Defeat of the Confederates J HERE was at that time an officer of the Roman cavalry named A Cornelius Cossus very remarkable for the gracefulness of his person extraordinary strength and exalted courage who constantly attentive to the honour of his family which was very illustrious both supported and augmented its glory Observing that Tolumnius carried terror and confusion among the Ro man troops wherever he moved and distinguishing him by his royal robes as he flew along the line of battle cried out  Is that the man who infringes human trea ties and tramples on the law of nations if the gods â will permit any sanctity to remain among mortals I shall soon see whether I can sacrifice him as a victim to the manes of our ambassadors Then springing forward with great impetuosity against the king as his peculiar adversary with one blow of his lance unhorsed him dismounting himself the same instant supported by his spear Whilst the king attempted to rise he beat him down upon his back with the boss of his buck ler and having given him several wounds thrust him through the body and nailed him to the ground He then stript him of his spoils cut off his head and fixed it on the point of his spear evidencing by that bloody trophy his victory to the enemy and spreading terror among them everywhere  CHAP 20 ROMANy HISTORY 339 Thus the enemy s cavalry who alone had kept the victory in suspense were broke and put to flight The dictator in the mean time pursued the flying legions and drove them back to the camp with prodigious slaugh ter Many of the Fidenates being acquainted with the country escaped to the mountains Cossus crossed the Tiber with his cavalry and returned to Rome loaded with spoils from the territory of the Vejentes During the battle there was also a skirmish at the Roman camp with the party which as was formerly observed had been detached thither by Tolumnius Fabius Vibulanus first defended the works by posting his men round them but afterwards made a sally at the gate on the right of the Principia with the Triarria and surprised the enemy wholly intent upon forcing the lines Terror and confusion on the part of the enemy was the con sequence of this manoeuvre but the slaughter was not considerable as there were but few engaged though the rout was as general and no less confused than in the field of battle Ti CHAP XX COSMS presents JOpima Spolia to Jupiter Feretriia HE Roman army having thus been everywhere vic torious the dictator by decree of the senaic and order of the people entered Rome in triumph but what prin cipally attracted the public attention in the procession was Cossus bearing the spoils of the king killed with his own hand The soldiers sung rude verses to his praise comparing him to Romulus He hung up these spoils in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius near those of Romulus at that time the only spoils that bore the name of Opima presenting them with a solemn dedication All the while he drew the eyes of the citizens from the dictator s chariot and fixed them on himself so that he engrossed  The Roman camp was a quadrangle divided into two prin cipal parts between which was a spot of ground about 100 feet long called the Principte The camp had four gates  in the front the Praetorian in the rear the Decumena in the right the Principals Dextta  and on tlie left the Principal Lseva  3 0 TITUS L1VIUS BOOK IV the best part of that day s solemnity The dictator by order of the people presented to Jupiter Capitoiinus a crown of gold of a pound weight at the public ex pence I have followed the universal opinion of authors who wrote before me in making A Cornelius Cossus only a legionary tribune at the time he brought the second Opitna Spoiia into the temple of Jupiter Feretrius But besides that those only properly speaking are Opima Spoiia which one general takes from another and none can be considered as a general but he who has the sole management of the war the very inscription of these spoils proves against both them and me that he was consul when he took them Therefore when I heard that Augustus Caesar who either built or repaired all the Roman temples had visited that of Jupiter Feretrius which he had rebuilt after it had fallen to ruins by the ravages of time and that he himself had read the in scription upon the linen breast plate of Tolumnius I thought it a pity to deprive Cossus of the testimony of his own spoils and of Casar also who rebuilt the temple The reader may however judge for himself where the mistake lies in that matter because annals so ancient and the linen register of magistrate kept in the temple of Moneta so often quoted by Liciifius Macer takes no â notice of Cossus s consulship till nine years after when Titus Quinctius Pennus was his colleague Add to this also that so famous a battle can never correspond to that year because for almost three years before and after the consulate of A Cornelius there was no war owing to a pestilential disiemper and a famine insomuch that some annals mourning as it were for the dead mention no thing with respect 19 these years but the names of the consuls The third year after he was consul he was ipade military tribune with consular nwer and before it expired master of horse in which capacity he fought another memorable battle at the head of the cavalry Still we may judge of this matter as we please bat in my opinion we may conclude any dispute about the matter ridiculous since he who commanded in this ac tion when the spoils were fresh and deposited in he temple near Jupiter himself to whom they were devoted  CHAP 21 ROMAN HISTORY 341 in the presence of Romulus witnesses not to be imposed on with a fictitious inscription calls himself A COKNE LIUS Cossus CONSUL CHAP XXI An epidemical distemper rages among the Vejentes and Falisci T ie Fidenates attempt a descent upon the Roman territory iN the consulship of M Cornelius Maluginensis and L Paperius Crassus the Roman armies marched into the territories of the Vejentes and Falisci and brought offa iarge booty in prisoners and cattle but the enemy kept out of the way so that there was no opportunity of coming to blows They did not however lay siege to any of their cities because an epidemical distemper raged among the people and Spurius Maelius a tribune of the commons was endeavouring though with little success to raise commotions at home lie thought the popularity of his name would enable him to raise some dust and therefore had impeached Minucius and brought in a bill for confiscating the estate of Servilius Ahala contending that the charge brought against Maelius by Minucius was a villainous trick a vile forgery and that Servilius had put to death a Roman citizen unheard and uncondemned These prosecutions appeared full as ridiculous to the people as the author of them Their attention however was totally engrossed by the violence of the distemper which was still encreasing and fright ful prodigies such as the news that houses in the coun try were frequently demolished by repeated shocks of an earthquake Wherefore they had recourse to prayer IB which the people followed the duumvirs  The plague rages with still greater fury when C Ici lius for the seconJ time and L Virginius were consuls and threatened such desolation in town and country that so far from making excursions for the sake of plunder a foreign war was never so much as hinted either in the senate or the forum The Fidenates however who had at first kept themselves in the mountains towns and for tified places were tempted now to make a descent upon 342 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV the Roman territory with a view to plunder Having afterward formed a junction with the army of the Ve jentos for tlie Falfsoi notwithstanding tlie distress of the Roman republic and the solicitations of their allies were determined to he no more concerned the two confederate armies passed the Anio and displayed their colours near the Colline gate   The consternation was prodigious in town and country The consul Icilius drew up his troops on the walls and rampart of the city whilst Virginius consulted the senate in the temple of Romulus There a dictator was resolv ed on and A Servilius appointed to the commission who by some is sirnamed Priscus by others Structus Virgi nius only waited 10 advise his colleague who having no objection lie named the dictator that night who chose Posthumius JEbutius Elva master of tlie horse CHAP XXII The Vuhci and Fidenatcs beat and Fidena taken V RDERS were issutd by the dictator that all should appear early next morning without the Colline gate nor did any who were able to carry arms fail in their obedience The standards were brought him from the treasury without a moment s delay When the enemy observed these motions they retired to the eminences whither the dictator foltowed them with an army suffi ciently engaged and coming to blows with them near Nomenton gave the legions of Etruria a severe drubbing and pursued them to the city Fidenat where he blocked them up But as the city stood high and strongly for tified it could not be taken by escalade nor could a blockade have been of any service as they had not only provisions sufficient for the present but large magazines previously laid in Therefore finding it would Tie im practicable to carry the city by storm or blockade the dictator resolved to open a passage under ground to the citadel from places near enough to be sufficiently ex amined at the back of the town where it was guarded with least care as being most strongly fortified by na ture  CHAP 23 ROMAN HISTORY 343 He divided his Army into foiir parts and carried on his attacks uponMhe walls in places very distant from each oilier He constantly relieved those who were fa tigued by fresh supplies of men artd so continued to skirmish with the townsmen night and day By these diversions he kept the enemy from perceiving the works Le was carrying on till he lta digged quite through tlie bill and opened a passage all the way to the castle and till the Etrurians having been diverted with the show of danger from all attention to the reality and a confirma tion that their city was taken in the enemy s shouts over their heads This year C Furius Pacilus and M Ge ganius Macerinus the censors fitted up a building In the Campus Martius where the census was made for the first time N CHAP XXIII The conquered are again in motion JL FIND in Licinius Macer that the same consuls Ici lius a third time and Virginius a second were re elect ed tor the following year Valerius Antias and Q Tu IJM O mention M Manlius and Q Sulpicius as consuls for that year Yet notwithstanding so great â Â differ ence both pretend the authority of the linen books and neither refuses that according to ancient historians the public administration for that year was vested in mili tary tribunes Licinius follows these linen records as an oracle of truth but Tubero is not so confident so that among other things which antiquity has involved in dark riess this too must be left undetermined â The taking of Fidenae spread a general alarm through out all Etruria For the Vejentes w ere not only in the most dreadful terror for meeting with the same fate but the Falisci too from the part they had acted in the first war although they had no hand in the second Where fore these two states having dispatched ambassadors to all the twelve nations prevailed with ihem to appoint Et general assembly of all Etruria at the temple of Voltum na upon which the senate as if a cloud had been ready to burst over their heads ordered Mamercus 344 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV once more to be created dictator Tlf named for master of he horse A Posihumius Tubertus and preparations were made for the war with a vigour proportioned to the force of all Etruna compared to thai of only two of its constituent parts â CHAP XXIV The Dictator passes a popular law which is highly resented by the Censors DUT this affair created less disturbance than was ge nerally expected wherefore when advices were brought by the merchants that the Etrurians had refused to be concerned with the Vejentes telling them since they had engaged in a war without consulting them they must carry it on without their assistance and not involve those in their misfortune whom they excluded from their hopes in more promising days The dictator then thus disappointed in his expectation of military glory that he might not seem to have been created in vain wished to leave a monument of his dicta torship in time of ps ace and with that view set about reducing the privileges of the censors either because he thought their power too extensive or perhaps because be was less dissatisfied with the greatness of their honours than the time of their duration Therefore having cal led an assembly he represented That as the immortal gods had takpn upon themselves the charge of the re public s affairs abroad under whose protection they mig ht rest secure it was his business to attend to the liberty of the people which could only be done with in the walls of the city That lor this purpose he had to observe that it was a matter of the last importance to take care that the great offices of the state should not continue long in the same hivnds and that bounds be set to the duration of employments to the power annexed to which all limitation is impossible That all other offices were annual the censorship alone quin quennial That it was intolerable to live for so many years exposed to the power of the same persons That therefore he was to propose a law restricting the cen sorship to the continuance of eighteen months  CHAP 25 ROMAN HISTORY 315 Next day the law was accepted by the unanimous consent of the people To convince you Romans that I am in earnest when I express so great a dislike to magistracies of long continuance this instant resign my own Having thus divested himself of his own office and so put an end to one and limited another he was conducted buck to his house by the multitude with loud acclamations of joy Mamercus s conduct in abridging the duration of a Roman office was highly re sented by the censors who degraded him from his tribe and saddled him with a tribute eight times his usual pro portion It is said of Emilius that he bore all this with a remarkable degree of fortitude disregarding the indig nity out of respect to the cause and though the senators had no great relish for the new law they were far from being pleased with this instance of despotism in the cen sors from a very natural reflection that though they might themselves be possessed of the same power they might be oftener and much longer subject to it How ever it is certain that such was the indignation of the people that butJ or the interposition of Mamercus him self the censors would have been torn to pieces CHAP XXV Complaints of the Tribunes that they were neglected by the people A pestilence rages X HE tribunes of the people by the constant ha rangue in opposition to the election of consuls at last carried that military tribunes with consular power should be chosen for the ensuing year after matters were almost brought to an inter regnum Nevertheless they obtained none of the reward they expected for not a single Plebeian was elected They were all Patri cions namely M Fabius Vibulanus M Fossus L Ser gius Ftdenas A pestilence which raged this year gate ihem a respite from oiher troubles A temple was vowed to Apollo for the health of the people The duumvirs tried many expedients presc ibed in their books for ap peasing the anger of the gods and rescuing the people from the plague But after all the distemper made 346 TITUS LIVJUS Book IV i such havock in town and country both among the in habitants and their cattle that fearing the losses the far mers had sustained would bring 6n a famine they sWit to Etruria Pomptinum Cumae and last of all to Sicily for corn  No motion was made for a consular Comitia at this time so that L Pinarius Mamercinus L Furius Me dulinus and Sp Posthufnius Albus were chosen mi litary tribunes with consular power all of them Patri cians This year the plague began to subside nor was there any danger of famine as measures had been taken to prevent it The Volsci and Equi however in their councils of state and the Etrurians in a general diet held at the temple of Volumna were talking in a stile which shewed their views were not pacific The scheme however was put off for a year and it was provided by a decree that there should be no general diet sooner notwithstanding all that could he urged by the Vejentes that Veii would soon share the fate of Fidense which was now in ruins In the mean time at Rome the wealthy Plebeians who had long but to little purpose waited at the pool of promotion now that they had a respite from foreign wars began to hold meetings at the tribunes houses There they had private consultations complaining That the people were ill affected to their interest insomuch that the military tribunes with consular power had Â been elected for a great many years yet never one  Plebeian had been admitted to that honour their an cestors surely had seen a great way before them who had wisely provided that no Patrician should enjoy an Â office among the Plebeians or long before this time Â they would have been tribunes of the people so des picable now were the commons to their own order Â that they were held in no greater contempt by the se i nators than the people Others excused the people and laid all the blame upon the Patricians alledging Â That it was owing to their intrigues and cunning ad Â dress that the gate to promotion was shut against the Â commons For were these false lights extinguished and the people neither flattered nor bullied by the Patricians they would not in their suffrages forget their CHAP 26 ROMAN HISTORY 347 friends among the commons and their countenance once obtained they would not fail to promote them Wherefore it was resolved that a law should be pro posed in order to put an effectual stop to intriguing that for the future no person appearing as a candidate for an office should affect to be distinguished by the Whiteness of his robes At this period a dispute so trifling would be little regarded but however much it may appear like a farce now between the senators and the people then it was a very serious affair The tribunes prevail ed and the law passed As the present animosity of the people gave reason to suspect that they would be biassed in favour of their own party therefore to put it out of their power to prefer them the senate enacted that the comitia for electing consuls should be held this year CHAP XXVI The Tribunes compel the Consuls to name a Dictator DVICES from the Hernici and the Latins that the Volsci and Equi were in motion furnished an apology for this resolution T Quinctius Cincinnatus the son of Lucius sirnamed also Pennus and C Julius Men to were made consuls This dreadful war was no longer delayed for by means of a sacred law among them the most effectual means of raising an army having made up their quotas each nation led a formidable party to the Algidus the place agreed on for their general ren dczvcns There the TEqui and Volsci fortified two sepa rate encampments their generals discovering a much greater degree of attention in disciplining the troops and securing the lines than ever they had done on any for mer occasion  These accounts increased the consternation at Rome so much the more The senate were determined to name a dictator because though they had to do with a people Who had often shewn them their backs they seemed at this time resolved on an extraordinary effort and besides the strength of the Romans was impaired Y y the loss of some of their youth that had been cut off by the raging distemper But nothing gave them so much concern as the perverseness of the consuls their 348 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV x misunderstanding between themselves and crossing each oilier in every measure Some authors affirm that they vere defeated at the Algidus which was the reason that a dictator was named One titing nevertheless is certain that however ihey differed in other things they joined in opposing the senate s motion for naming a dictator till expresses upon expresses announced the progress of the enemy s arms and the consuls still persisted in their obstinacy Q Servilius Priscus who had enjoyed the highest honours of the state with great credit turning to the tribunes of the people told them  Since maiters are â now come to this extremity tribunes the senate calls upon you considering the danger to which the state is exposed to exert your authority and compel the con suls to name a dictator This was no sooner said than the tribunes who thought they had now a fair op portunity of extending their power withdrew a littte and returned with the following declaration in name of the college It is the pleasure of the tribunes that the consuls should obey the senate and if they persisted one moment longer in their opposition to the united  desire of that very august order they would command them instantly to be laid in jail The consuls chose rather to submit to the tribunes than to the senate upbraiding ihe fathers however that it was by them the consular authority was beiray ed and subjected to the power of the tribunes For if a tribune by his authority could oblige the consuls to do as he pleased and if he refused could also order him to jail what worse had even a private person to tear It fell by lot to Titus Quinctius to name the dictator for the matter could not otherwise be settled between the consuls He named his father in law A Posthu miu Tubertius a man exceedingly haisb and imperious to the dictatorship and he L Julius for his general of the horse A vacation was immediately proclaimed and nothing minded in all the city but preparations for war The trial of those who pleaded an exemption from the service was put off till the end of the war so that they whose title was doubtful suffered themselves to be en rol ed The Hernici and Latins were ordered to furnish their quotas and both paid respect to the dictator s or ders with all possible diligence  CHAP 27 ROMAN HISTORY 343  CHAP XXVII The Dictator marches against the Mqui and Volsci LL these things were performed with remarkable dispatch and the consul C Julius being left for the de fence of the city and L Julius general of the horse to provide for the sudden exigencies of the war that their motions might not be retarded with any thing they might want in the camp the dictator vowed in a form pre scribed by A Cornelius the pontifex Maximus the great games on account of the present confusion Then inarching out of the city and dividing his command with the consul Quinctius he came up with the enemy As they had observed that the enemy had two camps at no great distance from each other they likewise encamp ed about a mile from them the dictator at a place near Tusculum and the consul near Lnnuvium Thus they had tour armies and as many fortified camps with a plain in the middle not only large enough to admit of skirmishes between small parties but to contain the ar mies on both sides drawn up in battalia From the mo ment the camps lay in this opposite direction a single day did not pass without small encounters the dictator giving the soldiers full liberty to try their strength with the enemy that the event of these skirmishes might gra dually lead them to hopes of victory m a general battle Wherefore the enemy despairing of success by fight ing it fairly in the open plain attacked the consul s camp in the night staking their all upon a very uncer tain event The sudden shout they raiser not only alarmed the consul s guards and afterwards his whole army but roused the dictator himself In cases of im mediate danger the consul wanted not courage nor conduct A party was ordered to reinforce the guards at the gates and others to post themselves round the rampart In the dictator s camp as there was less hurry and confusion so he could the better provide for the present exigence Wherefore having immediately dis patched a reinforcement to the consul s camp under the command of his lieutenant general Sp Posthumius Q 350 TITUS LIVIUS Book IV Albus he mached himself with a part of his army fetching a small compass to a place quite out of sight of the action from whence he might fall on the enemy s rear before they could be aware of his design He left the care of the camp to Q Sulpicius one of his lieuten ants and pat M Fabius another lieutenant at the head of a party of horse with orders not to stir till day light as it was difficult to manage horse in such a hurly burly by night All that could be expected from the valour and con duct of the most able general was performed by the dictator But in one instance be has a peculiar merit and appears in a glorious point of view For having been informed for certain that the enemy in great numbers had left their own camp with a view to attack the consuls from a motion of his own he dispatched M Geganius with a select body of troops to invest the camp they had left Geganius fell upon them whilst they were entirely taken up about the event of their as sault and so totally regardless as to themselves that they had neither posted guards nor sentries and had almost made himself master of their camp before they were fully convinced that it was attacked He then gave the signal by raising smoke as had been concerted and when it was observed by the dictator he cried out that the enemy s camp was taken and ordered it to be pub lished everywhere Â CHAP XXVIII B Battle with the iEqui and Vohci Y this time day light began to appear when all their operations were laid open At the same time that Fabius had charged whh his horse the consul had made a sally from the camp upon the enemy by this time quite dejected The dictator from another quarter falling upon their second line and corps de reserve had posted his victorious army quite round the enemy who were wheeling about to examine whence he confused shouts and sudden commotions proceeded Wherefore being now surrounded on all sides and shut up in the CHAP 28 ROMAN HISTORY 351 centre they would have paid dear for their rebellion if Vectius Messius one of the Volsci a man more dis tinguished for his merit than his birth had not read his countrymen a severe lecture as they were already star ing about them in crowds calling aloud to them Are you determined to open your breasts exposed to the enemy s darts and to fall here unrevenged Was it for this purpose that you brought arms with you â Was this all you had in view when you were the first to take up arms mighty bold when there is no dan ger but in battle mere poltroons What do you look for standing here Do you imagine that some divi nity is to take you under his protection and extricate you from your present difficulty No you must open a passage with your swords Such of you as have any desire to see your houses fathers wives and children again come this way along with me whither you shall see me lead the way You are neither ob structed by walls nor entrenchments but by men armed like yourselves If you are equal in course you are certainly superior in point of necessity the last and most effectual weapon He had scarce finished this speech when he was fol lowed by his own people with repeated shouts as he was putting in practice what he had promised They at tacked with great fury the cohorts which opposed them under Posthnmius Albus and made them give way victorious as they had been till the dictator came up just as they were beginning to retire The whole heat of the battle turned that way The fate of the enemy depended on Messius alone The list of the wounded and killed was high on both sides On the side of the Romans the general officers did not escape without wounds Though the dictator was wounded in the shoulder though Fabius thigh was almost pinned to his horse and though the consul lost an arm none of them thought of quitting the field at so critical a juncture 352  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV  CHAP XXIX The Dictator returns in tiiumph f J HE fury of Messius attack with a troop of young intrepid soldiers opened them a passage over ihe bodies of their slain to the camp of the Volsci which wan not yet taken Our whole army followed him thiiher The consul pursued the scattered enemy up to their lines which he attempted to force and make himself master of their camp The dictator on another side led on bis troops to the attack The work here was full as warm as in the battle The consul it is said threw an ensign into the entrenchments with a view to ani mate the soldiers to advance with all the ardour possi ble and the first impression they made was owiug to their noble exertions in recovering their colours The dictator to having dismounted the palisadoes had al ready entered the enemy s camp sword in hand upon which the enemy began to lay down their arms and surrender at discretion This camp being also taken all the enemy the senators excepted were sold for slaves Part of the plunder was restored to the Latins and Hernici who could point out what belonged to themselves The remainder the dictator sold by auction and having left the consuls to command the troops that remained in the camp he returned to Rome in triumph and immediately laid down his office Those authors ybo aver that A Posthumius caused the head of his son to be struck off because he had quitted his post without orders upon seeing an opportu nity of striking a blow in which he succeeded greatly abridge the glory of this dictatori hip For my own part 1 cannot believe it and yet amidst so many opi nions one may be led to believe it What couviuces me that there must be a mistake is that such instances â of severity are calted the orders of Manlius and not of Posthumius and there is no doubt but he who first set such a rigid precedent would have entailed upon him uelf a title charactei istical of his severity Manlius wai  CHAP SO ROMAN HISTORY 353 also sirnamed the imperious but Posthumius was never distinguished by any mark of baseness C Julius the consul whilst his colleague was absent dedicated the temple of Apollo without casting lots Quini tins did not take it well and for that reason after be had disbanded his army and returned to the city he laid a complaint before the senate but without effect â It is observed though at that time the Romans seemed to have little concern in the matter that in this year so remarkable for great events tor the first time the Car thaginians who were one day to be such terrible ene mies to the Roman people taking advantage of the divi sions which prevailed in Sicily sent an army thither tÂ the assistance of one of the contending parties CHAP XXX The Vejentes in motion A terrible drought followed by a plague A R 323 HE Tribunes of the commons made a bustle in the city to get military tribunes with consular power elected for the ensuing year but they failed in the attempt Lucius Papirius Crassus and L Julius were made con suls The JEqui sent ambassadors requesting the senate to treat with them and when instead of a treaty a submission at discretion was mentioned the envoys ob tained a truce for eight years The Volsci after the check they had received at the Algidus were divided into parties and from disputes and reproaches between those who had declared for war and those who had ad  vised peace came at last to an open rupture  so that the Romans were now at peace with all their neighbours The consuls having discovered by means of one of the tribunes that the college were preparing a law for fix ing the extent of fines which would be highly agreeÂ able to the people they took the start of them by moving it themselves These consuls were succeeded by L Ser gius Fidenas for the second time and Hostus Lucretius Tricipitinus During their administration nothir g me morable occurred Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Titus Wuintius Pennus a second time were their successors in office A R 324 v   V 354 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV The Vejentes now renewed their incursions upon the Roman territories Fame will have it that some of the youth of Fidena were concerned in these depredations The cognizance of this affair was assigned to L Sergius Q Servilius and Mamercus Kmilius Some of the de linquents were banished to Ostia because they could not account for their absence from Fidenae thedayson which these trespasses happened An additional number of planters was sent to the colony who had the lands of those who fell in battle assigned them  This year was remarkable for an excessive drought For the rains not only tailed but the earth too dramed of its native moisture was scarcely sufficient to supply the fixed rivers In other places near the springs and rivulets which were quite dried up the want of water made terrible havoc among the cattle which perished for thirst Others of them were cut off by the murrain From them the infection spread among the people rag ing at first among the peasants and slaves But it was not long before the city swarmed with sick Nor were their bodies alone infected with the distemper but their minds were also seized with various superstitions most of them too of foreign growth Some impostors turned the credulity of the people to their account by pretend ing to prophecy and introducing into families new rites in offering sacrifices till the principal men of the state came to be acquainted with the public nuisance by see ing in all the streets and chapels foreign and uncommon expiations for recovering the favour of the gods The ffidiles were then enjoined to take care that none but the Roman gods should be worshipped nor these in any other manner than that which custom had established The chastisement of the Vejentes was reserved for C Servilius Ahala and L Papirius Mugilanus the consuls for the following year and even then they had a scru ple at declaring war or marching an army immediately against them before the Feciales should be sent to de mand restitution a step which they thought should be previous to all others It was but lately that they had measured their swords with the Vejentes at Nomenturo and Fidense where a truce but not a peace ensued The truce was indeed expired now but before that time they had been in arms The Feciales were however dispatch  CHAP 31 ROMAN HISTORY 355 ed but though they were sworn as usual and demand ed restitution in form no regard was paid to what they said After all a contest arose whether war should be denounced by order of the people or whether a decree of the senate might be sufficient The tribunes by threatening that they woutd stop the levies carried that the consuls should lay before the people what respected the war All the centuries voted for the war The peo ple had the better in this dispute having also obtained that no consuls should be elected for the succeeding year CHAP XXXI   i Miscarriage of the Military tribunes A Dictator named 17 OUR military tribunes were chosen with consular authority Titus Quinctius Pennus who had been consul C Furiu M Posthumius A Corneilius Cossus Of these Cossus staid at Rome to preside in the city the other three having completed the levies marched di rectly to Veii where they gave a signal proof of the pernicious effects in war of a plurality of commanders ii chief for as they differed in opinion and each of them insisted to have his own plan adopted they gave the enemy an opportunity of taking them at a disadvantage For while the army had no distinct orders one command ing the signal to be given for battle another a retreat to be sounded the Vejentes seized that opportunity of attacking them They were put in disorder and fled back to their camp which was hard by so that they were more disgraced than hurt â The city unaccustomed to defeats was greatly afflict ed  they hated tribunes and cried out for a dictator there the whole hopes of the city seemed to centre But here again religion threw an obstacle in the way that a dictator could not be named but by a consul With re spect to this point the augurs were consulted who sa tisfied their scruples A Cornelius named Mamercus Emilius dictator who in return named him general of the horse Consequently whenever the circumstances of the state required exalted merit the censors degradation had no influence to prevent the people from vesting the admi nistration in a family which had been unjustly disgraced 356 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV The Vejentes elated with their success sent ambas sadors to all the nations of Etruria boasting that they had defeated three Roman generals in one pitched battle they could not however prevail with any of these siates openly to espouse their cause but the hopes l plunder drew volunteers from all quarters The Fidenates were the only people who were pleased to ami And as if it had been unlawful to commence a war without some ex traordinary guilt on their side they sullied their arms with the blood of the new coiouy as they had on another occasion done with that of the ambassadors and then joined the Vejentes The question now between the chiefs of these two nations came to be whether they should make Veii or Fidenae the seat of the war Fi den was agreed on as the most proper Wherefore cros sing the Tiber the Vejentes carried the war to Fidenae Rome was in ihe utmost terror  wherefore recallingtheir army from Veii whose spirits were much depressed on account of the late miscarriage a camp was formed be fore the gate Collina Guards were posted on the walls the administration of justice was suspended the shops were shut and all things resembled a camp more than a city Â CHAP XXXII The dictator addresses the People Action with the Confederates HILST the city was in this consternation the dic tator seat about public criers through all the streets to Summon an assembly of the people when he began with reproaching them For suffering themselves to be so much alarmed at the most trivial accidents Thai an inconsiderable los  not occasioned by the enemy s va lour nor the cowardice of the Roman army but by a disagreement among the commanders should make them afraid of the Vejentes an enemy who had fled before them six several times and of the Fidenates whose capital they had taken oltener if possible than they had even laid siege to it The Romans and the enemy were the same sort of men they bad been for so many ages With regard to courage strength of body  CHAP 32 ROMAN HISTORY 357 and arms the very same That he too was the same dictator Mamercus Emilius who formerly rooted the confederate armies of the Fidenates and Vejentes at Nomentum even when supported by the Falisci That A Cornelius his general of the horse would exert the same bravery hi battle now as in the former war when only a legionary tribune that he slew Lars Tolnnrnius king of the Vejentes in sigftt of both armies and carried the opirria spolia to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius That therefore they ought to remember that on their side they had triumphs spoils and vic tory that on the enemy s there was only the guilt of murdering ambassadors contrary to the law of nations the massacre of the colony of FidensB in time of pro found peace  the violation of the truce and revolts seven times repeated notwithstanding their bad success They should therefore fly to their arms and he was very certain so soon as the two armies were engaged these impious enemies would have but a short time to rejoice over the disgrace of the Roman army Then would the Roman people be fully convinced that they who had chosen him dictator for the third time had â done ihe commonwealth much more important service than they who had set a mark of infamy on his second dictatorship because he had set bounds to the tyranny of the censors Having then made proper vows to the gods he took the field and eucarriped fifteen hundred paces beyond Fidisnav supported on the right by the mountains and on the left by the Tiber He ordered Titus Quinctius Pennus his lieutenant ge neral to seize the mountains and gain the eminence in the enemy s rear where he might Iy concealed The itetftday when the Etrurians highly elevated with their success on a former occasion which they owed more to fortune than valour offered him battle he waited alittlc till his scouts brought him intelligence that Quinctius had gained the eminence near the castle of Fidenae and then set up his  standard leading on his infantry already drawn up by a quick march against the enemy at the same Jirne enjoining the general of the horse not to engage without His permission for that he would give him the signal whenever the assistance of the horse became necessary 358 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV and in the mean time that he had only to think of the royal combat the royal spoils of Romulus and Jupiter Feretrius in the time of action The armies charged each other with great ardour on both sides The Romans exasperated to the highest de gree insulted their enemies with the opprobrious names of villainous Fidenates felonious Vejentes truce break ers the cruel murderers of their ambassadors the inhu man butchers of the Roman colony perfidious allies dastardly enemies and thus gave full vent to their in dignation in words as well as actions l CHAP XXXIII Defeat of the Vejentes and Fidenates JL HEY had already begun to give way upon the first charge when the gates of Fidtnae on a sudden flew open and a strange kind of army sallied out till that moment never seen nor heard of A huge multitude armed with fire and blazing all over with the flames of lighted torches ran furiously against their enemies with a kmd of enthusiastic rage and by this new mode of fighting put the Romans in some confusion Then the dictator to animate the baitle having given the signal to the general of the horse and called down Quiuctius from the heights he flew in person to the left wing which terrified at the appearance of a conflagration ra ther than a battle had begun to draw back from the flames and cried out with an audible voice  Will you then be driven from your ground with nothing but smoke like a swarm of bees ami fly before an unarm ed enemy Will you uot extinguish these flames by your swords If you are to fight with fire and not the sword will not each of s ou for his own part wrest these torches from ihe enemy and turn them against themselves Go remember the Roman name and your own valour as well as the gallantry of your an cestors turn these flames against the enemy s capital and destroy Fideive by its own fires which yon have not been able to conciliate by all your favours The blood of your ambassadors and colony and the depre  CHAP 33 ROMAN HISTORY 359 â dations made on your country require this at your â hands The dictator s orders set the whole army in motion Some of the torches that had been thrown were re covered some were wrested by force from the enemy so that on both sides they were armed with torches The general of the horse too charged on a plan entirely new He ordered the cavalry to draw tha bits out of the horses mouths and clapping spurs to his own was the first to drive full speed into the middle of the flames whither he was followed by the rest driving at full gallop against the enemy A mixture of smoke and dust raised by themselves carried off the glancing of the light from the eyes both of the men and horses nor had the appear ance which had confounded the men the least impres sion on the horses so that the cavalry wherever they went beat down and trampled under foot aH before them Then a new shout was raised which surprised and attracted the attention of both armies till the dicta tor cried out Â It is Quinctius the lieutenant general who with the troops under his command has attacked â the enemy s rear and then with great cries pushed the attack with greater vigour than ever Whilst two armies carrying on two different attacks hemmed in and pressed the Etrurians in front and in rear so that they could neither retire into their camp nor effectuate their escape to the mountains whence a new enemy had come down upon them and everywhere the greatest part of the Vejentes fled with the utmost precipitation to the Tiber and all the Fidenates who were yet left alive to their capital Fidenae Their flight and terror hurried them to certain death Some of the Vejentes were cut off upon the banks of the river others were pushed into the water and car ried down by the stream even those who could swirn sunk through weariness wounds and fear so tfiat few out of a great number made the other side â The other part of vhe confederates fled through the camp inio the city whither the Romans pursued them with great fury especially Quinctius and those who had come down with him from the heights being still fresh as having only advanced towards the end of the battle TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV CHAP XXXIV Fidenee taken and plundered The Dictator returns in  triumph J HESE having entered the gates of the city pell mell with the enemy immediately got upon the top of the wall and from thence made a signal to the rest of the army that they were in possession of the town which was no sooner observed by the dictator who by this time had taken possession of the enemy camp by them just abandoned than he led his troops to the gate impa tient as they were to leave their ranks and rifle the camp but now encouraged to hope for greater plunder in the city and being admitted within the walls he marched straight t o the citadel whither he saw the enemy flying in crowds The slaughter in the city was noihing short of what it had been in the field till the Fidenates laid down their arms and begijmg only for their lives sur rendered at discretion The city and the camp were both plundered by tlie troops Next day the prisoners were disposed of by lot one being assigned to each of the knights and centurions and to such as had distinguished themselves more parti cularly two a piece The rest were sold to the highest bidder and then the dictator led back his artny crown ed with laurels and enriched with plunder and entered the city in triumph He then ordered the general of the horse to resign his office and abdicated his own the sixteenth day after he had received it leaving the city in the most profound peace and tranquillity which he had found involved in war and in extreme consternation Some annals make mention of a naval engagement which the Romans had with the Vejentes at Fidervee a circumstance as impossible as it appears incredible for even at this day the river is not broad enough for that purpose  and if we may believe an ient authors it was then not so broad as at present Perhaps the Romans may have driven off some boats which came to assist the â Vejantes in crossing the river and that circumstance has  CHAP 35 ROMAN HISTORY 631 been magnified which is not uncommon by those who were fond of the empty title of a naval victory A CHAP XXXV Celebration of games Complaints of the Tribunes L SEMPRONIUS ATTRATINUS Lucius Quinc tius Cmcinnatus L Furius Medullinus and L Horatius Barbatus were elected military tribunes with consular power for the ensuing year The Vejeutes obtained a truce for twenty years and the Equi for three only though they had insisted for a longer term The city now was at rest from civil dissensions The fotlowing year which was marked neither by a foreign war nor domestic disturbances was however rendered famous by the games which had been vowed in time of war the preparations for them made by the military tribunes and the vast concourse of the neighbouring people The tribunes with consular power were Ap Claudius Crassus Sp Nautius Rutilus L Sergius Fide nas Sextus Julius Julus What enhanced the pleasure of the entertain ment to the strangers who had come with the consent of their respective stales to be spectators was the kind and engaging manner in which they were treated After the celebration of these games the tribunes made seditious harangues to the people reproaching them severely  For their blind and stupid admiration of those whom at bottom they hated which kept them â voluntarily in eternal slavery that they not only durst â not aspire to the hope of obtaining the consulship with â the Patricians but could not even think of themselves or their friends in the nomination of military tribunes â in which they had an equal right with the senate It was no longer a wonder that nobody gave himself â trouble about the interests of the people for who would expose himself to danger and fatigue where neither honour nor profit was to be expected  There was nothing on earth but men would attempt if their rewards were â proportioned to their endeavours It was a thing there fore neither to be expected nor desired that any tri â bune of the people should plunge himself headlong in 362 TITUS LIVIUS  BOOK IV to disputes where the danger was so great and the ad vantage nothing from which he could promise himself â for certain eternal persecution from the senators with whom he was to enter the lists and from the people from whom are all his exertions no further honour or â regard  It is from great honours that great courage proceeds and no Plebeian could think meanly of hiui â self if he ceased to be despised by others They â ought certainly at least to make a trial in an instance or two whether any Plebeian be capable to support the weight of a great office in the state and whether it is so prodigious an affair to find a man of real merit and valour born among the people After many a struggle it was carried that military tri bunes with consular power might be elected and that too from the body of the people Men who had distin guished themselves both in peace and war offered their services In the first years they were insulted rejected and exposed to the ridicule of the senators and at last they would no longer lay themselves open to such af fronts No good reason could be assigned why a law should not be entirely abolished that gave a right which they were never to use for it would be less shameful for them to be excluded by an unjust law than passed by and neglected for their own personal defects CHAP XXXVI Scheme nf the Military Tribunes JL HE applause with which harangues of this kind were received induced some of the Plebetan order to stand candidates for the office of military tribune promising some of them to get one some another law passed for the interest of the commons during their administration The people were encouraged to hope for a division of the public lands among them an establishment of new co lonies and a tax to be laid on ihe landed interest to raise a fund for the payment of the army The military tri bunes took the advantage of a season when few of the people were in town having given the senators secret in timation to return against a certain day iu absence ef the    CHAP 37 ROMAN HISTORY 36 tribunes of the people to pass a decree that as there was advice that the Volsci had taken the field to ravage the country of the Hernici the military tribunes should set out immediately to inform themselves on the spot and that in the mean time an assembly for the election of consuls should be held They left at their departure as praefect of the city Appius Claudius the son of the decemvir a young ma I gistrate of great fire and vivacity and who from his cradle had imbibed an aversion to the people and their tribunes The tribunes afterwards had no room to con tend with those who had procured this act of the senate because they were absent nor with Appius because the affair was entirely over and completed    â CHAP XXXVII    Sempronius acts incautiously J HE fasces were conferred on C Sempronius Atratinus and Q Fabius Vibulanus An event which happened this year though it has no immediate connection with the affairs of Rome deserves to be taken notice of here Vulturnum a city belonging to the Etrurians now cal led f uj iua was taken by the Samnites It got the name of Capua from Capys the general of the Samnites or which is more probable from the openness of the coun try However that be they got possession of it in this manner The Etrurians being quite exhausted by a tedious war the Samnites were first admitted to settle with them in the cily and its territory and some time after taking the advantage of a public solemnity the new comers fell upon the first inhabitants buried in wine and sleep and murdered them all in the night Immediately on the back of these transactions the consuls mentioned above entered upon their office on the thirteenth day of De cember By this time the envoys reported that a war  Capua was considered as one of the three most considerable ci ties in the wortd and for some time rivalted both Rome and Car thage Its ruins stitt remain near the village Sancta Maria di Capoa situated in one of the finest provinces of the kingdom of Naples SG4  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV with the Volsd was unavoidable which was also confirm ed by dispatches from the Latins and Hernici importing that never upon any former occasion had the Volsci ap peared more in earnest either with respect to the choice of their generals or expediting their levies declaring upon all occasions that they must now bid adieu to arms and war for ever and tamely submit to the yoke of ser vitude or no longer shew themselves inferior to those with whom they contended for sovereignty in personal bravery patience under hardships and military disci pline These accounts were far from being groundless though they seemed to make no great impression on thefathers and C Sempronius who by lot had the command in that war trusting entirely to fortune as a thing incapable of change especially as he led a victorious army against a conquered enemy performed all the duties of his office without caution or care insomuch that there was more of the Roman discipline to be found in the Volscian army than in their own For which reason fortune as it has often happened before shifted to that side where merit was most conspicuous In the first engagement which Sempronius hazarded without the Ieast precaution or consideration having formed no corps de reserve and made a very injudicious disposition of his horse before the action the shouts gave the first intimation of the turn matters were like to take these raised by the enemy were brisker and more con stant  whilst on the side of the Romans they were con fused unequal faint and often repeated and by their discord expressive of the fear which had taken possession within Encouraged by this the enemy advanced with redoubled fury pressed hard upon them with their shields and plied them with their brandished swords On the other side the soldiers siood staring about them their helmets nodding on their heaJs and being totally at a  loss how to act ran trembling together in crowds The colours sometimes standing still were abandoned by the front ranks at other times they were moved back and planted among their own squadrons As yet they had not resolved to fly nor were the enemyabsolutely certain of victory The Romans however acted rather CHAP 38 ROMAN HISTORY 365 upon the defensive than the offensive whilst the Volsci advanced their standards pressed hard upon the Roman ranks and saw many more of them fail than fly  CHAP XXXVIIt Tlie gallantry of Sertus Tempawus   DY this time they began to give way everywhere arid it was in vain for the consul to employ either exhor tations or reproaches his authority and the majesty of his person were equally disregarded and they would immediately have turned their backs upon the enemy had not Sextus Tempanlus a decurio of the horse by a lucky thought and spirited execution prevented a total defeat He cried out with a loud voice to the horse to dismount if they would save the commonwealth The whole squadrons obeyed him to a man as if the consul himself had given the orders  Unless says he  this armed body of ours check the enemy s ardour the Ro man power is no more Follow my lance instead of an ensign and show both the Romans and the Volsci that on foot as well as on horseback you are irresisti ble All joined in a shout to express their approba tion and he advanced at their head carrying his spear aloft wherever they appeared they cleared their way  and covering themselves with their shields charged the enemy Where the Romans were most pressed where they once attacked they were sure to reinstate the for tune of the day nor is there the least question that if their number could have admitted them to shew them selves everywhere but they would have obliged the ene my to fly CHAP XXXIX A drawn battle JC S their impetuosity was everywhere irresistible the general of the Volsci ordered his troops to open a pas sage for the new battalion with the round bucklers till their impetuosity should hurry them too far tor rejoining 366 TITUS LIVIUS BOOKIV their own army This happened accordingly The ca valry were blocked up and found it quite impracticable to return the way they had advanced the enemy hav ing closed and in that part of the line standing in very close array The consul and Roman legions having lost sight of the battalion which was the life and soul of their army and fearing those generous troops would be blocked up and overpowered by the enemy outbraved every dan ger for their relief The Volsci making a double froat on the one side sustained the charge of the consul and his legions and on the other pressed hard upon Tem panius and his cavalry who having often attempted to break through the enemy s ranks to join the main body of their army without effect at last took possession of an eminence where throwing themselves into a ring they defended themselves with such bravery as cost the Volsci dear Only the night put an end to the battle The consul on his part kept the enemy sufficiently employed while any light remained Night drew off both sides equally uncertain which was victorious Their ignorance in this respect struck such a panic on both that leaving their wounded and a great part of their baggage behind both concluding themselves de feated made the best of their way to the mountains which lay nearest them The eminence however con tinued to be invested till after midnight when the be siegers being informed that their camp was abandoned and not doubting but the army had been also defeated went off in a fright under cover of the darkness the best way they could Tempanius fearing an ambuscade kept his post till day light when he went out with a few of his followers to reconnoitre the enemy and found upon inquiry at some of the wounded enemy that the Volsci had aban doned their camp Then with pleasure calling down all his soldiers from the hill he entered the Roman camp and there found the like solitude and total desertion as in the enemy s

When the cavalry appeared at a distance the consternation was still greater as being uncertain who they were The moment it was discover ed that these troops were the horse returned safe and victorious their fear was converted into such an excess of joy that the acclamations of those who congratulated them were heard over all the city and those families that but a little before were in the deepest concern cry ing out that their friends were gone ran out to the streets in transports and the mothers and wives quite out of their senses forgetting decency in their present extasy ran out to meet the troops each embracing her own with such expressions of tenderness and tears of joy as almost approached distraction The tribunes of the people who had impeached M Posthumius and T Quinctius on account of the battle ofVeii lost by then means thought this a noble op portunity in the present resentment of the people against Sempronius for reviving tlie odium against them Wherefore having called an assembly they bawled out with great warmth thai because the commonwealth had been betrayed by its generals at Veii and their fault had remained unpunished the army had again been be trayed by the consul in the country of the Volsci the bravest of ihe cavalry given up to destruction and the camp shamefully abandoned One of the tribunes C Icilius ordered the knight Tempanius to be cited before them and interrogated him as follows Sextus Tempanius I ask you Whether you think â that the consul Sempronius chose a proper time to 368 BOOK IV TITUS LIVIUS come to an engagement supported his line of battle with reinforcements or discharged any of the duties of a good consul â When you saw the legions routed did you not of your own accord prevail on the ca valry to dismount and reinstate the battle When you and your followers were separated from the main body of the army did the consul come in person or send any other to your relief Were you joined by any reinforcement next day Did not you and your battalion nuke good your way to the camp by means of your own bravery atone Did you find the consul or any armv there Was not the camp abandoned and the wounded soldiers left in it These question you are to answe this day as a man of honour and a soldier by whose bravery alone the republic has been saved in this w ir To conclude where is C SÂ n pronius â What is become of our legion Did the consul and the army abandon you or you them are we the conquerors or the vanquished CHAP XLI Tempanius1 sensible and modest answer J EMPANIUS s answer to these interrogatories is said to have been simple but sensible and in the stile of a soldier neither swelled with encomiums on himself nor enlivened with censures upon others He said  That it did not become him as a soldier to decide with re spect to the military abilities of his general It was the business of the Roman people to have been satisfied as to these when at the general election they chose him consul Wherefore it was highly improper to in terrogate him upon the plans and designs of a comman der in chief or the political virtues of a consul points that required experience and the penetration of the ablest heads to discuss that for his own part he could only speak what Be saw that before he was separated from the army he observed the consbl fighting at the head of his troops encouraging the soldiers and al ways in the midst of the Roman ensigns exposed to the darts of the enemy That afterwards he lost sight  CHAP U ROMAN HISTORY 369  of the Roman army but by the shouts and cries which he heard he judged that the action continued till night Considering the enemy s numbers he did pot believe it was possible to force a passage to the rising ground which he had seized That he knew not where the army was but he had reason to imagine for the preservation of the army the consul had retired to some place of greater safety than his own camp as he him self in a case of necessity had secured himself and fol lowers by the natural strength of the ground he had taken That it was his own opinion the affairs of the Volsci were in no better condition than those of the Romans and that the darkness had concealed from both parties their own situation and that of each other He was then at his request that they would detain him no longer as he was quite exhausted with the fatigue of his march and the pain of his wounds dismissed with the applauses of all the people for his moderation still more than for his valour and good con duct This scene was scarcely over when the consul ap peared at the temple of Quies in the Lavinian way Thither horses and carriages and other conveyances were sent from the city to take up the soldiers quite spent with the fatigue of the battle and travelling all night A little after the consul made his entry into the city and was not at greater pains to clear himself with re spect to the late miscarriage than to give Tempanius the praises due to his merit Whilst the state was afflicted on account of their late disaster and highly dissatified with their generals M Posthumius who had been one of the military tribunes with consular power that commanded at Veil was im peached before the people and fined 16 000 asses of brass Titus Quinciius his colleague laid the whole blame of that miscarriage upon Posihumius who was already condemned and out of regard to his great ser vjces agai ist the Volsci when consul under the dicta tor Posthumius Tubertus and at Fidense in quality of lieutenant general to Mamercus Emilius another dicta  Â 32 5 10 570 TITUS UVHIS BOOK IV tor he was acquitted by all the tribes The memory of his venerable father Cincinnatus is said to have been of great use to him on this occasion and the intercession of Capitolinus Quiuctius now spent with years who in treated the people in the mÂ st humble manner that now when his life was so near a close they would not make him the messenger of news so very distressing to Cincinnatus CHAP XLII Generous conduct of the four Tribunes with respect a Seaipronius SEX TEMPANIUS A Selling L Antistius Sex Pompilius in their absence were elected tribunes by the people The three last the horse had chosen for their centurions by the advice of Tempanius The senate finding that the name of consul out of odium to Seru pronius gave offence ordered military tribunes with consular power 10 be created in consequence of which the choice fell upon L Maulius Capitolinus 1 Antonius Merenda and L Papirius Mugillanus In the begin ning of the year L Hortensius one of the tribunes cite Sempronius the late consul to take his trial and when four of his colleagues conjured him in presence of the Roman people not to harrass their general who was innocent and could be reproached with nothing but bis ill fortune Hortensius took it amiss imagining they only meant to try his resolution as the delinquent rather depended on the assistance than the mediation of the tribunes which was intended only for show wherefore turning immediately to Sempronius he asked him â What was become of his Patrician spirit and that confidence with which a consciousness of innocence would inspire him when he a consul took shelter under the shadow of the tribunes Then turning to his colleagues â But if I should persist in my prosecution of this delinquent what part will you act Will you rob the people of their judicative privileges and overturn the power of the iribunes They replied that the Roman people had indisputably a supreme authority over Seraprooni  CHAP 43 ROMAN HISTORY tfl and every member of the state and for their own part they had neither the inclination nor the power of depriv ing the people of their prerogative in judging the accus ed but if their earnest intieaties in behalf of their ge neral who had been to them an indulgent parent could not prevail they would go into mourning with him Nay replied Hortensius  but that shall not be the commons of Rome shall not see their tribunes into mourning 1 have nothing farther to say against C Sempronius who by his behaviour in command could endear him so effectually to his soldiers The gra eful affection of the four tribunes did not give greater pleasure i the senators and people who were equally affected than he good nature of Horten sius which disposed him to yield so readily to their reasonable request Fortune did not continue long to fawn upon the 5kjni whose mercury rose as high upon this doubtful victory of the Volsci as if they themselves bad been crowned with laurels CHAP XUII The JEqui in motion suppressed New contest â Wise counsel of L Papirius Mugilanus L EXT year in the consulship of Numerius Fabius Vibulanus and T Juinctius Capitolinus the son of Capitolmus Fabius who h d got the direction of the war by lot performed nothing memorable for the ffiqui had no sooner shown their faces than like a convention of cowards they took to their heels J so that the consul gained no great honour and of course was refused a tri umph Yet because this victory served in some measure to extenuate the reproach of the Sempronian disaster he waÂ permitted to enter the city with an ovation As this war was brought to a conclusion with less trouble than had been apprehended so also in the city there anise out of a profound calm an unexpected storm of dissen sion between the senate and the people which had its foundation in a proposal to double the number of the quaestors 373 TITUS UVRTS  BOOK IV The consuls had moved that besides the two city juie tors there should be two others created to attend the army and assist the consuls in time of war This motion was highly approved of by the fathers bat the tribunes of the commons were determined to oppose it unless the consuls added a clause that some of the qucestors who till then had always been Patricians shoutd be chosen  out of the Plebeiaji order J The consuts and a so the senators at first opposed TlSis u endment with all their might but afterwards yielded so far that in the electioti of quaestors as in that of military tribunes with consular power the people should be at liberty to cliuse whom they thought proper When this proposal was not ac cepted they dropt the design of increasing the number of quaestors entirely The tribunes took up the affair where the senators left it and soon after introduced other seditious claims and amongst t he rest that of the Agrarian law Upon ac count of these commotions the senate wanted that con suls rather than military tribunes should be chosen but as they could not by reason of the opposition of the tri bunes pass an act for that purpose from consuls the administration returned to an inter regnum and even that cost no small contest as the tribunes were indefa tigable in their endeavours to prevent a meeting of the senate The best part of next year was spent in disputes be tween the new tribunes and the gentlemen who acted successively in the capacity of inter rex the tribunes sometimes preventing a meeting of the senate for elect ing an inter rex and when one had been choÂ en raising a dust to prevent an act of senate from being passed for holding the consular romitia till at length L Papirius Mugilianus then inter rex commenting vt ry sharply on the conduct of both Patricians and tribunes told them That the republic abandoned as it was and neglected by men was yet under the peculiar care and protec tion of the gods who had provided for its satety in the truce wiih the Vejentes and the inaction of the jEqui But should the motions of any of these nations raise an alaVm it was evident that they were determined to suffer the state to be ruined without a Patrician magi  CHAP 44 ROMAN HISTORY 375 strate at its head At present there was no army nor general to raise one Will a civil war at homer be any defence against the incursions of a foreign enemy On the contrary should we be attacked by both these calamities at once the power of all tlie gods would be barely sufficient to save us from destruction Ought not then the contending parties to abate something of their high pretensions and meet each other halfway to restore harmony to the state Let the senate per mit military tribunes to be elected instead of consuls and the tribunes lay the people under no restraint in the choice of four quaestors out of either order as they shall think proper CHAP XLIV Trial of Sempronius and a Vestal HE Comitia for the eleciion of tribunes met first When L Quincttus Cincinnaius for the third time L Furius Medullinus for the second M Manlius and A Sempronius Atratinus all Patricians were chosen Sem pronius presided in the election of Quxstors when among some other Plebeians Antistius and Sextus Pom pilius both tribunes recommended the first his son and the last his brother as candidates for the quasstorship but they had neither interest nor a sufficient number of votes to prevent the people from preferring those on acÂ count of their high birth whose fathers and grand fa thers they had seen vested with the consulate The tribunes upon this repulse and particularly An tistius and Pompilius enraged almost to madness cried out  That they could not conceive how the people could be so insensible to the services they had done them the ill treatment they had received from the senators and the pleasure of putting in practice a new right they had not before as not to honour one of their own number if not with the dignity of a military tribune at least with that of a quaestor What two tribunes of the commons vested with that sacred power insti tuted for the support of liberty the one recommend ing and soliciting for his son and the other for his R 37 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV â brother and both disregarded There must infallibly â have been some trick here and Sempronius in presid ing at the comitia has discovered more art than hones â ty For which reason they hail a right to con plaio that their friends had been disappointed by his uncan â did procedure As Atratinus himself was above their reach both on account of his known integrity and the high station in which he served they turned all their fury against C Sempronius his relation and by the as sistance of M Canuleius their colleague revived the prosecution against him for the disgrace he had brought upon the state in the war with the Volsci It was not long after that till the tribunes proposed in the senate a division of the lands among the people a â motion which C Sempronius had always most zealously opposed with a view as it turned out to lessen his in terest with the Patricians should he appear more pas sive or expose himself to the resentment of the people at the time of his trial should he persist in his opposition But he raiher chose to be the butt of rheir malice than expose his character by deserting the public cause though at the hazard of his own and therefore con tinued firm in his former opinion  That it would be bad policy to gratify three factious tribune s who in fact did not want to get land for the people but to raise the people s resentment against him For his own part he was determined to stand the storm without flinching and he saw no reason why he or any other citizen of Rome should be considered by the senate jn such an important point of view that in saving bim the state should be exposed to any hardship With the same steadiness on the day of his trial he pleaded his own cause but when the senators had tried every method to soften the people in his favour thev were still inexorable and condemned him in a fine of 5 OOO asses of brass This year too Posthumia a vestal virgin was im peached for incontinence She was found innocent as to the crime but she had paid too much attention to dress 3nd been too free in her behaviour for a vestal which  f 8  8  8 CHAP 45  ROMAN HISTORY 3 75 had Treated suspicions to her disadvantage Where fore her trial was put off for want of evidence f and she was afterwards acquitted but the high priest with the consent and approbation of the whole college admonish ed her to behave with more prudence and less gaiety for the future and to have more regard to modesty than taste and elegance in her dress â This year also Cumsc a city till then possessed by the Greeks was taken by the people of Capua In the following year the mili tary tribunes with consular power were Agrippa Mene nius Lanatus P Lucretius Tricipitinus and Sp Nautius Rutilus CHAP XLV Conspiracy of the Slaves Motions of the jEqui and Lavicans Obstinacy of the Military Tribunes JL HIS year was more remarkable for a lucky escape the Roman people had from a dangerous plot than any evil consequence that attended it The slaves had form ed a conspiracy to set the city on fire in several places at a distance from each other and with arms in their hands to seize the citadel and capitol whilst the people were employed in saving their houses But Jupiter frustrated the effect of their criminal intentions for the plot being discovered by two of their number the con spirators were secured and punished with death The informers for so Important a service were rewarded with their liberty and 10 000 asses of brass t weighed out ai the treasury A capital sum in those days After this the JEqui began to make preparations for war and besides advices were received at Kome the certainty of which was not to be doubted thai the peo ple of Lavicum who cm no former occasion had been at war with the Romans were associating themselves with these old enemies of the stale The war with the jEqui was in a manner become annual but ambassadors were  06 suspic umem â rather ab fu pkione â f Ampliatwn ab amplius censendo adjourned sisted for a new bearnj  Â 32 5 9f S76 TITUS L1VIUS BOOK IV immediately sent to Lavicum who returned with ambi guous answers such as that the people of Lavicum bad vot yet begun to make preparations for war but did not seem as if they would be long at peace The Tusculans were charged to keep a strict eye on Lavicum that DO JMJW commotions might arise there Soon after the military tribunes with consular power viz L Sergius Fidenas M Papirius Mugillanus and C Servilius the son of Priscus who had been dictator when Fidense was taken were chosen for the next year and had entered upon their office advices came by en voys from Tusculum  That the Lavicans had taken up arms joined the troops of the JEqui ravaged the coun try about Tusculum and encamped at the Algidus War was then declared against the Lavicans and the se nate enacted that two of the military tribunes should march against the enemy and the third remain at Rome for the government of the city This occasioned high words among the military tribunes each of them pre tending that he was most capable of commanding the army and expressing his contempt of the civil govern ment of the city as a mean and disagreeable office The senators observing with no small wonder a misun derstanding so indecent among them Q Servilius told them  since you have no respect either for the senate or for the commonwealth paternal authority shall put an end to the dispute My son without casting lots shall take upon him the care of the city I wish those who are so fond of war may discover more prudence and unanimity in conducting it than they seem to do do in desiring it CHAP XLVI Misunderstanding and miscarriage of the Tribunes A Dictator chosen X S it was judged improper to raise recruits indiscri minately from among all the people ten tribes were drawn by lot and the two tribunes having enlisted tlie young men belonging to them led them out to the field The misunderstanding which began to appear between CHAP 46 ROMAN HISTORY 377 them in the city their desire of commanding alone be ing not in the least abated broke out with still greater fury in the camp In sentiment they never agreed and each stuck inflexibly to his own Each was for  having no counsels followed and no orders executed but his own The only point agreed in was a sovereign contempt for each other till upon a remonstrance from their lieutenant generals matters were so ordered that they were to command each his day alternately Vhen these accounts came to Rome Servilins whose experience was equal to his years is said to have im plored the gods that the discord of the tribunes might not prove more fatal to the commonwealth than it had been at Veii and as if he had seen that some great ca lamity was at hand he pressed his soji to make levies and be ready to take the field He was not mistaken Sergius on one of the days when he commanded in chief was drawn by a feigned retreat of the ZEqui into a steep and disadvantageous ground close under their lines vainly imagining he would make himself master of iheir camp By a sudden sally from the canty the JRqai drove them down the precipice nudjmore of them were dashed to pieces by the weight of the fall down the declivity than fell by the precipitancy of their flight With much difficulty the Romans kept possession of their camp that day and the next when they aw themselves invested almost on every side by the enemy they made their escape out at a back gate and shamefully aban doned it The generals with thtir lieutenants and the best troops that did not quit the ensigns retired to Tus culum whilst the rest dispersing themselves about the country came to Rome by different ways and repre sented their loss much greater than it really was At Rbme the alarm was less both because in their fears they had anticipated all that happened and young Servilius had got together a new body of recruits to as sist them upon occasion The inferior magistrates also by his order quieted the commotions in the city and the couriers who had been lispatchÂ d to inform themselves of the state of the armies brought advice that the ge neral and their troops were at Tusculum and that the enemy still continued in their old camp But what reÂ 37 S TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV vived their courage in a peculiar manner was the no mination of Quinctius Servilius Priscus dictator by or der of the senate a man of whose penetration the state had had proofs on former occasions and especially with  respect to the event of this war he being the only OIK who before the late miscarriage seemed to foreste the consequence of the misunderstanding of the tribunes According to some authors he cbo e his son general of the horse by whom in quali y of military tribune he bad been himself declared dictator Others however say that Semlius Ahala was made general of the horse upon this occasion Wherefore taking the field with his new army he reinforced it with that at Tusculum and encamped within two miles of the enemy CHAP XLVII Tlie defeat sf the JRqui and Lavicans and capture of Lu uicum for which a Roman colony vias voted T J HE neglect and insolence which had formerly pre vailed in the Roman generals went over to the Ivrr with their good success The dictator having se nt hii horse in the beginning of the battle to charge the ene my s front which was soon put into disorder ordered the legions to advance to support them with all expedition and observing an ensign slacken his pace he killed him on the spot The ardour of the Roman troops was too much for the Equi to sustain wherefore being over powered in the field they fled with great precipitation to their camp which required still less time and trouble to force than it had done to beat them in the field The camp being taken and rifled the dictator gave all the plunder of it to the troops The horse who had pursued the enemy in their flight out of the camp having brought advice that the routed Lavicans and a great part of the Equi had fled to Lavicum the army marched thither next day invesied the place and having taken it by escalade it was plun dered by the soldiers The dictator marched back his victorious army to Rome and resigned the dictatorship eight days after his nomination  CHAP 48 ROMAN HISTORY 37 The senate before the tribunes had time to speak of a distribution of the territory of Lavicum and by that means revive the disputes about the Agrarian law at a full meeting very judiciously voted  that a colony should be planted at Lavicum Fifteen hundred citi zens went thither to each of whom were assigned two Roman acres f After the capture of Lavicum for the first year Agrippa Menenius Lanatus L Servilins Struc tus and P Lucretius Tficipitinus all for the second time and Sp Rutilius Crassus  and for the year follow ing A Sempronius Atratinus for the third time and M Papirius Mugilanus with Sp Nautius Rutilius for the second time presided in quality of military tribunes with consular power During these two years all was quiet abroad but the domestic tranquillity was greatly disturbed with disputes about the Agrarian law CHAP XLVII I Contests about the Agrarian law Advice of Appitis J HE tribunes wlio at this time kept the people in a  ferment were Sp Maecilius and Metilius who had been both elected in their absence the former for the fourth and the latter for the third time They had preferred a bill for an equal distribution of the conquered lands among the citizens f But as the city itself stood on con quered ground ana scarce any land about it but what had been the perquisite of their valour which by the bye excepting what the people had in possession had neither been exposed to sale nor distributed by public authority by this bill the greatest part of the estates of the nobility must hSve been confiscated which of con sequence seemed to lay the foundation of very warm contests between the senate and people Nor could the military tribune although they often convened the senate and ha d private conventions of the principal men of the Patrician party fall on any expedient to obviate this dilemma till Appius Claudius the grandson of that  A city of the Latins about 15 miles from Rome f Jugcrum 240 by 120 feet or 5 Tihs of an English acre  980 BOOK IV TITUS LIVIUS Appius who was created decemvir for compiling a body of laws at this time the youngest of all the senators represented as it is related of him  That he would lay before them an old political maxim hereditary in his family which his great grandfather Appius Claudius had convinced the senate was the only expedient for opposing the tyranny of the tribunes and that was by stirring up an opposition among themselves Per sons who had but lately emerged from obscurity would easily be induced by the influence of ihe great to take the other side of the argument would the senators only deign sometimea to speak of them in terms more agreeable to the times than to the dignity of their rank The pride of such generally kept pace witb their condition and therefore the moment they were convinced that their colleagues who took the lead in this affair had engrossed the favour of the people and that themselves had only a blank in reversion it would be no difficult matter to bring them over to the side of the senate whereby they might attract the attention of the whole order as well as the principal men in it All of them approved of this plan especially C Servi lius Priscus who run out much in praises of the young nobleman because he had not degenerated from the vir tue of his ancestors and recommended in a particular manner to the order to employ their interest respective ly to engage as many of the college of tribunes as pos sible to join in opposition to the bill After the senate was adjourned the principal mem bers applied themselves to gain the tribunes and by persuasion remonstrating and assuring them that they would not only lay every single senator but the whole body under a particular obligation they engaged six tif them to dissent from their colleagues Next day as it had been concerted a motion was made in the senate relative to the sedition excited by Maecilius and Metilius about a largess of a most dangerius tendency and eacb of the senators in giving his opinion of the matter took care to declare that for his own part he was at a loss to say nor could he see the least prospect of relief from any quarter but from the opposition of the tribunes The hepublic oppressed as it was and reduced to a stata  CHAP 49 ROMAN HISTORY 381 of bankruptcy now fled to the protection of that college   aml it would tend much to their ownjionour as well as to the dignity of their office if it should appear thai tlie power with which they were invested was not so much calculated for harassing the sentate and sowing discord among the different orders of the state as to oppose the malevolent designs of their colleagues There was now a noise all over the senate house oecasioned by the members who from every corner appealed to the col lege of tribunes When silence was ordered they who had been pre viously prepared by the application of the principal sena tors declared that they would oppose the bill preferred by their colleagues since it was the judgment of the se nate that it tended to the subversion of jthe state The senate renrned thanks to the dissenting tribunes j and those who had preferred the bill summoned an assembly where having inveighed against their colleagues as traitors to the interest of their constituents creatures of the consulars and other opprobrious appellatives they dronped from their motion CHAP XLIX â â    r â The jEqui humbled Pride of Posthumius checked by L Sextius 1 HE next year P Cornelius Cossus C Valerius Potitus Q Quint tins Cincinnatus and Numerius Fabius Vibulanus were created military tribunes with consular power Whilst they were in office the Republic would have had war with two of its restless neighbours if that with the Vejentes had not been put off by a religious scruple among their chiefs whose estates an inundation of the Tiber had lately damaged by demolishing their seats and villas and the jEqui been diverted from assist ing the inhabitants of Volse a people belonging to their own nation by the blow they had received three years before Incursions had been made from thence upon the territory of Lavicum bordering with theirs and hostili ties committed upon the Roman colony lately planted there They thought by the assistance of all the Equi 382 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV they would escape with impunity for this insult but bemg thus abandoned by their countrymen the war with them was very inconsiderable for they lost both their citv and its territory by one slight engagement and a short siegeyL L Sextos one of the popular tribunes attempted to bring ki a bill for sending a colony to Volse as had been done to Lavicum It ended in nothing by reason of the dissent of his colleagues who declared that they would sutler no bill to pass in the assembly of the com mons without the con sent of the senate Next year the jEqui having recovered Voice peopled it anew and strengthened the fortifications of the place during the presidency of Quinctius Fabius Vibulanus for the second time Cn Cornelius Cossns L Valerius Potitus and Posthumius Regillensis in quality of military tribunes with consular power To Posibutnius was committed the management of the war against the 2Equi He was a man of a vile disposi tion which became more visible in his victory than during the dependence of the war For having raised an arniy with great expedition and marched against V lie in several skirmishes he humbled the 55qui and at last made himself master of the city when he turn ed the insolence of his temper from the enemy upon his fellow citizens and though whilst he was carrying on the siege he had published that the soldiers should have the plunder after it was taken he broke his word I rather think that the resentment of the army origi nated in this circumstance than because the city which had been lately plundered and peopled with a new co lony did not produce so large a booty as this tribune had given out From whatever source this disgnst pro ceeded he inflamed it much upon his return to ihe city being recalled by his colleagues on account of the dust raised by the tribunes An expression of his was taken notice of in the assembly equally ridiculous and extra vagant As Sextius one of the tribunes was proposing  Regillensiswasa sirname common to two families theClsn dian

wanted spi rit nor eloquence having found in the opposition a proud heart and a petulant tongue whom he could provoke and enrage till he was driven to such expressions as would not only render himself odious but the cause he espous ed and the order to which he belonged attacked Post humius more frequently and with greater warmth than any other of the military tribunes Therefore immedi ately upon the harsh and brutal expression he cried out Do you hear Romans how Posthumius threatens his  soldiers as if they were his slaves However when the first offices of the state are to fie disposed of this  savage will be thought more worthy of them in your judgment than those who provide you with cities and  lands and send you into colonies who procure you safe retreats for your old age and for

our spoils dare to threaten us also Wherefore as these reflections were made openly the Qosestor Sextius to quell lie sedition believed it neces sary to employ the same violent methods as had given occasion for them and sent a lictor to one of the soldiers whom he heard exclaiming but this only served to in crease the tumult and the Qusestor being struck with a stoue was obliged to retire out of the crowd  the person who hail done it insulting him at the same time by cal ling out That the Quaxtor had got no more than what the general had threatened to give the soldiers When Post huraius himself was called to quell the mutiny he exas perated the troops more than ever by the strictness of his enquiries and the cruelty of his punishments At last wlien lie set no bounds to his fury the cries of those whom he had condemned to be drowned under a hurdle having drawn together a number of the soldiers and raised a tumult he burst like a fury from his tribunal and thrust among the crowd who were endeavouring to prevent the executing of his sentence The lictors and centurions in clearing the way dealt about them too roughly among the crowd which exasperated them to that extraordinary degree that the military tribune was stoned to death by his own army When thenews of this tragical event reached the city and the military tribunes with the concurrence of the senate decreed that a recognition should he taken relative to the murder of their colleague the tribunes of the people interposed This contest depended upon an other The conscript fathers were in the utmost concern lest the people for fear of the intended inquiry should in the heat of their passion create military tribunes out of their own order for which reason they exerted them selves to the utmost to get consuls elected But the tri bunes of the people would suffer no act to be passed by tlie senate nor a comitia to be held for the election of consuls o that the Republic fell into an iuter regnum The fathers afterwards prevailed CHAP 51 ROMAN HISTORY 385 CHAP LI The Trial of the mutinous Soldiers Contests between the  Orders Q FABIUS VILULANUS being declared inter rex held the comitia when A Cornelius Cossus and L Fu rius Medullinus were created consuls In the beginning of their administration the senate enacted that the tri bunes should without loss of time lay the affair of the enquiry into the murder of Posthumius before the as sembly of the people and that it should be left to the people to appoint whom thev pleased to preside in that enquiry The commons with the concurrence of the whole body of the people committed the charge of this matter to the two consuls They executed their com mission with great lenity and moderation and the few examples thai were made are generally believed to have prevented the execution of their sentence by a voluntary death Yet all these precautions did not stop the mouths of the people who complained bitterly that the bills which were brought in for their account were suffered to ly on the table neglected and protracted for so many ytars whilst one for shedding their blood and bringing them to punishment was put in execution directly and with rigour Now was the time after the punishment of the seditious soldiers for soothing the minds of the peo ple by a distribution of the lands of Vola The senators in that case would have diminished the ardour of the people in pushing the Agrarian law which was calcu lated to dispossess the Patricians of the property of the public they had unjustly usurped The people at that time were much exasperated with this provoking con sideration that the nobility not only persisted obstinate ly in retaining the public lands of which they were vio lent possessors but also prevented the distribution of those lately taken from the enemy now vacant which would also soon become the prey of a few Patricians as the rest had done before The same year the consul Furius led the legions against the Volsci who were ravaging Ae territory of 336 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV tlie Hernici but the enemy haviugdisappeared he took Ferentinum whither a great number of them had re tired The booty there came shoft of their expectation the Volsci when they began to despair of making a pro per defence had packed up their effects in the night time and departed the city The next day it was taken but it was almost desolate Of its territory the consul made a present to the Hernici CHAP LII An l jiiih niail distemper and a Famine A R 341 1 HE moderation of the tribunes rendered this year pretty peaceable But L Icilius one of the tribunes of the people immediately upon the accession of Q Fab i us Ambustus and C Furius Paulus to the consular fasces as if it had been hereditary in his flame and family en deavoured to raise a sedition by reviving the plea of the Agrarian laws A plague however which broke out at that time and gave more alarm than it proved destructive diverted the people s attention from the forum and po litical disputes to look after their families and talje care of their health It is thought that the eilects of the plague were less fatal than those of the sedition would have been The city was all over oppressed with sickness though no great mortality ensued but the neglect of agriculture whilst the calamity prevailed as it general ly happens the next year when M Papirius Atratinus and C Nautius Rutilus were consuls produced a scarci ty This would have done much more mischief than the plague if they had not found relief from their agents whom they sent through all the nations upon the coast of the Tuscan sea and the banks of the Tiber to pur chase corn â  The Samnites who were then in possession of Capaa and Cumse behaved insolently to the commissaries and prohibited them from buying whereas they were liberal ly supplied by the tyrants of Sicily The Etrurians with  A town which originally belonged to the Volsci now Fioreo tioo situated iu the Campagna di Roma 48 miles from Rome CHAP 53 ROMAN HISTORY 387 the utmost dispatch sent great quantities of grain down the Tiber While the sickness prevailed in the city the consuls had a demonstration of the desolate state of the city  for they could not find above one senator for every  particular embassy for which reason they were obliged to associate two knights with each of them Excepting the effects of the plague and the famine for two succes sive years the Romans had nothing to trouble them at home or abroad But the moment they had got over these difficulties all the miseries which had been the usual attendants on civil dissensions and foreign war at tacked them at once CHAP LIII Opposition of the College to Mxnius Valerius humbles the jEqui but is unpopular in the army _L HE former consuls were succeeded by Mamercus JEmilius and C Valerius Potitus in whose consulate the jEqui renewed their preparations for war and although the Volsci did not take up arms by public authority they joined the Equi as volunteers and served for pay Upon  advice of the progress of these enemies who by this time had entered the frontiers of the Latins and Hernici the consul Valerius began to make the levies for raising an army but M Mocnius one of those tribunes who had proposed the Agrarian law opposed him and while the commons were supported by this tribune none of them could be compelled to take the military oath During this contest they were surprised with the ac counts that the fortress of Carventum was in the hands of the enemy As this disgrace exposed Mcenius to the odium of the senators it furnished the other tribunes a noble pretext for opposing their colleague being previ ously determined to declare against the Agrarian law Wherefore after long altercations on both sides the con suls called gods and men to witness that whatever da mage or disgrace the enemy had or would bring upon them it was all chargeable upon Mfenius who had ob   structed the levies Maenius on the other hand exclaim ed that if the violent possessors of the property of the 388 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV public would give up what they held by so unjust a te nure he would obstruct the levies no longer The other nine tribunes put an end to the dispute and declared it was the opinion of their college  That in opposition to their colleague Micnius they should support the con â sul Valerius in imposing fines or inflicting other pu nishments on those who refused to enlist for the war The consul now armed with this decree having seized and imprisoned some of them who had appealed to the tribunes for assistance the rest were afraid and took the military oath However much the consul hated the army and the army him the moment they appeared before the fortress of Carventitm they discovered the greatest ardour in dis lodging the garrison and recovering the fort The ne gligence of such of the garrison as had gone to plunder in the neighbourhood gave them a favourable opportunity for the assault The booty was considerable as it con tained the magazine of all their praedatory acquisitions round the country The consul ordered the quaestors to sell the whole at vendue and put the price in the pablic treasur telling the soldiers they should share in the spoil when they showed less reluctance to the war This in creased the resentment of the people as well as of the soldiers against the consul insomuch that when by order of the senate he entered the city with an ovation the soldiers in their licentious manner repeated alter nately a rough kind of verses expressive of reproaches to the consul and high encomiums on the name of Maenius The people who lined the way to see the pro cession rivalled the soldiers in expressing their regard to Maenius by loud acclamations and applauses as oft as they heard his name The senators were more uneasy on this account than at the freedom the soldiers were tak ing with the consul as it was no uncommon thing on such occasions and concluding from this that Maenius would certainly be advanced to the military tribuneshijj should he appear as a candidate they took care to ex clude him by appointing thu comitia to be hehj for  electing consuls CHAP 54 ROMAN HISTORY 389 CHAP LIV Three plebeian quecstors cboten J HE consuls elected upon this occasion were Cn Cor nelius Cossus and L Furius MeduMinus for the second time At no time were the people more highly pro voked than at this when they were not permitted to ehuse military tribunes But they both consoled and avenged themselves on that account in the election of quEestors This was the first time that Plebeians were admitted to the Quaestorship and of four places there was only one reserved for Caeso Fabius Ambustus a Pa trician Q Silius P jElius and P Pupius were prefer red to the sons of the first families in Rome I find that three of the Icilian family who had been chosen tri bunes that year and noted for the inveteracy of their fa mily against the Patricians were the principal instfga tors of the people to assume this freedom in giving their suffrages promising them innumerable advantages of which they were excessively fond but declaring at the same time that they would not move a step towards the execution of them if at the Comitia for electing quaes tors the only officers whom the senate had left them at liberty to choose indiscriminately out of either order they had not resolution enough to effectuate what they had so long inclined and what the laws left them at liberty to Io The people considered this as a very great victory for they did not estimate the quaMtorship from the in trinsic privileges of the office but as it opened a doijr by which men of low birth might enter to the consulship and to triumphs On the other hand the fathers murmured not be cause the honours of the state were to be shared with the commons but because they were in a fair way to lose them altogether They insisted that if they were to go on at this rate it was needless to train up children for exalted stations if they were to be supplanted in the offices of their ancestors and see others in possession of the honours due to them whilst they were left in the obscure offices of priests and Salii with no other em 390  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV ployment but that of offering sacrifice for the prosperity of the people divested of every share of government or authority in the state Whilst both parties were in this ferment whilst the people were screwed up to the highest pitch being headed by three people celebrated for their exertions in popular causes the fathers foreseeing that every other office would go in the same manner as the qua storship where the people had a liberty of choosing out of either order directed all their engines to secure a consular Co rnitia in which the people had as yet no alternative The Icilii on the other hand insisted for military tri bunes and that it was high time now for the Plebeians to be admitted to a participation of the honours of that office  CHAP LV Further contests with the Tribunes Territories of the JEqui and Vokci ravaged JjUT as yet no claim was entered by the consuls for which reason the people had it not in their power by the force of their opposition to extort what they wanted when very fortunately for their views advices were re ceived that the Volsci and jEqui had marched out of their own country to pillage that of the Latins and Her Jjici  To chastise the insolence of these restless depre dators when by a decree of the senate the consuls be gan to make the levies the tribunes opposed them with all tnfjir might declaring that fortune had presented them and the people with an opportunity of doing them selves justice There were three of them men of the first distinction among the Plebeians and all of them exceedingly active and enterprising Two of them uudertook to have a continual eye upon the motions of h is consul whilst the third harangued the people at as semblies and checked or spurred them as seemed re quisite Thus were the consuls on the one hand pre vented from expediting the levies and the tribunes on the other hand from holding the Cornitia the objects of their respective pursuits CHAP 55 ROMAN HISTORY 391 Sortie time after fortune inclining to the side of the people expresses arrived with the accounts that the sol diers yjio kept garrison in the fortress ot Carventum having gone out on a foraging match the jEqui had surprised the fort and put the tew who were left for its defence to the sword That the rest of the soldiers either as they returned and were entering the fort again or as thev were found straggling in the country had met witti the same fate This affair prejudicial as it was to the state strengthened the hands of the tribunes in the present dispute For it was to no purpose that they had been solicited to obstruct the levies no longer now that matters were come to this extremity wherefore as they still continued inflexible notwithstanding the sierm which threatened the state and the odium they were like to bring on themselves the senate was obtiged to pass an act for the election of military tribunes but with this express provision that none of those who acted in the capacity of tribune of the people for this year should be elected nor be re elected to the office of tribune for the succeeding year Without all doubt the senate had the Icilii in their eye whom they accused of aspiring to a consular office as a reward of the seditious use they made of their tribunitian power Then the levies were made and preparations for war carried on with the universal con sent of all ranks Whether both consuls marched to re take the fortress of Carventum or one of them staid in the city to preside at the election is a question about which authors are not agreed But it is abundantly certain nor has it been contradicted that the Roman ar my after they had spent a long time before Carventum raised the siege and went against Verrugo a city of the Volsci which they reduced and by ravaging the terri tories of the E jui and Volsci made a considerable booty 392 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV CHAP LVI The Consuls offended with the Senate for proposing a Dictator The Tribunes refuse to interfere Sthe commons had prevailed in the first instance in obtaining the comitia they had insisted on so in the event ot the Comitia the senate prevailed in their turn For contrary to all expectation three Patricians C Ju lius Julus Publius Cornelius CQSSuS and C Servilius Ahala were elected military tribunes with consular pow er It is said that the Patricians had recourse to a stra tagem with which the Icilii reproached them at that ve ry time in setting up a number of low fellows to appear as candidates with men of the first merit and that the people ashamed of the tattered appearance made by some of them rejected the Plebeian candidates altoge ther Whether it was that the hopes of the 3L ui aud Volsci were revived from the circumstance of their hav ing been able to defend the fortress of Carventum or if their resentment was raised by the loss of the garrison of Verrugo advices were brought that they were mak ing extraoidinary preparations for war and that the Ao tiates were at the head of the confederacy who had am bassadors making the circuit of tlieir different courts re monstrating against them as a body of poltroons who whilst they were skulking within their walls suffered the Romans  the year before to ravage their country at pleasure and cut in pieces the garrison of Verugo That hostile armies were not only stnt against them but colonies planted in their country and that the Roman not content with a dividend of their subject among them selves had taken Ferentinurn from them and given it in a present to the Hernici The resentment of the people being by these re proaches screwed up to the highest pitch wherever they went the youth were very forward to enlist Where fore the youth of all the confederate nations having ren dezvoused at Antium there they encamped and waited for the enemy When advices of these motions were carried to Rome and greatly exaggerated in the rela CHAP 57 ROMAN IllSTORY  393 tion the senate as the last resource in cases of imminent danger immediately ordered a dictator to be named a circumstance which it is said greatly oflended Julius and Cornelius and produced very warm disputes with the senate and when the principal of that order com plained that the military tribunes refused to subject them selves to the authority of the senate and at last had re course to the tribunes of the people alledging they had precedents where in similar cases consuls had been over ruled by the authority of the tribunes The tri bunes far from being dissatisfied with this misunder standing among the fathers told them that it was ridi culous to expect any assistance from them wjiom they did not respect as citizens nor regard as men That if ever the honours and government of the state should be common to both orders they should soon be convinced that the decrees of the senate should not become void through the insolence of any magistrate whatever In the mean time the Patricians who seemed amenable to ueither laws nor Magistrates might exercise the authori ty of tribunes for themselves CHAP LVII  f A Dictator created who dispels the storm at Antium i HIS dispute had engrossed the public attention at a most unseasonable conjuncture when they had so great a war upon their hands whilst Julius and Cornelius had Iong held forth in alternate harangues the mjustice of wresting from them the honours the people had bestow ed on theni as they were sufficiently qualified them selves for doing their duty as generals and conducting the war when Ahala Servilius rose up and represented That he had long been silent not because he was at a loss how to act as the interests of a good citizen were  never separated from those of the public but bi ause he would have wished that his colleagues had volun tarily submitted to the authority of the senate rather than to have suffered them to apply 10 the power of the tribunes to compel them That even then did the si tuation of affairs permit he would most cheerfully give 394 T1TCS LIVIUS BOOK IV them time to recede from a resolution in which they had discovered too much obstinacy but as the dangers of war were too importunate to admit of delay he would prefer the interest of the state to the favour of bis Col leagues and if the senate persisted in their resolu tion lie would name a dictator that very night and if any should oppose the senate s decree he would con sider their authority as sufficient for his purpose When by this declaration he ltad gained the just ap plause and favour of all ranks he named P Cornelias dictator by whom he was also declared general of the horse which may convince any one who will compare his conduct with that of his colleagues that those who do not court respect and honour are sometimes in the way to both The war was not considerable For the enemy was routed at Antium in one engagement and that a very slight one The victorious army laid waste the country of the Volsci and took a fort upon the lake Fucinus where they made three thousand prisoners the rest of the Volsci being obliged to take refuge within their walled towns and leave their country to be ravaged by the enemy The dictator having finished this war in such a man ner as made it appear that he had neglected no oppor tunity fortune put in his way he returned to Rome with more success than glory and resigned his office The military tribunes without the least mention of a consu lar comitia very probably out of resentment because a dictator had been created proclaimed the assemblies for the election of military tribunes The fathers were the more sensibly piqued at this proceeding as they saw themselves betrayed by their own party Wherefore as they had the preceding year created a disgust among the Plebeians at the better sort of their order by setting up for candidates mere tatterdemalions so now having prevailed with those of the Patricians who were most eminent for the popularity and lustre oftheir families to appear as candidates they secured all the places and gave not the least chance to a Plebeian There were four elected who had all filled that office before L Fiurius Medultinus C Valerius Potitus Numerius Fa CHAP 58 ROMAN HISTORY 395 bius Vibulanus and C Servilius Ahala The last was rewarded by being contmued in his office both in regard of his other virtues and the favour lie had lately acquir ed by his singular moderation CHAP LV1II The people refuse their assent to a war with the Vejentcs J HAT year the truce with the Vejentes being ex pired heralds and commissioners were dispatched to de mand satisfaction for injuries sustained These heralds were met on the way as they were approaching the marches by an embassy from Veii The embassy re quested that they would proceed no farther till they had an audience from the senate of Rome The min isters of the Vejentes obtained from the senate that since their state laboured under all the calamities of civil dis sensions that satisfaction should be demanded of them So far were they from taking advantage of the misfor tunes of others to promote heir own interest At this time the Romans met with a disaster in the country of the Volsci in the loss of their garrison at Ver rugo Where a little time was of such consequence that the garrison who were besieged by the Volsci and had implored assistance might have been relieved had they been reinforced in time The army sent for this purpose came only in time to retaliate on the enemy just as they had put the Roman garrison to the sword and dis persed themselves with a design to plunder The senate was more to blame in not hastening the troops than the tribunes because they were told that the garrison made a vigorous defence never reflecting that no courage whatever can exceed the bounds of human force These brave fellows sold their lives dear and after their fall were severely revenged The following year had for military tribunes the two Cornelii Cossi P and Cn Numerius Fabius Ambustus and L Valerius Potitus when a motion was made to chastise the Vejentes for the insolence of their senate in ordering the Roman ambassadors to be told when they were demanding restitution that if they Hid not imine 396 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV diately leave the city and dominions of Veil they would treat them as Lars Totomnius had treated the Roman ambassadors on a former occasioh The fathers could not put up with so daring an ineoti and therefore decreed that the tribunes should forthwith lay before the people a motion for declaring war against the Yejentes The moment this motion was mentioued in the assembly the youth began to murmur insisting That the war with the Volsci was not finished j that it was but lately that two garrisons had been put to the sword and though they had been since recovered were not supported without danger not a year pas ses without a battle and yet as if they had not toil enough we must begin a new war against powerful neighbours who may engage all Etruria in their cause Thus they talked of their own accord and the tri bunes did not fail to encourage them in their opposition by represent ing  That the chief war they had to sustain was that which the senate carried on against the com mons That they were sent into the field only to be slaughtered or to be kept at a distance and in a mau ner Vanished from the city that they might not were â they allowed repose at home turn theit minds upon liberty and colonies or concerting measures for expe Â diting the Agrarian law and voting with freedom in their assemblies Then taking the veterans by ibe hand counted the years they se sved examined their wounds and scars asking them whether they bad yet any room for more wounds or any more blood to spare to the Republic By these arguments which they took every opportunity to enlarge upon in private conversa tions and public assemblies they prepossessed the people against the war so that the bill was deferred to a future  day because it appeared plain had it been proposed under so many prejudices it must have been rejected CW 59 ROMAN HISTORY  39 A CHAP LIX Anxur taken and plundered by the Soldiers who aft appointed pay by a decree of the Senate J N the mean time the military tribunes resolved to lead an army against the Volsci Only Cn Cornelius was left at Home The other three fmding that the Volsci had not encamped and did not seem as if they would hazard a battle divided their forces into three bodies and laid waste the country on different sides Valerius roarched to Antium and Cornelius to Ecetrse pillaging the houses and country all the way to amuse the Volsci But Fabius without stopping to plunder marched di rectly to lay srege to Anxmy the principal object of the expedition This was that Anxur which was after wards called Terracina It was situated above a marsh whence Fabius made a feint of carrying on his attack Four cohorts were sent round under the command of C Servilius Ahala to take possession of an eminence wnich overlooked the city From this eminence where the town was not defended they made an attack upon the walls with a prodigious clamour and noise which quite confounded those who defended the lower part of the city against Fabius and gave him an opportunity unob served to prepare for a scalade In a moment every corner was crowded with enemies and for some time up on the walls there was a great slaughter among those who fled as well as those who fought and among the armed and unarmed without distinction Whereforei the conquered having no hopes of quarter even should they surrender were driven by necessity to renew the fight when all of a sudden it was published aloud that none but such as were found in arms had any thing to fear which determined the whole multitude to lay down their arms and surrender at discretion Two thousand five hundred were made prisoners but the rest of the booty Fabius would not sufter to be touch ed till his colleagues should come up representing to his army that they had also contributed their share in the taking of Anxur in so far as they had prevented the other cities from coming to its relief When they arrivÂ S  398 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV ed the three armies plundered the city together which by a long train of prosperity had now become opulent This liberality of the generals began a reconciliation between the people and the Patricians but what com pleted it was a decree of the senate very seasonably obtained by means of the whole Patricians without so much as a hint from the people or their tribunes ordain ing the soldiers to be paid out of the treasury whereas before they had served the state at their own expence iCHAP LX Joy of the people on this occasion Envy of the Tribwiei 1 O circumstance we are told ever gave the people a more sensible pleasure than the news of this decree of the senate They ran in crowds from all quarters to the senate house and taking the senators by the band as they came out called them fathers in every sense of the word declaring at the same time that after such an instance of goodness there was not a single citizen who to the last moment of his life would not be ready to ex pose himself to every danger for so generous and bene ficent a country The people s satisfaction in this de cree did not only arise from the advantage it promised them in having their estates liable to no expence whilst they were personally engaged in the service of the pub lic but also because it was a voluntary deed of the se nate neither thought of by their tribunes nor such a de mand even surmised by themselves It was this con sideration which augmented their joy and enhanced the alue of the favour The tribunes of the people were the only persons who â had no share in the general joy and harmony that reign ed all over the city on this occasion They insisted that this was a stroke in politics which would not be  agreeable to all the fathers nor would they find their  account in it so much as they imagined That at first  sight it had a specious appearance but experience M would shew it in a different point of view For hoiv  could the money be raised but by imposing a tax upon Â individuals It was plain therefore that the senate was Â â liberal at the expence of others That though othen CHAP 61 ROMAN HISTORY 399 might wink at this innovation those who bad already served out their time would never consent that the condition of their successors should be better than theirs had been or that they who had already served their country at their own charge should be saddled with a tax for the support of others Such speeches left an impression with some and the tribunes proclaim ed that they were ready to assist all those who were disposed to stand out against the tax for the pay of the soldiers   The fathers however were determined to persevere â in supporting so laudable an undertaking and were the first to pay in their contributions and because they had as yet no silver coin some sent carriages loaded with brass to the treasury which gave their contingents a magnificent appearance When the senators had paid in their respective quotas with the utmost impartiality agreeable to their valuations the principal Plebeians who were in friendship with the nobility as had been concerted began to pay in their assessments and when the lower Plebeians observed how much they were com mended by the senators and respected as good citizens by the soldiers all at once despising the assistance of the tribunes he was the best man who paid first The bill was now passed for declaring war against the Vejentes and the new military tribunes led an army against Veii the greatest part of which consisted of volunteers CHAP LXI Artena taken the Fort having been betrayed by a slope J HE military tribunes this year were T Qumctius Capitolinus P

Etruria held a general council at the temple of Voltumna to consider whether they should make the siege of Veii a common cause but it does not appear that they came to any resolution The siege in the year following was carried on with still less vigour than at first part of the tribunes and the armies they com manded having been called off to a war with the Volsci 400 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK IV C Valerius Potitus for the third time Manius Ser gius Fidenas P Cornelius Maluginensis Cn Cornelius Cossus C ESO Fabius Ambustus and Sp Nautius Rutilas a second time were elected military tribunes with con sular power for this year The Volsci gave them an op portunity of coming to an action wi th them betweeu Ferentinum and Ecetra in which the Romans bad the advantage after which the military tribunes formed the siege of Artena a town belonging to the Voisci where the besieged having attempted a sally were dri ven back to the city with such precipitation that the Romans had an opportunity of entering with them pell mell and of taking every thing but the castle into which as it was naturally strong a body of armed men had thrown themselves Under this fortress many were put to the sword and many fell into the hands of the victors The fort itself was then besieged but to storm it would have been impracticable being for the extent of the place sufficiently defended and there could be no hopes of a surrender as all the corn in the public maga zines had been conveyed thither before the town was taken so that at last the Romans must have been so tir ed out as to have raised the siege had not a slave be trayed the fort into their hands The soldiers having been admitted by his means through a very intricate passage took the place and having put the guards to the sword the rest of the garrison were all at once so struck with terror that they immediately surrendered at discretion The city and citadel were both demolished and the legions withdrawn from the Volscian territory to push on the siege of Veii with all the force the Ro mans could muster The slave besides his liberty had the effects of two families assigned him as the reward of his treason He was called the Roman Servius Some think that this Artena belonged to the Vejentes and not tin Volsci A city of the same name situated between Caere and Veii leads them into this mistake but this Artena was de stroyed by the Roman kings and besides was not the property of the Vejentes but of the Caeretes This other Artena the destruction whereof hath been just now de scribed lay in the territory of the Volsci  W TITUS

HILST all around were in peace the Romans and Vejentes were at war which they prosecuted with such a spirit of hatred and revenge that it appeared the war must terminate in the dissolution of the conquered The assemblies for the election of magistrates in these two states acted upon principles entirely different The Romans increased the number of their military tribunes eight being elected this year which never happened be fore namely Manius jEmilius Mamercinus a second time L Valerius Potitus a third time Ap Claudius Crassus M Quinctilius L Julius Julus M Posthumius M Camillas M Posthumius Albinus The Vejentes on the contrary tired out with the annual intrigues about elections which sometimes laid the foundation of civil broils chose a king to rule over them â The two last were censors not military tribunes according to the Capitoline marbles 402 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V This proceeding gave great offence to the other states of Etruria who not only had an aversion to monarchy but a particular dislike to this king His person and pride had formerly rendered him odious to the people in having violently interrupted the yearly games any intermission in which was reckoned criminal He had stood candidate tor the office of high priest and by the suffrage of the twelve Lucomonies saw another prefer red in resentment of which affront he took an oppor tunity when the games were at the height to call off actors at a moment s warning of which the greatest part were his own slaves For this reason the Etrurians of all the nations the most superstitious and the most precise in the observance of every religious rite were determined to suffer the Vejentes to stand on their own legs whilst hey were subject to a king The accounts of this resolution were suppressed at Veii for fear of the king who would have treated the retailer of such intel ligence as a disturber of the peace whatever authority he had for the report he circulated The Romans were not without intelligence that all was quiet in Etruria yet as they had been advised that this affair had been debated in all their councils they raised fortifications to have a double effect and fronting different ways to se cure themselves against the city and the sallies of the besieged and to prevent any succours that might come from Etruria CHAP II A Winter  Campaign determined on and oppoted by tlie Tribunes j HE Roman generals thinking it would be more practicable to starve the city by a blockade than to carry it by assault ordered barracks to be built to defend them from the rigour of the season a thing absolutely unknown to the Roman soldiery as they were determined to con tinue the war during the winter When the noise of this resolution reached Rome the tribunes who had been long at a loss for materials to raise a combustion imme diately repaired to the assembly with a view to exaspe rate the people representing  That they might now 6BAp 2 HOMAN HISTORY 403 â see pretty plainly what were the views in the pay granted to the soldiers that they had not been deceiv ed when they asserted that wiih this instance of ge nerosity from their enemies was conveyed a secret poison â Thatthey had received it in exchange for their liberty â That the youth were removed and banished from the city and public affairs for good anc all and without regard to the rigour of the season were to be kept in the tield all the winter without the liberty of visiting their families or looking into their own atl airs And after all what reason can be assigned for continu ing the campaign Why that the youth in whom the strength of the people consists may be prevented from doing any thing in fuU assemblies for their com mon interest That besides they were subjected to much more fatigue and had greater hardships to en counter than the Vejentes who whilst they defend ed their town which was secured by excellent walls â and the natural strength of its situation passed the winter in their own houses whereas the Roman sol â diers amidst toil and hardships rvere exposed to frost and snow were obliged to lie in tents without laying aside their arms even during the w mter a se son of rest and respite from war all the world over A yoke of servitude which neither the kings nor before the existence of tribunitian power the consuls haughty as they were nor the despotism of a dictator nor even the cruelty of the decemvirs had ever imposed which the military tribunes now exercise without mercy over the commons of Rome in obliging them to serve in the field the whole year round What then would they do were the consuls or dictators who being only invested with the shadow of consular dignity to lord it with such tyrannical rigour But even in this circurn â stance there is hardly any room for complaint among eight military tribunes there was not a place for a single Plebeian That formerly the Patricians with out a very hard struggle could not fill up three of these places but now eight at a time jump at once into powej and yet among all that number a single Ple beian could not be smuggled in who if good for no tbing else might have put his colleagues in mind that 404 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V the soTdiers were not slaves but freemen and fellow citizens who ought at least during the winter to be permitted to return to their houses and families in or der that once in the year they might see their fathers wives and children enjoy their liberty and give their voice in the election of magistrates Whilst the tribunes were exclaiming in this manner they found an antagonist in Appius Claudius who had been left by his colleagues for the purpose of opposing the seditious attempts of the tribunes being highly qua lified for the task for from his youth he had beeo trained to

promote your interest or their own that your tribunes are still on the watch to raise seditions in the state I am certain this year must have cleared up every difficulty on that score And whilst I rejoice that there is now an end of the wild tedious goose chase they have led you I congratulate you and the republic on your account that your prosperity hath in a very peculiar manner contributed to open your eyes Is it not evident to all the world that your tribunes were never so sensibly touched with any injuries you ever received if indeed you ever received any as with the generosity of the senate to the people in appointing them pay whilst employed in the service of the republic What else do you imagine could have alarmed them at that time orwhat is it they would wish to disturb now but

and as masters did not suffer their slaves to have any intercourse with their neighbours that they might neither be well or ill used by them so you will not suffer the commons to have any intercourse with the nobles lest by our complaisance and generosity we should secure their attachment and lest they on the other hand should shew their regard in their obe dience to our orders How much more then should it be your study suppose you had no regard for the state if you had but the least spark of humanity remaining to use your utmost endeavours to promote this reci procal complaisance and

necessary at present only permit me to speak with regard to the condition of the troops there And I am convinced were I to speak not only to you but in the camp where the soldiers themselves would be my judges I should infallibly have their approbation For were my own ingenuity to furnish me with nothing new to advance in this affair I should think myself at no loss when I can confute my opponents

Pain and pleasure however contrary in their nature seem to have an in timate connection with each other The soldier in former times grudged excessively to serve the public at his own charge whilst with pleasure he employed a part of the year in cultivating his farm to get a sub sistence for his family at home and for himself when he took the field He is now happy in the reflection that the public must support him and receives his pay with pleasure As he is at no great expence he can bear with patience to be kept a little longer from his family and family affairs Besides were the republic to reckon with him it might justly be urged you are paid for a year s service why would you scruple to serve out your year Do you think it would be reasonable to exact full pay for half service It is with reluctance gentlemen that I touch upon these things These are arguments proper only to be used â with mercenary troops With you we would wish to act as with fellow citizens and think it but reason able you act with us as with your native country Either we should not have undertaken this war or we should certainly support it in a manner worthy the Roman people and bring it to a conclusion as quick ly as possible This we can accomplish if we press the besieged with vigour and not quit the siege till we have crowned our hopes by making ourselves masters of the city If we had no other motive for our perse verance by Hercules the shame of raising the block 1 ade ought to be more than sufficient For the sake â of one woman a city in former times was besieged â for the space of ten years by the united power of â Greece and pray how far were they from home â What countries what seas intervened Shall we then scruple to carry on a siege for twelve mouths within twenty miles

tribunes would substitute in place of pay to the soldiers of which they would wish to deprive them The soldiers with immense labour have drawn a ditch and rampart through a large tract of ground On these at first they only raised a few forts but since the army has been reinforced they have multiplied them prodi giously They have erected redoubts not only against the town but against Etruria also

summer campaign Is it not much more easy to defend the works already constructed to push on the siege with vigour and firmness till we accomplish our designs It cannot be a matter of long standing if we go on without interruption and do not ourselves frustrate our hopes by our own delays and remissness I only speak of the labour we must undergo and the time we must lose But this is not all By protracting the war we expose ourselves to a much a greater dar ger Do we sit down without the least concern whilst the states of Etruria meet so frequently to deliberate on sending aid to Veii As matters now stand they are disgusted with the Vejentes they hate them and will not interpose for their relief Nay for them we may take Veii when we can but who can divine if we intermit our operations that they will be of the same mind some time hence Only give them a little respite and you will see how their embassies will be reiterated and redoubled The circumstance of esta blishing monarchy at Veii which alone gives umbrage to the Etrurians may change in an instant either by the general consent of the state to reinstate them into favour with the Etrurians or by a voluntary resigna tion in

regard the establishment of our repu tation for other wars and other enemies in time to come Do you think that a judgment will not be formed of us from our behaviour on this occasion And that it is a matter of indifference whether the neigh bouring nations have reason to conclude that if a city can only sustain the first ardour of the Romans which is of no long duration there would be nothing more to fear Will it not establish the terror of the Roman name when it is remarked that neither the long con tinuance of a tedious siege nor the rigours of winter can induce a Roman army to give up a place they have once invested  that they have not yet learned to put an end to a v7ar in any other way than by vic tory  and that they value themselves as much upon their perseverance as their impetuosity in their at tacks Perseverance is necessary in every kind of war whatever but in sieges indispensably so  because most cities are rendered impregnable by fortifications and their natural situation they require time and to be in want of the necessaries of life to compel them to a surrender This will be the case with Veii if the tri bunes of the people go not over to the side of the ene my and give the Vejentes that assistance at Reme which they look for in vain in Etruria Could any thing have happened more to the wishes of the Vejen tes than to see Rome first and then the camp having catched the infection torn in pieces bv divisions Such at the same time upon honour is the firmness of the Vejentes that not even the pressures of a lon siege nor the burthen of a new king have brought about the least disturbance among them The refusal of aid from Etruria has not excited them to mutiny To at tempt a sedition there would be punished with imme diate death no man dares mutter there whai yjw speak out with impunity Whoever deserts his colours or abandons his post is sure of the bastinado But here they who advise not one or two soldiers but whole CHAP 7 ROMAN HISTORY 411 â armies to quit the colours and leave the camp in a boily in our assemblies are listened to with attention nay whatever a tribune of the people is pleased to ad  ranee were it to betray your country and sink the com monwealtli hini you accustom yourselves to hear with â patience Infatuated with the charms of the power of your tribunes you suffer the grossest crimes to ly con â cealed under it It only remains for them to carry the same spirit of revolt into the camp which they are â labouring to foment in your assemblies and by their seditious harangues corrupt the army and teach them to be disobedient to their officers For such now is the complexion of liberty at Rome that to disregard the â senate the magistrates the laws the customs of our an cestors the regulations of the fathers and all military â discipline whatever passes for spirit CHAP VII The works of Veii in flames â repaired by the Romans â Extraordinary unanimity between the Orders was already a match for the tribunes in their own assemblies when the news of a loss at Veii which nobody could have dreamed would have produced such an effect all at once turned the scale entirely in his fa vour cemented more strongly the orders of the state and inspired them with new ardour for pushing the siege with more vigour than ever  For when they had raised a mount  near the town and had only to fix the galleries to the walls as the Romans were more intent on carrying on their works by day than guarding them in the night a port was open ed all of a sudden whence multitudes sallied out armed with lighted torches and set fire to the works In an in stant these works which had taken so long a time in the construction were all in flames and numbers who en deavoured to extinguish them lost their labour and their lives into the bargain either by the fire or the sword  The Agger was made of fascines stones and earth composed of balisteri crossing each other in form of a Lattice its height was shun of the watls as it had wooden towers upon it overtop pins them 1 2 TITUS LIVIUS BookV When the news of this disaster reached Rome the feelings of every citizen were discernible in their looks and the senate was greatly concerned from a a appre hension that it would be impossible to prevent a sedition in the city as well as in the camp for the tribunes would not fail to crow over the commonwealth as on a victory obtained But instantly those who by their valuation were in the rank of knights though they had not horses assigned them by the public having previously concert ed among themselves applied directly to the senate and having obtained an audience offered to equip themselves at their own expence for the public service For this generous office the senate thanked them in the politest terms and the news being circulated throtigh the forum and the city brought the people in a moment to the senate house by the lump declaring that they were of that order which now served on foot and though it was out of their turn that they were ready to serve at Veii or wherever the senate should be pleased to lead them at the same time were they led to Veii they declared that they would not return before that city was taken The joy excited by a proposal so generous was ex cessive The people were not ordered the thanks of the house to be returned by the magistrates as had been done with respect to the knights nor were any of them called into the senate house to hear their answer  The senators could not keep within doors but out they ran and from an eminence every one in particular by his words and gestures expressed to the multitude that were standing below in the coroitium the general gladness and exultation such unanimity they cried out would render Rome happy â invincible â eternal They prais ed the knights they praised the commons nay they ex tolled the day â the glorious day They acknowledged the senate was now outdone in kindness and benevo lence The two orders seemed to vie with each other in weeping tears of joy till at length the fathers ware called back into the house where they enacted that The military tribunes should in an assembly of the people return thanks to both horse and foot in name of the Republic and assure them that the senate would Â never forget the regard they had shewn their country on this occasion 5 aud moreover ordered that all Uu CHAP 8  ROMAN HISTORY 413 â volunteers should receive pay as if they had been le vied in form On this occasion too a certain pay was instituted for the horse and it was at this time that the cavalry in general began to receive pay out of the treasury The new army of volunteers were conducted to Veii the works that had been destroyed by the enemy were not only restored but new ones constructed Provisions were conveyed from the city with more care and diligence than ever that nothing necessary might be wanting to an army that deserved so well of the RepubIic CHAR VIII The Falisci and Vcjentes support Veil and beat the Romans Misunderstanding of the Generals A R 351 J HE military tribunes for the following year were C Servilius Ahala for the third time Q Servilius L Virginius Q Sulpicius A Manlius a second time and Manius Sergius a second time also Whilst those tri bunes were totally intent upon the war with the Vejen tes by the negligence of the governor of the fort at Anxur in giving furloughs to the soldiers and admitting the Volscian merchants without reserve the centinels at the gates were betrayed and the fort surprised Few of the garrison fell in it as all of them but such as were sick followed the business of sutlers in the adjacent country and neighbouring towns Neither did they suc ceed better at Veii where the whole care of the public centered For the Roman generals hated one another more heartily than they did the enemy besides that the sudden appearance of the Capenates and Falisci had ren dered the Vejentes more formidable These two Etrurian nations were not without their fears that were Veii to fall they would be the next whom the Romans would attack as lying most contiguous for that  purpose The Falisci had laid themselves open to the resentment of the Romans by taking part Â on a former occasion with the Fldenates when at war with the Re public and now having sent deputies up and down among the neighbouring states they bound themselves TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V by an oath and marched with their armies to Veii when least expected They happened to attack that quarter of the camp where Mauius Sergius commanded and caus ed the greatest terror and dismay for the Romans were persuaded that all Etruria was up in arms and bad al ready arrived in prodigious numbers The same opinion prevailed among the besieged in the city and encourag ed them to make a sally â Thus was the Roman camp assaulted on both sides and whilst they ran up and dovru charging here and there they could neither keep back the Vi jeute Â within their fortifications nor defend their own lines so as to repel the enemy on the outside The only resource they had was in the hopes of as sistance from the greater camp as some of the legions might make head against the Capenates and Fah sci whilst others withstood ihe sallies of the townsmen but Virgimus between whom and Sergius there was a secret misunderstanding had the command of that camp When he was told that most part of their redoubts were at tacked their lines broke through and the enemy ad vancing on both sides he kept his troops under arrni saying at the same time that if there was any need of assistance his colleague would certainly send him word The arrogance of the one was equalled by the obsti nacy of the other who scorned to ask assistance from one he hated and chose rather to be defeated by the enemy than be obliged to his fellow eitizeji for victory For a considerable time the troops thus charged on both sides suffered exceedingly at last having abandoned their works a very few escaped to the grand camp the great est part with Sergius himself having made the best of their way to Rome As he laid the whole blame on hw colleague Virginius was sent for and the command given to their lieutenants during their absence The affair was laid before the senate when the two colleagues ran into invectives against each other Few of the Â i tors consulted the public interest upon this occasion bat stood up in defence of one or other of the delinquents as private friendship or faxour determined them CHAP t ROMAN HISTORY 415 CHAP IX Suspension of the old and election of new Magistrates JL HE principal of the senate were of opinion that they ought not to wait tor the usual time of etections but in stantly proceed to the election of new military tribunes who should enter upon office on the first of October The opinion met with general approbation nor did the other military tribunes make the leas t objection But Ser gius and Virginius on whose account alone it wasevident the senate were displeased with that year s magistrates first intreated that they might not be disgraced and at last entered a protest against the decree of the senate declaring they would not quit their office till the thir teenth of December the usual time for the election of new magistrates  During these disputes the tribunes of the people who much against their inclination bad been quiet whilst harmony prevailed and the affairs of the republic were in a prosperous train began all of a sudden to assume an imperious tone and threatened the military tribunes with instant imprisonment if they did not obey the or ders of the senate Then C Scrvilius Ahala tribune of the soldiers addressing himself to the tribunes  As to you and your menaces said he  I should not be dis pleased with an opportunity of proving that you have not more courage to execute than right to threaten But the decrees of the senate must be obeyed Where fore tribunes let us have no more of your interfering in our disputes to make that a pretence for doing in justice and my colleagues shall submit themselves to the pleasure of the senate or if they should persist in being refractory I shall instantly name a dictator who will know how to oblige them to quit their office This discourse was applauded by the whole assembly the senators being very much pleased that a more cer tain and consistent method was found out for keeping magistrates in order than the thunder of the tribunitian power Sergius and Virginius being thus reduced to obedience the military tribunes with common consent held the Comitia and elected successors who were to 416  TITUS LIVIUS

with consular power at this time there was sufficient business both at home and abroad Wan were multiplied upon their hands all at the same time with the Vejentes the Capenates the Falisci and the Volsci in order to recover Anxur Moreover at Rome they had no small difficulty in making the levies and col lecting the taxes The co optation of two tribunes be came another bone of contention and the trial of the two military tribunes who had just divested themselves of consular power raised no small contention To raise the levies however was the first business of the military tribunes Nor were the young men only inrolled but the old were also obliged to give in then names to serve as a city guard The more numerous the levies the more money became necessary for their pay which as it fell upon those who remained at home it was paid with no good will as they too did the duty of soldiers and served the state when they acted M quality of city guards These things sufficiently hard in themselves were greatly aggravated by the seditious harangues of the tri bune  who insisted that pay had been established for the soldiers with no other view but to ruin one half of the citizens by the hardships of war and the other by impositions they weie hot able to support Why pur sued they  one war has already been spun out to the  third year and designedly mismanaged to protract it still longer At one single levy armies have been  raised for four separate wars and both boys and old men mustered to complete them Now they no Ion  ger make any difference between winter and summer  ii ROMAN HISTORY 41 â No rest at all for the poor Plebeians who after all their other hardships are now taxed although they had brought back nothing from the wars but bodies worn out with fatigue wounds and old age and at home found their farms uncultivated through the long absence of their owners and yet notwithstanding the ruinous state of their affairs tribute they must pay Thus does the pay of the army return accumulated to the state as â if it had been let out at interest Besides the levies taxes and other cases of more im portance at the election of the Plebeian tribunes the number could not be completed The Patricians strug gled hard to get some of their erder co opted to fill up the vacant places and when they failed in that attempt they carried that two Plebeians C Lacerius and M Acutius should be elected and that no doubt by means of their own influence for the purpose of invalidating the tribonian law CHAP XI Prosecution of Scrgiiis and Virginius MONG tfiose who had been chosen there happened to be one Trebonius who believ ed that nothing less was due to his name and family than the defence of a law instituted by one of his ancestors He exclaimed  That the military tribunes had extorted what some of the Patricians had sued for in vain as they had found in their first attempt that the Trebohian law was infring ed and a co option of tribunes effected not by the suffrages of the people but by the authority of the Patricians and the matter was now come to that pass that the tribunes of the commons were either actually Patricians or their creatures The sacred laws were prostituted and the power of the tribunes trampled un der foot and he insisted all these were owing to the fraudulent practices of the Patricians and the wicked ness and treachery of his colleagues Whilst not only the senators but even the tribunes the co opted as well as the elected had incurred the odium of the people these of the collesje P Curatius AL Mitilius and M Minutius afraid of losing their in 4is TITUS LIVIUS Boon V tcrest to divert the public odium from themselves ran open mouthed against Sergiusand Virginius the mititary tribunes of the former year and cited them to take their trial They made open proclamation  That to such as groaned under the burden of taxes levies a tedious campaign and the prolongation of the war who la menied the loss of their children brothers kinsmen and friends that fatal day at Veii they offered a fair occasion to avenge themselves and the public upon the heads of two persons Sergius and Virginius who were equally culpable and responsible for all the mis fortunes that had happened Nor did this appear more evidently from the indictment laid against them by the prosecutor than the confession of ihe criminals who being equally conscious each of his own guilt had laid the blame upon one another Virginius reproaching Sergius with cowardice and Sergius retorting on Vir ginius his treachery That it was impossible they could have acted a part so shamefully inconsistent without the concurrence of the fathers who were in concert and equally fraudulent with them With a view to protract the war they had before that time given the Vejentes an opportunity of setting fire to their works that now they had sacrificed the army and delivered up the Roman camp to the Falisci That their whole plan was to keep the youth till they grew gray before Veii that the tribunes might not have it in their power to bring in a bill about the partition of lands or any thing else respecting the interest of the commons as they had not a sufficient number of citizens to support their bills and make head against the in trigues of the nobles That these delinquents had sentence already passed against them by the senate the Roman people and by their own colleagues For by a decree of the senate they were set aside as magi strates and when they refused to abdicate in terms of that order they were compelled to do it by their col leagues for fear of a dictator Nor was this all for the Roman people proceeded to make a new election not as usual on the 13th of December but iostautly on the 1 st of October because had they continued any longer in office this republic must have sunk at Â nce CM AH 12 ROMAN HISTORY 419 And yet these men convicted and damned as they have been before so many tribunals have the assur anoe to j pear before the people expecting to be ac quitted mtagining they have been sufficiently punish ed in losing the fasces two months before the time They do not seem to know the difference between dis arming them for fear of further mischief and punishing them for what they have done Were not their col leagues broke who had committed no fault Upon this occasion the Romans ought to recal those dispositions they felt on their late defeat when they saw their army covered with wounds flying affrighted and fal ling down at the gates of Rome accusing not fortune ftor the gods but these two generals They may rest assured that there is not a soul in this assembly who that day did not heartily curse and detest L Virginius a id M Sergius their families and all that belonged to them Is it fit then that after invoking the gods to punish these crimmals that they should receive the least indulgence from those who have them in their power which they ought to exert against them For the gods are never the executors of vengeance them selves it is enough that they furnish the injured with an opportunity of revenge  CHAP XII  Sergius and Virginius condemned A Plebeian elected to the military Tribuneship for the first time T HE people irritated by these harangues condemned the criminals each in a fine of 10 000 asses of brass nor would give any ear to Sergius s plea of the chance and fortune of war nor to Virginitis s intreaty not to ren der him more unhappy at home than he had been in the field The resentment of the people being turned totally against these two generals quite cancelled the remem brance of the co optation of tribunes and of the treacher ous attempt upon the Trebonian law The tribunes after this victory to give the people an immediate return for their sentence published the Agrarian law and forbade â   Â jÂ 32 i  9 420 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V the tax to be collected although they had so many armiei to support and their military affairs were in so successful a train that they were like to come to a conclusion with out the etl usion of blood For the camp which bad been lost before Veil was recovered and secured by guards and redoubts The tribunes M Kmilius and Caeso Fabius commanded there M Furius led an army against the Falisci and Cu Cornelius against the Capeuates but not an enemy appeared however they carried off a considerable booty and laid waste the country by burn ing theiv villages and consuming their corn without meddling with their towns either to assault or besiege them Having plundered the lands of the Volsci they at tempted to take Anxur by storm but as its situation was high they were disappointed and began to turn the siege into a blockade by surrounding it with a moat and rampart The province of the Volsci had fallen to Va lerius Potitus Whilst these military affairs were in this train an intestine division gave them much more trouble than all the foreign wars in which they were engaged As the tribunes would not suffer the tax to be levied and consequently no remittances having been made to the commanders the soldiers became importunate for their pay which almost had diffused the seditious sentiments throughout the camp which raged in the city Whilst the people were in this passion with the fathers the tribunes of the people represented that now was the time for establishing their liberty and transferring the honours of the state from such wretches as Sergius and Virginias to bold and manly Plebeians However they went no farther than just to ascertain their right by electing one of their order P Licinius Calvus to the dignity of military tribune with consular power the rest were all Patricians viz P Maenius L Titinius P Mselius L Furius Medullinus and L Publius Volscus The people as well as the man of their choice were really amazed that they had carried so great a point Licinius had never borne any public office before only he was an ancient senator and now a very old man ft does pot appear from what motives he was pitched on to be the first and the pfoperest person to fill this ho CHAP 13 ROMAN HISTORY 421 nourable station Some believe that it was in coaapli njent to his brother Ch Cornelius who had been mili tary tribune the vear before and had given triple pay to the soldiers Others ascribe it to a very seasonable speech in which he recommended unanimity to both or ders aittl na l tne thanks of senate and people The tribunes elated with this victory at the election passed from their opposition to the tax which had greatly clog ged the wheels of government Wherefore the mo ney was collected without any trouble and remitted to the army   CHAP XIII An epidemical distemper Introduction of the Lectistcr nium Defeat of the Faliici Capenatcs Ifc LNXUR in the country of the Volsci was soon after retaken owmg to the negligence of the city guards upou a holiday This year was remarkable for the severity of the winter ami a prodigious fall of snow insomuch thai the roads were impassable and the river ijuite frozen up It had n i influence however with respect to provisions as a sufficient stock had been laid in before As P L cinius had obtained his office without noise and with greater joy on the part of the people than vexation on the part of the senate so he executed it without offence to either which engaged the commons in a peculiar manner to raise Plebetans to the military tribuneship next election Of all the Patricians who offered their service none was accepted but M Veturius The centuries in gene ral voted Plebetans for ihe remainmg places of military tribunes with consular power namely M Pomponius C Duilius Volero Publilius Cn Genutius and L Ati lius Whether it was owing to the intemperance of the air changing suddenly from cold to heat or to some other came the severe winter was succeeded by a sum mer gross and pestiferous to all kinds of animals As no prescription was effectual in removing a distemper that seemed incurable the senate ordered the Sibylline books to be consulted T 422 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V The duumvirs who had the care of performing the sacred rites instituted the Lectisternium for the first time at Home and continued the festival for eight day having spread three beds with all the pomp and magni ficence the simplicity of these times would admit to ap pease Apollo Latona and Diana Hercules Mercury and Neptune This ceremony was also celebrated by private families Open house was kept throughout the whole city and every thing brought out to the street to be used in common Nay it is said that every one known or unknown and all strangers were entertained with a hearty welcome Persons at vartance laying aside all animosity and disputes conversed with freedom and affability Prisoners

object of terror three confederate armies being ready to fall upon them at once For all on a sudden the Capenates aniFalisci having come to the assistance of the Vejen tes as before invested the camp so that the Romans were obliged to front three different ways to repel as many different attacks The remembrance of Sergius and Virginius s fate had a peculiar influence upon their behaviour The troops in the grand camp that in the former action had been idle spectators being instantly led round fell upon the rear of the Capenates who had attacked the Roman lines The battle being thus begun in that quarter quite disconcerted the Falisci and a sally very seasonably made from the lesser camp during this consternation made them fairly show their backs The Capenates Leing thus repulsed the conquerors pursued them with prodigious slaughter Nor was it long be ore the troops which ravaged their country accidentally fell io with the scattered remains of this arm and cut them all to pieces

their fright and having gained an eminence drew them up again in order of battle but he took care not to risk another engagement upon fair ground The disgrace was greater than all the loss they sus tained which however in the consequesce was near proving a total defeat such was the consternation not only at Rome where fame had exaggerated every cir cumstance but also in the camp before Veii For a re port having been circulated all over the camp that the victorious Capenates and Falisci had cut off the Roman troops with both their generals and were in full march and at no great distance with all the Etrurian youth for Veil it was with much difficulty the soldiers coutd be prevented from flying outright The alarm was still greater at Rome fÂ r there they weje persuaded thai the camp at Veil was already attacked and part of the ene my in full march to attack the city The citizens flew to the ramparts and the ladies whom the general con sternation had driven put of their houses offered up sup plications in the temples imploring the gods that if the Romans had by proper rites renewed the neglected cere monies if the prodigies had been duly expiated they would protect the

curries on new worki at Veit Y this time the games and the Feria Latinae wÂ re renewed the waters drained from the AI ban lake into the fields and the destruction of Veii at no great distance Wherefore Furius Camillus the general for whom the fates had reserved the destruction of Veii and the pre servation of his country was named dictator who also appointed P Cornelius Scipio general of the horse The change of the general in a moment gave a wonder ful turn to all their affairs New hopes new souls seem ed to animate the whole bfidy of the republic and fortune seemed to have come over to the side of the city His first care was to punish those who had fled from Veii in the sudden consternation with all the strictness of military discipline and thereby taught them that an enemy ought not to be the principal object of terror to a soldier Having fixed a day for the levies he in the mean time posted to Veii in order to revive the courage of the troops there and then returned to Rome to raise a new army Nobody refused to enlist foreigners too the youth of the Latins and Hernici offered their service and came accordingly for which he thanked them in full senate When every thing was ready for taking the field the dictator by order of the senate made a vow to celebrate the great games when Veii should be taken and to rebuild and cledicate a new the temple of the goddess Matnta f which had formerly been dedicated by king Servius Tulliujj Wherefore leavmg the city with his army and thereby raising the expectation ra ther than the hopes of he people he fell in with the Falisci and Capenates in the territory ot Nepete I Every action of his was the result of prudence and reason  Those of the Circus f Juno sister of Semele aunt of Bacchus and wife of Ath nas was so called at Rome t Ncpi CHAP 20 ROMAN HISTORY 431 and the success as usual was answerable He not only routed the enemy in the engagement but took their camp where he found considerable spoils of which the greatest part was remitted to the quaestor and the re mainder given to the soldiers From thence he led his army to Veii where he increased the number or forts on the lines and prohibiting by proclamation all fighting without orders which bad often happened between the walls of the town and the lines in inconsiderate skir mishes he employed the people in useful works He then began the most important and laborious work of all which was to carry a mine into the enemy s cita Jel That there might be no intermission in the workr and at the same time to ease the workmen that they might not be oppressed with continual labour under ground he divided the pioneers into six bauds each of which was to work six hours at a time Thus the work was carried on night and day without intermission till a passage was opened to the citadel CHAP XX Tlie works completed Disputes about dividing the spoil J HE dictator when he saw that he must now infal libly conquer and that the richest city of Italy was on the point of falling into his hands where of consequence more considerable spoils would be taken than had been gained in all their former wars together that he might neither draw the anger of the soldiers upon himself for dividing them with too much parsimony nor the envy of the fathers for distributing them with too much pro fusion wrote to the senate to inform that body That bv â the favour of the immortal gods his own conduct ahii the perseverance of the soldiers Veii would soon be in the hands of the Roman people That therefore he  would be glad to have their opinion with regard to the disposal of the spoils The senate were divided into two opinions The one was that of Licinius the father who being first asked by his son answered that he thought proclamation should be made that whoever of the citizens was desirous of Â 2 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V    sharing in the plunder of Vii might repair to the dicta tor s camp The other was the opinion of Ap Claudius who spoke warmly against this bounty as being an un precedented prodigality and inconsistent with equity ami sound policy That if it was not judged proper thai the money taken from the enemy should be lodged in the treasury exhausted as it was by so many wars he would advise that it should be appropriated to the payment of the soldiers which would be an ease to the people in re gard to the taxes That thereby every family would be equally sensible of the benefit of this largess and the rapacious hands of idle citizens would not deprive the soldiers of the rewards so justly doe to their labour it be ing usually observed that the bravest and most forward in battle were the least active and expert at plundering Liciniu on the other hand insisted that the money o reserved and appropriated would be a source of end less discontent and occasion impeachments and seditions and new laws It was better therefore pursued he to conciliate to the senate the good will of the multi tude by a bounty which would relieve their present indigence exhausted as they were by the contributions of so many years and make them sensibl of the fruits â tof persevering in a war in Which they might almost be said to have grown old That what each man should take with his own hand from the enemy and bring home would give him more pleasure and satisfaction than a gift of much greater value at the pleasure of another That the dictator in referring the matter to the senate had no other view on earth but to spare himself envy and reproach That the senaie also ought from a like regard to themselves to refer the whole to the disposal of the people and suffer them to take the plunder as chance should throw it in their way This advice which was the most popular for the senate ap peared to be the safest wherefore proclamation was made that such as wanted to share in the plunder of Veii had only to repair to the camp which in conse quence was soon filled with prodigious numbers that flocked thither CHAP 21 ROMAN HISTORY 4SS  â CHAP XXI  â  i Veii taken and plundered by the Soldiers JL HE dictator then wept out to take the auspices and ordered the soldiers to arm O Pythian Apollo said he it is by thy inspiration and under thy direction that I am going to carry destruction to Veii to you then I devote the tenth part of the spoils And O queen Juno who now residest in Veii be pleased to follow us victorious to our city which shall soon be thy city and where thou shalt possess a temple worthy thy majesty Having fmished his prayers and his army being sufficiently numerous he ordered an assault to be made on all sides of the place at once to give the be sieged no opportunity of discovering their danger from the mine The Vejentes never dreamed that they were betrayed by their own diviners and given up by foreign oracles that some of their tutelarv gods had been invit ed to partake of the spoils and others conjured to leave their city to take up with new habitations and new temples among the enemy and in shori that their last hour was come and therefore feariug nothing less than that their walls were undermined and their citadel full of enemies were eager to run in emulation of each other â to the walls unable to guess why the Romans who had not appeared out of their lines for many days advanced all mi a sudden like madmen to attack the place on all skies A story goes here that his majesty of Veii was at that instant sacrificing to the gods when the soldiers in the mine heard the diviner say that the gods would give the victory to him who should dissect the entrails of that vic tim and the Romans immediately opening the mine seized upon the entrails and carried them to the dicta tor But in things of so old a date I think it sufficient to take what is probable for true Incidents of this kind which are fitter for the stage that dehghts in the marvel Ious than for history it is not worth while either to af firm or refute A select body of troops which at that time filled the wine appeared suddenly in arms in the temple of Juno 434 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V which stood in the citadel of Veii Some attacked the soldiers behind as they defended the walls some un barred the gates and some of them whilst they were pelted from the house tops with stones and tiles by the women and slaves set fire to the houses The whole city resounded with the shouts of the invaders and cries of the besieged mingled with the shrieks and lamenta tions of women and children In an instant the walls were cleared of those who defended them and the gates broke open when part of the Roman army entered in whole battalions others scaled the deserted ramparts so that the city soon swarmed with enemies and the battle raged in every quarter However after a prodigious slaughter it began to subside when the dictator ordered the heralds to proclaim quarter to all who should lay down their arms Here the slaughter ended and the surrender of the un armed multitude commenced then also with permission of the dictator the soldiers fell to plunder When Ca millus had ocular demonstration that the spoils both in quantity and value far surpassed what he had ever ex pected or imagined he is said to have lifted up his bands to heaven praying  that if the good fortune of the â Roman people or his own appeared too great in thÂ â sight of gods or men that the envy thereof might fall upon him but to spare the commonwealth It is fur ther added that as he was turning round after this prayer that he fell on the ground an accident construed by some to presage his condemnation after it had really happened and the destruction of Rome after it was taken by the Gauls both these events happened a few years after Thus was that day spent in slaughtering the Ve jentes and plundering their most opulent city CHAP XXII Murmurs against Camillta Juno brought to Rome EXT day the dictator exposed the freemen to publie sale the proceeds whereof alone were set apart for the public treasury At this the people took great oflence alledging that what plunder they carried home with them they had no reason to ascribe to the general CHAP 22 ROMAN HISTORY 435 with a riew to make them the authors of his own male volence had submitted an affair to them which entirely depended on himself nor to the senate but to the fa mily of the Liciui a son whereof had laid the matter be fore the senate and his father had strongly espoused the interest of the people in supporting the motion After all the worldly riches had been removed from Veil they began to remove what had been consecrated to the geds and the gods themselves but in this they acted more like worshippers than pillagers For some of the youngest men of the whole army were selected to whom wheii their bodies were washed perfectly clean and clothed in white it was given in charge to transport queen Juno to Rome They entered her temple with re verence touching her at first with a religious awe be cause that statue by a ceremony among the Etrurians none used to touch but a priest of a certain family At last when one of the lads whether by a divrne impulse pr in a youthful frolic asked her Will you go to Rome Juno Yes yes cried they altogether you see the goddess nods her assent which gave rise to the story that she was heard to pronounce distinctly  With all my heart Certain it is that she was easily moved from her place and that they got her to Rome with as little trouble or difficulty as if she had followed them They conveyed her safe and sound to the Aventine hill whither the dictator had invited heV and which was from that time to be the seat of her residence for ever and where he dedicated a temple to her in discharge of a vow he had made Such was the fate of Veii the richest city of all Tus cany the final ruin of which demonstrated its great ness for having sustained an unremitted siege for ten summers and as many winters wherein Rome had suf fered more from it than it had done from Rome it was at last by unavoidable destiny reduced not by force bus by stratagem  436 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V s â CHAP XXIII CuHilllits returns in triumph The people disgutted  HEN news of the reduction of Veii reached Rome although the prodigies had been expiated the responses of the diviners and of the Pythian oracle a secret to none and to secure success by every device human prudence could afford they had chosen the greatest ge neral of his age Marcus Furius yet because the fortune of war had shifted so often and they had met with so many defeats the joy was incredible as if the cause of it had been beyond all expectation Before the senate couid pass any decree the Roman ladies had filled all the temples returning thanks to the gods Tbe senate ordained solemn supplications for four days a greater number than had ever been appointed in any former war Never had any general such a retinue before at his arrival for all ranks and conditions ran in crowds to meet him and the magnificence of that day s triumph far exceeded what was usual on such occasions He himself was more especially conspicuous having made his entry into the city in a chariot drawn by four white horses whence it was inferred that he exalted himself not only above the condition of a citizen but even of human nature They considered it as an act of impiety for the dictator to be drawn by the same number of horses and of the same colour too with those of Jupiter and the sun and this circumstance alone however much it might heighten the splendour of bis triumph rendered it less agreeable to the spectators After this he drew the plan of the temple of ueen JunO on the Aventine hill and dedicated that of the goddess Matuta Wherefore having thus performed his duty to the gods and done such signal service to the state he abdicated the dictatorship The present to Apollo came then under public con sideration When Camillas represented that he had vowed the tenth part of the spoils to the god the priests gave it as their opinion that the people ought to per form the vow But to prescribe a method to make the neople bring in the spoils so as to deduct from them CHAP 24 ROMAN HISTORY i 4S7 what was due to the god was no easy matter At last they had recourse to an expedient which seemed to be least troublesome They ordered all those who wished to have their consciences clear with respect to this vow and to insure the safety of then families to make a fair and candid estimate of the booty they had obtained and lodge the tenth pair of that value in the public trea sury that it might be formed into a present of pure gold worthy the august temple and majesty of that god for svhom it was mtended and suitable to the grandeur of the Roman people This contribution added to the people s disgust at Camillas In the mean time ambassadors came from the Volsci to sue for peace which was granted them not out of respect to their merit but to give the people some re spite from war with which they had been so long and so much harassed  CHAP XXIV Inroltment for a Colony to be planted in the Volscian ter ritory Motion for transferring it to Veii L FTER the reduction of Veii six military tribunes with consular power were

with the Falisci fell by lot to the Cornelii that with the Capenates to Valerius and Servilius they made no attempt upon their cities by storm or blockade contenting themselves with ravaging the country and carrying off their implements of hus bandry JSot one fruit tree nor stalk of corn was left in the country This distress humbled the Capenates They sued for peace and obtained it The war with the Falisci was carried on At Rome during these transactions there were many seditions to appease which they had determined to send a colony into the country of the Volsci for which 3000 Roman citizens were enrolled The three commissioners chosen to conduct this business had assigned to each planter three seven twelfths Roman acres The people began 438 TITUS L1VIUS BOOK V to look upon this as no favour imagining it was only a bait to divert their attention from more lucrative ex pectations For why should the people be banished among the Volsci when they had in prospect Veii a most beautiful city and all its domains richer and more extensive than even the territory of Rome With Veii they thought Rome would bear no comparison either for situation or the grandeur of its buildings and accom modations public and private Moreover a motion was made which became more serious after Rome had been taken by the Gauls of re moving to Veii But in this motion it was proposed that part of the senate and part of the people should â settle at Veii and that the two cities inhabited by Ro mans should constitute but one commonwealth But this the nobility opposed so warmly that they declared they would sooner die in sight of the Roman people than suffer such a bill to be tabled  If there be such dissensions in one city what must there be in two Would any man in his senses prefer a conquered city to his own native city that had conquered it Or rea der the captive town of Veii more considerable after its fall than ever it had been before it  In fme that their fellow citizens

Camillus we nt from place to place loudly declaiming  That he was not at all sur  prised to see the people seized with madness seeing they had nothing less at heart than the performance of their vows to the gods he would say nothing of  the contribution which had more the appearance of an alms than a tenth of the spoil Each of the indi  viduals had bound himself to the performance so that the state was free But he was obliged in conscience to tell them one thing that the tenth of the moveable  part of the spoils had only been set apart for the god whilst the captive city and all the territory belonging  to it were comprehended in his vow The senate pretending to be perplexed about this scnuple referred the whole to the pontiffs who in con cert with Camillus declared as the opinion of their col lege that a tenth of whatever had belonged to the Ve jentes before the dictator made his vow and had after he had made the vow fallen into the hands of the Ro mans ought to be sacred to Apollo In consequence of this judgment the city and territory were valued and a tenth of the estimate given out of the treasury to the military tribunes to be given in exchange for gold But as there was not enough of this metal to be had in Rome the Ladies having had several meetings to deliberate on that affair with one consent made offer of their service to the military tribunes and in consequence thereof brought their gold and all their ornaments to the trea sury Never were thev fathers better pleased with any thing than with this instance of complaisance in the ladies in return for which generosity it is said they conferred the honour on them of riding in covered chariots to the sacrifices and public games and in open phaetons on festival and other days The gold from each was weigh ed and valued so as the equivalent might be return ed them in money and they fixed on a massy cup to be  Plutarch makes that gold amount to eight talents an enor mous sum for those times

tribunes of the commons began to stir again The multiiude were enraged at the whole body of the nobi lity but especially at Camillus In their absence they exclaimed prodigiously that by their sequestrations and their consecrations they had reduced the spoils of Veit to nothing In their presence they bs haved with more delicacy as they never seemed to avoid but rather throw themselves in their way when they were disposed to be in a passion Finding the matter was not like to be de termined for this year they chose again to the Plebeian trihune ihip the same men who had preferred the

progress owing to their delays whilst Camillus their roost formidable ad versary acquired new glory by his conduct in the war with the Falisci The enemy for some time kept themselves shu up in Falisci till the devastations made by he Romans in the CHAP 27 ROMAN HISTORY 441 territory about it provoked them at length to come out Their tear however did not suffer them to advance far They encamped about a mile from the town The only security and that not a slight one upon which they de pended was the difficulty of approaching them through rough and craggy Ways through narrow defiles and over steep rocks Cnmilius pressed a peasant for a guide and decamping in the dead of night shewed himself by the morning s dawn on a ground that overlooked them The Romans intrenched themselves in three di visions the remainder of the army standing under arms ready to engage whilst the enemy attempted to ob struct the warks they were routed and put to flight Such was the consternation of the Falisci that they ran past their camp which was in their way with great pre cipitation to the town The list of the killed and wounded before the fugi tives could get within their gates was numerous The camp was taken and the whole spoil given up to thp quaestors much to the dissatisfaction of the soldiers but they were kept in order by strict discipline The same virtue for which they hated him they could not help ad miring After this victory he invested the town and surrounded it with lines The townsmen sometimes as they found an opportunity sallied out and had slight skirmishes with the Roman guards spinning oul the time with little difference as to their hopes on either side For the town was better supplied with corn and other provisions than the besiegers having taken care to fill their magazines before hand and in all probability the siege of Falerii would have cost them as much time and trouble as that of Veii had done had not the fortune of the Roman general and a new instance which he exhi bited of his well known abilities in military affairs has tened on the victory CHAP XXVII Villainy of a Schoolmaster Generosity of Camillm Its effects on the Falisci IT was a custom among the Falisci to make the same person both tutor and companion to their children and 4t2 TITUS L1VIUS BOOK V to put many boys at th e same time nnder the care of one master a practice among the Greeks at this day The master who hail the greatest character for erudition as is generally the case had the charge of the youth of greatest distinction This man in time of peace usual ly carried his pupils out before the city to play aud ex ercise themselves Nor during this war did he discon tinue it sometimes carrying them a little and sometimes a greater way from the city Eut at last having found his opportunity he decoyed them by play and enter taining tales farther from the gates than usual first to the Roman out posts then to the camp till at last he landed them quite at Camillas tent There he crowned his villainous action with as villainous a speech viz that he now delivered Falerii into the hands of the Romans putting these young gentlemen under his power whose fathers had the principal sway in the city When Camillas had heard the scoundrel to an end he replied  Execrable wretch thou dost not approach either a general or a people with thy impious pre sent like thyself With the Falisci we have indeed no express and formal alliance  but that which nature hath established between all men both does and shalt subsist between us War has its rights and so has peace and we have learned to make it with no less justice than valour We are in arms it is true but not against that age which is spared even in cities taken by storm but against men armed likeourselves and these too who without any injury or provocation from us attacked the Roman camp at Veii them to the utmost of thy power thou hast exceeded by a crime of an extraordinary nature But as for me I shall conquer as at Veii by Roman arts by valour works and arms The traitor was then stripped his hands tied behind his back and then delivered up to his pupils who were furnished with rods to whip him all the way to the city This spectacle brought prodigious crowds of people when the magistrates convened the senate to deliberate about an affair that seemed so extraordinary So great a revolution in their sentiments did this circumstance effect that they who before had been so inflamed with hatred and resentment that they would have preferred  28 ROMAN HISTORY 443 annihilation with theVejeotes to an accommodation with tbe Capenatesi were unanimously determined to sue for peace Nothing was talked of in the forum or senate house but the virtue of the Romans and the probity of their general and accordingly with one consent am bassadors were dispatched to the camp to Camillus and by his permissioni to the senate at Rome to surrender Falerii When they had leave of audience it is said they ad dressed the senate in the following terms Illustrious fathers conquered by you and your general in a  manner that can give no offence to gods nor men we are come to surrender ourselves to you convinced that  we shall live more happy under your government than under our own laws a circumstance that reflects a pe culiar honour on the conqueror The event of this  war furnishes mankind with

sin cere than those lie had formerly received when the white horses drew his triumphal chariot through the city The senate made honourable mention of his mo desty and in order to discharge his vow with all possible dispatch L Valerius L Sergius and A Manlius were deputed to carry a golden cup to Delphos as a present 4 TITUS LIVIUS Book V to Apollo The long galiey in which these deputies embarked was intercepted by some pirates from the isle iil Liparre not fa from the streights ot Messina and by them carried into Liparae It was their custom to divide all their captures among the

same regard tor justice and religion And having not only entertained them with great hos pitality but in person with a squadron of ships con voyed them to Delphi and from thence safe back to Rome the right of hospitality was conferred on him by a decree of the senate and great presents were made him at the public expence Throughout this year the war with the i qui took such various turns that it remained a question both at Rome and in the camp which side had the better The generals in the war were C iEmilius and Sp Posthu mius At first they acted in conjunction and when they had defeated the enemy in a pitched battle iEmwius thought proper to go to garrison Vetrugo and Posthu mius to lay waste the enemy s borders The latter marching with his troops with too little precaution after bis late success was surprised and driven to the adja cent hills in great consternation by the JEqui Their fright commumcated itself to the other garrison at Ver rugo Posthumius having rallied his men and got them into a place of safety reproached them severely with their panic and flight telling them that they had suffered themselves to be beat by a most cowardly enemy who always shewed their backs The whole army acknow ledged that there was too much truth in what they had heard and confessed the frfult of which they had been guilty bqt promised that they woultl make amends and give the enemy but short time to rejoice over them They begged with earnestness to be instantly led to the attack of the enemy s camp which Vas within sight in 9 ROMAN HISTORY 446 a plain below declaring at the same

night over and they could see what they were about as well as by day The shouts of the com batants reaching Verrugo it was believed there that Posthumius camp was assaulted which occasioned such a fright that notwithstanding all that Emilius could urge to prevent them the troops dispersed and fled for refuge to Tusculum Thence flew a report to Rome that Posthumius and hrs army were cut to pieces Bat Posthumius as soon as it was light and safe to make a hot pursuit without danger of falling into an ambush rode through the ranks reminding them of their pro mise which inspired them with such ardour that the JEqni could no longer stand before them The slaughter that ensued of the fugitives was rather the effects  of re sentment than bravery and ended in the destruction of the enemy Posthumius letter crowned with laurel soon undeceived them with respect to the melancholy news from Tusculum bearing that the Romans had gained a complete victory and that the army of the flLijui had been quite destroyed CHAP XXIX Motions ef the JEtpd Trial and condemnation of two Tribunes the tribunes of the people had made no progress in their bill the commons laboured hard to keep those in office who had proposed it as did the fathers on the other hand tq get those re elected who had opposed it The commons prevailed however in the com it ia The fathers in revenge of this disappointment

they would not abandon that country for which they and their fathers had fought vith so much valour and success pointing at the same time to the capitol the temple of Vesta and other temples around them conjuring them not to drive t ie Roman people like felons and exiles from their native country and their guardian gods to Inhabit a city but lately peopled by their enemies and bring matters to

year also the temple of queen Juno vowed by the same dictator during the same war was dedicated when by all accounts the zeal of the Roman ladies rendered the ceremony particularly splendid With the 32qni there was an action at the Algidus but of no great consideration as the enemy were routed almost before they had struck a stroke Valerius had a triumph decreed him because he pursued the enemy farther and did more execution than Manlius who was only honoured with an ovation   In this same year anew war broke out with the Volsi nienses against whom no new army could be led because a famine and pestilence occasioned by an excessive hot and dry season then raged in the Roman territory This gave the Volsinienses so much assurance that 11 CHAP 32 ROMAN HISTORY  449 I conjunction with the Salpenates they made an incursion upon the Roman lands without the least provocation War was then declared against both nations In the mean time C Julius one of the censors was carried off and L Cornelius substituted in his place a thing after wards deemed inauspicious because Rome was taken in that lustrum Nor after this time did the Romans ever substitute in the place of a censor who died in his office another person to be colleague to the survivor The consuls too falling sick the senate decreed that they should abdicate and an inter regnurii ensue The con suls having therefore demitted in terms of the senate s decree M Furius Camillus was created inter rex and succeeded by Cornelius Scipio and he again by Valerius Potitus who held the comitia for the election of six mi

Volsinienses fed by lot to L Lucretius and C jEmilius and with the Salpenates to Agrippa Furius and Servius Sutpicius The first en gagement they had was with the Volsinienses who were more formidable for their numbers than their prowess For they were routed and put to flight at the first onset and 8000 men in arms being surrounded by the Roman cavalry laid down their arms and surrendered at discre tion The news of this battle cooled the ardour of the Sal penates so that they durst not appear in the field but shut themselves up armed as they were within their walls The Romans pillaged both the Volsinran and Salpina The Volsinienaes and Salpenates were both nations ofEtruriv The former inhabited a considerable city Volsinium the capital of one of the twelve Lucumonies situated near the

tired of the war obtained a truce for twenty years on condition of replacing whatever they had taken from the people of Rome and of being at the expence of one year s pay to the army This year too one Ca dicius a man of low rank told the tribunes that he heard a miraculous voice in the New Street above the temple of Vesta where there is â now a chapel which pronounced distinctly  Go tell  the magistrates the Gauls draw near The man s meanness as it is the way of the world brought the warning into contempt Moreover that nation was re mote and consequently little known But not only were the warnings from the gods despised on this occasion but Rome pushed headlong by the fates to destruction had also deprived herself in the banishment of Camillas of every human aid This great man having

a meeting in his house of his kindred and clients which comprehended a great part of the commons and when he had sounded them with re spect to the charge laid against him and found by their answers that they could not acquit him though they would most cheerfully contribute to his fine be rather chose to banish himself from Rome praying the immortal gods  That if he had suffered this injury

to soliciv CHAP  ROMAN HISTORY 451 aid against the Gauls The tradition is that the Gauls charmed with the excellent fruits and especially with the delicious wines of Italy which they had never tasted before crossed the Alps and seized upon lands which had formerly been in possession of the Etrurians and that Arunx a Clusian had imported wine into Gaul to entice that nation to make the invasion out of resent ment that Lucumo had debauched his wife in return for his attention as his tutor and from whom he could get no satisfaction his interest being very considerable un less he was supported bv foreign aid in consequence ofi which that he conducted the Gauls over the Alps and advised them to the siege of Clusium I will not pretend to say that the Gauls might have Leen brought to Clusium by this Arunx or some other inhabitant of the place but it is very certain that those who laid siege to Ciusium were not the first who had crossed the Alps for the Gauls had found the way to Italy two hundred years before the siege of Clusium or the capture of Rome Nor was it these Etrurians whom the Gaulic troops first encountered but long be fore who inhabit the country between the Appenines and the Alps with whom they were frequently at war  The Tuscan dominions were of considerable extent  both by sea and la nd before the Roman empire existed From the upper to the lower sea by which Italy is sur rounded in the form of an island their very names as certain the mighty power of this people the nations of Italy calling the one the Tuscan from the general name of the people and the other

excepting a cor ner belonging to the Venetians who dwelt round  bay of the sea as far as the Alps Nor can it be doubted but this too was the origin of the Alpine nations espe cially the Rhetae whom the situation of their country hath rendered so wil that they retain nothing of their  452  TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V original but a little of their language and that too cor rupted CHAP XXXIV In continuation JL HE history which I have been able to collect of the descent of the Gauls into Italy is as follows Dur ing the reign of Tarquinius Priscus at Rome the Bitu riges had the supreme authority among the Celue who inhabited a third part of Gaul and gave them a king called Ambigatus a very powerful prince both on ac count of his personal bravery and fortune public and private who finding that the part of Gaul of which he was sovereign was so overstocked with produce as well as inhabitants that it was next to impossible to manage  them signified to Bellovisus and Sigovisus his sister s sons two active young fellows as he was now an old man and wished to get clear of a troublesome crowd that he resolved to send them into whatever settlements the gods by augury should direct They might raisÂ what number of men they pleased that no nation wherever they came might be able to repel them The Herniciau forest a fell by lot to Sigovisus bat the gods pointed out to Bellovisus a

landed which was naturally defended by surrounding woods The Gauls pursued their route over the pathless Alps by the Tau rinian forest c and having defeated an army of Tuscans near the river Ticin

nation I find that came first to Clusium and thence to Rome but I cannot say whether they Icame alone or assisted by all the other Cisalpine emi grants The Clusiaas terrified at this new war when they saw the number aod extraordinary size of the ene my and withal the kind of arms they used at the same time having often heard that the Etrurians had been often defeated by them both on this and the other side of the o atthough they had no alliance with Rome nor any claim to her friendship if it were not that they had not appeared in defence of the Vejentes their kins men agiCinsK the Romans sent ambassadors to Rome to solicit assistance from the senate In this however they did not succeed but the thret sons of Ambustius Fabius were sent ambassadors to treat with the Gauls in name of the senate and people of Rome and to represent that they ought not to attack the friends and allies of the people of Rome who never had injured them and in whose defence should it prove necessary they would be obliged to arm But the most eligible alternative was if possible to prevent it and it would add more to the character of the Gauls whose settlement there had been but of a short Standing to make themselves known by the arts of peace than their prowess in war Â Who inhabited the Bourbotmois i Who inhabited 1 angress c Who possessed part of the dutchy of Urbrn of the territory of Perugia

nothing irritating but it was delivered in a tone and with an air which breathed more of the Gaulic fierceness than of Roman politeness Having delivered their commission in a council of the Gauls they had the following return That the name of the Romans was but iittle known to them though they had no tioubt of their bravery since the Clusians had thought proper to apply to them in their danger That as thjey had chose rather to employ the methods of pa cification than their arms in defence of their allies they on their side should not reject the offered peace provided the Clusians who had more land than they could well manage would give up a part of it to the Gauls who needed it Without this condition all proposals for peace were inadmissible That they would be glad to receive their answer in presence of the Roman am bassadors and in case of a refusal they would give them battle in presence of the same Romans that they might be able to say upoo their return how much the Gauls are superior to all mankind in bravery Upon this the ambassadors demanded to know  By what right they could insist on having land from its possessors and if not granted to threaten them with war Besides what business had they in Tuscany We carry our right replied they fiercely  in the points of our swords the brave are lords of the world Both sides were now highly exasperated and flew to their arms and began the action There the ambassadors the fates HOW pushing on the destruction of Rome in direct con tradiction to the law of nations took up arms Nor could this remain a secret when three warriors of the greatest distinction and valour of all the Roman youth fought at the head of the Etrurians so conspicuously did the bravery of the e strangers distinguish them from the Clusians Moreover Q Fabius riding up before the first line and meeting one of the Gaulic commanders who was rushing furiously upon the van of the Etrurians ran him through the side with his lance and kilted him 456  TITUS LIVKJS BOOK V on the spot Whilst he was stripping off his spoils he was known by the enemy and the report immediately spread through the whole army that it was one of the lioman ambassadors From that moment all hostilities ceased against the Clusians A retreat was sounded and nothing was heard but threats of vengeance against Rome Some were of opinion that they should instantly march thither but the advice of the elder in the council prevailed who were of opinion that they ought to begin by sending deputies to Rome to complain of what bad happened and to require that the Fabii should be deli vered into their hands for having violated their charac ter and with it the law of nations After the Gaulic deputies had thus delivered their commission and made their demand the senate were much dissatisfied with the conduct of the Fabii and made no objection to the justice of what the Barbarians insisted on But a vicious complaisance for young persons of their distinction prevented the senators from determin ing what they thought no more than reasonable on this occasion Wherefore that they might not be charge able with the consequences with which a rupture with the Gauls might be attended they referred the affair to i the decision of the people There the power and influ ence of the delinquents prevailed so much that far from punishing them the people named them to the military tribuneship for the following year The deputies full of that indignation which may be easily conceived return ed breathing only war and revenge With the three Fabii Q Sulpicius Longus Q Servilius a fourth time nnd Ser Cornelius Maluginensis were created military tribunes CHAP XXXVII â The Gauls march to Rome VV HEN Rome was threatened with such an inunda tion of misery she did not as was usual in the wars against the Fidenates Vejentes and other neighbouring â states apply the last and most vigorous measure in ap ointing a dictator so much does fortune infatuate m en CHAP 38 ROMAN HISTORY 457 when she is unwilling they should avert her impending purposes that in the present conjuncture when an un known and terrible enemy from the ocean and utmost verges of the earth were advancing by rapid marches to attack her Rome made no extraordinary effort by ap pointing a supreme magistrate or suing for foreign aid The tribunes whose rashness had involved Rome in this war presided in every thing speaking lightly of the war they made the levies with no more care than was usual upon the most ordinary occasions In the mean time the Gauls when they were inform ed that the violators of the law of nations had been rais â ed to the first dignities of the state and their embassy slighted gave full vent to their passion to which the nation is much addicted immediately pulled up their ensigns and began their march with all expedition When during their march they observed the confusion and terror of the cities through which they passed as they ran to their arms and the peasants flying before them they called out aloud that they were marching to Rome Wherever they went they made a very formid able appearance as their numbers both in horse and foot covered a vast tract of ground The rapidity of their march the news whereof fame and couriers from Clusi um and other states had brought to Rome before them occasioned a terrible consternation there Troops were levied in haste and without choice and Jed out in great confusion which with difficulty came up with the enemy eleven miles from the city where the river Allia rising out of the river Crustuminum and run  ning in a very deep channel falls into the Tiber a little below the Salarian high way The whole plain both before and round them was covered with enemies and the Gauls of whom a mighty bluster is characteristics by their barbarous songs and hideous bowlings made all about them resound with a horrible noise CHAP XXXVIII A battle Tfie Romans defeated 1 HERE the military tribunes took no care either to make choice of au advantageous post for their camp or i 458 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V to fortify it with an entrenchment to which they might retreat in case of a defeat and equally regardless of the gods 33 they had been deficient in human precaution without auspices without sacrifices they drew up their army extending the wing  that they might not be sur rounded by their enemies numbers But although by extending their wings in that manner they had thinned and weakened their centre to a great degree yet rfHl their front fell short of that of the enemy s Upon their right was a small eminence where they thought proper to post a corps de reserve that circumstance occasioned their first fear and flight and was the only means of se curing their retreat Breonus the Gaulic general having a strong appre hension that some design lay concealed in the smallntss of the enemy s numbers and imagining that they had taken possession of the height with a view to attack him with this body of reserve both in rear and flank the moment the front lines were engaged thought it ne cessary to begin with charging the reserved troop con vinced if they were once dislodged with so great a su periority in point of numbers that he could easily obtain the victory in the open plain Thus the Barbarians no only had fortune on their side but the prudent conduct of an able commander In the other army neither generals nor soldiers showed any thing of the Roman character A sudden panic and the thoughts of escaping had arrested all their faculties nay so much were they lost to all reflection whatever that by far the greater part fled to Veil an enemy s capital with the Tiber in their way rather than straight to Rome to their wives and children The situ ation of the place for some little time contributed to the defence of the corps de reserve But whenever the rest of the army heard the shouts of the Gauls which seem ed to those who stood next to have been raised from the flank and to the most remote from their rear they fled in a body without striking a stroke or even returning the enemy s shout and so far were they from feeling that they had but barely seen this strange enemy None of them fell in battle but in the rout where the crowd and hurry of the fugitives incumbered the flight those ID the rear were cut to pieces A great slaughter was CHAP 39 ROMAN HISTORY 459 made too on the banks of the Tiber whither the whole left wing had retreated after they had thrown down their arms many who knew not bow to 8vyim or could not being weighed down by their coats of mail and other ac coutrements were swallowed up by the waves The greatest part however got safe to Veii from whence â they were so far from sending relief to Rome that they never once thought of dispatching a courier with the news of their misfortune The right wing which was posted nearer the hill and at a great distance from the river marched all to Rome and took refuge in the cita del without staying to shut the gates of the city behind tneiii   CHAP XXXIX The Gauls enter Rome The flower of the Romans fy to the Citadel and CapiteL T VICTORY so suddenly obtained astonished the Gauls so muchj that they considered it as something mi raculous At first awed by fjear they stood motionless as if they had known nothing of what had happened They stil l dreaded stme ambuscade but at last began to strip the slainj and pile up the arms according to their custom After all when they saw nothing like an ene my appear they set out for Rome which they reached a little before sun set When the horse that were de tached before theni brought back word that the gates were open no guards posted before them nor any sol diers on tire walls they considered it as a continuation of the same miracle and not knowing what the night might bring forth at the same time that they were utter fi angers to the situation of the city they encamped be tween the Anio and the city and sent out scouts round the walls and the gates of the city to bring intelligence of the enemy s designs now that their situation was ex  tremely critical At Rome as the greatest part of the army had fled to Veii nobody imagining that one of them had escaped but those who had made good their retreat to Rome and  the whole city lamenting the loss of the living as well as the dead there was nothing to be seen but tears a nd fo TITUS LIVIUS  Book V sorrow but when they were advised of the enemy s ap proach public fear soon suppressed all p t8Bc concern It was not long before they heard the barbarians roaring out their howlings and discordant notes as they strolled in troops round the city walls During all the time after till next morning they were in the utmost suspense every moment expecting an attack would be made upon the city after the first approach of the enemy to it as it was highly probable they would not have stirred from Allia but with that intention At sun set as little light then remained they were fully persuaded that they would take the advantage of the little they had before the night came on and when all was quiet during the evening that they had deferred their design to strike the greater terror during the darkness of the night At last the approach of day doubled their panic which kept pace in progression with the evil itself till they saw the enemy s ensigns enter their gates However during that night and the day following the citizens acted with much greater propriety than the army had done at Allia For when they found that to defend the city with so small a force as had been left in it would be quite im practicable they resolved that all the youth fit to bear arms and the flower of the senate with their wives and children should retire into the citadel and capitol and having carried arms and provisions thither defend their gods their fellow citizens and the Rornan name from these strong holds whilst the priests of Romulus and the vestals carried off the sacred things and placed them out of the reach of fire and sword being firmly resolved ne ver to give over the worship of the godsi whilst a single soul remained to perform it For they thought that if the citadel and capitol the august body of the gods the senate that formed the public council of the state and the youth of age to bear arms survived the ruin that impended the city the loss of the old men an use less number left in the city and who in course of nature would die at any rate was not much to be regretted To encourage those of inferior rank to acquiesce in this resolution without murmuring the superannuate consu lar and triumphant generals declared publicly that they would die with them for since their bodies were too weak to support the weight of arms for the defence of CHAP 40 ROMAN HISTORY 461 their country they ought not to be a burthen upon those who were armed tor its preservation and might soon be in want of provisions 1 CHAP XL T7te deep distress which ensued from this battle   N this manner did these old men destined to death encourage and console each other Then addressing themselves to the young men and following them all the way to the citadel and capitol pathetically recommended To their bravery and youthful vigour the fortune of what yet remained of a city that in all its wars had been victorious for three hundred and sixty years But when the moment came that was to separate the champions of the captive city from those who were de termined not to survive its ruin deep was the distress which that scene exhibited and it was rendered still more afferting by the weeping and lamentations of the women distractedly running they knew not whither from their husbands to their sons and from their sons to their husbands asking now these now those â whose Â fate they should share In short never was human misery represented in more lively colours A great part of the women however followed their friends into the citadel who though they were not invited met with na opposition because of whatever consequence it might have bsen to the besieged to have been freed from an useless multitude it was quite inconsistent with humani ty to shut them out The remaining multitude consist ing chiefly of the populace too numerous to be lodged in a fortress that stood on so small a hill or to be main tained there in so great a scarcity left the city in crowds and took their way in a body towards the Janiculum From thence they dispersed themselves partly about the country and partly among the neighbouring cities hav ing neither leader to conduct them nor any concerted scheme to follow each of them following his own hopes and particular views the public interest being now given up for lost In the mean time the priests of Romulus and the ves tal dropping all concern about their private affairs con 462 lf ITtTS LIVIUS BOOK V suited together what sacred things they should carry away and as they could not take the whole what they should leave behind md where these precious deposits might be roost safely lodged At last they concluded it would be best to pack them in small casks and bury them in a chapel next to the house of the priest of Ko mulus where now h is reckoned unlawful to spit What was to be carried away they divided among them and each with his burden took the road by the bridge Sul picius leading to the Janiculum As L Albinus a Plebeian was drawing his wife and children in a waggon among the rest of the crowd who could hare been of no use in the defence of the city be observing the vestals on the side of a hill notwithstand ing the necessity of the times forgot not the respect due to things divine for thinking it most preposterous that he should be seen in a carriage with his family whilst

country and the Roman people by a vow which M Fabius the high priest administered in form The Gauls as the intervention of a whole night had Chap 42 ROMAN HISTORY 463 given time to he fury with which

without any signs of violent passion and resentment by the gate Collina moving on to the forum and cast ing their eyes on all sides to the temples of the gods and the citadel where alone they could observe the least appearance of resistance Then posting a small guard to prevent any sally from the citadel or capitol when they might be dispersed through the city they went about in plundering parties arid finding the streets quite empty and not meeting a single soul they rushed in bodies into the adjoining houses whilst others flew to the most remote imagining they had never been touch ed

sitting in the porches of their houses in dress and attitude appearing with an air of greatness above human and in the awful majesty of their looks and gravity of their deportment perfectly resembling the gods When they had stood some time gazing as at so many statues one of these ancients M Papirius is said to have provoked a Gaul by breaking his head with a smart blow of his ivory truncheon for using the freedom of stroking his beard which was then permit ted to grow to a great length He was the first victim and the rest were all killed where they sat The Gauls after thi massacre gave no

their head When they had gone a little out of town tiiey foinyl the camp of the Gauls open and unguarded on all sides jus as he had told them would be the case and attacked t with prodigious shouts There was no fighting but a terribleslaughter everywhere Naked as they were born and fast asleep they were all butchered without resistance Those that lay at the greatest distance slatted up in a fright and being totally ignorant whence or by whom they were attacked some took to their heels whilst others threw themselves inad vertently into the enemy s way A great part of them  v i H   â â â

Roman territories and loaded with booty had laid a plan for attacking Veii the only asylum and last resource of the Roman name The Roman soldiers had observed how they were ranging through the country and driv ing the booty before their main body at the same time that they had their camp not far from Veii At first the melancholy state of their own affairs threw a damp on their spirits but it soon gave way to indignation which immediately kindled in their minds the highest resent ment What said they do the Etrurians too from â whom we turned the arms of the Gauls upon ourselves â insult us in our adversity Nothing could have given them greater pleasure than to have attacked them that moment but by the advice of Coedicius a centurion whom they had chosen for their leader they suspended the

slowly both sides remaining inactive Whilst the Gauls were solely intent upon preventing any one of the enemy to quit the ptace by passing their guards a young Roman all of a sudden drew on himself the admiration as well of the enemy as of his fellow citizens There wa Â CHAP 46 ROMAN HISTORY 469 sacrifice peculiar to the Fabian family which could be performed nowhere but on the Quirinal hill For this purpose C Fabius Dorso came down from the capitol having his gown tucked up and the sacred things in his hands  passed through the enemy s guards and without regard to their threats or noise got safe to the Quirinal hill Having performed there all the necessary cere monies he retumed the same way with the same gravity of air and gesture to the capitol in full confidence of the protection of those gods whose worship he had pre served even at the risk of his life The Gauls were either astonished at his surprising boldness or moved with a sense of religion which they by no means neglect In the mean time the army at Veii not only gained fresh spirits but were every day considerably reinforced not only by many Romans who had been dispersed up and down the country after the defeat of Allia and the capture of Rome but also by crowds of Latin volunteers who joined them that they might come in for their share of the spoil Now they concluded was the time to save their country and deliver it out of the hands of the ene my but though they were a formidable party they had none among them able to take the command The place itself reminded them of Camillus besides that a great part of that very army had fought succes fully under the command and auspices of that great captain Caedicius protested  That he would do nothing to provoke either gods or men to put an end to his  command but not forgetful of his rank he would himself demand a general It was unanimously agreed to send for Camillus from Ardea but not before they had consulted the senate at Rome such was their regard to propriety and to the order prescribed by law in all  things even at a time when the Republic was on the brink of ruin To pass through the enemy s guards to the citadel was a dangerous attempt Pontius Com minius however a sprightly young fellow promised to lo his best in the business and laying himself on the bark of a tree was carried safely down the current of the Tiber to the city By a steep rock on the side next the river which the enemy thought unnecessary to guard he got up with difficulty to the capitol He was brought before the magistrates and delivered 470 TITUS LIVIUS  BooicV his commission from the army Having then got the senate s decree ordaining  That Camillas should by an act of the comitia assembled by curia be recalled from banishment and by authority of the people be immediately appointed dictator at the same time that c the arrny should have the general they desired Re turning the same way he posted to Veii with the news whence the commissioners were sent Camillas at Ardea who conducted him to Veii or rather an act repealing his banishment was passed in the comitia assembled by curia and he declared dictator in his absence for it Â more likely that he did not move from Ardea till he had certain advices of the act passed by the senate be cause he qould not change the place of bis retreat with out the voices of the people nor take the auspices regu

the citadel and capitol of Rome were in extreme danger The Gauls whether they had observed the impressions of a man s feet in that place where the messenger from Veii bad climbed the rock or of themselves had discovered that it wa accessibte by the rock Carmemalis it is certain that one night when it was pretty clear ihey first sent man before to examine the way without his arms which they afterwards handed up to him and where it was steep they supported lifted and lent each other a band as the difficuty of the place required till they had reach ed the top This they did with so much silence that neither the centinels nor even the dogs animals that are apt to stir at the least noise in the night time were in the least alarmed But they did not escape unnoticed by the geese which being sacred to Juno the Romans in all their scarcity of provisions had preserved alive This saved the capitol For by their gagling and beat ing their wmgs they raised M Manlius a great soldier who had been consul three years before he snatching CUAP 47 ROMAN HISTORY 471 up his arms and spreading the alarm flew to the ram part and whilst the rest were in a mighty consternation â with the boss of his buckler he beat back a Gaul who had by that time reached the top of the battlement and he in his fall tumbled down those who were next him whilst Manlius killed others who throwing down their arms in the utmost terror hung by their hands on the rocks By this time too others had crowdedto the place and with stones and darts precipitated the rest so that the whole of these adventurers tumbled headlong from the top to the bottom of the rock When the confusion was over the rest of the night was devoted to repose as far as could be enjoyed after such an alarm and solicitude for the danger that was past Early next morning the military tribunes assem bler the troops by sound of trumpet in onler to dispense rewards and punishments as merit or demerit should appear First of all Manlius was praised for his noble exertions and had presents not only from ihe military tribunes but from all the soldier for each of them car ried to his house which stood in the citadel half a pound meal and a measure of wine containing five ounces reward considerable only as it was a singular proof of their affection when in the extreme scarcuy of provi sions they could part with their very living to do ho nour to the merit of one man The centinels on that post where the enemy had escaped their vigilance and climbed up the rock were called upon next and though Sulpicius the military tribune sentenced them all to die according to the laws of military iscipline yet as all the soldiers faid the blame upon one centinel he was afraid oF a in iM v an so respited the rest With the approbation of the whole he who was undeniably in the wrong was thrown over jhe rock From thenceforth the guards were kept on both sides with more attention On the part of the Gauls because it was commonty talked that a correspondence was kept up between Roait and Veii and on thai of the Romans from a retrospect of the danger they had escap ed in the night i 72 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V CHAP XLVI1I Pestilence Famine A Compromise JtjUT now famine began to distress both parties more than all the calamities consequent on the siege of the war Add to this that a pestilential distemper raged among the Gauls who were encamped in a valley between two bitls rendered excessively hot by the flames of the houses and smoke issuing from them at the same time that the least blast of wind made not only the dust but the ashes in supportable The Gauls who had been accustomed to a moist and cold climate could not support under these inconvenience but oppressed with the excessive best and a lowness of spirits they died like rotten sheep in somuch that they could no longer be troubled with bury ing them one by one but piled them up in heaps pro miscuously and set fire to them at once rendering the place famous by the name of the Gaul s burying place After this a suspension of arms was agreed on by both parties during which by permission of the generals the troops had frequent intercourse together and whilst the Gauls insisted principally on the short allowance to which the besieged were reduced and advised them to surrender on that account to remove such thoughts i is said they threw loaves from the capiiol at dill ere u places into the posts of the enemy But by this time the famine had risen to such an height that it could neither be concealed uor endure any longer Therefore while the dictator was levyin troops in person at Ardea having dispatched L Vale rius general of the horse to march the troops from Veii and was making every preparation to act on th offensive with the enemy  the army in thecapitol quit exhausted with hard duty and watching though they had bravely surmounted all other human obstacles a gainst the cravings of nature their courage could furnish them with no antidote and

guard insisted absolutely to surrendei   CHAP 49 ROMAN HISTORY or to ransom themselves as they best could more espe cially as the Gauls gave strong hints in their discourse that hey would raise the siege for an inconsiderable ran som The senate met and empowered the military tribunes to negociate an accommodation which was concluded between Q Sulpicius the military tribune and Bren nus general of the Gauls and the ransom of a people destined one day to command the universe was fixed at one thousand pound weight of gold This capitulation was too disgraceful to require any addition but the Gauls improved upon the indignity They brought false weights and when the tribune objected to them the king insultingly added his sword which he threw into the scale expressing himself in these words  Wo to the conquered a phrase of all others the most shocking to a Roman ear â   CHAP XLIX Camillas changes thtface of affairs JjUT neither gods nor men would permit the Romans to live on the terms of a ransomed people For fortune had so ordered it that before this infamous ransom was all paid down their wrangling having taken up some time the dictator made his appearance and ordered the money to be taken away and the Gauls to be gone When they objected pleading the capitulation signed between them he replied that no treaty concluded with a magistrate of inferior authority without his participa tion from the moment he was declared dictator could be valid and then told them they might prepare for battle His own troops he ordered to throw their baggage in a heap and stand to their amis for with steel and not with gold were they now to redeem their country fightr ing in view of the temples of their gods in sight of their wives and children and in their native soil dis figured as it was by the calamities of war and in the midst of all that ought to be defended recovered or  Forty five thousand pounds sterting 474 TITUS LIVIUS BOOK V revenged He then drew up his army in the best order of battle possible amidst the ruins of the city and on uneven ground and took all the precautions that mili tary skill could suggest to insure success The Gauls confounded at this revolution ran to their arms and rushed against the Romans with more fur than prudence Affairs now wore quite a different as pect for the protection of the gods and human wisdom united in favour of the Romans For which reason the Gauls were defeated at the first charge with the same ease they had conquered at tho battle of Allia They were a second time routed stilt more completely â under the conduct and auspices of the same Camillas eight miles from Rome on the Gabinian way whither they had fled There the slaughter was total their camp taken and not a man escaped to carry home the melan choly news of their disaster Thus the dictator having recovered his country from the enemy returned in triumph to Rome and the sol diers in their rough jollity recognized him a second Ro mulus the founder of a new Rome eulogiums which be roost certainly deserved But this was not all His country which he rescued from the enemy he a second time saved from its friends For he prevented the peo ple from removing to Veii though the tribunes made greater effors to promote that emigration after the city was burnt and the people themselves more devoted to the project than ever they had been before  For this reason he did not abdicate the dictatorship after his tri umph but at the importunity of the senate deserted not the republic whilst its unsettled state required his super intendence CHAP L Regulations after the eitmbian of the Gauls F IRt T of al as he was exceedingly strict in whatever regarded religion he took under consideration what re lated 10 the worship of the gods and obtained a decree of the senate  That all the temples as they had beea  in the enemy s possession should be re established Â bounded and purified and that the duumvirs who had CHAP 50 ROMAN HISTORY 475 Â charge of the Sybilline books should be consulted â about the proper mode of purification That by public authority a league of hospitality should be made with the people of Caere  who had given a safe retreat to the Roman priests and sacred things and by whose favour the worship of the immortal gods had suffered no interruption That the Capitoline games should be celebrated in honour of Jupiter the best and greatest who in all the misfortunes that had happened had pre served his august abode and the citadel of Rome  and that the dictator Camiltus should constitute a college of persons chosen from among the inhabitants of the ca pitol and citadel to superintend that affair It was also moved that expiation should likewise be made for the neglect of the miraculous voice heard in the night which gave warning of the impending calami ty before any war with the Gauis was thought of and a temple ordered to be erected to Aius Locutius in the New Street It was likewise ordered that the gold which had been rescued from the Gauls and that which in their greatest danger had been taken out of the other temples and conveyed to the chapel of Jupiter should be deemed sacred and deposited at his shrine because in their confusion they could not recollect the places to which it ought to be returned The religion of the Romans had before been conspi cuous in the behaviour of the ladies when the public was at a loss to make up the stipulated ransom to the Gauls in supplying that deficiency that the sacred trea sure might not be touched for which act of generosity they had thanks returned them and moreover the ho nour decreed them of having funeral orations pronounced over them after their death as well as the men After the duties of religion and such things as could be trans acted by means of the senate had been performed the tribunes began in their daily harangues to resume the old plea and urge the people to abandon Rome in ruins and remove to Veii a city ready built and furnished

in any other but in Cam ill us cri minal to the last degree while any spark of life re mains For what occasion had we to recover or wrest this our city when besieged out of the hands of the Bar barians if after all our exertions we ourselves should abandon it r When the gods and tke Roman people held by actual possession the capitol and citadel whilst all the rest of the city together fell a sacrifice to the victorious Gauls shall we now when conquerors after all we have done to recover this city abandon al so the capitol and citadel and our prosperity bo the cause of a greater desolation in Rome than even our adversity If indeed these religious rites which were instituted and handed down to us from the foundation of the city were to be totally disregarded by us yet the protection of the gods hath been so strongly marked to us in the present instance that for men to neglect the worship of the gods were in my opinion absolutely impossible Only look back upon what has happened to us good or bad for some years past and you will see evidently that every thing has succeeded with us when submissive and dutiful to the gods and every thing unfortunate jvhen we despised them First of all let us take a re view of the war with Veii ich continued for so many years with incredible CHAF 52 ROMAN HISTORY 477  fatigue and was never brought to a conclusion till by  advice of the gods the water was drawn off from the Alban Lake And what after all shall I say of the  fatal blow which Rome lately received That did not  happen till we had been forwarned by a miraculous voice that the Gauls were coming which we slighted nor till the law of cations had been violated by our am  bassadors and we regardless of our duty to the gods shewed an unpardonable remissness in punishing them This therefore is the source of all we have suffered from godsand men we have been conquered enslaved and ransomed as examples to all the world Our uus  fortunes at that time put us in mind of the duties of religion We fled to the capitoI to throw ourselves  upon the protection of the gods we sat down in the august abode of Jupiter the greatest and the best Amidst the general devastation some of our sacred things we concealed under ground and others we car ried to the neighbouring cities where our enemies could not come at them Though thus abandoned by heaven and earth we never omitted the worship of the gods and what is the consequence Why they have â restored us our country victory the Roman name and military glory which e had forfeited And as for the enemy who blinded with their

priest and fla â mens to be less strict in the performance of the public â ceremonies of religion than for a private person of â those peculiar to his family But perhaps it may be alledged that these

ancient to be abandoned in a pro â fane place Only mark the difference between our an cestors and us They transmitted to us a tradition that some of our solemnities should be performed upon 4 Mount Alba and Lavinium Now was it an act of devotion to bring religious â ceremonies from hostile cities to ourselves at Rome â and shall we without involving ourselves in the guilt of sacrilege carry them hence to Veii a hostile city Will you only call to mind how often our sacred ce remonies have been performed a new because some ancient regulation either through carelessness or ac cident had been omitted What other circumstance was it of late after the prodigy of the Alban lake but â the renewal of the sacred auspices that relieved the 5 commonwealth oppressed as it was with the war with CHAP

for all this work if we had been determined to leave the city at the same time with the Gauls if our stay in the capitol during a siege of so many months was not voluntary If it was not fear that kept us back from the enemy But do I only mention rites and temples and leave the priests entirely out of the question Do you not  perceive how much we shall have to account for with respect to them The vestals are fixed to one parti cular residence from which no consideration but the capture of the city ever moved them The priest of Jupiter without the grossest criminality dare not sleep  one night out of the city Would you make them Vejentian instead of Roman priests And O Vesta  shall any vestals forsake thee now And will the priest  of Jupiter by residing among strangers involve in so  much guilt himself and his country every night  Need I mention other things which are performed by auspices generally within the pomcerium must they too be forgotten or neglected The comitia by curiae who have the cognizance of military affairs the co mitia by centuries by whom our consuls and military  tribunes are elected can they be held any where un der proper auspices but in the usual place Shall

necessity obliges us to quit a city in ruins and reduced to ashes and to take re fuge in Veii where we shall find all conveaiencies without harassing the poor people with rebuilding Rome Were I not to tell you this is a vain pretext a mere allegation I am certain you must see it For some of you gentlemen must remember that before the arrival of the Gauls when all the buildings pub lic and private were whole and entire and Rome ir absolute safety this same affair of removing to Veii was in agitation But to show you tribunes in what different points of view this matter appears to you and to me You think though great objections might have been made at that time that now there can be none On the contrary it is my opinion nor need you be surprised till you have heard me out although we might have left the city before it had suffered from the rude touches of the Gauls that in honour we cannot leave these ruins now For at that time our victory furnished us with some pretence for removing to a city we had just conquered as it was cause of boasting to ourselves and posterity but to remove thither now would be for us mean and shameful in the extreme but to the Gauls it would do singular credit For it would by no means appear that we had left our coun try when victorious but that we had lost it when con quered To the defeat at Allia the capture of Rome and the blockade of the Capitol may be justly ascrib ed the sad alternative of abandoning our tutelary gods of flying and banishing ourselves from a place v i could tot defend Have the Gauls been able to de molish Rome and shall it be thought that the Romans are not able to rebuild it What then remains but that you tamely suffer these very Gauls whose numbers are incredible to return if they please with a new army and take possession of this city which they have taken ami you abandoned But if the Gauls have no such intention what if the CHAP 54 ROMAN HISTORY Â l JEqui and Volsci your former enemies should remove to Rome Would you wish them to become Romans whilst you were only burghers of Veii Whether would you choose that Rome should be a desert in your own possession or to be inhabited by your ene mies Of two alternatives so unaccountable it is hard to say which is the more criminal Would you really involve yourselves in so much guilt and expose your selves to such infamy only to save you the trouble of rebuilding the city If in all the Â ity a house larger or more handsome could not be raised than the cottage which served our Founder for a palace of old would it not be more honourable to dwell in huts like shepherds and herdsmen amidst your household gods and the temples still existing than to condemn yourselves to a public and universal banishment Did our ancestors who were strangers and shepherd so quickly rear up a new city when there was nothing here but woods and marshes and shall we when the capitol citadel and temples of the gods are still standing and safe shall we I say think it a mighty matter to rebuild a city that has been consumed by fire Is it not surprising that as a community we should hesitate on doing when the calamity is general what every individual would do were it his particular case CHAP LIV In Continuation JjUT in the name of the gods should a fire either by accident or design happen at Veii and the wind as might naturally be supposed spread the flumes so as to consume the best part of that city must we then shift about from thence to Fidenae Gabii or some other town Has your native soil no charms to attract your regard Has this our mother country none at all Does our love for our country extend only to roofs and rafters Upon honour I will frankly acknowledge though it gives me more pain to call your injustice than my own misfortune to
