consuls were now in office Caius Plautius a second time and Lucius jEmilius Mamercinus when messengers from Setia and Norba brought information to Rome of the revolt of the Privernians with complaints of the da mages sustained by those colonies News also arrived that an army of Volscians headed by the people of Antium had taken post at Satricum Both these wars fell by lot to Plautius who marching first to Priver num came to an immediate engagement The enemy after a slight resistance were intirely defeated and their town taken but this was restored to the inha bitants being first secured by a strong garrison while two thirds of their lands were taken from them From thence the victorious army was led to Satricum against the Antians there a furious battle was fought with a great effusion of blood on both sides A storm sepa rated the combatants while there was no evident ad vantage on either part the Romans however nowise disheartened by the fatigue of an engagement so inde cisive prepared for battle against the next day But the Volscians when they had reckoned up their loss found not in themselves the same degree of resolution for making a second trial and marched off in the night to Antium with all the hurry of a defeat leaving be hind their wounded and part of their baggage A vast liv vol in a   LIVY quantity of arms was found both in the field and in the camp these the consul declared an offering to Mother Lua 1 and entering the enemy s country laid it all waste as far as the sea coast The other consul JEmi lius on marching into the Sabellan territory found neither a camp of the Samnites nor legions to oppose him  but while he was wasting their country with fire and sword ambassadors came to him suing for peace He referred them to the senate where when they were admitted to an audience laying aside their fierce ness of spirit they requested of the Romans that peace might be restored between the two nations and that they might be at liberty to carry on war against the Sidi cinians  these requests they alleged they were the better intitled to make as  they had united in friend ship with the Roman people at a time when their own affairs were in a florishing state not in a season of dis tress as the Campanians had done  and because those against whom they wished to take arms were the Sidi ciuians who had ever been enemies to them and never friends to the Romans who had neither as the Sam nites sought their friendship in time of peace nor as the Campanians their assistance in war nor were connected with them in any way either of alliance or subjection 2 The pretor Tiberius Emilius having required the opinion of the senate respecting the demands of the Samuites and the senate having voted a renewal of the treaty with them gave them this answer that  as the Romans had given no cause to hinder the uninterrupted continuance of their friendship so neither did they now object to its being revived since the Samnites showed an unwillingness to persevere in a war which they had brought on themselves through their own fault That as to what regarded the Sidicinians they did not interfere with the liberty of the Samnite nation to de termine for themselves with respect to peace and war The treaty being concluded and the ambassadors re 1 Otherwise called Ops Rhea and Terra the earth HISTORY OF ROME BOOK VIM turning home the Roman army was immediately with drawn from thence after receiving a year s pay for the soldiers and corn for three months which were the conditions stipulated by the consul on his granting them a truce until the ambassadors should return The Samnites marched against the Sidicinians with the same troops which they had employed in the Ro man war sanguine in their expectation of getting im mediate possession of the enemy s capital On this the Sidicinians proposed first to the Romans to put themselves under their dominion but the senate re jected the proposal as made too late and forced from them merely by extreme necessity then the same offer was made to and accepted by the Latines who were ready to commence hostilities on their own ac count Nor did even the Campanians refrain from taking a part in this quarrel much stronger impres sions being left on their minds by the ill treatment re ceived from the Samnites than by the kindness of the Romans Out of such a number of nations one vast army was composed under the direction of the La tines which entering the territories of the Samnites did much greater damage by depredations than by fighting But although the Latines had the better in the field yet they were well pleased to retire out of the enemy s country to avoid the necessity of too fre quent engagements This respite afforded time to the Samnites to send ambassadors to Rome who having obtained an audience of the senate made heavy com plaints that though now their confederates they suf fered the same calamities which they had felt when their enemies and with the humblest intreaties re quested that the Romans would  think it enough to have deprived the Samnites of conquest over their ene mies the Campanians and Sidicinians and that they would not besides suffer them to be conquered by such a union of dastardly nations That they would by their sovereign authority oblige the Latines and Cam panians if those people were really under the dominion of the Romans to forbear from entering the territory 4 LIVY of the Samnites and if they refused obedience compel them to it by arms To this the Romans gave an inde terminate answer because it would have been mortify ing to acknowlege that the Latines were not under their power and they feared lest by charging them with misbehavior they might attempt to free themselves from all subjection  but considered the case of the Campa nians as very different they having come under their protection not by treaty but by surrender They answered therefore that  the Campanians whether willing or not should be quiet but in the treaty with the Latines there was no article which prohibited their waging war against whom they chose 3 This answer as it sent away the Samnites in doubt what opinion to form with respect to the conduct which the Romans intended to pursue intirely subverted the allegiance of the Campanians by the menaces held out to them  it also increased the presumption of the La tines as the senate seemed now not disposed in any respect to control them These last therefore under the pretext of preparing for war against the Samnites held frequent meetings in which their chiefs concert ing matters among themselves secretly fomented the design of a war with Rome The Campanians too gave their support to this war though against their pre servers But notwithstanding that they took all pos sible pains to keep their proceedings from being gene rally known and though they wished to get rid of the Volscian enemy then at their back before the Romans should be alarmed yet by means of persons connected with the latter in hospitality and other private ties in telligence of the conspiracy was conveyed to Rome There the consuls being commanded to abdicate their office in order that the new ones might be the sooner elected and have the more time to prepare for a war of so great importance it began to be considered as improper that the election should be held by persons not vested with full authority consequently an inter regnum took place and continued under two inter reges Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius A U C HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 415 B C 337 The latter elected consuls Titus Man lius Torquatus a third time and Publius Decius Mus It is agreed on all hands that in this year Alexander king of Epirus made a descent with a fleet on Italy in which expedition had his first attempts been crowned with success he would without doubt have carried his arms against the Romans This period was also dis tinguished by the exploits of Alexander the Great son to the other s sister who in another quarter of the globe after showing himself invincible in war was doomed by fortune to be cut off by sickness in the prime of life Now the Romans although they enter tained not a doubt of the revolt of their allies and of the Latine nation yet as if they acted in behalf of the Samnites not of themselves summoned ten of the chiefs of the Latines to appear at Rome and receive their orders The Latines had at that time two pre tors Lucius Annius a native of Setia and Lucius Nu micius of Circei both Roman colonists  through whose means besides Signia and Velitra which belonged to the Romans the Yolscians also had been engaged to join in the war It was thought proper that these two should be particularly summoned every one clearly perceived on what account they were sent for the pre tors therefore before they set out for Rome called a general assembly whom they informed that they were called to attend the Roman senate and desired their opinion with respect to the business which they sup posed would be the subject of discussion and to make known to them the answers which they chose should be given on the occasion 4 After several different opinions had been advanced Annius said  Although I myself proposed the question of what answer should be made yet in my judgment the general interest requires that you determine how we are to act rather than how we are to speak When your designs shall be clearly unfolded it will be easy to adapt words to the subject for if we are still capa ble of submitting to slavery under the shadow of a confederacy between equals what have we more to do IIVY than to abandon the Sidicinians yield obedience to the commands not only of the Romans but of the Sam nites saying in answer to the former that whenever they intimate their pleasure we are ready to lay down our arms But on the other hand if our minds are at length penetrated by an ardent desire of liberty if there be a confederacy subsisting if alliance be equality of rights if the Romans have now reason to glory ia a circumstance of which they were formerly ashamed our being of the same blood with them if they have in our troops such an army of allies that by its junc tion with their own they double their strength  such a one in short as their consuls either in commencing or concluding their own wars would very unwillingly disunite from their party why is there not a perfect and settled equalisation  Why is it not permitted that one of the consuls should be chosen from among the Latines  and that they who supply an equal share of strength should be admitted to an equal share in the government This indeed considered in itself would not redound to our honor in any extraordinary degree  as we should still acknowlege Rome to be the metropolis of Latium but that it may possibly appear to do so is owing to our tame resignation for such a length of time But if you ever wished to acquire a participation in the government the opportunity now presents itself afforded to you by the bounty of the gods and your own resolution You have tried their patience by re fusing the supply of troops who can doubt that they were incensed to the highest degree when we broke through a practice of more than two hundred years continuance  Yet they thought proper to smother their resentment We waged war with the Pelignians in our own name those who formerly would not grant us liberty to defend our own frontiers interfered not then They heard that we had received the Sidicinians into our protection  that the Campanians had revolted from them to us  that we were preparing an army to act against the Samnites their confederates yet they stirred not a step from their city What but a know HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 7 lege of our strength and of their own made them thus moderate I am informed from good authority that when the Samnites made their complaints of us the Roman senate answered them in such terms as plainly evinced that they themselves did not insist on Latium being under the dominion of Rome Urge then your claim and assnme the exercise of that right which they tacitly concede to you If fear deters you from making this demand lo here I pledge myself that I will re quire in the hearing not only of the senate and people of Rome but of Jove himself who resides in the capi tol that if they wish us to continue in confederacy and alliance with them they receive from us one of the consuls and half of the senate On his not only re commending this measure with boldness but under taking the execution of it they unanimously with ac clamations of applause gave him authority to act and speak in such manner as he should judge conducive to the interest of the republic of the Latine nation and becoming his own honor 5 When the pretors arrived in Rome they had audience of the senate in the capitol and the consul Titus Manlius having by the direction of the senate required of them that they should not make war on the Samnites the confederates of the Romans â Annius as if he were a conqueror who had taken the eapitol by arms and not an ambassador who owed his safety in speaking to the law of nations replied thus  Titus Manlius and you conscript fathers it is full time for yom to cease to treat us as a people Subject to your commands since you see the very florishing state which through the bounty of the gods Latium enjoys at present both with respect to numbers and strength  the Samnites are conquered by our arms  the Sidi cinians and Campanians and now the Volscians also are united to us in alliance  and even your own colo nies prefer the government of Latium to that of Rome Bat since you do not think proper to put an end to your imperious exertions of arbitrary dominion we although able by force of arms to assert the inde 8 LIVY pendency of Latium will yet pay so much regard td the connexion subsisting between us as to offer an as sociation on terms of equality as it has pleased the gods that the strength of both should be as it is com pletely balanced One of the consuls must be chosen out of Latium the other out of Rome the senate must consist of an equal number of each nation  we must become one people one republic and in order that both may have the same sea of government and the same name as one side or the other must make the concession let this to the happiness of both have the advantage of being deemed the mother country and let us all be called Romans The Romans happened to have a consul Titus Manlius of a temper as vehe ment as that of Annius who so far from restraining his anger openly declared that if the conscript fathers should be so infatuated as to receive laws from a man of Setia he would come into the senate with his sword in hand and put to death every Latine that he should find in their house  then turning to the statue of Jupi ter he exclaimed Jupiter hear these impious de mands hear justice and equity O Jupiter are you as if overpowered and made captive to behold in your consecrated temple a foreign consul and a foreign se nate  Are these Latines the treaties which the Roman king Tullus made with the Albans your forefathers or which Lucius Tarquinius afterwards concluded with yourselves Does not the fight at the lake Regillus recur to your thoughts Are your calamities of old and our recent kindnesses towards you intirely ob literated from your memories V 6 These words of the consul were followed by ex pressions of indignation from the senators and it is related that in reply to the frequent addresses to the gods whom the consuls often invoked as witnesses to the treaties Annius was heard to express contempt of the divinity of the Roman Jupiter However being inflamed with wrath and quitting the porch of the temple with hasty steps he fell down the stairs and was dashed against a stone at the bottom with such HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 6 violence that he received a contusion on his head which deprived him of sense As all the authors do not concur in mentioning his death to have ensued I for my part must leave that circumstance in doubt as I shall another of a violent storm with dreadful noise in the air happening while appeals were made to the gods concerning the infraction of the treaties for as these accounts may possibly be founded in fact so may they likewise have been invented to express in a lively manner an immediate denunciation of the wrath of the gods Torquatus being sent by the senate to dismiss the ambassadors on seeing Annius stretched on the ground exclaimed in a voice so loud as to be heard both by the senators and the people  Ye gods pro ceed in so just a war in which your own rights are concerned there is a deity in heaven  thou dost exist great Jupiter  not without reason have we consecrated you in this mansion as the father of gods and men Why do you hesitate Romans and you conscript fathers to take up arms when the gods thus lead the way Thus will I throw down in the dust the legions of the Latines as you see their ambassador prostrated These words of the consul were received by the multi tude with applause and excited such a flame in their breasts that the ambassadors at their departure owed their safety rather to the care of the magistrates who escorted them by the consul s order than to the people s regard to the laws of nations The senate concurred in voting for the war and the consuls after raising two armies marched through the territories of the Marsians and Pelignians and having formed a junc tion with the army of the Samnites pitched their camp in the neighborhood of Capua where the Latines and their allies had already collected their forces Here as it is related there appeared to both the consuls in their sleep the same figure of a man of a form larger and more majestic than the human who said to them that of the one party a general of the other the army were due as victims to the infernal gods and to mother earth and that on whichever side a general should 10 LIVY devote the legions of his enemy and himself together with them to that party and nation the victory would fall The consuls having communicated to each other these visions of the night determined that victims should be slain to avert the wrath of the gods and also that if the portents appearing in their entrails concurred with what they had seen in their sleep one or other of the consuls should fulfil the will of the fates Finding the answers of the auspices to agree with the awful impressions already made on their minds in private they then called together the lieute nant generals and tribunes and having made known to them all the decrees of the gods settled between themselves that lest the voluntary death of a consul might dishearten the troops in the field on whichever side the Roman army should begin to give ground the consul commanding there should devote himself for the Roman people and for his country In this consulta tion it was also mentioned that if ever strictness in command had been enforced in any war it was then particularly requisite that military discipline should be brought back to the ancient model Their attention was the more strongly directed to this point by the consideration that the enemies with whom they had to deal were the Latines people who used the same lan guage and who had the same manners the same kind of arms and what was more than all the same mili tary institutions as themselves who had been inter mixed with them in the same armies after in the same companies soldiers with soldiers centurions with cen turions tribunes with tribunes as comrades and col leagues Lest in consequence of this the soldiers might be betrayed into any mistake the consuls issued orders  that no person should fight with any of the enemy except in his post 7 It happened that among the other commanders of the troops of horsemen which were despatched to every quarter to procure intelligence Titus Manlius the consul s son came with his troop to the back of the enemy s camp so near as to be scarcely distant a dart s HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 11 throw from the next post where some horsemen of Tusculum were stationed under the command of Ge minius Metrius a man highly distinguished amongst his countrymen both by his birth and conduct On observiug the Roman horsemen and the consul s son remarkable above the rest marching at their head for they were all known to each other particularly men of any note he called out  Romans do you in tend with one troop to wage war against the Latines and their allies  What employment will the two con suls and their armies have in the mean time  Man lias answered  They will come in due season and with them will come one whose power and strength is superior to eitherâ Jupiter himself the witness of those treaties which you have violated If at the lake of Re gillus we gave you fighting until you were weary I will answer for it that we shall in this place also give you such entertainment that for the future it will not be extremely agreeable to you to face us in the field To this Geminius advancing a little from his men re plied  Do you choose then until that day arrives when with such great labor you move your armies to enter the lists yourself with me that from the event of a combat between us two it may immediately be seen how much a Latine horseman surpasses a Roman Either anger or shame of declining the contest or the irresistible power of destiny urged on the daring spirit of the youth so that disregarding bis father s com mands and the edict of the consuls he rushed preci pitately to a contest in which whether he was victori ous or vanquished was of no great consequence to him self The other horsemen moved to some distance as if to behold a show and then in the space of clear ground which lay between them the combatants spurred on their horses against each other and on their meeting in fierce encounter the point of Man ias spear passed over the helmet of his antagonist and that of Metrius across the neck of the other s horse they then wheeled their horses round and Manlius having with greater quickness raised himself LIVY in his seat to repeat his stroke fixed his javelin be tween the ears of his opponent s horse the pain of which wound made the animal rear his fore feet on high and toss his head with such violence that he shook oft his rider whom as he endeavored to raise himself after the severe fall by leaning on his javelin and buckler Manlius pierced through the throat so that the steel came out between his ribs and pinned him to the earth Then collecting the spoils he rode back to his men and together with his troop who ex ulted with joy proceeded to the camp and so on to his father without ever reflecting on the nature or the consequences of his conduct or whether he had merited praise or punishment  Father said he  that all men may justly attribute to me the honor of being descended of your blood having been challenged to combat I bring these equestrian spoils taken from my antagonist whom I slew Which when the consul heard turning away instantly from the youth in an angry manner he ordered the assembly to be called by sound of trumpet and when the troops had come together in full numbers he spoke in this manner  Titus Manlius for as much as you in contempt of the consular authority and of the respect due to a father have contrary to our edict fought with the enemy out of your post and as far as in you lay subverted the military discipline by which the power of Rome has to this day been supported  and have brought me under the hard necessity either of over looking the interests of the public or my own and those of my nearest connexions it is fitter that we undergo the penalty of our own transgressions than that the commonwealth should expiate our offences so injurious to it We shall afford a melancholy ex ample but a profitable one to the youth of all future ages For my part I own both the natural affection of a parent and the instance which you have shown of bravery misguided by a false notion of honor affect me deeply But since the authority of a consul s orders must either be established by your death or HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 13 by your escaping with impunity be annulled for ever I expect that even you yourself if you have any of our blood in you will not refuse to restore by your punishment that military discipline which has been subverted by your fault Go lictor bind him to the stake Shocked to the last degree at such a cruel or der each looking on the axe as if drawn against him self all were quiet through fear rather than disci pline They stood therefore for some time motionless and silent but when the blood spouted from his se vered neck then their minds emerging as it were from the stupefaction in which they had been plunged they all at once united their voices in free expressions of compassion refraining not either from lamentations or execrations and covering the body of the youth with the spoils they burned it on a pile erected with out the rampart with every honor which the warm zeal of the soldiers could bestow on a funeral From thence  Manlian orders were not only then considered with horror but have been transmitted as a model of austerity to future times The harshness of this pu nishment however rendered the soldiery more obedient to their commander while the guards and watches and the regulation of the several posts were hence forth attended to with greater diligence  this severity was also found useful when the troops for the final decision went into the field of battle 8 A battle between these two nations much re sembled that of a civil war for except in point of courage there was a perfect similarity between the Latines and Romans in every particular The Romans formerly made use of targets afterwards when they came to receive pay they made shields for themselves instead of the targets  and their army which before was composed of phalanxes like those of the Macedonians began to be formed in a line of distinct companies At length a farther division was made of these into cen turies  each century containing sixty two soldiers one centurion and a standard bearer The spearmen formed the first line in ten companies with small in 14 LIVY tervals between them A company had twenty light armed soldiers the rest bearing shields  those were called light who carried only a spear and short iron javelins This body which formed the van in the field of battle contained the youth in early bloom who were advancing to the age of service  next to them followed the men of more robust age in the same number of companies whom they called principes all bearing shields and distinguished by the completest armor This band of twenty companies they called antepilani because there were at the same time ten others placed behind them with the standards Of these companies each was distinguished into three divisions and the first division of each they called a pilus Each company had three ensigns and con tained one hundred and eighty six men The first ensign was at the head of the triarii veteran soldiers of approved courage  the second at the head of the rorarii men whose age and course of service afforded less ability  the third at that of the accensi the body in whom they placed the least confidence of all for which reason also they were thrown back to the last line An army being marshalled according to this disposition the spearmen first began the fight if these were unable to repulse the enemy they retreated lei surely and the principes received them into the in tervals of their ranks The fight then rested on the principes the spearmen following in their rear The veterans continued kneeling behind the ensigns with their left leg extended forward holding their shields resting on their shoulders and their spears fixed in the ground with the points erect so that their line presented an appearance of strength like that of a rampart If the principes also failed in making an impression on the enemy they fell back slowly from the front to the veterans Hence cape into use the proverbial expression denoting a case of difficulty that the affair had come to the triarii These then rising up received the principes and spearmen into the intervals of their ranks and immediately closing HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 15 their files shut up as it were every opening and in one compact body fell on the enemy after which there was no other resource left This was the most formidable circumstance to the enemy when after having pursued them as vanquished they saw a new line of battle suddenly starting up with an increase of strength The number of legions generally raised was four each consisting of four thousand foot and three hundred horse To these an addition of an equal number used to be made by levies among the Latinos with whom the Romans were now to contend as ene mies and who practised the same method in drawing up their troops so that it was well known that un less the ranks should be put out of their order they would have to engage not only ensign against ensign a body of every description against one exactly similar but even centurion against centurion There were among the veterans two first centurions one in each army the Roman deficient in bodily strength but a man of courage and experience in service  the Latine exceedingly strong and a first rate warrior These were perfectly well known to each other because they had always commanded centuries in equal rank The Roman diffident of his strength had before he left Rome obtained permission from the consuls to appoint any one he thought proper his sub centurion to de fend him against the one who was destined to be his antagonist and the youth whom he chose being op posed to the Latine centurion in battle obtained a vic tory over him The armies came to an engagement at a little distance from the foot of Mount Vesuvius where the road led to the Veseris 9 The Roman consuls before they led out their forces to the field performed sacrifices We are told that the aruspex showed to Decius that the head of the liver was wounde d on the side which respected himself in other respects the victim was acceptable to the gods but Manlius found jn his immolation omens highly favorable Ou which Decius said  All is well yet since my colleague s offering has been ac cepted With their troops arrayed in the order al 10 LIVY ready described they marched forth to battle Man lius commanded the right wing  Decius the left At the beginning the conflict was maintained with equal strength on both sides and with equal courage After wards the Roman spearmen on the left wing unable to withstand the violent push made by the Latines re treated to the principes On this disorder happening the consul Decius called to Marcus Valerius with a loud voice  Valerius we want the aid of the gods as public pontiff of the Roman people dictate to me the words in which I may devote myself for the le gions The pontiff then directed him to take the gown called pretexta and with his head covered and his hand thrust up under the gown to his chin stand ing on a spear laid under his feet to repeat these words  O Janus Jupiter Father Mars Quirinus Bellona you Lares you gods Novensiles 1 you gods Indigetes you divinities under whose dominion we and our enemies are and you gods of the infernal re gions I beseech you I adore you I implore of you that you may propitiously grant strength and victory to the Roman people the Quirites and affect the enemies of the Roman people the Quirites with terror dismay and death In such manner as I have expressed in words so do I devote the legions and the auxiliaries of our foes together with myself to the infernal gods and to earth for the republic of the Ro mans for the army legions and auxiliaries of the Roman people the Quirites After he had uttered these solemn words he ordered his lictors to go to Titus Manlius and to inform his colleague without delay that he had devoted himself for the army Then girding himself in the Gabine cincture and taking his arms he leaped on his horse and plunged into the midst of the enemy He appeared in the view of both armies much more majestic than one of the human race as if sent from heaven to expiate all the wrath of 1 The Novensiles were nine deities brought to Rome by the Sabines  Lara Vesta Minerva Feronia Concord Faith Fortune Chance Health HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 17 the gods to avert destruction from his friends and transfer it to the side of their enemies  accordingly all the terror and dismay went along with him  at first disturbed the battalions of the Latines and then spread universally over their whole line This ap peared most evidently in that wherever he was carried by his horse there they were seized with a panic as if struck by some pestilent constellation but where he fell overwhelmed with darts manifest consternation took possession of the cohorts of the Latines so that they fled from the spot leaving it void to a consider able extent At the same time the Romans their minds being delivered from the dread of the gods exerted themselves with fresh ardor as if they were then rushing to the first onset on receiving the signal Then even the rorarii pushed forward among the an tepilani and added strength to the spearmen and principes  and the veterans resting on their right knee waited for the consul s nod to rise up to the fight 10 Afterwards in the course of the battle the La tines had the advantage in some places on account of their superior numbers The consul Manlius who had heard the circumstances of his colleague s death and as was justly due to him expressed his sentiments of the glorious manner in which he died both by tears and by the praises to which it was intitled hesitated a while whether it were yet time for the veterans to rise  then judging it better to reserve them fresh for the decisive blow he ordered the accensi to advance from the rear before the standards On their moving forward the Latines immediately called their veterans thinking their adversaries had done the same and when these by fighting furiously for a considerable time had fatigued themselves and either broken off the points of their spears or blunted them yet con tinuing to drive back their opponents thinking that the fate of the battle was nearly decided and that they had come to the last line then the consul called to the veterans  Now arise fresh as you are against men who are fatigued and think on your country your LIV VOL III B IS LIVY parents your wives and children  think on your consul submitting to death to insure your success The veterans rising with their arms glittering and re ceiving the antepilani into the intervals of their ranks presented a new face which was not foreseen  raising their shout they broke the first line of the Latines then after slaying those who constituted the principal strength forced their way almost without a wound through the other companies as if through an unarmed crowd  and such havoc did they make in their thick est bands that they left alive scarce a fourth part of the enemy The Samnites who stood in order of battle at a distance close to the foot of the mountain increased the fears of the Latines But of all whether citizens or allies the principal share of honor was due to the consuls  one of whom drew down on his own single person all the dangers and threats denounced by the deities either of heaven or hell  while the other dis played such a degree both of courage and conduct that it is universally agreed among all who have trans mitted to posterity an account of that battle both La tines and Romans that on whichever side Manlius had held the command victory must have attended The Latines fled towards Minturnae The body of Decius was not found that day night putting a stop to the search  on the following it was discovered pierced with a multitude of darts amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies and his funeral was solemnised under the direction of his colleague in a manner suited to his honorable death It seems proper to mention here that it is allowable for a consul dictator andpre tor when they devote the legions of their enemies to devote along with them not themselves in particular but any citizen whom they choose out of a Roman legion regularly inrolled  If the person devoted perishes the performance is deemed complete If he die not then an image seven feet high or more must be buried in the earth and a victim sacrificed as an expiation Where that image shall be buried there it shall be unlawful for a Roman magistrate to pass But if he HISTORY OF ROME BOOK VIII 19 shall choose to devote himself as Decius did then  if he who devotes himself die not he shall not be capa ble of performing with propriety any act of worship in behalf either of himself or of the public Let him have a right to devote his arms to Vulcan or to any other god he shall do it either by a victim or in any other mode The enemy should if possible be hin dered from getting possession of the weapon on which the consul stood when he uttered his imprecation  but if they chance to attain it an atonement must be made to Mars by the sacrifices called Suovetaurilia Al though the memory of every divine and human rite has been obliterated through the preference given to what is new and foreign above that which is ancient and the growth of our own country yet I thought it not amiss to recite these particulars as they have been transmitted to us and even in the very words in which they were expressed 11 Several authors relate that the Samnites having waited to see the issue of the fight came up at length with support to the Romans after the battle was ended In like manner a reinforcement from Lavi nium after wasting time in deliberation set out to the aid of the Latines after they had been vanquished  and when the first standards and part of the army had passed the gates receiving information of the over throw of the Latines they faced about and returned to the city  on which their pretor named Millionius is reported to have said that  a high price must be paid to the Romans for so short a journey Such of the Latines as survived the fight after being scattered through different roads collected themselves in a body and took refuge in the city of Vescia There their general Numisius insisted in their meetings that  the variable chances of war had ruined both armies by equal losses and that the name only of vic tory was on the side of the Romans and that they were in fact no better than defeated The two pa vilions of their consuls were polluted  one by the parricide committed on a son the other by the death 20 LIVY of a devoted consul every part of heir army had suf fered great slaughter their spearmen and their first rank were cut to pieces and both before and behind their standards multitudes were slain until the vete rans at last restored their cause Now although the forces of the Latines were reduced in an equal propor tion yet still for the purpose of procuring reinforce ments either Latium or the territory of the Volscians was nearer than Rome Wherefore if they approved of it he would with all speed call out the youth from the states of the Latines and Volscians  would march back to Capua with an army prepared for action and while the Romans thought of nothing less than a bat tle strike them with dismay by his unexpected arri val The misrepresentations contained in his letters which he despatched round Latium and the Volscian nation were the more easily credited by the people as they had not been present at the battle and in con sequence a tumultuary army levied in haste assembled from all quarters This body the consul Torquatus met at Trisanum a place between Sinuessa and Min turnaj Withput waiting to choose ground for camps both parties threw down their baggage in heaps and immediately began an engagement which decided the fate of the war for the strength of the Latines was so intirely broken fljat on the consul leading his victo rious army to ravage their country they all submitted themselves to his mercy and their submission was fol lowed by that of the Campanians A forfeiture of a portion of their territory was exacted from Latium and Capua The Latine lands to which the Privernian were added and also the Falernian which had be longed to the people of Campania as far as the river Vulturnus were distributed to the Roman commons Of two acres the portion allotted to each three fourths were assigned them in the Latine ground the comple ment to be made up out of the Privernian In the Falernian three acres were given to each the addition of one being made in consideration of the distance  Of the Latines the Laurentians were exempted from A HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII J I punishment as were the Campanian horsemen he cause they had not joined in the revolt An order was made that the treaty should be renewed with the Lau rentians and from that time this has been annually done on the tenth day after the Latine festival The privileges of citizens were granted to the Campanian horsemen  and as a monument thereof they hung up a tablet in the temple of Castor at Rome The people of Campania were also enjoined to pay them a yearly stipend of four hundred and fifty denarii1 each  their number amounted to one thousand six hundred 12 The war being thus brought to a conclusion Titus Manlius after distributing rewards and punish ments according to the merits and demerits of each returned to Rome On his arrival there it appeared that none but the aged came out to meet him and that the young both then and during the whole of his life detested and cursed him The Antians having made inroads on the territories of Ostia Ardea and Solonia the consul Manlius unable on account of the ill state of his health to act against them in person nominated dictator Lucius Papirius Crassus who happened at the time to be pretor and he constituted Lucius Papirius Cursor master of the horse Nothing worth mention was performed against the Antians by the dictator al though he kept his army in a fixed camp in the terri tory of Antium during several months To this year which was signalised by conquest over so many and such powerful nations and besides by the glorious death of one of the consuls and the other s unrelent ing severity in command by which he has been ren dered for ever memorable succeeded as consuls Ti berius jEmilius Mamerrinus and Quintus Publilius Philo A U C 416 B C 336 who found not equal opportunity for the display of abilities  and were be sides more attentive to their private interests and the parties which divided the state than to the public good The Latines taking arms again out of resent Â 141 10s 7 d 22 ment for being deprived of their lands were defeated and driven out of their camp in the plains of Ferenti num  and while Publilius under whose conduct and auspices the battle had been fought was employed there in receiving the submissions of the Latine states who had lost the greater part of their young men in the engagement jEmilius led the army towards Pe dum The people of this city were supported by the Tiburtine Praenestine and Veliternian states  auxili aries also came to them from Lavinium and Antium Though the Romans had here the superiority in seve ral engagements yet the most difficult part of the bu siness remained still to be attempted at the city of Pe dum itself and at the camp of the combined states which lay close to the walls when the consul on hearing that a triumph had been decreed to his col league hastily left the war unfinished and repaired to Rome to demand a triumph for himself before he had obtained a victory The senate offended at his ambi tious proceeding refused to grant it until Pedum should either surrender or be taken This so alienated Emilius from their interests that he acted during the remainder of his consulate like a seditious tribune for as long as he continued in office he never ceased criminating the patricians in harangues to the people which his colleague who was himself a plebeian took no pains to prevent The charges he brought against them were grounded on a scanty distribution of the Latine and Falernian lands and when the senate wishing to put an end to the administration of the con suls ordered a dictator to be nominated to conduct the war against the Latines who were again in arms jEmilius who was the acting consul at the time nomi nated his colleague dictator who appointed Junius Bru tus master of the horse The dictatorship of Publilius was popular for his discourses were replete with invec tives against the patricians He at the same time passed three laws highly advantageous to the commons and injurious to the nobility  one that the orders of the commons should bind all the Romans another that HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 23 the senate should previous to the taking of the suf frages declare their approbation of all laws which should be passed in the assemblies of the centuries  the third that one of the censors should necessarily be elected out of the commons as it had been already established that both the consuls might be plebeians In the judgment of the patricians the detriment sus tained that year at home from the behavior of the consuls and dictator was more than a counterbalance to the increase of empire through their conduct and successes in war 13 At the commencement of the nextyear A U C 417 B C 335 in which Lucius Furius Camillus and Caius Maenius were consuls the senate in order to render more conspicuous the conduct of jEmilius in relinquishing the business of the campaign warmly urged that men arms and every kind of force should be employed to take Pedum and demolish it The new consuls were of course obliged to postpone every other business and to set out thither In Latium the state of affairs was such that the people could ill en dure either war or peace  their strength was not equal to the support of a war and peace they dis dained on the humiliating terms of losing their lands They resolved therefore to steer a middle course  to keep within the walls of their towns so that no pro vocation should be offered to the Romans which might serve them as a pretext for hostilities  and in case they should hear of siege being laid to any of their possessions then that every one of the estates should be obliged to bring succor to the besieged Pedum however received aid from few  the Tiburtians and Praenestians whose territories lay nearest arrived there but the Aricians Lavinians and Veliternians while forming a junction with the Volscians of Anti um at the river Astura were unexpectedly attacked by Maenius and routed The Tiburtians who were much the strongest body Camillus fought at Pedum  and though he had greater difficulties to surmount yet the issue was equally successful Some confusion 21 LIVY happened occasioned principally by a sudden erilpÂ tion of the townsmen during the fight but Camillus making part of his troops face about not only drove them within the walls but after utterly discomfiting both themselves and their allies took the city the same day by scalade It was then resolved their troops being flushed with victory that they should proceed until they had made an intire conquest of all Latium This plan they prosecuted without intermis sion making themselves masters of some of the towns by force and of others by capitulation reducing the intire country to subjection Then leaving garrisons in the conquered places they returned to Rome to en joy the triumph to which all men allowed they were justly intitled To a triumph was added the honor of having equestrian statues erected to them in the fo rum a compliment very rare in that age Before the assembly for electing consuls was called for the en suing year Camillus moved the senate to take into consideration the conduct to be observed towards the states of Latium and proceeded in this manner  Con script fathers whatever was to be eflected in Latium by means of arms and military operations has now through the favor of the gods and the valor of your soldiers been fully accomplished The armies of our enemies have been cut to pieces at Pedum and the Astura  all the towns of Latium and Antium in the Volscian territory either taken by storm or surren dered are held by your garrisons It remains then to be considered since the frequent rebellious of these people are the cause of so much trouble by what means we may secure their quiet submission and peaceable behavior The attainment of this end the immortal gods have placed within your reach inso much that they have given you the power of deter mining whether Latium shall longer exist or not You can therefore insure to yourselves perpetual peace as far as regards the Latines by the means either of se verity or of mercy Do you choose to adopt cruel measures against people vanquished and submitting to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 25 your authority You may utterly destroy all La tium and make a desert of a country from which in many and difficult wars you have often been supplied with a powerful army of allies Do you choose on the contrary and in conformity to the practice of your ancestors to augment the Roman state by receiving the vanquished into the number of your citizens  Here is a large addition which you may acquire by means which will redound most highly to your glory That government which the subjects feel happy in obeying stands certainly on the firmest of all founda tions But whatever your determination may be it is necessary that it be speedy  as all those states are at present suspended between hope and fear It is therefore of importance that you should be discharged as soon as possible from all solicitude concerning them  and also that either by punishment or cle mency an immediate impression be made on their minds before they recover from the state of insensi bility into which the uncertainty of their fate has thrown them It was our part to bring the business to such an issue that your deliberations concerning it should be unrestrained in every particular It is now yours to determine what is most advantageous to your selves and the commonwealth 14 The principal members of the senate highly ap proved of the consul s statement of the business on the whole  but said that  as the states were differently circumstanced it would conduce to an easy adjustment of the plan so as that their resolutions should be con formable to the several merits of each if he put the question on the case of each state separately The question was accordingly put and a decree passed with respect to each singly The Lauuvians were ad mitted members of the state the exercise of their pub lic worship was restored to them with a provision that the grove and temple of Juno Sospita should be in common between the burghers1 of Lanuvium and the 1 Of the conquered countries the Romans constituted some 26 LIVY Roman people On the same terms with these the Aricians Nomentans and Pedans were received into the number of citizens To the Tusculans the rights of citizens of which they were already in possession were continued  and the guilt of the rebellion instead of being imputed to disaffection in the state was thrown on a few incendiaries On the Veliternians who were Roman citizens of an old standing in resentment of their having so often arisen in rebellion severe ven geance was inflicted  their walls were rased and their senate driven into banishment they were also enjoined to dwell on the farther side of the Tiber with a denun ciation that if any of them should be caught on the hither side of that river the fine to be paid for his dis charge should be no less than one thousand asses 1 and that the person apprehending him should not release him from confinement until the money should be paid Into the lands which had belonged to their senators colonists were sent from the addition of whose num bers Velitraa recovered the appearance of its former populousness To Antium also a new colony was sent permission being granted at the same time to the Antians of having themselves inrolled therein if they chose it The ships of war were taken from them aud the people wholly interdicted from meddling with ma ritime affairs but the rights of citizens were granted corporate towns where the people retained their own laws and magistrates and even honored with the title and some of them with all the rights and privileges of Roman citizens The people of Caere were the first who were thus indulged with full rights but afterwards having joined some neigh boring states in a war against Rome all the privileges of ci tizens were taken from them and the title only left In other countries they planted colonies of their own citizens by which means they disburdened the city of numbers of useless and poor inhabitants and at the same time formed barriers against the adjoining states Colonists retained all the rights of citizens chose their own magistrates and formed a kind of petty republics under that of Rome Other countries were made prefectures deprived of their own laws and magistrates and governed by a prefect sent annually from Rome 1 3i 4s 7d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 27 to them The Tiburtians and Pranestians were amerced in a portion of their lands not merely on account of their recent crime of rebellion common to them with the rest of the Latines but because they had formerly in disgust at the Roman government associated in arms with the Gauls a nation of savages From the other states they took away the privileges of intermar riage commerce and holding assemblies To the Campanians in compliment to their horsemen who had refused to join in rebellion with the Latines as likewise to the Fundans and Formians because the troops had always found a safe and quiet passage through their territories the freedom of the state was granted without right of suffrage The states of Cu mae and Suessula it was decreed should be placed on the same footing and enjoy the same privileges as Capua Of the ships of the Antians some were drawn up into the docks at Rome  the rest were burned and with the prows of these a pulpit built in the forum was ordered to be decorated hence called rostra 1 15 During the succeeding consulate of Caius Sul picius Longus and Publius jElius Paetas A U C 418 B C 334 whilst all the neighboring states were sincerely disposed not more through consideration of the power of the Romans than grateful sentiments in spired by their generous conduct to cultivate peace with them a quarrel broke out between the Sidicinians and the Auruncians The latter having been formerly on their submission admitted into alliance by Titus Manlius in his consulate had ever since demeaned themselves peaceably for which reason they were more justly intitled to expect assistance from the Ro mans But before the consuls led out the army for the senate had ordered the Auruncians to be sup ported intelligence was brought that these through fear had deserted their city and removing with their wives and children had fortified Suessa which is now called Aurunca and that their former dwellings and 1 From rostrum the beak or prow of a ship 28 Ll W fortifications were demolished by the Sidicinians The senate highly displeased with the consuls in conse quence of whose dilatory proceedings their allies had been disappointed of support ordered a dictator to be nominated Caius Claudius Regillensis being accord ingly appointed chose Caius Claudius Hortator master of the horse A scruple afterwards arose concerning the dictator and the augurs having declared his crea tion informal both he and the master of the horse ab dicated their offices This year Minucia a vestal falling at first under suspicion of incontinence because of her dressing in a style of elegance beyond what became her situation and being afterwards prosecuted before the pontiffs on the testimony of a slave was by their decree ordered to refrain from meddling in sa cred rites and to retain her slaves under her own power 1 Being afterwards brought to trial she was buried alive at the Colline gate on the right hand of the causeway in the Field of Wickedness which was so denominated I suppose from her crime The same year Quintus Publilius Philo was the first plebeian elected pretor He was opposed by the consul Sulpi cius who refused to admit him as a candidate  but the senate having failed of carrying their point with re spect to the highest offices showed the less earnestness about the pretorship 16 The following year A U C 419 B C 333 wherein Lucius Papirius Crassus and Caeso Duillius were consuls was distinguished by a war with the Ausonians which deserves notice rather as they were a new enemy than on account of its importance This people inhabited the city Cales they had united their arms with their neighbors the Sidicinians yet the forces of the two nations were defeated in a single battle without any great difficulty Their cities being near at hand induced them to quit the field the earlier and also afforded them shelter after their flight How ever the senate did not on this desist from the prose 1 For if she had made them free they could not have been examined by the torture HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 23 cution of the war being provoked at the Sidicinians having so often taken arms against them either as principals or auxiliaries They therefore exerted their utmost endeavors to raise to the consulship the fourth time Marcus Valerius Corvus the greatest general of that age A U C 420 B C 332 1 The colleague joined with him was Marcus Atilius Regulus and lest chance might frustrate their wishes a request was made to the consuls that without casting lots that province might be assigned to Corvus Receiving the victorious army from the former consuls he marched directly to Cales where the war had its rise  and having at the first onset routed the enemy who were disheartened by the recollection of the former engage ment he directed his operations against the town itself Such was the ardor of the soldiers that they wanted to proceed directly up to the walls with ladders assert ing that they would quickly scale them  but that being a hazardous attempt Corvus chose to effect his purpose by the labor of his men rather than at the expense of so much danger to them  he therefore formed a ram part prepared machines and advanced towers up to the walls But an opportunity which accidentally pre sented itself prevented his having occasion to use them  for Marcus Fabius a Roman who was prisoner there having broken his chains while his guards were inat tentive on a festival day by fastening a rope to one of the battlements let himself down among the Roman works and persuaded the general to make an assault on the enemy while in consequence of feasting and drinking they were disqualified for action And thus the Ausonians together with their city were captured with as little difficulty as they had been defeated in the field The booty found there was immense and the legions leaving a garrison at Cales returned to Rome The consul triumphed in pursuance of a de cree of the senate and in order that At1lius should n ot be without a share of honor both the consuls were ordered to lead the troops against the Sidic1nians But first in obedience to the senate they nominated   30 LlVY dictator for the purpose of holding the elections Lu cius jEmilius Matnercinus who named Quintus Publi lius Philo master of the horse A U C 421 B C 331 The dictator presiding at the election Titus Veturius and Spurius Postumius were created consuls Notwithstanding the war with the Sidicinians remained unfinished yet being desirous to prevent by an act of generosity the wishes of the commons they proposed to the senate the sending a colony to Cales and a de cree being passed that two thousand five hundred men should be inrolled for that purpose they constituted Caeso Duillius Titus Quintius and Marcus Fabius commissioners for conducting the colony and distri buting the lands 17 The new consuls receiving from their predeces sors the command of the army marched into the ene my s country and carried devastation even to the walls of their capital There because it was expected that the Sidicinians who had collected a vast body of forces would make a vigorous struggle in support of their last hope and a report also prevailing that Samnium was preparing for hostilities the consuls by direction of the senate nominated dictator Publius Cornelius Ru finus who appointed Marcus Antonius his master of the horse A doubt afterwards arose with respect to the regularity of their creation on which they abdi cated their offices and a pestilence ensuing recourse was had to an interregnum as if the auspices of every office had been infected by that irregularity Under Marcus Valerius Corvus the fifteenth interrex from the commencement of the interregnum consuls were at last elected  Aulus Cornelius a second time and Cneius Domitius A U C 422 B C 330 While things were in a state of tranquillity a report which was spread that the Gauls were in arms produced the same effect which a war with that people usually did a resolution to create a dictator Marcus Papirius Crafsus was nominated to that office and Publius Va lerius Publicola to that of master of the horse and while they were busy in levying troops with greater HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIM 31 diligence than would have been deemed requisite in the case of war with any neighboring state intelligence was brought by scouts despatched for the purpose that all was quiet among the Gauls Suspicions were also entertained that Samnium still continued during this year in a disposition to raise new disturbances for which reason the Roman troops were not withdrawn from the country of the Sidicinians An attack made by Alexander king of Epirus on the Lucanians drew the Samnites to that quarter where those two nations fought a pitched battle with the king as he was making a descent on the side of the country adjoining Paestum Alexander having gained the victory concluded a treaty of amity with the Romans  with what degree of faith he would have observed it had the rest of his enterprises proved successful it is hard to say The census or general survey was performed this year and the new citizens rated on whose account two ad ditional tribes were constituted the Maician and Scap tian by the censors Quintus Publilius Philo and Spurius Postumius The Acerrans were inrolled as Romans in pursuance of a law introduced by the pre tor Lucius Papirius which granted them the privi leges of citizens excepting the right of suffrage Such were the transactions foreign and domestic of this year 18 The following year A U C 423 B C 329 exhibited a shocking scene whether occasioned by the intemperature of the air or by the wickedness of the people The consuls were Marcus Claudius Marcel lus and Caius Valerius either Flaccus or Potitus for I find these different surnames of the consul in the an nals  it is however a matter of little consequence which of them be the true one There is another ac count which I could heartily wish were false  that those persons whose deaths distinguished this year as disastrous on account of the extraordinary mortality were cut off by poison Although this particular be not mentioned by all the historians of this period yet that I may not detract from the credit of any writer I 32 Ll VY shall relate the matter as it has been handed down to us While the principal persons of the state died by disorders of the same kind and which were attended with the same issue in every case a certain maid ser vant undertook before Quintus Fabius Maximus cu rule edile to discover the cause of the general malady provided security were given ber on the public faith that she should not be a sufferer in consequence Fa bius immediately reported the affair to the consuls and the consuls to the senate  and by order of that body the public faith was pledged to the informer She then stated to them that the calamity which afflicted the nation was caused by the wicked contrivances of certain women  that some matrons were at the time preparing drugs for the purpose and that if they would be pleased to go along with her without delay they might detect them in the fact Accordingly they followed the informant and found several women pre paring drugs and also quantities of the same laid up which being brought into the forum and the matrons in whose custody they were found to the number of twenty being summoned by a beadle two of them Cornelia and Sergia both of patrician families asserted that those drugs were wholesome  while the informant maintained the contrary and insisted on their drinking them in order to convict her of having invented a falsehood On this having taken time to confer toge ther and in the open view of all a space being cleared for them they drank off the preparation and all pe rished by means of their own wicked device Their attendants being instantly seized gave information against a great number of matrons of whom no less than one hundred and seventy were condemned Until that day no person had ever been tried at Rome for poisoning The affair was deemed a prodigy and seemed more the result of madness than of vicious de pravity Wherefore mention being found in the an nals that formerly on occasion of the secessions of the commons a disastrous time the ceremony of driving the nail had been performed by a dictator and that by HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 33 that expiation the minds of men which were distracted by discord had been restored to their proper state it was resolved that a dictator should be nominated for the purpose Cneius Quintus being accordingly created appointed Lucius Valerius master of the horse and as soon as the nail was driven they abdicated their offices A U C 424 B C 328 19 Lucius Papirius Crassus and Lucius Plautius Venno were the consuls for the next year A U C 425 B C 327  in the beginning of which ambassadors came to Rome from Fabrateria and Polusca two Vol scian stntes praying to be admitted into alliance  and promising that if they were protected against the arms of the Samnites they would ever continue faithful and obedient subjects to the government of the Roman people On this ambassadors were sent by the senate to require of the Samnites that they should offer no violence to the territories of those states  and this embassy produced the desired effect rather because the Samnites were not yet prepared for war than that they were desirous of peace This year war broke out with the people of Privernum these were supported by the inhabitants of Fundi of which country was also the commander in chief Vitruvius Vaccus a man of considerable note not only at home but at Rome also He had a house on the Palatine hill on the spot which after the buildings were rased and the ground thrown open was called Vacciprata 1 He was committing great depredations in the districts of Setia Norba and Cora to oppose him therefore Lucius Papirius began his march and took post at a small distance from his camp Vitruvius neither took the prudent resolution of remaining within his trenches in the presence of an enemy his superior in strength nor had he the cou rage to fight at any great distance from them With out either judgment in forming or boldness in exe cuting his plan he entered on an engagement while the last of his troops had scarcely got out of the gate 1 Or the field of Vaccus from pratum a field LIV VOL III C 34 LIVY of the camp and his men were in a disposition rather to fly back thither than to face the enemy After some slight efforts he was compelled to give up the contest intirely but by reason of the shortness of the dis tance and the ease with which he could regain his camp he saved his army without much difficulty from any great loss few falling either in the action or in the retreat As soon as it grew dark they removed in haste and disorder to Privernum choosing to intrust their safety to walls rather than to a rampart The other consul Plautius after wasting the country on every side and driving off the spoil led his army from Privernum into the territory of Fundi On entering the borders he was met by the senate of that state who declared that  they came not to intercede for Vi truvius and those who had followed his faction but for the peopl of Fundi who in the judgment of Vi truvius himself were clear from all blame of the war as he showed by repairing for safety after his defeat to Privernum and not to Fundi his native city At Privernum therefore the enemies of the Roman peo ple were to be sought and punished who regardless of their duty to both countries had revolted at once from Fundi and from Rome The Fundians were in a state of peace their minds were Roman and impressed with a grateful remembrance of the privilege of citizens imparted to them they besought the consul that he would not treat as enemies an unoffending people  as suring him that their lands their city and their per sons were and ever should be in the disposal of the Roman people The consul commended their con duct  and despatching letters to Rome that the Fun dians had preserved their allegiance turned his march to Privernum Claudius writes that he first inflicted punishment on those who had been the principal abet tors of the conspiracy that three hundred and fifty were sent in chains to Rome but that the senate did not accept their submission because they thought that the people of Fundi meant by consigning to punish ment these men who were mean and indigent to se cure impunity to themselves HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 35 20 While the two consular armies were employed in the siege of Privernum one of the consuls was re called to Rome to preside at the elections This year gaols were first erected in the circus While the at tention of the public was still occupied by the Priver nian war it was forcibly attracted by an alarming re port of the Gauls being in arms a matter at no time slighted by the senate The new consuls therefore Lucius jEmilius Mamercinus and Caius Plautius on the calends of July A U C 426 B C 326 the very day on which they entered into office received orders to settle the provinces immediately between themselves Mamercinus to whom the Gallic war fell was directed to levy troops without admitting any plea of immu nity  nay it is said that even the rabble of handi crafts and those of sedentary trades of all the worst qualified for military service were called out by which means a vast army was collected at Veii in readiness to meet the Gauls It was not thought pro per to proceed to a greater distance lest the Gauls might by some other route arrive at the city without being observed In the course of a few days it was found on a careful inquiry that every thing on that side was quiet at the time and the whole force which was to have opposed the Gauls was then turned against Privernum Of the issue of the business there are two different accounts  some say that the city was taken by storm and that Vitruvius fell alive into the hands of the conquerors others that the townsmen to avoid the extremities of a storm presented the rod of peace and surrendered to the consul and that Vi truvius was delivered up by his troops The senate being consulted with respect to Vitruvius and the Pri vernians sent directions that the consul Plautius should demolish the walls of Privernum and leaving a strong garrison there come home to enjoy the honor of a triumph  at the same time ordering that Vitruvius should be kept in prison until the return of the consul and that he should then be beaten with rods and put to death His house which stood on the Palatine hill 36 LIVY they commanded to be rased to the ground and his effects to be devoted to Semo Sancus With the mo ney produced by the sale of them brazen globes were formed and placed in the chapel of Sancus opposite to the temple of Quirinus As to the senate of Pri vernum it was commanded that every person who had continued to act as a senator of Privernum after the revolt from the Romans should reside on the farther side of the Tiber under the same restrictions as those of Velitrse After the passing of these decrees there was no farther mention of the Privernians until Plau tius had triumphed When that ceremony was over and Vitruvius with his accomplices had been put to death the consul thought that the people s resentment being now fully gratified by the sufferings of the guilty he might safely introduce the business of the Priver nian state which he did in the following manner  Conscript fathers since the authors of the revolt have received both from the immortal gods and from you the punishment due to their crime what do you judge proper to be done with respect to the guiltless multi tude For my part although my duty consists rather in collecting the opinions of others than in offering my own yet when I reflect that the Privernians are si tuated in the neighborhood of the Samnites with whom it is exceedingly uncertain how long we shall be at peace I cannot help wishing that as little ground of animosity as possible may be left between them and us 21 The affair naturally admitted of a diversity of opinions while each agreeably to his particular tem per recommended either severity or lenity and the debate was still farther perplexed by the behavior of one of the Privernian ambassadors more conformable to the prospects to which he had been born than to the insuperable exigency of the present juncture  for being asked by one of the advocates for severity  What punishment he thought the Privernians deserved V he answered  Such as those deserve who deem them selves worthy of liberty The consul observing that HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 37 by this stubborn answer the adversaries of the cause of the Privernians were the more exasperated against them and wishing by a question of favorable import to draw from him a more conciliating reply said to him  What if we remit the punishment in what man ner may we expect that you will observe the peace which shall be established between us He replied  If the peace which you grant us be a good one invio lably and eternally if bad for no long continuance On this several exclaimed that the Privernian menaced them and not in ambiguous terms and that such ex pressions were calculated to excite rebellion But the more reasonable part of the senate interpreted his an swers more favorably and said that  the words which they had beard were those of a man and of one who knew what it was to be free Could it be believed that any people or even any individual would remain longer than necessity constrained in a situation which he felt painful  that the terms of a peace were faith fully observed only when they were voluntarily ac cepted  but that it was absurd to expect fidelity when attempts were made to establish slavery In this opi nion they were led to concur principally by the consul himself who frequently observed to the consulars who had proposed the different resolutions in such a manner as to be heard by the rest that  surely those men who thought of nothing but liberty were worthy of being made Romans They consequently carried their cause in the senate  and moreover by direction of that body a proposal was laid before the people that the freedom of the state should be granted to the Privernians This year a colony of three hundred was sent to Anxur and received two acres of land each 22 The year following A U C 427 B C 325 in which the consuls were Publius Plautius Proculus and Publius Cornelius Scapula was remarkable for no one transaction civil or military except the sending of a colony to Fregellae a district which had belonged to the Sidicinians and afterwards to the Volscians and a distribution of meat to the people made by Marcus 38 LIVY Flavius on occasion of the funeral of his mother There were many who represented that under the ap pearance of doing honor to his parent he was making recompense to the people for having acquitted him when prosecuted by the ediles on a charge of having debauched a married woman This donative intended as a return for favors shown on the trial proved also the means of procuring him the honor of a public office for at the next election of plebeian tribunes though absent he was preferred before the candidates who so licited in person The city Palaepolis was situated at no great distance from the spot where Neapolis now stands The two cities were inhabited by one people  these came from Cumae and the Cumans derive their origin from Chalcis in Euboea By means of the fleet in which they had been conveyed hither they pos sessed great power on the coast of the sea near which they dwelt Their first landing was on the islands of jEnaria and the Pithacnsae  afterwards they ventured to transfer their settlement to the continent This state relying on their own strength and also on the disposi tion of the Samnites to come to a rupture with the Ro mans  or encouraged by the report of a pestilence having attacked the city of Rome committed various acts of hostility against the Romans settled in the Cam panian and Falernian territories Wherefore in the succeeding consulate of Lucius Cornelius and Quintus Publilius Philo a second time A U C 428 B C 324 heralds being sent to Palaepolis to demand satisfaction and a haughty answer being returned by these Greeks a race more magnanimous in words than in action the people in pursuance of the direction of the senate ordered war to be declared against them On settling the provinces between the consuls the war against the Greeks fell to Publilius Cornelius with another army was appointed to watch the motions of the Samnites and a report prevailing of an expected revolt in Cam pania in which case they intended to march their troops thither that was judged the properest station for him HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 39 23 The senate received information from both the consuls that there waj very little hope of peace with the Samnites Publilius informed them that two thou sand soldiers from Nolae and four thousand of the Sam nites had been received into Palrepolis a measure rather forced on the Greeks by the Nolans than agree able to their inclination Cornelius wrote that a levy of troops had been ordered that all Samnium was in motion and that the neighboring states of Privernum Fundi and Formiae were openly solicited to join them It was thought proper that before hostilities were com menced ambassadors should be sent to expostulate on these subjects with the Samnites who answered in a haughty manner they even went so far as to accuse the Romans of behaving injuriously towards them  but nevertheless they took pains to acquit themselves of the charges made against them asserting that  their state had not given either counsel or aid to the Greeks nor used any solicitations on their behalf to the Fun dians or Formians for if they were disposed to war they had not the least reason to be diffident of their own strength However they could not dissemble that it gave great offence to the state of the Samnites that Fregelhe a town which they had taken from the Volscians and demolished should have been rebuilt by the Romans and that they should have established a colony within the territory of the Samnites to which their colonists gave the name of Fregellae This injury and affront if not done away by the authors they were determined themselves to remove by the most effectual means in their power One of the Roman ambassa dors proposed to discuss the matter before their com mon allies and friends  on which their magistrate said Why do we disguise our sentiments Romans no conferences of ambassadors nor arbitration of any per son whatever can terminate our differences but the plains of Campania in which we must fight let our armies therefore meet between Capua and Suessula  and there let us decide whether the Samnite or the Roman shall hold the sovereignty f Italy To this 40 LIVY the ambassadors of the Romans replied that they would go not whither their enemy called but whither their commanders should lead In the mean time Publi lius by seizing an advantageous post between Palaepo lis and Nea polis had cut off the confederates from that interchange of mutual aid which they had hitherto af forded each other when either place was pressed The day of the elections approached  and as it was highly inexpedient that Publilius should be recalled when on the point of assailing the enemy s walls and in daily expectation of gaining possession of their city appli cation was made to the tribunes to recommend to the people the passing of an order that Publilius Philo when his year of office should expire might continue in command as proconsul until the war with the Greeks should be finished A letter was despatched to Lucius Cornelius with orders to name a dictator for it was not thought proper that the consul should be recalled while he was employed in vigorously prosecuting the business of the campaign and had already carried the war into Samnium He nominated Marcus Claudius Marcellus who appointed Spurius Postumius master of the horse The elections however were not held by the dictator because the regularity of his appoint ment was called in question  and the augurs being consulted pronounced that it appeared defective The tribunes inveighed against this proceeding as dangerous and dishonorable   for it was not probable they said  that a fault in the appointment could have been dis covered as the consul rising in the night had nomi nated the dictator in private and while every thing was still 1 nor had the said consul in any of his letters either public or private made any mention of such a thing nor did any person whatever appear who said that he saw or heard any thing which could vitiate the auspices Neither could the augurs sitting at Rome divine what inauspicious circumstance had occurred to 1 Any noise happening during the taking of the auspice was reckpned inauspicious HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 41 the consul in the camp Who did not plainly perceive that the dictator s being a plebeian was the defect which the augurs had discovered These and other arguments were urged in vain by the tribunes the affair ended in an interregnum At last after the elections had been adjourned repeatedly on one pre text or another the fourteenth interrex Lucius jEmi lius elected consuls Caius Petilius and Lucius Papi rius Mugillanus or Cursor as I find him named in some annals A U C 429 B C 323 24 Historians relate that in this year Alexandria in Egypt was founded and that Alexander king of Epirus being slain by a Lucanian exile verified in the circumstances of his death the prediction of Jupiter of Dodona At the time when he was invited into Italy by the Tarentines he received a caution from that ora cle to beware of the Acherusian waters and the city Pandosia for there were fixed the limits of bis destiny for that reason he made the greater haste to pass over to Italy in order to be at as great a distance as pos sible from the city Pandosia in Epirus and the river Acheron which after flowing through Molossis wins into the lakes called Infernal and is received into the Thesprotian gulf But as it frequently happens that men by endeavoring to shun their fate run directly on it after having often defeated the armies of Brut tium and Lucania and taken Heraclea a colony of the Tarentines Potentia and Metapontum from the Luca nians Terina from the Bruttians and several other cities of the Messapians and Lucanians and having sent into Epirus three hundred illustrious families whom he intended to keep as hostages he posted his troops on three hills which stood at a small distance from each other not far from the city Pandosia and close to the frontiers of the Bruttians and Lucanians in order that he might thence make incursions into every part of the enemy s country At that time he kept about his person two hundred Lucanian exiles whom he considered as faithful attendants but whose fidelity according to the general disposition of people of that description was ever ready to follow the changes of 42 LIVY fortune A continual fall of rain spread such an inun dation over all the plains as cut off from the three separate divisions of the army all communication In this state the two parties in neither of which the king was present were suddenly attacked and overpowered by the enemy who after putting them to the sword em ployed their whole force in blockading the post where Alexander commanded in person From this place the Lucanian exiles sent emissaries to their countrymen and stipulating a safe return for themselves promised to deliver the king either alive or dead into their power But he bravely resolving to make an extra ordinary effort at the head of a chosen band broke through the midst of their forces  engaged singly and slew the general of the Lucanians and collecting to gether his men who had been scattered in the retreat arrived at a river where the ruins of a bridge which had been recently broken by the violence of the flood pointed out his road Here while the soldiers were  fording the river on a very uneven bottom one of them almost spent with fatigue and apprehension cried out as a reflection on the odious name of it â You are justly named Acheros dismal which expression reach ing the king s ears and instantly recalling to his mind the fate denounced on him he halted hesitating whe ther he should cross over or not Then Sotimus one of the royal band of youths which attended him asked why he delayed in such a critical moment and showed him that the Lucanians were watching an opportunity to perpetrate some act of treachery  whereon the king looking back and seeing them coming towards him in a body drew his sword and pushed on his horse through the middle of the river He had now reached the shal low when a Lucanian exile from a distance transfixed him with a javelin after his fall the current carried down his lifeless body with the weapon sticking in it to the posts of the enemy  there it was mangled in a man ner shocking to relate for dividing it in the middle they sent one half to Consentia and kept the other as a subject of mockery to themselves While they were throwing darts and stones at it a woman mixing with HISTORY OF ROME BOOK VIII 43 the crowd who expressed a degree of barbarous rage which could scarce be conceived to exist in human breasts prevailed on them to stop for a moment She then told them with tears in her eyes that she had a husband and children prisoners among the enemy  and that she hoped to be able with the king s body if they would grant it to her however disfigured to ransom her friends this put an end to their outrages The remnants of his limbs were buried at Consentia intirely through the care of the woman and his bones were sent to Metapontum to the enemy from whence they were conveyed to Epirus to his wife Cleopatra and his sister Olympias  the latter of whom was the mother the former the sister of Alexander the Great Such was the melancholy end of Alexander of Epirus of which although fortune did not allow him to engage in hostilities with the Romans yet as he waged war in Italy I have thought it proper to give this brief ac count This year the fifth time since the building of the city the Lectisternium was performed at Rome for procuring the favor of the same deities to whom it was addressed before 25 The new consuls having by order of the people declared war against the Samnites exerted themselves in more formidable preparations of every kind than had been made against the Greeks and about the same time received a new accession of strength from a quarter where they had no such expectation The Lucanians and Apulians nations who until that time had no kind of intercourse with the Roman people proposed an alliance with them promising a supply of men and arms for the war a treaty of friend ship was accordingly concluded At the same time their affairs went on successfully in Samnium Three towns fell into their hands Allifae Callifae and Ruffrium and the adjoining country to a great ex tent was on the first arrival of the consuls laid in tirely waste As the commencement of their opera tions on this side was attended with so much success so the war in the other quarter where the Greeks were 44 LIVY held besieged now drew towards a conclusion  for besides the communication between the two posts of the enemy being cut off by the besiegers having pos session of part of the works through which it had been carried on they now suffered within the walls hardships far more grievous than those with which they were threatened being insulted in the persons of their wives and children and feeling all the extre mities usual in the sacking of cities When therefore intelligence arrived that reinforcements were to come from Tarentum and from the Samnites all agreed that there were more of the latter already within the walls than they wished  but the young men of Tarentum who were Greeks as well as themselves they earnestly longed for as they hoped to be enabled by their means to oppose the Samnites and Nolans which they deemed no less necessary than resisting their Roman enemies At last a surrender to the Romans appeared to be the lightest evil Charilaus and Nymphius the two prin cipal men in the state consulting together on the sub ject settled the part which each was to act it was that one should desert to the Roman general and the other stay behind to manage affairs in the city so as to facilitate the execution of their plan Charilaus was the person who came to Publilius Philo  he told him that  he had taken a resolution which he hoped would prove advantageous fortunate and happy to the Palajpolitans and to the Roman people of delivering the fortifications into his hands Whether he should appear by that deed to have betrayed or preserved his country depended on the honor of the Romans That for himself in particular he neither stipulated nor re quested any thing but in behalf of the state he re quested rather than stipulated that in case the design should succeed the Roman people would consider more especially the zeal and hazard with which it sought a renewal of their friendship than its folly and rashness in deviating from its duty He was com mended by the general and received a body of three thousand soldiers with which he was to seize on that HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIM 45 part of the city which was possessed by the Samniles which detachment was commanded by Lucius Quintius military tribune 26 In the mean time Nymphius on his part art fully addressing himself to the commander of the Saro nites prevailed on him as all the troops of the Ro mans were employed either about Palaepolis or in Samnhim to allow him to sail round with the fleet to the territory of Rome where he undertook to ravage not only the sea coast but the country adjoining the very city But in order to avoid observation it was neces sary he told him to set out by night and to launch the ships immediately To effect this with the greater despatch all the young Samnites except the necessary guards of the city were sent to the shore While Nymphius wasted the time there givipg contradictory orders designedly to create confusion which was in creased by the darkness and by the crowd which was so numerous as to obstruct each other s operations Charilaus according to the plan concerted was ad mitted by his associates into the city  and having filled the higher parts of it with Roman soldiers he ordered them to raise a shout on which the Greeks who had received previous directions from their leaders kept themselves quiet The Nolans fled through the oppo site part of the town by the road leading to Nola The flight of the Samnites who were shut out from the city was easier but had a more disgraceful appear ance  for they returned to their homes without arms stripped of their baggage and destitute of every thing all in short belonging to them being left with their enemies  so that they were objects of ridicule not only to foreigners but even to their own countrymen I know that there is another account of this matter which represents the town to have been betrayed by the Samnites  but I have chosen to follow the writers most worthy of credit besides the treaty of Neapolis for to that place the seat of government of the Greeks was then transferred renders it more probable that the renewal of friendship was voluntary on their side 4 3 LIVY Publilius had a triumph decreed him because people were well convinced that it was his conduct of the siege which reduced the enemy to submission This man was distinguished by two extraordinary incidents of which he afforded the first instance  a prolongation of command never before granted to any one and a triumph after the expiration of his office 27 Another war soon after arose with the Greeks of the other coast The Tarentines having for a consi derable time buoyed up the state of Palaepolis with delusive hopes of assistance when they understood that the Romans had gotten possession of that city as if they were the persons who had suffered the disap pointment and not the authors of it they inveighed against the Palaepolitans and became furious in their anger and malicje towards the Romans to which they were farther incited by receiving information that the Lucanians and Apulians had joined them  for a treaty of alliance had been this year concluded with both these nations  The business they observed  was now brought almost to their doors  and such wonld soon be the state of affairs that they must deal with the Romans as enemies or receive them as masters  that in fact their interests were at stake on the issue of the war of the Samnites the only nation which con tinued to make opposition  and that with power very inadequate since they were deserted by the Lucanians  these however might yet be brought back and induced to renounce the Roman alliance if proper skill were used in sowing dissension between them These reasonings being readily adopted by people who wished for a change they procured for money some young Luca nians of considerable note in their country but devoid of honor to bring about their design these having lacerated each other s bodies with stripes came naked into a public meeting of their countrymen exclaiming that because they had ventured to go into the Roman camp they had been thus beaten with rods by order of the consul and had hardly escaped the loss of their heads Circumstances so shocking in their nature HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 47 carrying strong proofs of the ill treatment none of artifice the people were so irritated that by their clamors they compelled the magistrates to call toge ther the senate and whilst some stood round that as sembly insisting on a declaration of war against the Romans others ran different ways to rouse to arms the multitude residing in the country Thus the minds even of rational men being hurried into imprudence by the general uproar a decree was passed that the alli ance with the Samnites should be renewed and ambas sadors sent for that purpose This hasty proceeding surprised the Samnites who however insisted that they should not only give hostages but also receive garri sons into their fortified places  and they blinded by resentment refused no terms In a little time after on the authors of the imposition removing to Taren tum the whole came to light But as they had given all power out of their own hands nothing was left them but unavailing repentance 28 This year proved as it were a new era of liberty to the Roman commons  a stop being put to the prac tice of confining debtors This alteration1 of the law was effected in consequence of the behavior of a usurer in which lust and cruelty were equally conspicuous His name was Lucius Papirius To him one Caius Publilius having surrendered his person to be confined for a debt due by his father his youth and beauty which ought to have excited commiseration operated on the other s mind as incentives to barbarity He first attempted to seduce the young man by impure discourses but finding that his ears were shocked at their infamous tendency he then endeavored to terrify him by threats and reminded him frequently of his situation At last convinced of his resolution to act conformably to his honorable birth rather than to his present condition he ordered him to be stripped and scourged With the marks of the rods imprinted in his flesh the youth rushed out into the public street uttering loud complaints of the depravedness and in humanity of the usurer On which a vast number of 48 LIVY people moved by compassion for his early age and indignation at his barbarous treatment reflecting at the same time what might be the lot of themselves and of their children flocked together into the forum and from thence in a body to the senate house When the consuls were obliged by the sudden tumult to rail a meeting of the senate the people falling at the feet of each of the senators as they were going into the senate house presented to their view the back of Caius torn with stripes On that day in consequence of the outrageous conduct of an individual one of the strong est bonds of credit was broken  and the consuls were commanded to propose to the people that no person should be held in fetters or stocks except convicted of a crime and in order to punishment but that for money due the goods of the debtor not his person should be answerable Thus the confined debtors were released and provision made for the time to come that they should not be liable to confinement 29 In the course of this year while the war with the Samnites was sufficient in itself to give full employ ment to the senate besides the sudden defection of the Lucanians and the intrigues of the Tarentines by which it had been effected they found another source of uneasiness in a union formed by the state of the Vestinians with the Samnites Which event though it continued during the present year to be the general subject of conversation without coming under any public discussion appeared so important to the con suls of the year following A U C 430 B C 322 Lucius Furius Camillus a second time and Decius Junius that it was the first business which they pro posed to the consideration of the state Notwithstand ing it had yet produced no effects it threw the senate into great perplexity as they dreaded equally the con sequences either of passing it over or of taking it up  lest on the one hand if that people s conduct passed with impunity wantonness and arrogance might ex cite other states in their neighborhood to follow their example  and on the other if an attempt should be HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 49 made to punish them by force of arms resentment and dread of immediate danger might produce the same effect And the whole body of Vestinians too was at least equal in strength to the Samnites being com posed of the Marsians the Pelignians and the Mar rusinians  against all of whom they would have to contend if any steps were taken against that nation However that opinion prevailed which might at the time seem to have more spirit than prudence  but the event afforded a proof that fortune assists the brave The people in pursuance of the direction of the senate ordered war against the Vestinians which province fell by lot to Junius  Samnium to Camillus Armies were led to both places which by carefully guarding the frontiers prevented a junction of the forces of their enemies But Lucius Furius on whom the principal weight of the business rested was deprived of his share in the management of it being seized with a severe sickness He was therefore ordered to nomi nate a dictator to conduct the war and he nominated Lucius Papirius Cursor the most celebrated general by far of any in that age who appointed Quintus Fa bius Maximus Rullianus master of the horse These commanders were remarkable for their exploits in war  but more so for a quarrel which arose between them selves and which proceeded almost to violence The other consul in the territory of the Vestinians carried on operations of various kinds and in all was uni formly successful He utterly laid waste their lands and by spoiling and burning their houses and corn compelled them to come to an engagement when in one battle he reduced the strength of the Vestinians to such a degree though not without loss on his own side that they not only fled to their camp but fear ing even to trust to the rampart and trench dis persed from thence into the several towns in hopes of tmding security in the situation and fortifications of their cities At last he undertook to reduce their towns by force  and so ardent were the soldiers and such their resentment for the wounds which they had MV V0L D 50 LIVY received hardly one of them having come out of the hattle unhurt that he took Cutina by scalade and afterwards Cingilia The spoil of both cities he gave to the soldiers in consideration of their having bravely surmounted the obstruction both of gates and walls 30 The commanders entered Samnium without having obtained any particularly favorable indications in the auspices an ominous circumstance which pointed not at the event of war for that was prosper ous but at the furious passions and the quarrels which broke out between the leaders for Papirius the dic tator returning to Rome in order to take the auspices anew in consequence of a caution received from the aruspex left strict orders with the master of the horse to remain in his post and not to engage in battle during his absence After the departure of the dic tator Fabius having discovered by his scouts that the enemy were in as unguarded a state as if there was n ot a single Roman in their neighborhood the high spirited youth either conceiving indignation at the sole authority in every point appearing to be lodged in the hands of the dictator or induced by the opportunity of striking an important blow having made the necessary preparations and dispositions marched to a place called Imbrinium and there fought a battle with the Samnites His success in the fight was such that there was no one circumstance which could have been improved to more advantage if the dictator had been present The leader was not wanting to the soldiers nor the soldiers to their leader The cavalry too finding after re peated charges that they could not break the ranks by the advice of Lucius Cominius a military tribune pulled off the bridles from their horses and spurred them on so furiously that no power could withstand them  forcing their way through the thickest of the enemy they bore down every thing before them  and the infantry seconding the charge the whole body was thrown into confusion Of these twenty thou sand are said to have fallen on that day Some ac counts say that there were two battles fought during HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 51 the dictator s absence and two victories obtained  but the most ancient writers mention only this one and in some histories the whole transaction is omitted The master of the horse getting possession of abun dance of spoils in consequence of the great numbers slain collected the arms into a huge heap and burned them  either in pursuance of a vow to some of the gods or if we choose to credit Fabius in order to pre vent the dictator from reaping the fruits of that re nown to which be alone was intitled He feared too that Papirius might inscribe his name on the spoils or carry them in triumph His letters also containing an account of the success being sent to the senate showed plainly that he wished not to impart to the dictator any share of the honor  who certainly viewed the proceeding in this light for while others rejoiced at the victory obtained he showed only surliness and anger  insomuch that immediately dismissing the se nate he hastened out of the senate house and fre quently repeated with warmth that the legions of the Samnites were not more effectually vanquished and overthrown by the master of the horse than were the dictatorial dignity and military discipline if such con tempt of orders escaped with impunity Thus breath ing resentment and menaces he set out for the camp  but though he travelled with all possible expedition intelligence arrived before him that the dictator was coming eager for vengeance and in every second sen tence applauding the conduct of Titus Manlius 31 Fabius instantly called an assembly and in treated the soldiers to  show the same courage in pro tecting bim under whose conduct and auspices they had conquered from the outrageous cruelty of the dictator which they had so lately displayed in defend ing the commonwealth from its most inveterate ene mies He was now coming he told them  frantic with envy enraged at another s bravery raving like a madman because in his absence the business of the public had been executed with remarkable success  and if he could change the fortune of the engagement 52 LIVY would wish the Samnites in possession of victory ra ther than the Romans He talked much of contempt of orders as if his prohibition of fighting were not dictated by the same motive whrch caused his vexa tion at the fight having taken place He wished to shackle the valor of others and meant to take away the soldiers arms when they were most eager for ac tion and that no use might be made of them in his absence  he was farther enraged too because Quin tus Fabius considered himself as master of the horse not as a beadle to the dictator How would he have behaved had the issue of the fight been unfortunate  which through the chances of war and the uncertainty of military operations might have been the case since now when the enemy has been vanquished as com pletely indeed as if that leader s own singular talents had been employed in the matter he yet threatens the master of the horse with punishment  Nor is his rancor greater towards the master of the horse than towards the military tribunes towards the centurions towards the soldiers On all he would vent his rage  and because that is not in his power he vents it on one Envy like flame soars upwards  aims at the summit and makes its attack on the head of the busi ness on the leader If he could put him out of the way together with the glory of the service performed he would then triumph like a conqueror over van quished troops and without scruple practise against the soldiers what he had been allowed to act against their commander It behoved them therefore in his cause to support the general liberty of all If the dictator perceived among the troops the same una nimity in justifying their victory that they had dis played in gaining it and that all interested themselves in the safety of one it would bend his temper to milder counsels In fine he told them  that he com mitted his life and all his interests to their honor and to their courage 32 His speech was received with the loudest accla mations from every part of the assembly bidding him HISTORY OF ROME BOOK VIII  have courage  for while the Roman legions were in being no man should offer him violence Not long after the dictator arrived and instantly summoned an assembly by sound of trumpet Then silence being made a crier cited Quintus Fabius master of the horse and as soon as on the lower ground he had approached the tribunal the dictator said  Quintus Fabius I demand of you when the authority of dic tator is acknowleged to be supreme and is submitted to by the consuls officers endowed with regal power  and likewise by the pretors created under the same auspices with consuls  whether or no you think it reasonable that it should not meet obedience from a master of the horse  I also ask you whether when I knew that I set out from home under uncertain aus pices it was for me under that consideration to ha zard the safety of the commonwealth or whether my duty did not require me to have the auspices newly taken so that nothing might be done while the will of the gods remained doubtful And farther when a re ligious scruple was of such a nature as to hinder the dictator from acting whether the master of the horse could be exempt from it and at liberty  But why do I ask these questions when supposing that I had gone without leaving any orders your own judgment ought to have been regulated according to what you could discover of my intention Why do you not answer Did I not forbid you to act in any respect during my absence  Did I not forbid you to engage the enemy  Yet in contempt of these my orders while the aus pices were uncertain while the omens were confused contrary to the practice of war contrary to the disci pline of our ancestors and contrary to the authority of the gods you dared to enter on the fight Answer to these questions proposed to you On any other mat ter utter not a word Lictor draw near him To each of these particulars Fabius finding it no easy matter to answer at one time remonstrated against the same person acting as accuser and judge in a cause which affected his very existence at another 54 LIVY he asserted that his life should sooner be forced from him than the glory of his past services  clearing him self and accusing the other by turns so that the dic tator s anger blazed out with fresh fury and he or dered the master of the horse to be stripped and the rods and axes to be got ready Fabius imploring the protection of the soldiers while the lictors were tear ing his garments retired to the quarters of the ve terans who were already raising a commotion in the assembly  from them the uproar spread through the whole body  in one place the voice of supplication was heard in another menaces Those who hap pened to stand nearest to the tribunal because being under the eyes of the general they could easily be known applied to bim with intreaties to spare the master of the horse and not in him to condemn the whole army The remoter parts of the assembly and the crowd collected round Fabius railed at the unre lenting spirit of the dictator and were not far from mutiny  nor was even the tribunal perfectly quiet The lieutenants general standing round the general s seat besought him to adjourn the business to the next day and to allow time to his anger and room for con sideration  representing that  the indiscretion of Fa bius had been sufficiently rebuked  his victory suffi ciently disgraced and they begged him not to pro ceed to the extreme of severity not to brand with ignominy a youth of extraordinary merit or his fa ther a man of most illustrious character together with  the whole family of the Fabii When neither their prayers nor arguments made any impression they de sired him to observe the violent ferment of the assem bly and told him that  while the soldiers tempers were heated to such a degree it became not either his age or his wisdom to kindle them into a flame and af ford matter for a mutiny that no one would lay the blame of such an event on Quintus Fabius who only deprecated punishment but on the dictator if blinded by resentment he should by an ill judged contest draw on himself the fury of the multitude and HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 65 lest he should think that they acted from motives of regard to Quintus Fabius they were ready to make oath that in their judgment it was not for the interest of the commonwealth that Quintus Fabius should be punished at that time 33 Their expostulations irritating the dictator against themselves instead of appeasing his anger against the master of the horse the lieutenants general were or dered to go down from the tribunal and after several vain attempts were made to procure silence by means of a crier the noise and tumult being so great that neither the voice of the dictator himself nor that of his apparitors could be heard night as in the case of a battle put an end to the contest The master of the horse was ordered to attend on the day following but being assured by every one that Papirius being agitated and exasperated in the course of the present contention would proceed against him with greater violence he fled privately from the camp to Rome  where by the advice of his father Marcus Fabius who bad been three times consul and likewise dic tator be immediately called a meeting of the senate While he was laying his complaints before the fathers of the rage and injustice of the dictator on a sudden was heard the noise of lictors before the senate house clearing the way and Papirius himself arrived full of resentment having followed with a guard of light horse as soon as he heard that the other had quitted the camp The contention then began anew and the dictator ordered Fabius to be seized As he persisted in his purpose with inflexible obstinacy notwithstand ing the united intercessions of the principal patricians and of the whole senate Fabius the father then said  Since neither the authority of the senate has any weight with you nor my age which you wish to ren der childless  nor the noble birth and merit of a mas ter of the horse nominated by yourself nor prayers which have often mitigated the rage of an enemy and which appease the wrath of the gods  I call on the tribunes of the commons for support and appeal to 50 LIVY the people  and since you decline the judgment of your own army as well as of the senate I call you before a judge who must certainly be allowed though no other should to possess more power and authority than yourself though dictator It shall be seen whe ther you will submit to an appeal to which Tullus Hostilius a Roman king submitted They proceeded directly from the senate house to the assembly where having arrived the dictator attended by few the mas ter of the horse by all the people of the first rank in a body Papirius commanded him to be taken from the rostrum to the lower ground on which his father following him said  You do well in ordering as to be brought down to a place where even as private per sons we have liberty of speech At first instead of regular speeches nothing but altercation was beard  at length the indignation of old Fabius and the strength of his voice got the better of noise while he reproached Papirius with arrogance and cruelty He himself he said  had been dictator at Rome  and no man not even the lowest plebeian or centurion or soldier had suffered in any way through his means But Papirius sought for victory and triumph over a Ro man commander with as much zeal as over the gene rals of the enemy What an immense difference be tween the moderation of the ancients and the oppres sion of the moderns  Quintius Cincinnatus when dic tator showed no farther mark of resentment to Lucius Minucius the consul although from his ill conduct he had fallen into the power of the enemy and from which he rescued him than leaving him at the head of the army in the quality of lieutenant general in stead of consul Marcus Furius Camillus in the case of Lucius Furius who in contempt of his great age and authority had fought a battle the issue of which was dishonorable in the last degree not only restrained his anger at the time so as to write no unfavorable re presentation of his conduct to the people or the senate  but after returning home when the patricians gave him a power of electing from among his colleagues HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 57 whoever he might approve as an associate with him self in the command chose that very man in prefer ence to all the other consular tribunes Nay the body of the people themselves whose power is supreme in every case never suffered their passions to carry them to greater severity even towards those who through rashness and ignorance had occasioned the I09S of armies than the fining them a sum of money Until that day a capital prosecution for ill conduct in war had never been instituted against any commander but now generals of the Roman people after gaining the most splendid victories and meriting the most honor able triumphs are threatened with rods and axes  a treatment which would not have been deemed allow able even towards those who had been defeated by an enemy What degree of punishment would his son have been liable to if he had occasioned the loss of the army  if he had been put to fight and driven out of his camp Could the dictator stretch his resentment and violence to any greater length than to scourge him and put him to death How was it consistent with reason that through the means of Quintus Fa bius the state should be filled with joy exulting in victory and occupied in thanksgivings and congratu lations  while at the same time he who had given occasion to the temples of the gods being thrown open their altars yet smoking with sacrifices and loaded with honors and offerings should be stripped naked and torn with stripes in the sight of the Roman peo ple within view of the capitol and citadel and of those gods whose aid he had so successfully invoked in two different battles With what temper would such proceedings be borne by the army which had conquered under his conduct and auspices  What mourning would there be in the Roman camp what joy among their enemies V This speech he accompa nied with an abundant flow of tears uniting re proaches and complaints imploring the aid both of gods and men and warmly embracing his son 34 On his side stood the majesty of the senate the 68 LIVY favor of the people the support of the tribunes and regard for the absent army On the other side were urged the inviolable authority of the Roman govern ment and military discipline  the edict of the dictator always observed as the mandate of a deity  nor was the severity of Manlius forgot and his postponing even parental affection to public utility  The same also said the dictator  was the conduct of Lucius Brutus the founder of Roman liberty in the case of his two sons But now such is the indulgence of fa thers and the easiness of temper in the aged that in this case of contempt of the dictatorial authority they indulge the young in the subversion of military order as if it were a matter of trifling consequence For his part however he would persevere in his purpose and would not remit the smallest part of the punishment justly due to a person who fought contrary to his orders while the rites of religion were imperfectly executed and the auspices uncertain Whether the majesty of the supreme authority was to be perpetual or not depended not on him  but Lucius Papirius would not diminish aught of its rights He wished that the tribunitian office inviolate itself would not by its interposition violate the authority of the Roman government nor the Roman people in his case par ticularly annihilate the dictator and the rights of the dictatorship together But if this should be the case not Lucius Papirius but the tribunes and the people would be blamed by posterity  though then too late when military discipline being once dis solved the soldier would no longer obey the orders of the centurion the centurion those of the tribune the tribune those of the lieutenant general the lien tenant general those of the consul nor the master of the horse those of the dictator No one would then pay any deference to men no nor even to the gods Neither edicts of generals nor auspices would be ob served The soldiers without leave or absence would straggle at random through the lands of friends and of foes and regardless of their oath would merely to HISTORY OF ROME â 59 BOOK  VIM gratify a wanton humor quit the service whenever they might choose The standards would be forsaken  the men would neither assemble in pursuance of orders nor attend to the difference of fighting by night or by day on favorable or unfavorable ground In a word military operations instead of the regularity esta blished under the sanction of a sacred solemnity would become like those of freebooters directed by chance and accident Render yourselves then tri bunes of the commons accountable for all these evils to all future ages Expose your own persons to these heavy imputations in defence of the licentious conduct of Quintus Fabius 35 The tribunes stood confounded and were now more anxiously concerned at their own situation than at his who sought their support when they were freed from this embarrassment by the Roman people una nimously having recourse to prayers and intreaties that the dictator would for their sakes remit the pu nishment of the master of the horse The tribunes likewise seeing the business take this turn followed the example earnestly beseeching the dictator to par don human error to consider the immaturity of the offender s age who had suffered sufficiently  and now the youth himself now his father Marcus Fabius dis claiming farther contest fell at the dictator s knees and deprecated his wrath Then the dictator after causing silence said  Romans it is well Military discipline has prevailed  the majesty of government has prevailed both which were in danger of ceasing this day to exist Quintus Fabius who fought con trary to the order of his commander is not acquitted of guilt but after being condemned as guilty is granted as a boon to the Roman people  is granted to the college of tribunes supporting him with their prayers not with the regular power of their office Live Quintus Fabius more happy in this union of all parts of the state for your preservation than in the victory in which you lately exulted Live after hav ing ventured on such an act as yoiy father himself 60 LIVY bad he been in the place of Lucius Papirius would not have pardoned With me you shall be recon ciled whenever you wish it To the Roman people to whom you owe your life you can perform no greater service than to let this day teach you the important lesson of submission to lawful commands both in war and peace He then declared that the master of the horse was at liberty to depart and as he retired from the rostrum the senate being greatly rejoiced and the people still more so gathered round him and escorted him on one hand commending the dictator on the other congratulating the master of the horse while all agreed in opinion that the authority of mili tary command was confirmed no less effectually in the instance of Quintus Fabius than in that of young Man lius It so happened that through the course of that year as often as the dictator left the army the Sarn nites were in motion but Marcus Valerius the lieu tenant general who commanded in the camp had Quintus Fabius before his eyes for an example not to fear any violence of the enemy so much as the unre lenting anger of the dictator so that when a body of his foragers fell into an ambuscade and were cut to pieces in disadvantageous ground it was generally believed that the lieutenant general could have given them assistance if he had not been held in dread by his rigorous orders The resentment which this ex cited helped to alienate the affections of the soldiery from the dictator  against whom they had been before incensed by his implacable behavior towards Quintus Fabius and from having granted him pardon at the intercession of the Roman people after he had refused it to their intreaties 36 The dictator prohibited Quintus Fabius from acting in any case as a magistrate conferred the com mand in the city on Lucius Papirius Crassus as master of the horse and then returned to the camp where his arrival brought neither any great joy to his coun trymen nor any degree of terror to the enemy  for on the day following either not knowing the dictator s HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 61 arrival or little regarding whether he were present or absent they marched out in order of battle Of such importance however was that single man Lucius Pa pirius that had the zeal of the soldiers seconded the dispositions of the commander no doubt was enter tained that an end might have been put that day to the war with the Samnites He chose the best possible position for his troops posted his body of reserve most judiciously and strengthened them with every advan tage which military skill could devise but the sol diers exerted no vigor and designedly kept from con quering in order to injure the reputation of their leader Of the Samnites however very many were slain and great numbers of the Romans wounded The experienced commander quickly perceived the cir cumstance which prevented his success and that it would be necessary to moderate his temper and to mingle mildness with austerity Accordingly attended by the lieutenants general he went round to the tents of the wounded soldiers inquiring of each the state of his health then mentioning them by name he gave them in charge to the officers tribunes and prefects recommending them to their particular care This be havior popular in itself he maintained with such dex terity that by his attention to their recovery he gra dually gained their affection nor did any thing so much contribute towards their recovery as the grati tude excited by this humane condescension As soon as the men were restored to health he came to an en gagement with the enemy and both himself and the troops being possessed with full confidence of success he so intirely defeated and dispersed the Samnites that they never after that day met the dictator in the field The victorious army afterwards directed its march wherever a prospect of booty invited and traversed their territories without a weapon being raised against them or any opposition given either openly or by stratagem It added to their alacrity that the dictator had by proclamation given the whole spoil to the soldiers so that they were animated not only by the 62 LIVY public quarrel but by their private emolument Thus reduced the Samnites sued to the dictator for peace and after they had engaged to supply each of his sol diers with a suit of clothes and a year s pay being ordered to apply to the senate they answered that they would follow the dictator committing their cause wholly to his integrity and honor On this the troops were withdrawn out of Samnium 37 A U C 431 B C 321 The dictator entered the city in triumph and though desirous of resigning his office immediately yet by order of the senate he held it until the consuls were elected these were Caius Sulpicius Longus a second time and Quintus jEmilius Cerretanus The Samnites without finishing the treaty of peace the terms being still in negotiation departed after concluding a truce for a year Nor was even that faithfully observed so strongly was their inclination for war excited on hearing that Papirius was gone out of office In this consulate of Caius Sulpicius and Quintus jEmilius some histories have Aulius to the revolt of the Samnites was added a new war with the Apulians Armies were sent against both The Sam nites fell by lot to Sulpicius the Apulians to iEmilius Some writers say that this war was not waged with the Apulians but in defence of the allied states of that na tion against the violence and injustice of the Samnites But the circumstances of the Samnites at that period when they were themselves engaged in a war which they could with difficulty support render it more pro bable that they did not make war on the Apulians but that both nations were in arms against the Romans at the same time However no memorable event oc curred The lands of the Apulians and Samnium were utterly laid waste but in neither quarter did the enemy show themselves At Rome an alarm which happened in the night suddenly roused the people from their sleep in such a fright that the capitol and citadel the walls and gates were all filled with men in arms But after they had called all to their posts and run together in bodies in every quarter when day ap HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII 63 peared neither the author nor cause of the alarm could be discovered This year in pursuance to the advice of Flavius a tribune of the commons the Tusculans were brought to a trial before the people He pro posed that punishment should be inflicted on those of the Tusculans  by whose advice and assistance the Veliternians and Privernians bad made war on the Roman people The Tusculans with their wives and children came to Rome  and in mourning habits like persons under accusation went round the tribes throw ing themselves at the feet of the citizens with humble supplications This excited a degree of compassion which operated more effectually towards procuring them pardon than all the arguments they could urge did towards clearing themselves of guilt Every one of the tribes except the Pollian negatived the propo sition The sentence of the Pollian tribe was that the grown up males should be beaten and put to death and their wives and children sold by auction accord ing to the rules of war It appears that the resent ment which arose against the advisers of so rigorous a measure was retained in memory by the Tusculans down to the age of our fathers  and that hardly any candidate of the Pollian tribe could ever since gain the votes of the Papirian 38 In the following year A U C 432 B C 320 which was the consulate of Quintus Fabius and Lucius Fulvius Aulus Cornelius Arvina being made dictator and Marcus Fabius Ambustus master of the horse troops were levied with greater exertion than ordinary under the apprehension of having a more powerful op position than usual to encounter in the war with the Samnites who it was reported had procured from their neighbors a number of young men for hire an army therefore of extraordinary force was sent against them Although in a hostile country their camp was pitched in as careless a manner as if the foe were at a great distance  when suddenly the legions of the Sam nites approached with so much boldness as to advance their rampart close to an outpost of the Romans Night 64 LIVY coming on prevented their assaulting the works but they did not conceal their intention of doing so next day as soon as the light should appear The dictator found that there would be a necessity for lighting sooner than he had expected and lest the situation should be an obstruction to the bravery of the troops he led away the legions in silence leaving a great num ber of fires the better to deceive the enemy The camps however lay so close together that he could not escape their observation their cavalry instantly pur sued and pressed closely on his troops yet refrained from attacking them until the day appeared Their infantry did not even quit their camp before daylight As soon as it was dawn the cavalry ventured to begin skirmishing and by harassing the Roman rear and pressing them in places of difficult passage consider ably delayed their march Meanwhile their infantry overtook their cavalry  and now the Samnites pursued close with their intire force The dictator then find ing that he could no longer go forward without great inconvenience ordered the spot where he stood to be measured out for a camp But it was impossible while the enemy s horse were spread about on every side that palisades could be brought and the work be begun seeing it therefore impracticable either to march forward or to settle himself there he drew up his troops for battle removing the baggage out of the line The enemy likewise formed their line opposite to his nowise inferior either in spirit or in strength Their courage was chiefly improved from not knowing that the motive of the Romans retreat was the ihcom modiousness of the ground so that they imagined themselves objects of terror and supposed that they were pursuing men who fled through fear This kept the balance of the fight equal for a considerable time  though of late it had been unusual with the Samnites to stand even the shout of a Roman army Certain it is that the contest on this day continued so very doubtful from the third hour to the eighth that nei ther was the shout repeated after being raised at the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII G5 first onset nor the standards moved either forward or backward nor any ground lost on either side They fought without taking breath every man in his post and pushing agaiust their opponents with their shields The Doise continuing equal and the terror of the fight the same seemed to denote that the decision would be effected either by fatigue or by the night The men had now exhausted their strength the sword its power and the leaders their skill when on a sudden the Samnite cavalry having learned from a single troop which had advanced beyond the rest that the baggage of the Romans lay at a distance from their army with out any guard or defence eager for booty they has tened to attack it of which the dictator being informed by a hasty messenger said  Let them alone  let them incumber themselves with spoils Afterwards came several one after another crying out that they were plundering and carrying off all the effects of the sol diers  he then called to him the master of the horse and said  Do you see Marcus Fabius that the ene my s cavalry have forsaken the fight  They are en tangled and incumbered with our baggage Attack them  you will find them as is the case of every mul titude employed in plundering scattered about few mounted on horseback few with swords in their hands and while they are loading their horses with spoil and unarmed put them to the sword and make it bloody spoil for them I will take care of the legions and the fight of the infantry yours be the honor which the horse shall acquire 39 The body of cavalry in the most exact order possible charging the enemy who were straggling and embarrassed filled every place with slaughter for the packages which they hastily threw down and which lay in the way of their feet and of the affrighted horses as they endeavored to escape made them unable either to fight or fly Then Fabius after he had almost in tirely cut off the enemy s horse led round his squadrons in a small circuit and attacked the infantry in the rear The new shout raised in that quarter terrified the Sam LIV VOL III E 66 LIVY nites on the one hand  and when on the other the dic tator saw tbeir troops in the van looking behind them their battalions in confusion and their line wavering he earnestly exhorted and animated his men calling on the tribunes and chief centurions by name to join him in renewing the fight Raising the shout anew they pressed forward and as they advanced perceived the enemy more and more confused The cavalry now could be seen by those in front and Cornelius turning about to the several companies made them understand by raising his voice and hands that he saw the standards and bucklers of his own horsemen On hearing which and at the same time seeing them they at once so far forgot the fatigue which they had endured through al most the whole day and even their wounds that they rushed to the fray with as much vigor and alacrity as if they were coming fresh out of camp on receiving the signal for battle The Samnites could no longer sustain the charge of horse and foot together part of them inclosed on both sides were cut off the rest separated and fled different ways The infantry slew those who were surrounded and made resistance  and the cavalry made great havoc of the fugitives among whom fell their general This battle crushed at length the power of the Samnites so effectually that in all their meetings they expressed so much discontent and said  it was not at all to be wondered at if in an im pious war commenced in violation of a treaty when the gods were with justice more incensed against them than men none of their undertakings prospered They were not to expect the crime for such an infraction of treaties must be held to be expiated and atoned for without a heavy penalty The only alternative they had was whether the penalty should be the guilty blood of a few or the innocent blood of all Some now ventured to name the authors of the war among whom was particularly mentioned Brutulus Papius he was a man of power and noble birth and undoubt edly the cause of the late rupture The pretors being compelled to take the opinion of the assembly concern HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK VIII G ing him a decree was made  that Brutulus Papius should be delivered into the hands of the Romans and that together with him all the spoil taken from the Romans and the prisoners should be sent to Rome and that the restitution demanded by the heralds in conformity to treaty should be made as was agreeable to justice and equity In pursuance of this determi nation heralds were sent to Rome and also the dead body of Brutulus for by a voluntary death he avoided the punishment and ignominy intended for him It was thought proper that his goods also should be de livered up along with the body But none of all those things were accepted except the prisoners and such articles of the spoil as were recognised by the owners The dictator obtained a triumph by a decree of the senate 40 Some writers affirm that the consuls had the con duct of this war and that they triumphed over the Sam nites and also that Fabius advanced into Apulia and carried off from thence abundance of spoil But that Aulus Cornelius was dictator that year is an undis puted fact The question then is whether he was ap pointed for the purpose of conducting the war or on occasion of the illness of Lucius Plautius the pretor in order that there might be a magistrate to give the signal for the starting of the chariots at the Roman games This latter is asserted of him  and that after performing the business which in truth reflected no great lustre on his office he resigned the dictatorship It is not easy to determine between either the facts or the writers which of them deserves the preference  I am persuaded that history has been much corrupted by means of funeral panegyrics and false inscriptions on monuments each family striving by false representa tions to appropriate to itself the fame of warlike ex ploits and public honors From this cause certainly much confusion has taken place both in the memoirs of individuals and in the public records of events Nor is there extant any writer contemporary with those events on whose authority we can with certainty rely 68 LIVY BOOK IX Chap 1 The year following A U C 433 B C 319 was distinguished by the convention of Caudium so memorable on account of the misfortune of the Ro mans The consuls of the year were Titus Veturins Calvinus and Spurius Postumius The Samnites were that year commanded by Caius Pontius son to Heren nius born of a father most highly renowned for wis dom and himself a consummate warrior and com mander When the ambassadors who had been sent to offer restitution returned without concluding a peace he said in an assembly  that you may not think that no purpose has been effected by this embassy be assured that whatever degree of anger the deities of heaven had conceived against us on account of the in fraction of the treaty has been hereby expiated I am very confident that whatever deities they were whose will it was that you should be reduced to the necessity of making restitution it was not agreeable to them that our atonement for the breach of treaty should be so haughtily spurned by the Romans for what more could possibly be done towards appeasing the gods and softening the anger of man than we have done The effects of the enemy taken among the spoils which appeared to be our own by the right of war we re stored  the authors of the war as we could not deliver them up alive we delivered to them dead  their goods we carried to Rome lest by retaining them any degree of guilt should remain among us What more Roman do I owe to thee what to the treaty what to the gods the guarantees of the treaty  What umpire shall I call in to judge of your resentment and of my punishment  I decline none neither nation nor private person But if the weak is not to find protection against a stronger in human laws I will appeal to the gods the avengers of intolerable arrogance and will beseech them to turn their wrath against those who are not satisfied by the HISTORY OF ROME G J â BOOK IX restoration of their own nor by additional neaps of other men s property  whose inhuman rage is not sati ated by the death of the guilty by the surrender of their lifeless bodies and by their goods accompanying the surrender of the owner who cannot be appeased otherwise than by giving them our blood to drink and our entrails to be torn Samnites war is just when it becomes necessary and arms are clear of impiety when men have no hope left but in arms Wherefore as the issue of every human undertaking depends chiefly on men s acting either with or without the favor of the gods be assured that the former wars you waged in opposition to the gods more than to men  in this which we are now to undertake you will act under the im mediate guidance of the gods themselves  2 After uttering these predictions not more favor able than true he led out the troops and placed his camp about Caudium as much out of view as possible From thence he sent to Calatia where he heard that the Roman consuls were encamped ten soldiers in the habit of shepherds and ordered them to keep some cattle feeding in several different places at a small dis tance from the Roman posts and that when they fell in with any of their foragers they should all agree in the same story that the legions of the Samnites were then in Apulia besieging Luceria with their whole force and very near becoming masters of it Such a rumor had been industriously spread before and had already reached the Romans but these prisoners caused them to give it greater credit especially as they all concurred in the same report The Romans did not hesitate to resolve on carrying succor to the Lucerians because they were good and faithful allies  and for this farther reason lest all Apulia through apprehension of the impending danger might go over to the enemy The only point which came under deliberation was by what road they should go There were two roads lead ing to Luceria one along the coast of the upper sea wide and open  but as it was the safer so it was pro portionably longer the other which was shorter 70 LIVY through the Caudine forks The nature of the place is this there are two deep glens narrow and covered with wood connected together by mountains ranging on both sides from one to the other between these lies a plain of considerable extent abounding in grass and water and through the middle of which the passage runs but before this is arrived at the first defile must be passed while the only way back is through the road by which it was entered  or if in case of resolving to proceed forward it must be by the other glen which is still more narrow and difficult Into this plain the Romans marched down their troops by one of those passes through the cleft of a rock and when they ad vanced to the other defile found it blocked up by trees thrown across with a mound of huge stones The stratagem of the enemy now became apparent and at the same time a body of troops was seen on the emi nence over the glen Hastening back then to the road by which they had entered they found that also shut up by such another fence and men in arms Then without orders they halted  amazement took possession of their minds and a strange kind of numbness of their limbs they then remained a long time motionless and silent with their eyes fixed on each other as if each thought the other more capable of judging and advising than himself After some time the consul s pavilions were erected and they got ready the implements for throwing up works although they were sensible that it must appear ridiculous to attempt raising a fortification in their present desperate condition and when almost every hope was lost Yet not to add a fault to their misfortunes they all without being advised or ordered by any one set earnestly to work and inclosed a camp with a rampart close to the water while themselves besides enduring the haughty taunts of their enemies seemed with melancholy to acknowlege the apparent fruitlessness of their labor The lieutenants general and tribunes without being summoned to consultation for there was no room for either consultation or re medy assembled round the dejected consul while the HISTORY OF ROME â 71 BOOK IX soldiers crowding to the general s quarters demanded from their leaders that succor which it was hardly in the power of the immortal gods themselves to afford them 3 Night came on while they were employed in la menting their situation all urging with warmth what ever their several tempers prompted Some crying out  Let us go over those fences which ohstruct the roads others  over the steeps through the woods any way where arms can be carried Let us be but permitted to come to the enemy whom we have been used to conquer now near thirty years All places will be level and plain to a Roman fighting against the per fidious Samnite Another would say  Whither or by what way can we go Do we expect to remove the mountains from their foundations While these cliffs hang over us how can we proceed Whether armed or unarmed brave or dastardly we are all without dis tinction captured and vanquished The enemy will not even show us a weapon by which we might die with honor He will finish the war without moving from his seat In such discourse thinking of neither food nor rest they passed the whole night Nor could the Samnites though in circumstances so accordant to their wishes instantly determine how to act it was therefore universally agreed that Herennius Pontius father of the general should be consulted by letter He was now grown feeble through age and had withdrawn himself not only from all military but also from all civil occu pations  yet notwithstanding the decline of his bodily strength his mind retained its full vigor When he was informed that the Roman armies were shut up at the Caudine forks between the two glens and was asked for advice by his son s messenger he gave his opinion that they should all be immediately dismissed from thence unhurt On this counsel being rejected and the same messenger returning to advise with him a second time he recommended that they should all to a man be put to death On receiving these answers so opposite to each other like the ambiguous responses 72 LIVY of an oracle his son although as well as others per suaded that the powers of his father s mind together with those of his body had been impaired by age was yet prevailed on by the general desire of all to send for him and consult him in person The old man we are told complied without reluctance and was carried in a waggon to the camp where when he came to speak he made no alteration in the opinions which he had given only added the reasons on which he founded them That  by his first plan which he esteemed the best he meant by an act of extraordinary kindness to establish perpetual peace a nd friendship with a most powerful nation by the other to put off the return of war to the distance of many ages during which the Ro man state after the loss of those two armies could not easily recover its strength A third plan there was not His son and the other chiefs then asking him if  a plan of a middle kind might not be adopted  of dis missing them unhurt and at the same time by the right of war imposing terms on them as vanquished â That indeed said he  is a plan of such a nature as neither procures friends nor removes enemies Only consider who they are whom you would irritate by ignominious treatment The Romans are a race who know not how to sit down quiet under defeat any scar which the present necessity shall imprint in their breasts will rankle there for ever and will not suffer them to rest until they have wreaked manifold ven geance on your heads Neither of these plans was approved and Herennius was carried home 4 In the other camp the Romans having tried many fruitless efforts to force a passage and being now des titute of every means of subsistence were reduced by necessity to send ambassadors who were first to ask peace on equal terms which if they did not obtain they were to challenge the enemy to battle To this Pontius answered that  the war was at an end  and since even in their present vanquished and captive state they were not willing to make acknowlegement of their situation he would send them under the yoke HISTORY OF ROME BOOK IX 73 unarmed and only partly clothed  that the other con ditions of peace should be such as were just and pro per between the conquerors and the conquered Their troops must depart and their colonies be withdrawn out of the territories of the Samnites  and for the fu ture the Romans and Samnites under a treaty of equality shall live according to their own respective laws On these terms he was ready to negotiate with the consuls  and if any of these should not be accepted he forbade the ambassadors to come to him again When the result of this embassy was made known such general lamentation suddenly arose and such melancholy took possession of every mind that had they been told that all were to die on the spot they could not have felt deeper affliction Silence con tinued a long time the consuls not being able to utter a word either in favor of a treaty so disgraceful or against a treaty so necessary  at length Lucius Lentu lus who was the first among the lieutenants general both in respect of bravery and of the public honors which he had attained addressed them thus  Con suls I have often heard my father say that he was the only person in the capitol who did not advise the senate to ransom the state from the Gauls with gold  and this he would not concur in because they had not been inclosed with a trench and rampart by the enemy who were remarkably slothful with respect to works and raising fortifications and because they might sally forth if not without great danger yet without certain destruction Now if in like manner as they had it in their power to run down from the capitol in arms against their foe as men besieged have often sal lied out on the besiegers it were possible for us to come to blows either on equal or unequal ground the advice which I should give would not be devoid of the same spirit which animated my father I acknowlege indeed that death in defence of our country is highly glorious  and I am ready either to devote myself for the Roman people and the legions or to plunge into the midst of the enemy But in this spot I behold my 74 LIVY country in this spot the whole of the Roman legions and unless these choose to rush on death for their own gratification what is there which can be preserved by their death The houses of the city some may say and the walls of it and the crowd who dwell in it But in fact in case of the destruction of this army all these are given up to ruin instead of being saved from it for who will protect them  An unwarlike and un armed multitude shall I suppose Yes just as they defended them against the attack of the Gauls Will they call to their succor an army from Veii with Ca millus at its head  Here on the spot I repeat are all our hopes and strength by preserving which we preserve our country  by delivering them up to death we abandon and betray it But a surrender is shame ful and ignominious True  but such ought to be out affection for our country that we should save it by our own disgrace if necessity required as freely as by our death Let us therefore undergo that indignity bow great soever and submit to that necessity to which even the gods themselves are seen to yield Go con suls ransom the state for arms which your ancestors ransomed with gold 5 The consuls accordingly went to Pontius to con fer with him and when he talked in the strain of a conqueror of a treaty they declared that such could not be concluded without an order of the people nor without the ministry of the heralds and the other cus tomary rites So that the Caudine peace was not rati fied by settled treaty as is commonly believed and even asserted by Claudius in his history but by con vention wherein the parties became sureties For what occasion would there be either for sureties or hostages in the former case where the ratification is performed by the imprecation  that whichever nation shall give occasion to the said terms being violated may Jupiter strike that nation in like manner as the swine is struck by the heralds The consuls lieute nants general questors and military tribunes became sureties and the names of all these are extant in the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 75 convention  where had the business been transacted by treaty none would have appeared but those of the two heralds On account of the necessary delay be fore a peace could be concluded it was also insisted on that six hundred horsemen should be given as hos tages who were to suffer death if the compact were not fulfilled a time was then fixed for delivering up the hostages and sending away the troops disarmed The return of the consuls renewed the general grief in the camp insomuch that the men hardly refrained from offering violence to them  by whose rashness they said  they had been brought into such a situa tion  and through whose cowardice they were likely to depart with greater disgrace than they came They had employed no guide who knew the country nor scouts to explore it but went on blindly like beasts into a pitfall They cast looks of distraction on each other viewed earnestly the arms which they must pre sently surrender while their persons would be subject to the will of the enemy  figured to themselves the hostile yoke the scoffs of the conquerors their haughty looks and finally thus disarmed their march through the midst of an armed foe In a word they saw with horror the miserable journey of their dishonored band through the cities of the allies and their return into their own country to their parents whither themselves and their ancestors had so often come in triumph ob serving that  they alone had been conquered without a fight without a weapon thrown without a wound  that they had not been permitted to draw their swords against the enemy In vain had arms in vain had strength in vain had courage been given them While they were giving vent to such grievous reflec tions the fatal hour of their disgrace arrived which was to render every circumstance still more shocking in fact than they had preconceived it in their imagina tions First they were ordered to go out beyond the rampart unarmed and with single garments then the hostages were surrendered and carried into custody the lictors were next commanded to depart from the 76 LIVV consuls and the robes of the latter were stripped off This excited such a degree of commiseration in the breasts of those very men who a little before were pouring execrations on them that everyone forgetting his ovvu condition turned away his eyes from that dis graceful insult on so high a dignity as from a spectacle too horrid to behold 6 First the consuls nearly half naked were sent under the yoke  then each officer according to his rank was exposed to disgrace and the same of the le gions successively The enemy stood on each side under arms reviling and mocking them  swords were pointed at most of them  several were wounded and some even slain when their looks rendered too fierce by the indignity to which they were subjected gave offence to the conquerors Thus were they led under the yoke and what was still more intolerable under the eyes of the enemy When they had got clear of the defile they seemed as if they had been drawn up from the infernal regions and then for the first time beheld the light yet wheu they viewed the ignomini ous appearance to which the army was reduced the light itself was more painful to them than any kind of death could have been  so that although they might have arrived at Capua before night yet doubting the fidelity of the allies and embarrassed by shame they halted at a small distance from that city They stood in need of every kind of refreshment yet threw them selves carelessly on the ground on each side of the road which being told at Capua compassion for the situation of their allies took place of the arrogance na tural to the Campanians They immediately sent to the consuls their ensigns of office the fasces and lie tors  to the soldiers arms horses clothes and provi sions in abundance  and on their approach the whole senate and people went out to meet them and per formed every proper office of hospitality both public and private But the looks and address of the allies joined with all their kindness could not draw a word from them nor even prevail on them to raise their HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 77 eyes so deeply were they affected by shame and grief that they shunned the conversation of these their friends Next day when some young nobles who had been sent from Capua to escort them on their road to the frontiers of Campania returned they were called into the senate house and in answer to the inquiries of the elder members said that  to them they seemed deeply sunk in melancholy and dejection  that the whole body moved on in silence almost as if they were dumb  the former genius of the Romans was struck mute and that their spirit had been taken from them together with their arms Not one gave answer to those who saluted them  as if through fear they were unable to utter a word and that their necks still carried the yoke under which they had been sent That the Samnites had obtained a victory not only glorious but lasting for they had subdued not Rome merely as the Gauls had formerly done but what was a much more warlike achievement the Roman cou rage These discourses were attentively listened to and lamentations made in this assembly of faithful al lies as if the Roman name were almost extinct We are told that Ofilius Calavius son of Ovius a man highly distinguished both by his birth and conduct and at this time farther respectable on account of his age declared that he entertained a very different opi nion in the case  This obstinate silence said he  those eyes fixed on the earth  those ears deaf to all comfort with the shame of beholding the light are indications of a mind calling forth from its inmost re cesses the utmost exertions of resentment Either he was ignorant of the temper of the Romans or that si lence would shortly excite among the Samnites la mentable cries and groans for that the remembrance of the Caudine peace would be much more sorrowful to the Samnites than to the Romans Each side would have their own native spirit wherever they should happen to engage but the Samnites would not every where have the glens of Caudium 7 People at Rome were by this time informed of 78 LIVY the disaster which had hefallen them At first they heard that the troops were shut up afterwards the news of the ignominious peace arrived  and this caused greater affliction than had been felt for their danger On the report of their being surrounded a levy of men was begun  but when it was understood that the army had surrendered in so disgraceful a manner the pre parations were laid aside and immediately without any public directions a general mourning took place with all the various demonstrations of grief The shops were shut and all business ceased in the forum by common consent without any order for that purpose being issued Ornamented dresses1 were laid aside and the public were in greater tribulation if possible than the vanquished themselves they were not only enraged against the commanders the advisers and sure ties of the peace but were filled with detestation even of the unoffending soldiers and asserted that they ought not to be admitted into the city But these transports of passion were allayed by the arrival of the troops in a state so deplorable as was sufficient to convert even anger into compassion for they came into the city not like men returning into their coun try with unexpected safety but in the habit and with the looks of captives late in the evening and they hid themselves so closely in their houses that for the next and several following days not one of them could bear to come in sight of the forum or of the public The consuls shut up in private transacted no official business except that they were compelled by a decree of the senate to nominate a dictator to preside at the elections They nominated Quintus Fabius Ambustus and as master of the horse Publius JElius Paetus But some irregularity being discovered in their ap 1 In the original lati clavi The latns clavus was a tunic or vest ornamented with a broad stripe of purple on the fore part worn by the senators  the knights wore a similar one only ornamented with a narrower stripe Gold rings were also used as badges of distinction the common people wore iron ones HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 79 pointment there was substituted in their room Marcus yEmilius Papus dictator and Lucius Valerius Flac cus master of the horse But neither did these hold the elections and the people being dissatisfied with all the magistrates of that year an interregnum en sued The office of interrex was held by Quintus Fa bius Maximus afterwards by Marcus Valerius Cor vus who elected consuls Quintus Publilius Philo and Lucius Papirius Cursor a second time A U C 434 B C 318 a choice universally approved for there were no commanders at that time of higher reputation 8 They entered into office immediately on being elected for so it had been determined by the fathers When the customary decrees of the senate were passed they proposed the consideration of the Caudine peace and Publilius whose duty it was to open the business said  Spurius Postumius speak He arose with just the same countenance with which he had passed under the yoke and delivered himself to this effect  Con suls doubtless I am to be called up first with marked ignominy not with honor and am ordered to speak not as being a senator but as a person who has to an swer for an unsuccessful war and disgraceful peace However the question propounded by you is not con cerning our guilt or our punishment waving there fore a defence which would not be very difficult before men who are not unacquainted with the casualties to which mankind are subject I shall briefly state my opinion on the matter in question which opinion will testify whether I was actuated by tenderness to myself or to your legions when I engaged as surety to the convention be it of what kind it may whether disho norable or necessary  by which however the Roman people are not bound inasmuch as it was concluded without their order nor is any thing liable to be for feited to the Samnites in consequence of it except our persons Let us then be delivered up to them by the heralds naked and in chains Let us free the people of the religious obligation if we have bound them un der any such so that there may be no restriction 80 LI VY divine or human to prevent your entering on the war anew without violating the maxims of religion and justice I am also of opinion that the consuls in the mean time enlist arm and lead out an army but that they should not enter the enemy s territories before every particular respecting the surrender of us be re gularly executed And O immortal gods I pray and beseech you that although it has not been your will that Spurius Postumins and Titus Veturius in the of fice of consuls should wage war with success against the Samnites you may yet deem it sufficient to have seen us sent under the yoke to have seen us bound under an infamous convention to have seen us shackled and delivered into the hands of our foes taking on our own heads the whole weight of the enemy s resentment And grant that the consuls and legions of Rome may meet the same fortune in war against the Samnites which has attended them in every war before we be came consuls On his concluding this speech men s minds were so impressed with admiration and compas sion that they could scarce believe him to be the same Spurius Postumius who had been the author of so shameful a peace  lamenting at the same time that such a man was likely to undergo among the enemy a punishment even beyond that of others through the desire of annulling the peace All the members show ing tenderness towards him expressed their approba tion of his sentiments when Lucius Livius and Quintus Majlius being tribunes of the commons attempted for a time to stop the proceeding by a protest insisting that  the people could not be acquitted of the religious obligation from the consuls being given up unless all things were restored to the same state in which they had been at Caudium nor had they themselves de served any punishment for having by becoming sure ties to the peace preserved the army of the Roman people nor finally could they being sacred and in violable be surrendered to the enemy or treated with violence 9 To this Postumius replied  In the mean time HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 81 surrender us as unsanctified persons which you may do without offence to religion those sacred and in violable personages the tribunes you will deliver up as soon as they go out of office  but if you listen to me they will be first scourged with rods here in the Comitium by way of interest for their punishment on account of the delay of payment for as to their de nying that the people are acquitted of the religious obligation by our being given up who is there so ignorant of the laws of the heralds as not to know that those men speak in that manner to prevent themselves from being surrendered rather than because the case is really so Still I do not deny conscript fathers that compacts on sureties given are as sacred as trea ties in the eyes of all who regard faith between men with the same reverence which is paid to duties re specting the gods  but I insist that without the order of the people nothing can be ratified that is to bind the people Suppose that out of the same arrogance with which the Samnites forced from us the convention in question they had compelled us to repeat the esta blished form of words for the surrendering of cities would you tribunes say that the Roman people had surrendered  and that this city these temples and consecrated grounds these lands and waters were be come the property of the Samnites I say no more of the surrender because our having become sureties is the point insisted on Now suppose we had become sureties that the Roman people should quit this city that they should set it on fire  that they should have no magistrates no senate no laws  that they should in future be ruled by kings  the gods forbid you say But the enormity of the articles lessens not the obliga tion of a compact If the people can be bound in any one instance it can in all Nor is there any impor tance in another circumstance which weighs perhaps with some whether a consul a dictator or a pretor be the surety And this indeed was the judgment even of the Samnites themselves who were not satis fied with the security of the consuls but compelled LIV VOL ill F LIVY the lieutenant generals questors and military tribunes to join them Let it not then be demanded of me why I entered into such a compact when do such power was lodged in a consul and when I could not either to them insure a peace of which I could not command the ratification  or in behalf of you who had given me no powers Conscript fathers none of the transactions at Caudium were directed by human wisdom The immortal gods deprived of understanding both your generals and those of the enemy On the one side we acted not with sufficient caution  on the other they threw away a victory which through our folly they had obtained while they hardly confided in the places by means of which they had conquered but were in haste on any terms to take arms out of the hands of men who were born to arms Had their reason been sound would it have been difficult during the time which they spent in sending for old men from home to give them advice to send ambassadors to Rome and to negotiate a peace and treaty with the senate and with the people It would have been a journey of only three days to expeditious travellers In the interim matters might have rested under a truce that is until their ambassadors should have brought from Rome either certain victory or peace That would have been really a compact on the faith of sureties for we should have become sureties by order of the people But neither would you have passed such an order nor should we have pledged our faith  nor was it the will of fate that the affair should have any other issue than that they should be vainly mocked with a dream as it were of greater prosperity than their minds were capable of comprehending and that the same fortune which had entangled our army should effectuate its deliverance  that an ineffectual victory should be suc ceeded by a more effectual peace  and that a conven tion on the faith of a surety should be introduced which bound no other person besides the surety for what part had you conscript fathers what part had the people in this affair Who can call on you  Who can say that he has been deceived by you i Can the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 83 enemy  Can a citizen  To the enemy you engaged nothing You ordered no citizen to engage on yonr behalf You are therefore no way concerned either with us to whom you gave no commission  nor with the Samnites with whom you transacted no business We are sureties to the Samnites  debtors whose abili ties are sufficiently extensive over that which is our own over that which we can offerâ our bodies and our minds On these let them exercise their cruelty against these let them whet their resentment and their swords As to what relates to the tribunes you will consider whether the delivering them up can be imme diately effected or if it must be deferred to another day Meanwhile let us Titus Veturius and the rest concerned offer our worthless persons as atonements for the non performanco of our engagements and by our sufferings liberate the Roman armies 10 These arguments and still more the person by whom they were delivered powerfully affected the se nators  as they did likewise every one not excepting even the tribunes of the commons who declared that they would be directed by the senate They then in stantly resigned their office and were delivered toge ther with the rest to the heralds to be conducted to Caudium On passing this decree of senate it seemed as if some new light had shone on the state Postu mius was in every mouth  they extolled him to hea ven  and pronounced him to have equalled in glory even the consul Publins Decius who devoted him self  Through his counsel and exertions they said  the republic had raised up its head after being sunk in an ignominious peace He now offered himself to the enemy s rage and to torments and was suffering in atonement for the Roman people All turned their thoughts towards arms and war and the general cry was  When shall we be permitted with arms in our hands to meet the Samnites While the state glowed with resentment and rancor the levies were composed almost intirely of volunteers Legions composed of the former soldiers were quickly formed and an army 84 LJW marched to Caudium The heralds who went before on coming to the gate ordered the sureties of the peace to be stripped of their clothes and their hands to be tied behind their backs As the apparitor out of re spect to his dignity was binding Postumius in a loose manner  Nay said he  draw the cord tight that the surrender may be regularly performed Then when they came into the assembly of the Samnites and to the tribunal of Pontius Aulus Cornelius Arvina a herald pronounced these words   Forasmuch as these men here present without orders from the Roman peo ple the Quirites entered into surety that a treaty should be made whereby they have rendered them selves criminal now in order that the Roman people may be freed from the crime of impiety I here sur render these men into your hands On the herald saying thus Postumius gave him a stroke on the thigh with his knee as forcibly as he could and said with a loud voice that  he was now a citizen of Samnium the other a Roman ambassador that the herald had been by him violently ill treated contrary to the law of nations  and that the people he represented would therefore have the more justice on their side in the war which they were about to wage 11 Pontius then said  Neither will I accept such a surrender nor will the Samnites deem it valid Spu rius Postumius if you believe that there are gods why do you not undo all that has been done or fulfil your agreement The Samnite nation is intitled either to all the men whom it had in its power or in stead of them to a peace But why do I make a de mand on yon who with as much regard to faith as you are able to show return yourself a prisoner into the hands of the conqueror I make the demand on the Roman people If they are dissatisfied with the convention made at the Caudine forks let them re place the legions within the defile where they were pent up Let there be no deception on either side Let all that has been done pass as nothing Let them re ceive again the arms which they surrendered by the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 85 convention  let them return into their camp What ever they were in possession of the day before the con ference let them possess again Then let war and resolute counsels be adopted Then let the conven tion and peace be rejected Let us carry on the war in the same circumstances and situations in which we were before peace was mentioned Let neither the Roman people blame the convention of the consuls nor us the faith of the Roman people Will you never want an excuse for violating the compacts which you make on being defeated  You gave hostages to Por sena you clandestinely got them back You ran somed your state from the Gauls for gold  while they were receiving the gold they were put to the sword You concluded a peace with us on condition of our restoring your captured legions that peace you now annul in fine you always spread over your fraudu lent conduct some show of right Do the Roman peo ple disapprove of their legions being saved by an igno minious peace Let them take back their peace and return the captured legions to the conqueror This would be conduct consistent with faith with treaties and with the laws of the heralds But that you should in consequence of the convention obtain what you de sired the safety of so many of your countrymen while I obtain not what I stipulated for on sending you back those men a peace is this the law which you Aulus Cornelius which you heralds prescribe to nations But for my part I neither accept those men whom you pretend to surrender nor consider them as surren dered  nor do I hinder them from returning into their own country which stands bound under an actual con vention carrying with them the wrath of all the gods whose authority is thus despised Wage war since Spurius Postumius has just now struck with his knee the herald in character of ambassador The gods are to believe that Postumius is a citizen of Samnium not of Rome  and that a Roman ambassador has been vio lated by a Samnite  and that therefore you have just grounds for a war against us That men of years and 86 LIVY of consular dignity should not be ashamed to exhibit such mockery of religion in the face of day and should have recourse to such shallow artifices to pal liate their breach of faith as not even children would allow themselves  Go lictor take off the bonds from those Romans Let no one hinder them to depart when they think proper Accordingly they returned unhurt from Caudium to the Roman camp having ac quitted certainly their own faith and perhaps that of the public  12 The Samnites finding that instead of peace which flattered their pride the war was revived and with the utmost inveteracy not only felt in their minds a foreboding of all the consequences which ensued but saw them in a manner before their eyes They now too late and in vain applauded the plans of old Pon tius by blundering between which they had exchanged a certainty of victory for an uncertain peace  and were now to fight against men whom they might have either put out of the way for ever as enemies or en gaged for ever as friends And such was the change which had taken place in men s minds since the Cau dine peace even before any trial of strength had shown an advantage on either side that Postumius by sur rendering himself had acquired greater renown among the Romans than Pontius among the Samnites by his bloodless victory The Romans considered their being at liberty to make war as certain victory while the Samnites supposed the Romans victorious the moment they resumed their arms Meanwhile the Satricans revolted to the Samnites who attacked the colony of Fregellae by a sudden surprise in the night accom panied as it appears by the Satricans From that time until day their mutual fears kept both parties quiet the daylight was the signal for battle which the Fregellans contrived to maintain for a considerable time without loss of ground  for they fought for their religion and liberty  and the multitude who were unfit to bear arms assisted them from the tops of the houses At length a stratagem gave the advantage to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 87 the assailants a crier was heard proclaiming that  whoever laid down his arms might retire in safety This relaxed their eagerness in the fight and they began almost every where to avail themselves of it A part more determined however retaining their arms rnshed out by the opposite gate and found greater safety in their boldness than the others from the cre dulity inspired by their fears  for the Samnites sur rounded the latter with fires and burned them all to death while they made vain appeals to the faith of gods and men The consuls having settled the pro vinces between them Papirius proceeded into Apulia to Luceria where the Roman horsemen given as host ages to Caudium were kept in custody  Publilius remained in Samnium to oppose the Caudine legions This proceeding perplexed the minds of the Samnites  they could not safely determine either to go to Luceria lest the enemy should press on their rear  or to remain where they were lest in the mean time Luceria should be lost They concluded therefore that it would be most advisable to trust to the decision of fortune and to try the issue of a battle with Publilius accordingly they drew out their forces into the field 13 When Publilius was about to engage he thought it proper to address his soldiers and accordingly he ordered an assembly to be summoned But though they ran together to the general s quarters with the greatest alacrity yet so loud were their clamors de manding the fight that none of the general s exhorta tions were heard each man s own reflections on the late disgrace were sufficient to determine them They advanced therefore to battle urging the standard bearers to hasten and lest in beginning the conflict there should be any delay by reason that javelins were less easily wielded than swords they threw away the former as if a signal to that purpose had been given and drawing the latter rushed in full speed on the foe The general had little opportunity of showing his skill in forming ranks or reserves the ungoverned troops performed all with a degree of fury little inferior to 88 LIVY madness The enemy therefore were completely routed not even daring to retreat to their camp but dis persing made the best of their way towards Apulia afterwards however they collected their forces into one body and came to Luceria The same exaspera tion which had carried the Romans through the midst of the enemy s line carried them forward also into their camp where greater carnage was made and more blood spilt than even in the field while the greater part of the spoil was destroyed in their rage The other army with the consul Papirius had now arrived at Arpi on the sea coast having passed with out molestation through all the countries in their way  which was owing to the ill treatment received by those people from the Samnite s and their hatred towards them rather than to any favor received from the Ro man people  for such of the Samnites as dwelt on the mountains used to ravage the low lands and the places on the coast and being savage themselves despised the husbandmen who were of a gentler kind Now the people of this tract had they been favorably affected towards the Samnites could either have prevented the Roman army from coming to Arpi or as they lay be tween Rome and Arpi could by intercepting the con voys of provisions have caused such scarcity of every necessary as would have been fatal Even as it was when they went from thence to Luceria both the be siegers and the besieged were distressed equally by want Every kind of supplies was brought to the Romans from Arpi but in a very scanty proportion the horsemen carrying corn from thence to the camp in little bags for the foot who were employed in the outposts watches and works and these sometimes falling in with parties of the enemy when they were obliged to throw the corn from off their horses in order to fight With respect to the Samnites before the arrival of the other consul and his victorious army provisions and reinforcements had been brought in to them from the mountains but the coming of Publilius strengthened the Romans in every part for committing the siege to the care of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 89 his colleague and keeping himself disengaged he threw every difficulty in the way of the enemy s con voys There heing therefore little hope for the be sieged or that they would be able much longer to en dure want the Samnites encamped at Luceria were obliged to collect their forces from every side and come to an engagement with Papirius 14 At this juncture while both parties were pre paring for an action ambassadors from the Tarentines interposed requiring both Samnites and Romans to desist from war with menaces that  if either refused to agree to a cessation of hostilities they would join their arms with the other party against them Papirius on hearing the purport of their embassy as if their words had made some impression on him answered that he would consult his colleague he then sent for him employing the intermediate time in the neces sary preparations and when he had conferred with him on a matter on which they were at no loss how to determine he made the signal for battle While the consuls were employed in performing the religious rites and the other usual business preparatory to an engagement the Tarentine ambassadors put them selves in their way expecting an answer to whom Papirius said  Tarentines the priest reports that the auspices are favorable and that our sacrifices have been attended with excellent omens  under the direc tion of the gods we are proceeding as you see to ac tion He then ordered the standards to move and led out the troops  thus rebuking the exorbitant arrogance of that nation which at a time when through intestine discord and sedition it was unequal to the manage ment of its own affairs yet presumed to prescribe the bounds of peace and war to others On the other side the Samnites who had neglected every preparation for fighting either because they were really desirous of peace or found it their interest to pretend to he so in order to conciliate the favor of the Tarentines when they saw on a sudden the Romans drawn up for battle cried out that  they would continue to be directed by 90 LIVY the Tarentines and would neither march out nor carry their arms beyond the rampart That they would rather endure any consequence which might ensue than show contempt to the recommendation of the Ta rentines The consuls said that  they embraced the omen and prayed that the enemy might continue in the resolution of not even defending their rampart Then dividing the forces between them they advanced to the works and making an assault on every side at once while some filled up the trenches others tore down the rampart and tumbled it into the trench All were stimulated not only by their native courage but by the resentment which since their disgrace bad been festering in their breasts They made their way into the camp where every one repeating that here was not Caudium nor the forks nor the impass able glens where cunning haughtily triumphed over error  but Roman valor which no rampart nor trench could ward off â they slew without distinction those who resisted and those who fled the armed and unarmed freemen and slaves young and old men and cattle Nor would any one have escaped had not the consuls given the signal for retreat and partly by commands partly by threats forced the soldiers out of the camp where they were greedily indulging themselves in slaughter As they were highly incensed at being thus interrupted a speech was immediately addressed to them assuring the soldiers that  the consuls neither did nor would fall short of any one of the soldiers in hatred towards the enemy  on the contrary as they led the way in battle so would they have done the same in executing unbounded vengeance had not their inclinations been restrained by the consideration of the six hundred horsemen who where confined as hostages in Luceria for it was feared that the Sam nites through despair might be hurried on blindly to take cruel revenge on them before they perished themselves The soldiers highly applauded the con sul s conduct rejoiced that their resentment had been checked and acknowleged that every thing ought to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 91 be endured rather than that so many Roman youths of the first distinction should be brought into danger 15 The assembly being then dismissed a consulta tion was held whether they should press forward the siege of Luceria with all their forces or whether one of the commanders and his army should make trial of the dispositions of the rest of the Apulians which were still doubtful The consul Publilius set out to make a circuit through Apulia and in the one expedition either reduced by force or received into alliance on con ditions a considerable number of the states Papirius likewise who had remained to prosecute the siege of Luceria soon found the event agreeable to his hopes for all the roads being blocked up through which pro visions used to be conveyed from Samnium the Sam nites in garrisons were reduced so low by famine that they sent ambassadors to the Roman consul proposing that he should raise the siege on receiving the horse men who were the cause of the war To whom Pa pirius returned this answer that  they ought to have consulted Pontius son of Herennius by whose advice they had sent the Romans under the yoke what treat ment he thought fitting for the conquered to undergo But since instead of offering fair terms themselves they chose rather that they should be imposed on them by their enemies be desired them to carry back orders to the troops in Luceria that they should leave within the walls their arms baggage beasts of burden and all persons unfit for war The soldiers he would send under the yoke with single garments retaliating the disgrace formerly inflicted not setting the example All this they submitted to Seven thousand soldiers were sent under the yoke and an immense booty was seized in the town where the Romans retook all the standards and arms which they had lost at Caudium  and what greatly increased their joy recovered the horsemen whom the Samnites had sent to Luceria to be kept as pledges of the peace Hardly ever did the Romans gain a victory more remarkable for the sudden reverse produced in the state of their affairs especially 92 LIVY if it be true as I find in some annals that Pontius son of Herennius the Samnite general was sent under the yoke along with the rest to atone for the disgrace of the consuls I think it indeed less strange to find un certainty with respect to the treatment of the Samnite general than that there should be a doubt whether it was Lucius Cornelius in quality of dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor being master of the horse who acted at Caudium and afterwards at Luceria as the single avenger of the disgrace of the Romans enjoying the best deserved triumph perhaps next to that of Furius Camillus which had ever yet been obtained or whe ther that honor belongs to the consuls and particularly to Papirius This uncertainty is followed by another whether at the next election A U C 435 B C 317 Papirius Cursor was chosen consul a third time with Quintus Aulus Cerretanus a second time being re elected in requital pf his services at Luceria or whe ther it was Lucius Papirius Mugillanus the surname being mistaken 16 From henceforth the accounts are clear that the other wars were conducted to a conclusion by the con suls Aulius by one successful battle intirely con quered the Ferentans The city to which their army had retreated after its defeat surrendered on terms and was ordered to give hostages Similar fortune at tended the other consul in his operations against the Satricans  who though Roman citizens had after the misfortune at Caudium revolted to the Samnites and received a garrison into their city The Satricans however when the Roman army approached their walls sent deputies to sue for peace with humble in  treaties to whom the consul answered harshly that they must not come again to him unless they either put to death or delivered up the Samnite garrison  which words struck greater terror into the colonists than the arms with which they were threatened The deputies on this several times asking the consul how he thought that they who were few and weak could attempt to use force against a garrison so strong and well armed HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 93 lie desired them to  seek counsel from those by whose advice they had received that garrison into the city They then departed and returned to their countrymen having obtained from the consul with much difficulty permission to consult their senate and bring back their answer to him Two factions divided the senate the leaders of one had been the authors of the defection from the Roman people  the other consisted of the citi zens who retained their loyalty  both however showed an earnest desire that every means should be used to wards effecting an accommodation with the consul for the restoration of peace As the Samnite garrison being in no respect prepared for holding out a siege intended to retire the next night out of the town one party thought it sufficient to discover to the consul at what hour through what gate and by what road his enemy was to march out The other who had opposed the going over to the Samnites went farther and opened one of the gates for the consul in the night secretly admitting him into the town In consequence of this twofold treachery the Samnite garrison was surprised and overpowered by an ambush placed in the woody places near the road and at the same time a shout was raised in the city which was now filled with the besiegers Thus in the short space of one hour the Samnites were put to the sword the Satricans made prisoners and all things reduced under the power of the consul who taking proper measures to discover who were the instigators of the revolt scourged with rods and beheaded such as he found to be guilty  and then disarming the Satricans he placed a strong gar rison in the place On this Papirius Cursor proceeded to Borne to celebrate his triumph according to the re lation of those authors who say that he was the gene ral who retook Luceria and sent the Samnites under the yoke Undoubtedly as a warrior he was deserv ing of every praise excelling not only in vigor of mind but likewise in strength of body He possessed extra ordinary swiftness of foot surpassing every one of his age in running from whence came the surname into 94 LIVY his family and he is said either from the robustness of his frame or from much practice to have been able to digest a very large quantity of food and wine Never did either the foot soldier or horseman feel military service more laborious under any general because he was of a constitution not to be overcome by fatigue The cavalry on some occasion venturing to request that in consideration of their good behavior he would excuse them some part of their business he told them  you should not say that no indulgence has been granted you â I excuse you from rubbing your horses backs when you dismount He supported also the au thority of command in all its vigor both among the allies and his countrymen The pretor of Praeneste through fear had been tardy in bringing forward his men from the reserve to the front the general walking before his tent ordered him to be called and then bade the lictor to make ready his axe  on which the Prae nestine standing frightened almost to death he said  here lictor cut away this stump it is troublesome to people as they walk and after thus alarming him with the dread of the severest punishment fined and dismissed him It is beyond doubt that during that age than which none was ever more productive of virtuous characters there was no m u in whom the Roman affairs found a more effectual support nay people even marked him out in their minds as a match for Alexander the Great in case that having completed the conquest of Asia he should have turned his arms on Europe 17 Nothing has ever been farther from my inten tion since the commencement of this history than to digress more than necessity required from the course of narration  and by embellishing my work with va riety to seek pleasing resting places as it were for my readers and relaxation for my own mind neverthe less the mention of so great a king and commander as it has often set my thoughts at work in silent dis quisitions now calls forth a few reflections to public view and disposes me to inquire what would have HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 96 been the consequence respecting the affairs of the Romans if they had happened to have been engaged in a war with Alexander The circumstances of greatest moment seem to be the number and bravery of the soldiers the abilities of the commanders and fortune which exerts a powerful sway over all hu man concerns and especially over those of war Now these particulars considered both separately and col lectively must clearly convince an observer that not only other kings and nations but that even Alexander himself would have found the Roman empire invin cible And first to begin with comparing the com manders I do not indeed deny that Alexander was a captain of consummate merit but still bis fame owes part of its lustre to his having been single in command and to his dying young while his affairs were advanc ing in improvement and while he had not yet expe rienced a reverse of fortune  for to pass by other illustrious kings and leaders who afford exemplary in stances of the decline of human greatness what was it but length of life which subjected Cyrus whom the Greeks in their panegyrics exalt so far beyond all others to the caprice of fortune And the same was lately the case of Pompey the Great I shall enume rate the Roman chiefs not every one of every age but those only with whom either as consuls or dicta tors Alexander might have been engaged Marcus Valerius Corvus Caius Marcius Rntilus Caius Sulpi cius Titus Manlius Torquatus Quintns Publilius Philo Lucius Papirius Cursor Quintus Fabius Maxi mus the two Decji Lucius Voluiunius Manius Cu rius Then follow a number of very extraordinary men had it so happened that he had first engaged in war with Carthage and had come into Italy at a more advanced period of life Every one of these possessed powers of mind and a capacity equal with Alexander add to this that a regular system of military discipline had been transmitted from one to another from the first rise of the city of Rome a system now reduced into the form of an art completely digested in a train LIVY of fixed and settled principles deduced from the prac tice of the kings and afterwards of the expellers of those kings the Junii and Valerii  with all the im provements made in it by the Fabii the Quintii the Comelii and particularly Furius Camillus who was an old man in the earlier years of those with whom Alexander must have fought Manlius Torquatus might perhaps have yielded to Alexander had he met him in the field  and so might Valerius Corvus  men who were distinguished soldiers before they be came commanders The same too might have been the case with the Decii who after devoting their per sons rushed on the enemy or of Papirius Cursor though possessed of such powers both of body and mind The counsels of one youth it is possible might have baffled the wisdom of a whole senate composed of such members that he alone who said it was an assembly of kings conceived a just idea of it But then there was little probability that he should with more judgment than any one of those whom I have named choose ground for an encampment provide supplies guard against stratagems distinguish the season for fighting form his line of battle or strengthen it properly with reserves He would have owned that he was not dealing with Darius who drew after him a train of women and eunuchs saw nothing about him but gold and purple was incumbered with the bur densome trappings of his state and should be called his prey rather than his antagonist whom therefore he vanquished without loss of blood and had no other merit on the occasion than that of showing a proper spirit in despising empty show Italy would have ap peared to him a country of a quite different nature from Asia which he traversed in the guise of a re veller at the head of a crew of drunkards if he bad seen the forests of Apulia and the mountains of Luca nia with the vestiges of the disasters of his house and where his uncle Alexander king of Epirus had been lately cut off 18 I am here speaking of Alexander not yet intoxi HISTORY OF ROME BOOK IX 97 cated by prosperity the seductions of which no man was less capable of withstanding But if a judgment is to be formed of him from the tenor of his conduct in the new state of his fortune and from the new dis position as I may say which he put on after his suc cesses he would have entered Italy more like Darius than Alexander and would have brought thither an army who had forgotten Macedonia and were degene rating into the manners of the Persians It is painful in speaking of so great a king to recite his ostentatious pride in the frequent changes of his dress his re quiring that people should address him with adulation prostrating themselves on the ground a practice in supportable to the Macedonians had they even been conquered much more so when they were victorious  the shocking cruelty of his punishments  his murder ing his friends in the midst of feasting and wine  with the folly of his fiction respecting his birth What must have been the consequence if his love of wine had daily increased  If his fierce and uncontrollable anger  and as I mention not any one circumstance of which there is a doubt among writers do we consider these as no disparagements to the qualifications of a commander But then as is frequently repeated by the silliest of the Greeks who are fond of exalting the reputation even of the Parthians at the expense of the Roman name it was to be apprehended that the Roman people would not have had resolution to face the splendor of Alexander s name who however in my opinion was not known to them even by common fame and while in Athens a state reduced to weak ness by the Macedonian arms which at the very time saw the ruins of Thebes smoking in its neighborhood men had spirit enough to declaim with freedom against him as is manifest from the copies of their speeches which have been preserved  is it to be supposed that out of such a number of Roman chiefs no one would have freely uttered bis sentiments How large soever the scale may be on which our idea of this man s great ness is formed still it is the greatness of an individual LIV VOL III G 98 LIVY constituted by the successes of a little more than ten years  and those who give it pre eminence on account that the Roman people have been defeated though not in any intire war yet in several battles whereas Alex ander was never once unsuccessful in fight do not consider that they are comparing the actions of one man and that a young man with the course of action of a nation which has been waging wars now eight hundred years Can we wonder then if fortune has varied more in such a long space than in the short term of thirteen years But why not compare the success of one man with that of another  How many Roman commanders might I name who never were beaten  In the annals of the magistrates and the re cords we may run over whole pages of consuls and dictators with whose bravery and successes also the Roman people never once had reason to he dissatisfied And what renders them more deserving of admiration than Alexander or any king is that some of these acted in the office of dictator which lasted only ten or it might be twenty days  none in a charge of longer duration than the consulship of a year their levies obstructed by plebeian tribunes often late in taking the field  recalled before the time to attend elections  amidst the very busiest efforts of the campaign overtaken by the close of their official year sometimes by the rashness sometimes the perverseness of a colleague involved in difficulties or losses  and finally succeed ing to the unfortunate administration of a predecessor with an army of raw or ill disciplined men But on the other hand kings being not only free from every kind of impediment but masters of circum stancesand seasons control all things in subserviency to their designs themselves uncontrolled by any So that Alexander unconquered would have encoun tered unconquered commanders  and would have had stakes of equal consequence pledged on the issue Nay the hazard had been greater on his side be cause the Macedonians would have had but one Alex ander who was not only liable but fond of exposing HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 99 himself to casualties  the Romans would have had many equal to Alexander both in renown and in the greatness of their exploits the life or death of any one of whom would have affected only his own con cerns without any material consequence to the pub lic 19 It remains to compare the forces together with respect to their numbers the different kinds of troops and their resources for procuring auxiliaries Now in the general surveys of that age there were rated two hundred and fifty thousand men  so that on every revolt of the Latine confederates ten legions were en listed almost intirely in the city It often happened during those years that four or five armies were em ployed at a time in Etruria in TJmbria the Gauls also being at war in Samnium in Lucania Then as to all Latium with the Sabines and Volscians the Equans and all Campania  half of Umbria Etruria and the Picentians the Marsians Pelignians Vesti nians and Apulians  to whom we may add the whole coast of the lower sea possessed by the Greeks from Thurii to Neapolis and Cum a and the Samnites from thence as far as Antium and Ostia all these he would have found either powerful allies to the Ro mans or deprived of power by their arms He would have crossed the sea with his veteran Macedonians amounting to no more than thirty thousand infantry and four thousand horse these mostly Thessalians This was the whole of his strength Had he brought with him Persians and Indians and those other na tions it would be dragging after him an incumbrance rather than a support Add to this that the Romans being at home would have had recruits at hand Alexander waging war in a foreign country would have found his army worn out with long service as happened afterwards to Hannibal As to arms theirs were a buckler and long spears those of the Romans a shield which covered the body more effectually and a javelin a much more forcible weapon than the spear either in throwing or striking The soldiers 100 LIVY on both sides were used to steady combat and to pre serve their ranks But the Macedonian phalanx was unapt for motion and composed of similar parts throughout the Roman line less compact consisting of several various parts was easily divided as occa sion required and as easily conjoined Then what soldier is comparable to the Roman in the throwing up of works  who better calculated to endure fatigue Alexander if overcome in one battle could make no other effort The Roman whom Caudium whom Cannae did not crush what fight could crush In truth even should events have been favorable to him at first he would have often wished for the Persians the Indians and the effeminate tribes of Asia as op ponents  and would have acknowleged that bis wars had been waged with women as we are told was said by Alexander king of Epirus after receiving his mor tal wound in relation to the battles fought in Asia by this very youth and when compared with those in which himself had been engaged Indeed when I re flect that in the first Punic war a contest was main tained by the Romans with the Carthaginians at sea for twenty four years I can scarcely suppose that the life of Alexander would have been long enough for the finishing of one war with either of those nations And perhaps as the Punic state was united to the Roman by ancient treaties and as similar apprehensions might arm against a common foe those two nations the most potent of the time he might have been overwhelmed in a Punic and a Roman war at once The Romans have had experience of the boasted prowess of the Macedo nians in arms not indeed when they were led by Alexander or when their power was at the height but in the wars against Antiochus Philip and Perses and so far were they from sustaining any losses that they incurred not even danger Let not the truth give offence o any nor our civil wars be brought into men tion  never were we worsted by an enemy s cavalry never by their infantry never in open fight never on equal ground much less when the ground was favor HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 101 able Our soldiers heavy laden with arms may rea sonably fear a body of cnvalry or arrows defiles of difficult passages and places impassable to convoys But they have defeated and will defeat a thousand armies more formidable than those of Alexander and the Macedonians provided that the same love of peace and zeal to promote domestic harmony which at pre sent subsist among us shall continue to prevail 20 Marcus Foslius Flaccinator and Lucius Plau tius Venno were the next raised to the consulship A U C 436 B C 316 In this year ambassadors came from most of the states of the Samuites to procure a renewal of the treaty  and having moved the compas sion of the senate by the humility with which they prostrated themselves before them were referred to the people with whom they found not their prayers so efficacious Their petition therefore with regard to the treaty was rejected but after a supplication of several days they obtained a truce for two years The Teaneans likewise and Canusians of Apulia worn out by the devastations of their country surrendered them selves to the consul Lucius Plautius and gave hos tages This year prefects first began to be created for Capua and a code of laws was given to that nation by Lucius Furins the pretor both in compliance with their own request as a remedy for the disorder of their affairs occasioned by intestine dissensions At Rome two additional tribes were constituted the Ufen tine and Falerine On the affairs of Apulia falling into decline the Teatians of that country came to the new consuls Caius Junius Bubulcus and Quintus Emilius Barbula suing for an alliance A U C 437 B C 315 and engaging that peace should be observed towards the Romans through every part of Apulia By pledging themselves boldly for this they obtained the grant of an alliance not however on terms of equa lity but of their submitting to the dominion of the Roman people Apulia being intirely reduced for Junius had also gained possession of Forentum a town of great strength the consuls advanced into Lucania 102 LIVY there Nerulum was surprised and stormed by the con sul jEmilius When fame trad spread abroad among the allies how firmly the affairs of Capua were settled by the introduction of the Roman institutions the An tians imitating the example presented a complaint of their being without laws and without magistrates on which the patrons of the colony itself were appointed by the senate to form a body of laws for it Thus not only the arms but the laws of Rome widely extended their sway 21 The consuls Caius Junius Bubulcus and Quin tus jEmilius Barbula at the conclusion of the year delivered over the legions not to the consuls elected by themselves who were Spurius Nautius and Mar cus Popillius but to a dictator Lucius Emilius A U C 438 B C 314 He with Lucius Fulvius master of the horse laying siege to Saticula gave oc casion to the Samnites of reviving hostilities and this produced a twofold alarm to the Roman army On one side the Samnites having collected a numerous force with intent to relieve their allies from the siege pitched their camp at a small distance from that of the Romans on the other side the Saticulans opening suddenly their gates ran up with violent tumult to their posts Afterwards each party relying on sup port from the other more than on its own strength formed a regular attack and pressed on the Romans The dictator on his part though obliged to oppose two enemies at once yet had his line secure on both sides for he chose a position in which he could not easily be surrounded and also formed two different fronts However he directed his first efforts against those who bad sallied from the town and without meeting much resistance drove them back within the walls He then turned his whole force against the Samnites there he found greater difficulty But the victory though long delayed was neither doubtful nor alloyed by losses The Samnites being forced to fly into their camp extinguished their fires at night and marched away in silenoe  and renouncing all hopes of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 103 relieving Saticula sat themselves down before Plistia which was in alliance with the Romans that they might if possible retort equal vexation on their enemy 22 The year coming to a conclusion the war was thenceforward conducted by a dictator Quintus Fa bius A U C 439 B C 313 The new consuls Lucius Papirius Cursor and Quiutus Publilius Philo both a fourth time as the former had done remained at Rome Fabius came with a reinforcement to Sati cula to receive the command of the army from jEmi lius The Samnites had not continued before Plistia  but having sent for a new supply of men from home and relying on their numbers had encamped in the same spot as before and by provoking the Romans  to battle endeavored to divert them from the siege The dictator so much the more intently pushed for ward his operations against the fortifications of the enemy considering the taking of the city as the only object of the war and showing an indifference with respect to the Samnites except that he placed guards in proper places to prevent any attempt on his camp This encouraged the Samnites so that they rode up to the rampart and allowed him no quiet These now coming up close to the gates of the camp Quintus Aulius Cerretanus master of the horse without con sulting the dictator sallied out furiously at the head of all the troops of cavalry and drove them back In this desultory kind of fight Fortune exerted her power in such a manner as to occasion an extraordinary loss on both sides and the remarkable deaths of the com manders themselves First the general of the Sam nites filled with indignation at being repulsed and compelled to fly from a place to which he had advanced with such confidence prevailed on his horsemen by intreaties and exhortations to renew the battle As he was easily distinguished among the horsemen while he urged on the fight the Roman master of the horse galloped up against him in such a furious career that with one stroke of his spear he tumbled him lifeless from his horse The multitude however were not as 104 LIVY is generally the case dismayed by the fall of their leader but rather roused to fury All who were within reach darted their weapons at Aulins who incautiously pushed forward among the enemy s troops but the chief share of the honor of revenging the death of the Samnite general was reserved for his brother who urged by rage and grief dragged down the victorious master of the horse from his seat and slew him As he fell in the midst of their troops the Samnites were also near keeping possession of his body but the Ro mans instantly dismounting the Samnites were obliged to do the same and thus were lines formed suddenly and a battle began on foot round the bodies of the ge nerals in which the Romans had manifestly the advan tage  and recovering the body of Aulius carried it back in triumph to the camp with hearts filled with a mixture of joy and grief The Samnites having lost their commander and made a trial of their strength in this contest between the cavalry left Saticula which they despaired of relieving and returned to the siege of Plistia within a few days after which the Romans got possession of Saticula by capitulation and the Samnites of Plistia by force 23 The seat of the war was then changed The le gions were led away from Samnium and Apulia to Sora This city had revolted to the Samnites and put to death the Roman colonists The Roman army hav ing arrived here first by forced marches with the pur pose of revenging the murder of their countrymen and recovering possession of the colony and the scouts who were scattered about the roads bringing intelligence one after another that the Samnites were following at no great distance they marched to meet the enemy and at Lautulae fought them with doubtful success Neither loss nor flight on either side but the night separated the combatants uncertain whether they were victorious or defeated I find in some historians that the Romans were worsted in this battle and that here Quintus Aulius the master of the borse fell Caius Fabius substituted master of the horse in the room of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 105 Qnintus Aulius came hither with a new army from Rome and having by messengers whom he sent for ward consulted the dictator where he should halt at what time and on what side he should fall on the enemy and being sufficiently apprised of his designs in every particular he rested in a place where he was safe from observation The dictator after having kept his men within the rampart for several days after the engagement like one besieged rather than a besieger suddenly displayed the signal for battle and judging it the more efficacious method of inflaming the courage of brave men to let none have any room for hope but in himself he kept secret from the troops the arrival of the master of the horse and the new army and as if there were no safety but in forcing their way thence he said  Soldiers caught as we are in a confined situ ation we have no passage through which we can extri cate ourselves unless we open one by a victory Our post is sufficiently secured by works  but at the same time untenable through scarcity of necessaries for all the country round from which provisions could be supplied has revolted  and besides even were the in habitants disposed to aid us the nature of the ground is unfavorable I will not therefore mislead you by leaving a camp here into which you may retreat as on a former day without completing the victory Works ought to be secured by arms not arms by works Let those keep a camp and repair to it whose interest it is to protract the war but let lis cut oft from ourselves every other prospect but that of con quering Advance the standards against the enemy as soon as the troops shall have marched beyond the rampart let those who have it in orders burn the camp Your losses soldiers shall be compensated with the spoil of all the nations round who have revolted The soldiers advanced against the enemy with spirits in flamed by the dictator s discourse which seemed to indicate an extreme necessity and at the same time the very sight of the camp burning behind them though the nearest part only was set on fire for so the dicta 106 LIVY tor had ordered was no small incitement rushing on therefore like madmen they disordered the enemy s battalions at the very first onset and the master of the horse when he saw at a distance the fire of the oamp which was a signal agreed on made a season able attack on their rear The Samnites thus assailed on every side fled different ways A vast number who had gathered into a body through fear yet from confusion incapable of acting were surrounded and cut to pieces The enemy s camp was taken and plun dered  and the soldiers being laden with the spoil the dictator led them back to the Roman camp highly re joiced at the success but still more at finding contrary to their expectation every thing there safe except a small part only which was injured or destroyed by the fire 24 They then marched back to Sora A U C 440 B C 312 and the new consuls Marcus Petilius and Cains Sulpicius receiving the army from the dictator Fabius discharged a great part of the veteran soldiers having brought with them new cohorts to supply their place  Now while on account of the difficulties pre sented by the situation of the city no mode of attack could be devised which promised any certainty of suc cess and the taking of it must either he done at the expense of a great deal of time or at a desperate risk a townsman deserting came out of the town privately by night and when he had got as far as the Roman watches desired to be conducted instantly to the con suls  which being complied with he made them an offer of delivering the place into their hands From his answers to their questions respecting the means by which he intended to accomplish his design it appeared to be not ill formed  and he persuaded them to remove the Roman camp which was almost close to the walls to the distance of six miles alleging that this would render the guards by day and the watches by night the less vigilant He then desired that some cohorts should post themselves the following night in the woody places under the town and took with himself ten chosen HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 107 soldiers through steep and almost impassable ways into the citadel where a quantity of missive weapons had heen collected larger than bore proportion to the number of men There were stones besides  some lying at random as in all craggy places and others heaped up by the townsmen to add to the security of the place Having posted the Romans here and shown them a steep and narrow path leading up from the town to the citadel  From this ascent said he  even three armed men would keep off any multitude what ever Now you are ten in number and what is more Romans and the bravest among the Romans The night is in your favor which by concealing the real state of things magnifies every object to people when once alarmed I will immediately fill every place with terror be you alert in defending the citadel He then ran down in haste crying aloud  To arms citi zens  we are undone  the citadel is taken by the ene my  run defend it This he repeated as he passed the doors of the principal men  the same to all whom he met and also to those who ran out in a fright into the streets The alarm communicated first by one was soon spread by numbers through all the city The magistrates dismayed on hearing from scouts that the citadel was full of arms and armed men whose number they multiplied laid aside all hopes of reco vering it Flight began on every side  and the towns men half asleep and for the most part unarmed broke open the gates through one of which the body of Ro man troops roused by the noise burst in and slew the terrified inhabitants who attempted to skirmish in the streets Sora was now taken when at the first light the consuls arrived and accepted the surrender of those whom Fortune had left remaining after the flight and slaughter of the night Of these they con veyed in chains to Rome two hundred and twenty five whom all men agreed in pointing out as the authors both of the revolt and also of the horrid massacre of the colonists The rest were left in safety at Sora where they placed a garrison All those who were 108 LIVY brought to Rome were beaten with rods in the forum and beheaded to the great joy of the commons whose interest it most highly concerned that the multitudes sent to various places in colonies should be in safety 25 The consuls leaving Sora turned their opera tions against the lands and cities of the Ausonians  for all places had been set in commotion by the coming of the Samnites when the battle was fought at Lautulae conspiracies likewise had been formed in several parts of Campania nor was Capua itself clear of the charge nay the business spread even to Rome and occasioned inquiries to be instituted respecting some of the prin cipal men there However the Ausonian nation fell into the Roman power in the same manner as Sora by their cities being betrayed  these were Ausona Min turn e and Vescia Certain young men of the princi pal families twelve in number having conspired to betray their respective cities came to the consuls and informed them that their countrymen who had for a long time before earnestly wished for the coming of the Samnites on hearing of the battle at Lautulae had looked on the Romans as defeated and had assisted the Samnites with supplies of men and arms  but that since the Samnites had been beaten out of the country they were wavering between peace and war not shut ting their gates against the Romans lest they should thereby invite an attack yet determined to shut them if any troops should approach  and that while their minds were in that fluctuating state they might easily be overpowered by surprise By these men s advice the camp was moved nearer and soldiers were sent at the same time to each of the three towns some armed who were to lie concealed in places near the walls  others in the garb of peace with swords hidden under their clothes who on the opening of the gates at the approach of day were to enter into the cities These latter began with killing the guards and at the same time made the signal to the men in arms to hasten up from the ambuscades Thus the gates were seized and the three towns taken in the same hour and by the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 109 same device But as the generals were not present when the attacks were made there were no bounds to the carnage which ensued and the nation of the Au sonians when there was scarcely any clear proof of the charge of its having revolted was utterly de stroyed as if it had supported a contest through a deadly war 26 During this year Luceria fell into the hands of the Samnites the Roman garrison being betrayed to them The actors in this treachery did not long go unpunished  the Roman army was not far off by whom the city which lay in a plain was taken at the first onset The Lucerians and Samnites were to a man put to the sword  and to such a length was re sentment carried that at Rome on the senate being consulted about sending a colony to Luceria many voted for the demolition of it Their hatred was of the bitterest kind against a people whom they had been obliged twice to subdue by arms  the great dis tance also made them averse from sending their citi zens as colonists among nations so ill affected towards them However the resolution was carried that such should be sent and accordingly two thousand five hundred were transported thither This year disaffec tion to the Romans becoming general conspiracies were formed among the leading men at Capua as well as at other places  which being reported to the senate they deemed it an affair by no means to be neglected They decreed that inquiries should be made and re solved that a dictator should be appointed to enforce these inquiries Caius Maenius was accordingly no minated and he appointed Marcus Foslius master of the horse People s dread of that office was very great insomuch that the Calavii Ovius and Novius who were the heads of the conspiracy either through fear of the dictator s power or the consciousness of guilt previous to the charge against them being laid in form before him chose as appeared beyond doubt to avoid trial by a voluntary death As the subject of the inquiry in Campania was thus removed the pro 110 LIVY ceedings were then directed towards Rome by con struing the order of the senate to have meant that in quiry should be made not specially who at Capua but generally who at any place had formed cabals or conspiracies for that cabals for the attaining of honors were contrary to the edicts of the state The inquiry was extended to a greater latitude with re spect bQth to the matter and to the kind of persons concerned The dictator scrupled not to avow that his power of research was unlimited  in consequence some of the nobility were called to account and though they applied to the tribunes for protection no one interposed iu their behalf or to prevent the charges 1 from being received On this the nobles not those only against whom the charge was levelled but the whole body jointly insisted that such an imputation lay not against themselves or their order to whom the way to honors lay open if not obstructed by fraud but against the new men so that even the dictator and master of the horse with respect to that question would appear more properly as culprits than inquisi tors  and this they should know as soon as they went out of office This so deeply affected Maenius who was more solicitous about his character than his office that he advanced into the assembly and spoke to this effect  Romans of my past life you are all wit nesses  and this honorable office which you conferred on me is in itself a testimony of my innocence For the dictator proper to be chosen for holding these in quiries was not as on many other occasions where the exigences of the state so required the man who was most renowned in war but him whose course of life was most remote from such cabals But certain of the nobility for what reason it is more proper that you should judge than that I as a magistrate should with out proof insinuate have labored to stifle intirely the inquiries  and then finding their strength unequal to it rather than stand a trial have fled for refuge to the stronghold of their adversaries an appeal and the support of the tribunes and on being there also re HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX Ill pulsed so fully were they persuaded that every other measure was safer than the attempt to clear them selves have made an attack on us  and though in private characters have not been restrained by a sense of decency from instituting a criminal process against a dictator Now that gods and men may perceive that they to avoid a scrutiny as to their own conduct attempt even impossibilities and that I willingly meet the charge and face the accusations of my ene mies I divest myself of the dictatorship And con suls I beseech you that if this business is put into your hands by the senate you will make me and Marcus Foslius the first objects of your examinations  it shall be manifested that we owe our safety from such imputations to our own innocence not to the dignity of office He then abdicated the dictatorship as did Marcus Foslius immediately after his office of master of the horse  and being the first brought to trial be fore the consuls for to them the senate had com mitted the business they were most honorably ac quitted of all the charges brought by the nobles Even Publilius Philo who had so often been invested with the highest honors and had performed so many emi nent services both at home and abroad being disa greeable to the nobility was brought to trial and ac quitted Nor did the inquiry continue respectable on account of the illustrious names of the accused longer than while it was new which is usually the case  it then began to descend to persons of inferior rank  and at length was suppressed by means of those factions and cabals against which it had been instituted 27 The accounts received of these matters but more especially the hope of a revolt in Campania for which a conspiracy had been formed recalled the Samnites from their intended march towards Apulia back to Caudium  where being near they might if any commotion should open them an opportunity snatch Capua out of the hands of the Romans To the same place the consuls repaired with a powerful army They both held back for some time on the different 112 LIVY sides of the defiles the roads being dangerous to either party Then the Samnites making a short circuit through an open tract marched down their troops into level ground in the Campanian plains and there the hostile camps first came within view of each other Both armies then made trial of their strength in slight skirmishes more frequently between the horse than the foot and the Romans were no way displeased either at the issue of these or at the protraction of the war The Samnite generals on the contrary were uneasy that their battalions should be weakened daily by small losses and the general vigor abated by inac tion They therefore marched into the field disposing their cavalry on both wings with orders to give more heedful attention to the camp behind than to the bat tle  for that the line of infantry would be able to pro vide for their own safety The consuls took post Sul picius on the right wing Petilius in the left The right wing was stretched out wider than usual the Samnites also on that side being formed in thin ranks either with design of turning the flank of the enemy or to avoid being themselves surrounded On the left besides that they were formed in more compact order an addition was made to their strength by a sudden act of the consul Petilius for the subsidiary cohorts which were usually reserved for the exigences of a tedious fight he brought up immediately to the front and in the first onset pushed the enemy with the whole of his force The Samnite line of infantry giving way their cavalry advanced to support them  and as they were charging in an oblique direction between the two lines the Roman horse coming up at full speed disordered their battalions and ranks of infantry and cavalry so as to oblige the whole line on that side to give ground The left wing bad not only the pre sence of Petilius to animate them but that of Sulpi cius likewise  who on the shout being first raised in that quarter rode thither from his own division which had not yet engaged When he saw victory no longer doubtful there he returned to his own post with twelve HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 113 hundred men but found affairs on that side in a very different posture the Romans driven from their ground and the victorious enemy pressing on their disordered battalions However the arrival of the consul effected a speedy change in every particular  for on the sight of their leader the spirit of the sol diers was revived and the bravery of the men who came with him rendered them a more powerful rein forcement than even their number while the news of success in the other wing of which they soon had visi ble proof restored the vigor of the fight From this time the Romans became victorious through the whole extent of the line and the Samnites giving up the contest were slain or taken prisoners except such as made their escape to Maleventum the town which is now called Beneventum Thirty thousand of the Samnites were slain or taken according to accounts of historians 28 The consuls after this important victory led forward the legions to lay siege to Bovianum and there they continued during part of the winter until Cains Petilius being nominated dictator with Marcus Foslius master of the horse received the command of the army from the new consuls Lucius Papirius Cursor a fifth and Caius Junius Bubulcus a second time A U C 441 B C 311 On hearing that the citadel of Fregellas was taken by the Samnites be left Bovia num and proceeded to that city of which he recovered possession without any contest the Samnites abandon ing it in the night he then placed a strong garrison there and returned to Campania directing his opera tions principally to the recovery of Nola Within the walls of this place the whole multitude of the Sam nites and the inhabitants of the country about Nola shut themselves up on the approach of the dictator Having taken a view of the situation of the city in order to open the approach to the fortifications he set fire to all the buildings which stood round the walls which were very numerous and in a short time after Nola was taken either by the dictator Petilius or the LIV VOL III H 114 LIVV consul Caius Junius but by which of them is uncertain Those who attribute to the consul the honor of taking Nola add that he also took Antina and Calatia and that Petilius was created dictator in consequence of a pestilence breaking out merely for the purpose of driving the nail The colonies of Suessa and Pontie were established in this year Suessa had been the property of the Auruncians the Volscians had occu pied Pontics an island lying within sight of their shore A decree of the senate was also passed for conducting colonies to Interamna and Cassinum A U C 442 B C 310 But the commissioners were appointed and the colonists to the number of four thousand sent by the succeeding consuls Marcus Valerius and Pub lius Decius 29 The Samnites were now nearly disabled from continuing the war but before the Roman senate was freed from all concern on that side a report arose of the Etrurians intending to commence hostilities and there was not in those times any nation excepting the Gauls whose arms were more dreaded by reason both of the vicinity of their country and of the multitude of their men While therefore one of the consuls pro secuted the remains of the war in Samnium Publius Decius who being attacked by a severe illness re mained at Rome by direction of the senate nominated Cains Junius Bubulcus dictator He as the magni tude of the affair demanded compelled all the younger citizens to enlist and with the utmost diligence pre pared all requisite matters Yet he was not so elated by the power he had collected as to think of com mencing offensive operations but prudently determined to remain quiet unless the Etrurians should become aggressors The plans of the Etrurians were exactly similar with respect to preparing for and abstaining from war neither party went beyond their own fron tiers The censorship of Appius Claudius and Caius Plautius for this year was remarkable  but the name of Appius has been handed down with more celebrity to posterity on account of his having made the road HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 116 called after him the Appian and for having conveyed water into the city These works he performed alone  for his colleague overwhelmed with shame by reason of the infamous and unworthy choice made of senators had abdicated his office Appius possessing that in flexibility of temper which from the earliest times had been the characteristic of his family held on the censorship by himself By direction of the same Ap pius the Potitian family in which the office of priests attendant on the great altar of Hercules was hereditary instructed some of the public servants in the rites of that solemnity with the intention to delegate the same to them The consequence as related is wonderful to be told and sufficient to make people scrupulous of disturbing the established modes of religious solemni ties  for though there were at that time twelve branches of the Potitian family all grown up persons and not fewer than thirty yet they were every one together with their offspring cut off within the year  so that the name of the Potitii became extinct while the censor Appius also was pursued by the wrath of the gods and some years after deprived of sight 30 The consuls of the succeeding year A U C 443 B C 309 were Caius Junius Bubulcus a third time and Quintus jEmilius Barbula a second In the com mencement of their office they complained before the people that by the improper choice which had been made of members of the senate that body had been disgraced several having been passed over who were preferable to the persons chosen in  and they declared that they would pay no regard to such election made without distinction of right or wrong merely to gratify interest or humor they then immediately called over the list of the senate in the same order which had taken place before the censorship of Appius Claudius and Caius Plautius Two public employments both relating to military affairs came this year into the dis posal of the people one being an order that sixteen of the tribunes for four legions should be appointed by the people whereas hitherto they had been generally 110 LIVY bestowed by the dictators and consuls and very few of the places were left to be filled by vote This order was proposed by Lucius Atilius and Caius Marcius plebeian tribunes Another was that the people likewise should constitute two naval commissioners for the equipping and refitting of the fleet The person who introduced this order of the people was Marcus Decius plebeian tribune Another transaction of this year I should pass over as trifling were it not for the relation which it bears to religion The flute players taking offence be cause they had been prohibited by the last censors from holding their repasts in the temple of Jupiter which had been customary from very early times went off in a body to Tibur so that there was not one left in the city to play at the sacrifices This affair gave uneasiness to the senate on account of its consequences to religion  and they sent envoys to Tibur with in structions to endeavor that these men might be sent back to Rome The Tiburtines readily promised com pliance and first calling them into the senate house warmly recommended to them to return thither and then finding that they could not be prevailed on practised an artifice not ill adapted to the dispositions of that description of people on a festival day they invited them separately to their several houses ap parently with the intention of heightening the pleasure of their feasts with music and there plied them with wine of which such people are always fond until they laid them asleep In this state of insensibility they threw them into waggons and carried them away to Rome nor did they know any thing of the matter until the wnggons having been left in the forum the light surprised them still heavily sick from the de bauch The people then crowded about them and on their consenting at length to stay privilege was granted them to ramble about the city in full dress with music during three days in every year And that license which we see practised at present and the right of being fed in the temple was restored to those who played at the sacrifices These incidents occurred HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 11 while the public attention was deeply engaged by two most important wars 31 The consuls adjusting the provinces between them the Samnites fell by lot to Junius the new war of Etruria to Emilias In the country of the former the Samnites finding themselves unable to take Cluvia a Roman garrison by force had formed a blockade and reduced it by famine to capitulate and after torturing with stripes in a shocking manner the towns men who surrendered had put them to death En raged at this cruelty Junius determined to postpone every thing else to the attacking of Cluvia and on the first day that he assaulted the walls took it by storm and slew all who were grown to man s estate The victorious troops were led from thence to Bovianum  this was the capital of the Pentrian Samnites by far the most opulent of their cities and the most powerful both in men and arms The soldiers stimulated by the hope of plunder soon made themselves masters of the town where their resentment being less violent there was less severity exercised on the enemy but a quantity of spoil was carried off greater almost than had ever been collected out of all Samnium and the whole was liberally bestowed on the assailers The Samnites now perceiving that the Romans possessed such a superiority in arms that no force in the field no camp no cities could withstand them bent their whole attention to find out an opportunity of acting by stratagem They conceived that the enemy proceeding with incautious eagerness in pursuit of plunder might on such occasion be caught in a snare and overpowered Some peasants who deserted and some prisoners who were taken part of them being purposely thrown in the way while others were met by accident concurred in their report to the consul which at the same time was true that a vast quantity of cattle had been driven to gether into a certain defile of difficult access and by which he was induced to lead thither the legions lightly accoutred in order to seize the prey Here a very numerous army of the enemy had posted themselves 118 LIVY secretly at all the passes  and as soon as they saw that the Romans had got into the defile they rose up sud denly with great clamor and tumult and attacked them unawares At first an event so unexpected caused some confusion while they were taking their arms and throwing the baggage into the centre but as fast as each had freed himself from his burden and fitted himself with arms they assembled about the standards from every side  and all from the long course of their service knowing their particular ranks they formed the line without any directions The consul riding up to the place where the fight was most warm leaped from his horse and called  Jupiter Mars and the other gods to witness that he had come into that place not in pursuit of any glory to himself but of booty for his soldiers  nor could any other fault be charged on him than too great a solicitude to enrich them at the expense of the enemy From the impending disgrace nothing could extricate him but the valor of the troops let them only join unanimously in a vigorous attack against a foe whom they had already vanquished in the field beaten out of their camps and stripped of their towns and who were now trying their last re source in arr attempt to overreach them by the con trivance of an ambuscade placing their reliance on the ground they occupied not on their arms But what ground what station was now unsurmountable to Ro man valor V The citadel of Fregellae and that of Sora were called to their remembrance with many other places where difficulties from situation had been sur mounted Animated by these exhortations the sol diers regardless of all obstacles advanced against the enemy posted above them  and here they underwent a good deal of fatigue in climbing the steep But as soon as the first battalions got footing in the plain on the summit and the troops perceived that they now stood on equal ground the dismay was instantly turned on the plotters  who dispersing and casting away their arms attempted by flight to recover the same lurking places in which they had lately concealed themselves HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 119 But the difficulties of the ground which had been their inducement to make choice of it now entangled them in the snares of their own contrivance  very few found means to escape twenty thousand men were slain and the victorious Romans hastened in several parties to secure the booty of cattle which the enemy had so un wisely thrown in their way 32 While such was the situation of affairs in Sam nium all the states of Etruria except the Arretians had taken arms and vigorously commenced hostilities by laying siege to Sutrium  which city being in al liance with the Romans served as a barrier against Etruria Thither the other consul jEmilius came with an army to deliver the allies from the siege The Romans on their arrival were plentifully supplied by the Sutrians with provisions carried into their camp which was pitched before the city The Etrurians spent the first day in deliberating whether they should expedite or protract the war On the day following their leaders having determined on the speedier plan in preference to the safer as soon as the sun rose dis played the signal for battle and the troops marched out to the field  which being reported to the consul he instantly commanded notice to be given that they should take refreshment and then appear under arms The order was obeyed and the consul seeing them armed and in readiness ordered the standards to be carried forth beyond the rampart and drew up his men at a small distance from the enemy Both parties stood a long time with fixed attention each waiting for the shout and fight to begin on the opposite side  and the sun had passed the meridian before a weapon was thrown by either At length rather than leave the place without something being done the shout was given by the Etrurians the trumpets sounded and the battalions advanced Nor were the Romans less alert both rushed to the fight with violent animosity the Etrurians superior in numbers the Romans in valor The battle continued a long time doubtful and great numbers fell on both sides particularly the men of 120 LIVY greatest courage nor did victory declare itself until the second line of the Romans came up fresh to the front in the place of the first who were much fatigued The Etrurian line not being supported by any fresh reserves all before and round the standards were slain and in no battle whatever would have been seen a nobler stand or a greater effusion of human blood had not the night sheltered the Etrurians who were resolutely determined to resist to death  so that the victors not the vanquished were the first who desisted from fighting After sunset the signal for retreat was given and both parties retired in the night to their camps During the remainder of the year nothing memorable was effected at Sutrium  for of the enemy s army the whole first line had been cut off the re serves only being left who were scarce sufficient to guard the camp  and among the Romans a greater number died of their wounds than had fallen in the field 33 Quintus Fabius consul for the ensuing year A U C 444 B C 308 succeeded to the command of the army at Sutrium  the colleague given to him was Caius Marcius Rutilus On the one side Fabius brought with him a reinforcement from Rome and on the other a new army had been sent for and came from home to the Etrurians Many years had now passed without any disputes between the patrician magistrates and plebeian tribunes when a contest took its rise from that family which seemed raised by fate as antagonists to the tribunes and commons of those times  Appius Claudius being censor when the eighteen months had expired which was the time limited by the Emilian law for the duration of the censorship although his colleague Caius Plautius had already resigned his office could not be prevailed on by any means to give up his There was a tribune of the commons Publius Sempronius who undertook to enforce the termination of the censorship within the lawful time by means of a legal process which was not more popular than just nor more pleasing to the people generally than to HISTORY OF ROME BOOK IX 121 every man of character in the city After frequently appealing to the jEmilian law and bestowing commen  dations on Mamercus jEmilius who in his dictator ship had been the author of it for having contracted within the space of a year and six months the censor ship which had formerly lasted five years and was a power which in consequence of its long continuance often became tyrannical he proceeded thus   Tell me Appius Claudius in what manner you would have acted had you been censor at the time when Caius Fu rius and Marcus Geganius were in that office V Appius insisted that  the tribune s question was irrelevant to his case for although the jEmilian law might biud those censors during whose magistracy it was passed because the people made that law after they had be come censors  and whatever order is the last passed by the people that is held to be the law and valid â yet neither he nor any of those who had been created censors subsequent to the passing of that law could be bound by it 34 While Appius urged such frivolous arguments as these which carried no conviction whatever the other said  Behold Romans the offspring of that Appius who being created decemvir for one year created himself for a second  and who during a third without being created even by himself or by any other held on the fasces and the government nor ceased to continue in office until the government itself ill ac quired ill administered and ill retained overwhelmed him in ruin This is the same family citizens by whose violence and injustice you were compelled to banish yourselves from your native city and seize on the Sacred Mount the same against which you provided for yourselves the protection of tribunes  the same which occasioned you to form two armies and to take post on the Aventine the same which violently opposed the laws against usury and always the agra rian laws  the same which broke through the right of intermarriage between the patricians and the commons  the same which shut up the road to curule offices 122 LIVY against the latter  this is a name more hostile to your liberty by far than that of the Tarquinii I pray you Appius Claudius this being now the hundredth year since the dictatorship of Mamercus jEmilius during which period so many men of the highest characters and abilities have filled that office did none of these ever read the twelve tables  None of them know that whatever was the last order of the people that was law Nay certainly they all knew it  and they therefore obeyed the jEmilian law rather than the old one under which the censors had been at first created  because it was the last order  and because when two laws are contradictory the new always repeals the old Do you mean to say Appius that the people are not bound by the jEmilian law or that the peo ple are bound and you alone exempted The jEmilian law bound those violent censors Caius Furius and Marcus Geganius who showed what mischief that office might do in the state  when out of resentment for the limitation of their power they disfranchised Mamercus jEmilins the first man of the age either in war or peace It bound all the censors thenceforward during the space of a hundred years It binds Caius Plautius your colleague created under the same aus pices with the same privileges Did not the people create him with the fullest privileges with which any censor ever was created Or is yours an excepted case in which this singularity peculiarly takes place  Shall the person whom you create king of the sacri fices laying hold of the style of sovereignty say that lie was created with the fullest privileges with which any king was ever created at Rome  who then do you think would be content with a dictatorship of six months Who with the office of interrex for five days  Whom would you with confidence create dictator for the purpose of driving the nail or of exhibiting games How foolish how stupid do you think those must ap pear in this man s eyes who after performing most important services abdicated the dictatorship within the twentieth day  or who being irregularly created HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 123 resigned their office  Why should I bring instances from antiquity Lately within these last ten years Caius Maenius dictator having enforced inquiries with more strictness than consisted with the safety of some powerful men a charge was thrown out by his enemies that he himself was infected with the very crime against which his inquiries were directed â now Maenius I say in order that he might in a private ca pacity meet the imputation abdicated the dictatorship I expect not such moderation in you  you will not de generate from your family of all others the most im perious and assuming  nor resign your office a day or even an hour before you are forced to it Be it so but then let no one exceed the time limited It is enough to add a day or a month to the censorship But Appius says I will hold the censorship and hold it alone three years anS six months longer than is al lowed by the jEmilian law Surely this is like ab solute power Or will you fill up the vacancy with another colleague a proceeding not allowable even in the case of the death of a censor You are not satisfied with having as if you were a religious censor hindered the most ancient solemnity and the only one instituted by the very deity to whom it is performed from being attended by priests of the highest rank but degraded it to the ministration of servants You are Dot satisfied that a family more ancient than the origin of this city and sanctified by an intercourse of hospi tality with the immortal gods has by means of you and your censorship been utterly extirpated with all its branches within the space of a year but would in volve the whole commonwealth in guilt so horrid that I dread even to  mention it This city was taken in that lustrum in which Caius Julius and Lucius Papi rius were censors On the death of Julius Papirius rather than resign his office substituted Marcus Cor nelius Maluginensis as his colleague Yet how much more moderate was his ambition Appius than yours Lucius Papirius neither held the censorship alone nor beyond the time prescribed by law But still no one LIVY has since been found who would follow his example  all censors having in case of the death of a colleague abdicated the office As for you neither the expira tion of the time of your censorship nor the resignation of your colleague nor law nor shame restrains you Your fortitude is arrogance  your boldness is a con tempt of gods and men Appius Claudius in consi deration of the dignity of that office which you have borne and of the respect due to it I should be sorry not only to offer you personal violence but even to address you in language too severe With respect to what I have hitherto said your pride and obstinacy forced me to speak And now unless you pay obe dience to the iEmilian law I shall order you to be led to prison Nor since a rule has been established by our ancestors that in the election of censors unless two shall obtain the legal number of suffrages neither shall be returned but the election deferred â will I suffer you who could not singly be created censor to hold the censorship without a colleague Having spoken to this effect he ordered the censor to be seized and borne to prison But although six of the tribunes approved of the proceeding of their colleague three gave their support to Appius on his appealing to them and he held the censorship alone to the great disgust of all ranks of men 35 While such was the state of affairs at Rome the Etrurians had laid siege to Sutrium and the consul Fabius as he was marching along the foot of the mountains with a design to succor the allies and at tempt the enemy s works if he should see it practica ble was met by their army prepared for battle The wide extended plain below showing the greatness of their force the consul in order to remedy his defi ciency in point of number by advantage of the ground changed the direction of his route a little towards the hills where the way was rugged and covered with stones and then formed his troops facing the enemy The Etrurians thinking of nothing but the multitude of their men on which alone they depended advanced HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 125 with such haste and eagerness that in order to come the sooner to a close engagement they threw away their javelins drew their swords and rushed on On the other side the Romans poured down on them sometimes javelins and sometimes stones which the place abundantly supplied so that the blows on their shields and helmets confusing even those whom they did not wound kept them from closing with their foe  and they had no missive weapons with which to act at a distance While they stood still exposed to blows against which they had no sufficient defence some even giving way and the line growing unsteady and waver ing the Roman spearmen and the first rank renewing the shout poured down on them with drawn swords This attack the Etrurians could not withstand but facing ahout fled precipitately towards their camp  when the Roman cavalry getting before them hy gal loping obliquely across the plain threw themselves in the way of their flight on which they quitted the road and hent their course to the mountains From thence in a body almost without arms and debilitated with wounds they made their way into the Ciminian forest The Romans having slain many thousands of the Etrurians and taken thirty eight military standards took also possession of their camp together with a vast quantity of spoil They then began to consider of pursuing the enemy 36 The Ciminian forest was in those days deemed as impassable and frightful as the German forests have been in latter times  not even any trader having ever attempted to pass it Hardly any besides the general himself showed boldness enough to enter it so fresh was the remembrance of the disaster at Caudium in every one s mind On this Marcus Fabius the con sul s brother some say Caeso others Claudius born of the same mother with the consul undertook to ex plore the country and to bring them in a short time an account of every particular Being educated at Caere where he had friends he was perfectly ac quainted with the Etrurian language I have seen it 196 LIVY affirmed that in those times the Roman youth were commonly instructed in the Etrurian learning as they are now in the Greek  but it is more probable that there was something very extraordinary in the person who acted so daringly a counterfeit part and mixed among the enemy It is said that his only attendant was a slave who had been bred up with him and who was therefore not ignorant of the same language They received no farther instructions at their departure than a summary description of the country through which they were to pass  to this was added the names of the principal men in the several states to prevent their being at a loss in conversation and from being discovered by making some mistake They set out in the dress of shepherds armed with rustic weapons bills and two short javelins each But though their speaking the language of the country with the fashion of their dress and arms be supposed to have concealed them it was more effectually done by the incredible circumstance of a stranger s passing the Cimiuian forest They are said to have penetrated as far as the Camertian district of the Umbrians  there the Romans ventured to own who they were and being introduced to the senate treated with them in the name of the consul about an alliance and friendship  and after being entertained with courteous hospitality were de sired to acquaint the Romans that if they came into those countries there should be provisions in readi ness for the troops sufficient for thirty days and that they should find the youth of the Camertian Umbrians prepared in arms to obey their commands When this information was brought to the consul he sent forward the baggage at the first watch ordering the legions to march in the rear of it He himself stayed behind with the cavalry and next day as soon as light ap peared rode up in a threatening manner to the posts of the enemy which had been stationed on the outside of the forest and when he had detained them there for a sufficient length of time he retired to his camp and marching out by the opposite gate overtook the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 127 main body of the army before night At the first light on the following day he had gained the summit of Mount Ciminius from whence having a view of the opulent plains of Etruria he let loose his soldiers on them When a vast body had been driven off some tumul tuary cohorts of Etrurian peasants hastily collected by the principal inhabitants of the district met the Ro mans  but in such disorderly array that these res ouers of the prey were near becoming wholly a prey themselves These being slain or put to flight and the country laid waste to a great extent the Romans returned to their camp victorious and enriched with plenty of every kind It happened that in the mean time five deputies with two plebeian tribunes had come hither to charge Fabius in the name of the se nate not to attempt to pass the Ciminian forest These rejoicing that they had arrived too late to pre vent the expedition returned to Rome with the news of its success 37 The consul by this expedition instead of bring ing the war nearer to a conclusion only spread it to a wider extent for all the tract adjacent to the foot of Mount Ciminius had felt his devastations  and out of the indignation conceived thereat had roused to arms not only the states of Etruria but the neighboring parts of Umbria They came therefore to Sutrium with such a numerous army as they had never before brought into the field  and not only ventured to en camp on the outside of the wood but earnestly desirous of coming to an engagement as soon as possible marched down to the plains to offer battle The troops being marshalled stood at first for some time on their own ground having left a space sufficient for the Romans to draw up opposite to them  but perceiving that these declined fighting they advanced to the rampart where observing that even the advanced guards had retired within the works they at once began to iusist clamor ously on their general s ordering provisions for that day to be brought down to them  for they were re solved to remain there under arms and either in the LIVY night or at all events at the dawn of day to attack the enemy s camp The Roman troops though not less eager for action were restrained by the commands of the general About the tenth hour the consul ordered his men a repast and gave directions that they should be ready in arms at whatever time of the day or night he should give the signal He then addressed a few words to them  spoke in high terms of the wars of the Samnites and contemptuously of the Etrurians who  were not he said  to be compared with other na tions either in respect of abilities as soldiers or in point of numbers Besides he had an engine at work as they should find in due time  at present it was of importance to keep it secret This he intimated in order to raise the courage of his men damped by the superiority of the enemy s force  and from their not having fortified the post where they lay the insinua tion of a stratagem formed against them seemed the more credible After refreshing themselves they went to rest and being roused without noise about the fourth watch took arms The servants following the army had axes put into their ha nds to tear down the rampart and fill up the trench The line was formed within the works and some chosen cohorts posted close to the gates Then a little before day which in sum mer nights is the time of the profoundest sleep the signal being given the rampart was levelled and the troops rushing forth fell on the enemy who were every where stretched at their length Some were put to death before they could stir others half asleep in their beds the greatest part while they ran in confu sion to arms few in short had time to defend them selves  and those who followed no particular leader nor orders were quickly routed and pursued by the Roman horse They fled different ways to the camp and to the woods The latter afforded the safer re fuge  for the former being situated in a plain was taken the same day The gold and silver was ordered to be brought to the consul the rest of the spoil was given to the soldiers On that day sixty thousand of HISTORY OF ROME BOOK IX 129 the enemy were slain or taken Some affirm that this famous battle was fought on the farther side of the Ciminian forest at Perusia and that the public had been tinder great dread lest the army might be inclosed in such a dangerous pass and overpowered by a gene ral combination of the Etrurians and Umbrians But on whatever spot it was fought it is certain that the Roman power prevailed  and in consequence thereof ambassadors came from Perusia Cortona and Arre tium which were then among the principal states of Etruria to solicit a peace and alliance with the Ro mans  and they obtained a truce for thirty years 38 During these transactions in Etruria the other consul Caius Marcius Rutilus took Allifae by storm from the Samnites and many of their forts and smaller towns were either destroyed by his arms or surren dered intire About the same time also the Roman fleet having sailed to Campania under Publius Corne lius to whom the senate had given the command on the sea coast put into Pompeii Immediately on land ing the marine soldiers set out to ravage the country about Nuceria and after they had quickly laid waste the parts which lay nearest and whence they could have returned to the ships with safety they were al lured by the temptation of plunder as it often happens to advance too far and thereby roused the enemy against them While they rambled about the country they met no opposition though they might have been cut off to a man  but as they were returning in a careless manner the peasants overtook them not far from the ships stripped them of the booty and even slew a great part of them Those who escaped were driven in confusion to the ships As the news of Fa bius having marched through the Ciminian forest had occasioned violent apprehensions at Rome so it had excited joy in proportion among the enemy in Sam mum  they talked of the Roman army being pent up and surrounded and of the Caudine forks as a model of what they were to undergo  Those people they said  ever greedy after farther acquisitions were now Liv vol ill I 130 MVY brought into inextricable difficulties  hemmed in not more effectually by the arms of their enemy than by the disadvantage of the ground Their joy was even mingled with a degree of envy because Fortune as they thought had transferred the glory of finishing the Roman war from the Samnites to the Etrurians they hastened therefore with their whole collected force to crush the consul Caius Marcius resolving if he did not give them an opportunity of fighting to proceed through the territories of the Marsians and Sabines into Etruria The consul met them and a battle was fought with great fury on both sides but without a de cisive issue Although both parties suffered severely yet the discredit of losing the day fell on the Romans because several of equestrian rank some military tri bunes with one lieutenant general had fallen  and what was more remarkable than all the consul himself was wounded This event exaggerated by report as is usual greatly alarmed the senate so that they re solved on having a dictator nominated No one enter r tained a doubt that the nomination would light on Pa pirius Cursor who was then universally deemed to possess the greatest abilities as a commander but they could not be certain either that a message might be conveyed with safety into Samnium where all was in a state of hostility or that the consul Marcius was alive The other consul Fabius was at enmity with Papirius on his own account and lest this resentment might prove an obstacle to the public good the senate voted that deputies of consular rank should be sent to him who uniting their own influence to that of go vernment might prevail on him to drop for the sake of his country all remembrance of private animosities When the deputies came to Fabius and delivered to him the decree of the senate adding such arguments as were suitable to their instructions the consul cast ing his eyes towards the ground retired in silence leaving them in uncertainty what part he intended to act Then in the silent time of the night according to the established custom be nominated Lucius Papi HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 131 rius dictator When the deputies returned him thanks for so very meritoriously subduing bis passion be still persevered in obstinate silence and dismissed them without any answer or mention of what he had done  a proof that he felt an extraordinary degree of resent ment which it cost him a violent struggle to suppress Papirius appointed Caius Junius Bubulcus master of the horse and as he was proceeding in an assembly of the curiae 1 to get an order passed respecting the command of the army an unlucky omen obliged him to adjourn it for the curia which was to vote first happened to be the Faucian remarkably distinguished by two disasters the taking of the city and the Cau dine peace  the same curia having voted first in those years in which the said events are found Licinius Macer supposes this curia ominous also on account of a third misfortune that which was experienced at the Cremera 39 Next day the dictator taking the auspices anew obtained the order Â and marching out at the head of the legions lately raised on the alarm occasioned by the army passing the Ciminian forest came to Lon gula where having received the troops of the consul Marcius he led on his forces to battle nor did the enemy seem to decline the combat However they stood under arms until night came on neither side choosing to begin the fray After this they continued a considerable time encamped near each other without coming to action neither diffident of their own strength nor despising the adversary Meanwhile the army in Etruria was fully employed  for a decisive battle was fought with the Umbrians in which the enemy was routed but lost not many men  for they did not main tain the fight with the vigor with which they began it 1 The comitia curiata or assemblies of the curiae alone had the power of conferring military command no magistrate therefore could assume the command without the previous order of their assembly In time this came to be a mere matter of form yet the practice always continued to be ob served 132 LIVY Besides this the Etrurians having made a levy of troops enforced by the sanctions of the devoting law each man choosing another came to an engagement at the Cape of Vadimon with more numerous forces and at the same time with greater spirit than they had ever shown before The battle was fought with such animosity that no javelins were thrown by either party swords alone were made use of and the fury of the combatants was still higher inflamed by the long continued contest so that it appeared to the Romans as if they were disputing not with Etrurians whom they had so often conquered but with a new race Not the least intention of giving ground appeared in any part the first lines fell and lest the standards should be exposed without defence the second lines were formed in their place At length even the last reserves were called into action  and such was the ex tremity of the difficulty and danger that the Roman cavalry dismounted and pressed forward through heaps of arms and bodies to the front ranks of the in fantry A new army as it were thus starting up disordered the battalions of the Etrurians and the rest weak as their condition was seconding this at tack broke at last through the enemy s ranks Their obstinacy then began to give way some companies quitted their posts and as soon as they once turned their backs betook themselves to open flight That day first broke the strength of the Etrurians now grown exuberant through a long course of prosperity all the flower of their men were cut off and the Ro mans without halting seized and sacked their camp 40 Equal danger and an issue equally glorious soon after attended the war with the Samnites who besides their many preparations for the field made no little glitter with new decorations of their armor Their troops were in two divisions one of which had their shields embossed with gold the other with silver The shape of the shield was this broad at the middle to cover the breast and shoulders and flat at top sloping off gradually so as to become pointed below that it HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 133 might be wielded with ease a loose coat of mail also helped to defend the breast and the left leg was co vered with a greave their helmets were adorned with plumes to add to the appearance of their stature The golden armed soldiers wore tunics of various colors  the silver armed of white linen To the latter the right wing was assigned the former took post on the left The Romans had been apprised of these splendid accoutrements and had been taught by their command ers that  a soldier ought to be rough not decorated with gold and silver but placing his confidence in his sword  that matters of this kind were in reality spoil rather than armor glittering before action but soon losing their brilliancy when besmeared with blood  that the brightest ornament of a soldier was valor that all those trinkets would follow victory  and that those rich enemies would be valuable prizes to the poorer conquerors Cursor having animated his men with these observations led them on to battle He took post himself on the right wing giving the command of the left to the master of the horse At the first onset the conflict between the two armies became desperate while the dictator and the master of the horse were eagerly contending on which wing victory should first show itself It happened that Junius first with the left wing made the right of the enemy give way this consisted of men devoted after the custom of the Sam nites and on that account distinguished by white gar ments and armor of equal whiteness Junius saying he would sacrifice these to Pluto pressed forward disordered their ranks and made an evident impres sion  which being perceived by the dictator he ex claimed  Shall the battle begin on the left wing and shall the right the dictator s own troops only second the arms of others and not claim the greatest share of the victory This spurred on the soldiers nor did the cavalry yield to the infantry in bravery nor the ardor of lieutenant generals to that of the commanders Marcus Valerius from the right wing and Publius Decius from the left both men of consular rank rode 1 34 LIVY off to the cavalry posted on the extremities of the line and exhorting them to join in putting in for a share of the honor charged the enemy on the flanks The Ro man legions on observing the confusion of the Sam nites by being thus assailed on both sides renewed the shout and rushing forcibly on them they began to fly And now the plains were quickly filled with heaps of bodies and splendid armor At first their camp re ceived the dismayed Samnites but they did not long retain even the possession of that before night it was taken plundered and burnt The dictator triumphed in pursuance of a decree of the senate  and the most splendid spectacle by far of any in his procession was the captured arms  so magnificent were they deemed that the shields adorned with gold were distributed among the owners of the silver shops to serve as em bellishments to the forum Hence it is said arose the custom of the forum being decorated by the ediles when the grand processions are made on occasion of the great games The Romans indeed converted these extraordinary arms to the honor of the gods  but the Campanians out of pride and in hatred of the foe gave them as ornaments to their gladiators who used to be exhibited as a show at their feasts and whom they distinguished by the name of Samnites During this year the consul Fabius fought with the remnants of the Etrurians at Perusia which city also had vio lated the truce and gained an easy and decisive vic tory After this he marched up to the walls of the town and would have taken it had not deputies come out and capitulated Having placed a garrison at Pe rusia and sent on before him to the Roman senate the embassies of Etruria who solicited friendship the con sul rode into the city in triumph for successes more important than those of the dictator Besides a great share of the honor of reducing the Samnites was attri buted to the lieutenant generals Publius Decius and Marcus Valerius whom at the next election the people with universal consent declared the one con sul the other pretor HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 135 41 Fabius in consideration of his extraordinary merit in the conquest of Etruria was re elected into the consulship A U C 445 B C 307 Decius was appointed his colleague Valerius was created pretor a fourth time The consuls divided the provinces be tween them Etruria fell to Decius  Samnium to Fa bins The latter having marched to Nuceria rejected the application of the people of Alfaterna who then sued for peace because they had not accepted it when offered and by force of arms compelled them to sur render A battle was fought with the Samnites who were overcome without much difficulty nor would the memory of that engagement have been preserved ex cept that in it the Marsians first appeared in arms against the Romans The defection of the Marsians was followed by that of the Pelignians who met the same fate The other consul Decius was likewise very successful in his operations  through the terror with which he inspired the Tarquinians he compelled them to supply his army with corn and to sue for a truce for forty years He took several forts from the Volsinians by assault some of which he demolished that they might not serve as receptacles to the enemy and by extending his operations through every quar ter diffused such a dread of ljis arms that the whole Etrurian nation sued to him for an alliance this they did not obtain but a truce for a year was granted them The pay of the Roman army for that year was furnished by the enemy and two tunics for each sol dier were exacted from them  this was the purchase of the truce The tranquillity now established in Etru ria was interrupted by a sudden insurrection of the Umbrians a nation which had suffered no injury from the war except what inconvenience the country had felt in the passing of the army These by calling into the field all their young men and forcing a great part of the Etrurians to resume their arms made up such a numerous force that speaking of themselves with os tentatious vanity and of the Romans with contempt they boasted that they would leave Decius behind in 13G LIVY Etruria and march away to besiege Rome  which de sign of theirs being reported to the consul Decius he removed by long marches from Etruria towards their city and sat down in the district of Pupinia in readi ness to act according to the intelligence which he might receive of the enemy s motions Nor was the insur rection of the Umbrians slighted at Rome their very threats excited fears among the people who had expe rienced in the calamities suffered from the Gauls the insecurity of the city wherein they resided Deputies were therefore despatched to the consul Fabius with directions that if he had any respite from the war of the Samnites he should with all haste lead his army into Umbria The consul obeyed the order and by forced marches proceeded to Mevania where the forces of the Umbrians then lay The unexpected arrival of the consul whom they had believed to be sufficiently employed in Samnium far distant from their country so thoroughly affrighted the Umbrians that several ad vised retiring to their fortified towns others the laying aside their arms However one district called by themselves Materina prevailed on the rest not only to retain their arms but to come to an immediate engage ment They fell on Fabius while he was fortifying his camp When the consul saw them rushing impetu ously towards his rampart he called off his men from the work and drew them up in the best manner which the nature of the place and the time allowed  en couraged them by displaying in honorable and just terms the glory which they had acquired as well in Etruria as in Samnium and bade them finish this in significant appendage to the Etrurian war and take vengeance for the impious expressions in which these people had threatened to attack the city of Rome Such was the alacrity of the soldiers on hearing this that raising the shout spontaneously they interrupted the general s discourse and without waiting for orders advanced with the sound of all the trumpets and cornets in full speed against the enemy They made their attack not as on men or at least men in arms but what must HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 137 appear wonderful in the relation began by snatching the standards out of the hands which held them  and then the standard bearers themselves were dragged to the consul and the armed soldiers hauled from the one line to the other little resistance was any where made and the business was performed not so much with swords as with their shields with the bosses of which and thrusts of their elbows they bore down the foe The prisoners were more numerous than the slain and through the whole line the Umbrians called on each other with one voice to lay down their arms Thus a surrender was made in the midst of action by the first promoters of the war and on the next and following days the other states of this people also surrendered The Ocriculans were admitted to a treaty of friendship on giving security 42 Fabius after reaping laurels in a war allotted to another led back his army into his own province And as in the preceding year the people had in con sideration of his services so successfully performed re elected him to the consulship so now the senate from the same motive notwithstanding a warm oppo sition made by Appius prolonged his command for the year following A U C 446 B C 306 in which Appius Claudius and Lucius Volumuius were consuls In some annals I find that Appius still holding the office of censor declared himself a candidate for the consulship and that his election was stopped by a pro test of Lucius Furius plebeian tribune until he re signed the censorship After his election to the con sulship the new war with the Sallentines who had taken arms being decreed to his colleague he re mained at Rome with design to increase his interest by popular intrigues since the means of procuring ho nor in war were placed in the hands of others Vo lumnius bad no reason to be dissatisfied with his pro vince  he fought many battles with good success and took several cities by assault He was liberal in his donations of the spoil and this munificence engaging in itself he enhanced by his courteous demeanor by 138 LIVY which conduct he inspired his soldiers with ardor to meet both toil and danger Quintus Fabius procon sul fought a pitched battle with the armies of the Samnites near the city of Allifae The victory was complete The enemy were driven from the field and pursued to their camp nor would they have kept possession of that had not the day been almost spent It was invested however before night and guarded until day lest any should slip away Next morning while it was scarcely clear day they proposed to capi tulate and it was agreed that such as were natives of Samnium should be dismissed with single garments AH those were sent under the yoke No precaution was taken in favor of the allies of the Samnites  they were sold by auction to the number of seven thousand Those who declared themselves subjects of the Herni cians were kept by themselves under a guard All these Fabius sent to Rome to the senate and after being examined whether it was in consequence of a public order or as volunteers that they had carried arms on the side of the Samnites against the Romans they were distributed among the states of the Latines to be held in custody  and it was ordered that the new consuls Publius Cornelius Arvina and Quintus Mar cius Tremulus who by this time had been elected should lay that affair intire before the senate A U C 447 B C 305  this gave such offence to the Hernici ans that at a meeting of all the states assembled by the Anagnians in the circus called the Maritime the whole nation of the Hernicians excepting the Alatri ans Ferentines and Verulans declared war against the Roman people 43 In Samnium also in consequence of the depar ture of Fabius new commotions arose Calatia and Sora and the Roman garrisons stationed there were taken and the prisoners treated with extreme cruelty  Bublius Cornelius was therefore sent thither with an army The command against the new enemy for by this time an order had passed for declaring war against the Anagnians and the rest of the Hernicians was de HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 139 creed to Marcius These in the beginning secured all the passes between the camps of the consul in such a manner that no messenger however expert could make his way from one to the other and each consul spent several days in absolute uncertainty and in anxious suspense concerning the state of the other Apprehensions for their safety spread even to Rome  so that all the younger citizens were compelled to en list and two regular armies were raised to answer sud den emergences The conduct of the Hernicians during the progress of the war afterwards showed no thing suitable to the present alarm or to the ancient renown of that nation Without ever making any effort worth mentioning being beaten out of three dif ferent camps within a few days they stipulated for a truce of thirty days during which they might send to Rome to the senate on the terms of furnishing two months pay and corn and a tunic to every soldier The senate referred them back to Marcius whom they empowered to determine on the affair and he accepted their submission Meanwhile in Samnium the other consul though superior in strength was very much embarrassed by the nature of his situation  the enemy had blocked up all the roads and seized on the passa ble defiles so as to stop all supplies of provisions nor could the consul though he daily drew out his troops and offered battle allure them to an engagement It was evident that neither could the Samnites support an immediate contest nor the Romans a delay of action The approach of Marcius who after he had subdued the Hernicians hastened to the succor of his colleague put it out of the enemy s power any longer to avoid fighting for they who had not deemed themselves a match in the field even for one of the armies conld surely not suppose that if they should allow the two consular armies to unite they could have any hope remaining they made an attack therefore on Marcius as he was approaching in the irregular order of march The baggage was hastily thrown together in the centre and the line formed as well as the time permitted 140 LIVY The shout which reached the post of Cornelius with the dust observed at a distance excited a bustle and hurry in his camp Ordering his men instantly to arms and leading them out to the field with the utmost haste he charged the flank of the enemy s line which had enough to do in the other dispute at the same time exclaiming that  it would be the height of infamy if they suffered Marcius army to monopolise the honor of both victories and did not assert their claim to the glory of their own war He bore down all before him and pushed forward through the midst of the enemy s line to their camp which being left without a guard he took and set on fire  and the flames of it being seen by the soldiers of Marcius and likewise by the enemy on their looking about a general flight im mediately took place among the Samnites But they could not effect an escape in any direction in every quarter they met death After a slaughter of thirty thousand men the consuls had now given the signal for retreat and were collecting into one body their several forces who were employed in mutual congratulations when some new cohorts of the enemy which had been levied for a reinforcement being seen at a distance oc casioned a renewal of the carnage On these the con querors rushed without any order of the consuls or signal received crying out that they would give these Samnites an introduction to service which they would not like The consuls indulged the ardor of the le gions well knowing that raw troops mixed with vete rans dispirited by defeat would be incapable even of attempting a contest Nor were they wrong in their judgment all the forces of the Samnites old and new fled to the nearest mountains These the Roman army also ascended so that no situation afforded safety to the vanquished they were beaten off even from the summits which they had seized And now they all with one voice supplicated for a suspension of arms On which being ordered to furnish corn for three months pay for a year and a tunic to each of the sol diers they sent deputies to the senate to sue for peace HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 141 Cornelius was left in Samnium Marcius returned into the city in triumph over the Hernicians and a decree was passed for erecting to him in the forum an equestrian statue which was placed before the temple  of Castor To three states of the Hernicians the Alatrians Verulans and Ferentines their own laws were restored because they preferred these to the being made citizens of Rome  and they were per mitted to intermarry with each other a privilege which they alone of the Hernicians for a long time after enjoyed To the Anagnians and the others who had made war on the Romans was granted the freedom of the state without the right of voting  pub lic assemblies and intermarriages were not allowed them and their magistrates were prohibited from act ing except in the ministration of public worship Du ring this year Cains Junius Bubulcus censor con tracted for the building of a temple to Health which he had vowed during his consulate in the war with the Samnites By the same person and his colleague Marcus Valerius Maximus roads were made through the fields at the public expense During the same year the treaty with the Carthaginians was renewed a third time and ample presents made to their ambassadors who came on that business 44 This year had a dictator in office Publius Cor nelius Scipio with Publius Decius Mus master of the horse By these the election of consuls was held being the purpose for which they had been created because neither of the consuls could be absent from the armies The consuls elected were Lucius Postumius and Titus Minucius A U C 448 B C 304  whom Piso places next after Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius omitting the two years in which I have set down Claudius with Volumnius and Cornelius with Marcius as consuls Whether this happened through a lapse of memory in digesting his annals or whether he purposely passed over those two consulates as deeming the accounts of them false cannot be ascertained During this year the Samnites made incursions into the district of Stellae I43 LIVY in the Campanian territory Both the consuls were therefore sent into Samnium and proceeded to different regions Postumius to Tifernum Minucius to Bovia num The first engagement happened at Tifernum where Postumius commanded Some say that the Samnites were completely defeated and twenty thou sand of them made prisoners Others that the army separated without victory on either side and that Postumius counterfeiting fear withdrew his forces privately by night and marched away to the mountains whither the enemy also followed and took possession of a stronghold two miles distant The consul having created a belief that he had come thither for the sake of a safe post and a fruitful spot and such it really was secured his camp with strong works Furnishing it with magazines of every thing useful he left a strong guard to defend it and at the third watch led away the legions lightly accoutred by the shortest road which he could take to join his colleague who lay opposite to his foe There by advice of Postumius Minucius came to an engagement and when the fight had con tinued doubtful through a great part of the day Post umius with his fresh legions made an unexpected attack on the enemy s line spent by this time with fatigue  thus weariness and wounds having rendered them incapable even of flying they were cut off to a man and twenty one standards taken The Romans then proceeded to Postumius station where the two victorious armies falling on the enemy already dis mayed by the news of what had passed routed and dis persed them  twenty six military standards were taken here and the Samnite general Statius Gellius with a great number of other prisoners and both the camps fell into the hands of the conquerors Next day Bovia nuui was besieged and soon after taken Both the consuls were honored with a triumph and with high applause of their excellent conduct Some writers say that the consul Minucius was brought back to the camp grievously wounded and that he died there  that Mar cus Fulvius was substituted consul in his place and HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 143 that it was be who being sent to command Minucius army took Bovianum During the same year Sara Arpinum and Censennia were recovered from the Sam nites The statue of Hercules the great was erected in the capitol and dedicated 45 In the succeeding consulate of Publius Sulpicius Saverrio and Publius Sempronius Sophus A U C 449 B C 303 the Samnites desirous either of a termination or a cessation of hostilities sent ambassa dors to Rome to treat of peace to whose submissive solicitations this answer was returned that  had not the Samnites frequently solicited peace at times when they were actually preparing for war their present ap plication might perhaps in the course of negotiating have produced the desired effect But now since words had bitherto proved vain people s conduct might be guided by facts that Publius Sempronius the consul would shortly be in Samnium with an army that he could not be deceived in judging whether their disposi tions inclined to peace or war He would bring the senate certain information respecting every particular and their ambassadors might follow the consul on his return from Samnium The Roman accordingly marched through all parts of Samnium found every thing in a state of peace and was liberally supplied with provisions on which a renewal of the old treaty was this year granted to the Samnites The Roman arms were then turned against the jEquans their old enemies but who bad for many years past remained quiet under a fallacious appearance of friendship The reason of making war on them was that while the Her nicians were in a state of prosperity these had in con junction with them frequently sent aid to the Sam nites and after the Hernicians were subdued almost the whole nation without dissembling that they acted by public authority had revolted to the enemy and when after the conclusion of the treaty with the Sam nites at Rome ambassadors were sent to demand satis faction they said that  this was only a trial made of them on the expectation that they would through fear 144 LIVY suffer themselves to be made Roman citizens But how much that condition was to be wished for they had been taught by the Hernicians who when they had the option preferred their own laws to the freedom of the Roman state To people who wished for liberty to choose what they judged preferable the necessity of becoming Roman citizens would have the nature of a punishment In resentment of these declarations uttered publicly in their assemblies the Roman people ordered war to be made on the jEquans  and in pro secution of this new undertaking both the consuls marched from the city and sat down at the distance of four miles from the camp of the enemy The troops of the jEquans like tumultuary recruits in consequence of their having passed such a number of years without waging war on their own account were all in disorder and confusion without established officers and without command Some advised to give battle others to de fend the camp  the greater part were influenced by Concern for the devastation of their lands likely to take place and the consequent destruction of their cities left with weak garrisons Among a variety of proposi tions they however heard one which tended to transfer every man s attention from the public interests to the care of his private concerns It recommended that at the first watch they should depart from the camp by different roads and carry all their effects into the cities where they might be secured by the strength of the fortifications this they all approved and warmly cele brated When the enemy were now dispersed through the country the Romans at the first dawn marched out to the field and drew up in order of battle but no one coming to oppose them they advanced in a brisk pace to the camp Perceiving neither guards before the gates nor soldiers on the ramparts nor the usual bustle of a camp â surprised at the extraordinary si lence they halted in apprehension of some stratagem At length passing over the rampart and finding the whole deserted they proceeded to search out the tracts of the enemy But these as they scattered themselves HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK IX 145 to every quarter occasioned perplexity at first After wards discovering their design by means of scouts they attacked their cities one after another and within the space of fifty days took intirely by force forty one towns most of which were rased and burnt and the race of the Equans almost extirpated A triumph was granted over the Equans The Marrucinians Mar sians Pelignians and Ferentans warned by the ex ample of their disasters sent deputies to Rome to so licit peace and friendship  and these states on their submissive applications were admitted into alliance 46 In the same year Caius Flavius son of Cneius grandson of a freedman a notary in low circumstances originally but artful and eloquent was appointed curule edile I find in some annals that being in at tendance on the ediles and seeing that he was voted edile by the prerogative tribe but that his name would not be received because he acted as a notary he threw down his tablet and took an oath that he would not for the future follow that business But Licinius Ma cer contends that he had dropped the employment of notary a considerable time before having already been a tribune and twice a triumvir once for regulating the nightly watch and another time for conducting a co lony However of this there is no dispute that to the contempt thrown by the nobles on the meanness of his condition he opposed much firmness He made public the rules of proceeding injudicial causes hitherto shut up in the closets of the pontiffs and hung up to public view round the forum the calendar on white tablets that all might know when business could be transacted in the courts To the great displeasure of the nobles he performed the dedication of the temple of Concord in the area of Vulcan s temple  and the chief pontiff Cornelius Barbatus was compelled by the united in stances of the people to dictate to him the form of words although he affirmed that consistently with the practice of antiquity no other than a consul or com mander in chief could dedicate a temple This occa sioned a law to be proposed to the people by direction LIV VOL III K 146 LIVY of the senate that no person should dedicate a temple or an altar without an order from the senate or from a majority of the plebeian tribunes The incident which I am about to mention would be trivial in itself were it not an instance of the freedom assumed by plebeians in opposition to the pride of the nobles Flavins coming to make a visit to his colleague who was sick some young nobles who were sitting there agreed among themselves not to pay him the compliment of rising at his entrance on which he ordered his curule chair to be brought thither and from his honorable seat of office enjoyed the sight of his enemies tortured with envy However Flavius owed his appointment to the edileship to a faction composed of the lowest class of people which had gathered strength during the censor ship of Appius Claudius for he was the first who de graded the senate by electing into it the immediate descendants of freedmen  and when he found that no one allowed that election as valid and that his conduct in the senate house had not procured him the influence in the city which it had been his principal object to attain he distributed men of the meanest order among all the several tribes and thus corrupted the assemblies both of the forum and of the field of Mars With re spect to the election of Flavius it excited great indig nation in the breasts of most of the nobles who laid aside their gold rings and bracelets in consequence of it From that time the state was split into two parties The uncorrupted part of the people who favored and supported the good held one side the faction of the rabble the other Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were then made censors and Fabius both for the sake of concord and at the same time to prevent the elections remaining in the hands of the lowest of the people purged the rest of the tribes of all the rabble of the forum and threw it into four which he ordered to be called city tribes And this procedure we are told gave such universal satisfaction that by this regulation in the orders of the state he obtained the surname of Maximus which he had not been honored with by his HISTORY OF ROME BOOK X 147 many victories The annual review of the knights on the ides of July is also said to have been projected and instituted by him BOOK X Chap 1 Under the succeeding consuls Lucius Ge nucius and ServiusCornelius A U C 450 B C 302 the state enjoyed almost uninterrupted rest from fo reign wars Colonies were led out to Sora and Alba for the latter situated in the country of the jEquans six thousand colonists were inrolled Sora had for merly belonged to the Volscian territory but had fallen into the possession of the Samnites thither were sent four thousand settlers This year the freedom of the state was granted to the Arpinians and Trebulans The Frusinonians were fined a third part of their lands because it was discovered that they had endeavored to stir up the Hernicians to rebellion  and the heads of that conspiracy after a trial before the consuls held in pursuance of a decree of the senate were beaten with rods and beheaded However that the Romans might not pass the year intirely exempt from war a little expedition was made into Umbria intelligence being received from thence that numbers of men in arms had from a certain cave made excursions into the adjacent country Into this cave the troops pene trated with their standards and the place being dark they received many wounds chiefly from stones thrown At length the other mouth of the cave being found for it was pervious both the openings were filled up with wood which being set on fire there pe rished by means of the smoke and heat no less than 148 LIVY two thousand men  many of whom at the last in at tempting to make their way out rushed into the very flames A U C 451 B C 301 The two Marci Livius Denter and iEmilius succeeding to the con sulship war broke out again with the iEquaus who being highly displeased at the colony established with in their territory as if it were a fortress to keep them in awe made an attempt with their whole force to seize it but were repulsed by the colonists themselves They caused however such an alarm at Rome that to quell this insurrection Caius Junius Bubulcus was nominated dictator for it was scarcely credible that the jEquans after being reduced to such a degree of weakness should by themselves alone have ventured to engage in a war The dictator taking the field with Marcus Titinius master of the horse in the first en gagement reduced the oEquans to submission and returning into the city in triumph on the eighth day dedicated in the character of dictator the temple of Health which he had vowed when consul and con tracted for when censor 2 During this year a fleet of Grecians under the command of Cleonymus a Lacedaemonian arrived on the coast of Italy and took Thuriae a city in the ter ritory of the Sallentines Against this enemy the consul jEmilius was sent who in one battle completely defeated them and without farther opposition drove them on board their ships Thuriae was then restored to its old inhabitants and peace re established in the coun try of the Sallentines In some annals I find that Junius Bubulcus was sent dictator into that country and that Cleonymus without hazarding an engagement with the Romans retired out of Italy He then sailed round the promontory of Brundusium and steering down the middle of the Adriatic gulf because he dreaded on the left hand the coasts of Italy destitute of harbors and on the right the Illyrians Liburnians and Istrians nations of savages and noted in general for piracy he passed on to the coasts of the Venetians Here having landed a small party to explore the HISTORTf OF ROME â BOOK X 149 country and being informed that a narrow beach stretched along the shore beyond which were marshes overflowed by the tides  that dry land was seen at no great distance level in the nearest part and rising be hind into hills beyond which was the mouth of a very deep river into which they had seen ships brought round and moored in safety this was the river Me duacus he ordered his fleet to sail into it and go up against the stream As the channel would not admit the heavy ships the troops removing into the lighter vessels arrived at a part of the country occupied by three maritime cantons of the Patavians settled on that coast Here they made a descent leaving a small guard with the ships made themselves masters of these cantons set fire to the houses drove oft a considerable booty of men and cattle and allured by the sweets of plunder proceeded still farther from the shore When news of this was brought to Patavium where the con tiguity of the Gauls kept the inhabitants constantly in arms they divided their young men into two bands one of which was led towards the quarter where the marauders were said to be busy the other by a dif ferent route to avoid meeting any of the pirates to wards the station of the ships fifteen miles distant from the town These attacked the small craft and killing the guards compelled the affrighted mariners to remove their ships to the other bank of the river By land also the attack on the dispersed plunderers was equally successful and the Grecians flying back towards their ships were opposed in their way by the Venetians Thus inclosed on both sides they were cut to pieces  and some who were made prisoners gave information that the fleet with their king Cleo nymus was but three miles distant Sending the cap tives into the nearest canton to be kept under a guard some soldiers got on board the flat bottomed vessels so constructed for the purpose of passing the shoals with ease  others threw themselves into those which had been lately taken from the enemy and proceeding down the river surrounded their unwieldy ships loO LIVY which dreaded the unknown sands and flats more than they did the Romans and which showed a greater eagerness to escape into the deep than to make re sistance The soldiers pursued them as far as the  mouth of the river and having taken and burned a part of the fleet which in the hurry and confusion had been stranded returned victorious Cleonymus hav ing met success in no part of the Adriatic sea de parted with scarce a fifth part of his navy remaining Many now alive have seen the beaks of his ships and the spoils of the Lacedaemonians hanging in the old temple of Juno In commemoration of this event there is exhibited at Patavium every year on its an niversary day a naval combat on the river in the middle of the town 3 A treaty was this year concluded at Rome with the Vestinians who solicited friendship Various causes of apprehension afterwards sprung up News arrived that Etruria was in rebellion the insurrec tion having arisen from the dissentions of the Arre tians for the Cilnian family having grown exorbi tantly powerful a party out of envy of their wealth had attempted to expel them by force of arms Ac counts were also received that the Marsians held forcible possession of the lands to which the colony of Carseoli consisting of four thousand men had been sent By reason therefore of these commotions Mar cus Valerius Maximus was nominated dictator and chose for his master of the horse Marcus Emilius Paullus This I am inclined to believe rather than that Quintus Fabius at such an age as he then was and after enjoying many honors was placed in a sta tion subordinate to Valerius but I think it not un likely that the mistake arose from the surname Maxi mus The dictator taking the field at the head of an army in one battle utterly defeated the Marsians drove them into their fortified towns and afterwards in be course of a few days took Milionia Plestina and Fresilia and then fining this people in a part of their lands granted them a renewal of the treaty HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 151 The force of the war was then directed against the Etrurians  and the dictator having gone to Rome for the purpose of renewing the auspices the master of the horse going out to forage was taken at disadvan tage by means of an ambuscade and obliged to fly shamefully into his camp after losing several stand ards and many of his men Now that such a discom fiture happened to Fabius is exceedingly improbable  not only because if in any particular certainly above all in the qualifications of a commander he fully merited his surname  but besides impressed with the recollection of Papirius severity he never could have been tempted to fight without the dictator s orders 4 The news of this disaster excited at Rome an alarm greater than the importance of the affair should seem to justify  for as if the army had been destroyed the courts were ordered to be shut guards mounted at the gates and watches set in every street and armor and weapons were heaped on the walls All the younger citizens were compelled to enlist and the dic tator was ordered to join the army There he found every thing in a more tranquil state than he expected aud regularity established through the care of the master of the horse the camp removed to a place of greater safety  the cohorts which had lost their stan dards left without tents on the outside of the ram parts and the troops ardently impatient for battle that their disgrace might be the sooner obliterated He therefore immediately decamped and advanced into the territory of Rusella Thither the enemy also followed  and although since their late success they entertained the most sanguine hopes from an open trial of strength yet they endeavored to gain also an advantage by a stratagem which they had before prac tised with success There were at a small distance from the Roman camp the half ruined houses of a town which had been burnt in the devastation of the country Among these they concealed a body of troops and then drove on some cattle within view of a Roman post commanded by a lieutenant general LIVY Cneius Fulvius This temptation not inducing any one to stir from his station one of the herdsmen ad vancing close to the works called out that others were driving out those cattle at their leisure from the ruins of the town  why did they remain idle when they might safely drive them through the middle of the Ro man camp  This being interpreted to the lieutenant general by some natives of Csere and great impatience prevailing through every company of the soldiers who nevertheless dared not to move without orders he commanded some who were skilled in the language to observe attentively whether the dialect of the herdsmen resembled that of rustics or of citizens these reported that their accent in speaking their manner and appearance were all of a more polished cast than suited such description of persons  Go then said he  tell them that they may uncover the ambush which they vainly conceal that the Romans understand all their devices and can now be no more taken by stratagem than they can be conquered by arms When these words were heard and carried to those who lay in ambush they immediately arose from their lurking place and marched out in order into the plain which was open to view on every side The lieutenant general thinking their force too powerful for his small band to cope with sent in haste to Vale rius for support and in the mean time by himself sustained the enemy s onset 5 On receiving his message the dictator ordered the standards to move and the troops to follow in arms But every thing was executed more quickly almost than ordered The men in an instant snatched up their standards and were with difficulty restrained from running impetuously on being stimulated both by indignation at their late defeat and by the shouts striking their ears with increasing vehemence as the contest grew hotter They therefore urged each other and pressed the standard bearers to quicken their pace The dictator the more eagerly he saw them push forward took the more pains to repress their HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 163 haste and ordered them to march at a slower rate On the other side the Etrurians putting themselves in motion on the first beginning of the fray had come up with their whole force  and several expresses came to the dictator one after another that all the legions of the Etrurians had joined in the fight and that his men could not any longer withstand them at the same time he himself saw from the higher ground the peril ous situation of the party Confident however that the lieutenant general was able even yet to support the dispute and considering that he himself was at hand to rescue him from defeat he wished to let the enemy be fatigued as much as might be in order that when in that state he might fall on them with his fresh troops Slowly as these marched the distance was now just sufficient for the cavalry to begin their career for a charge The battalions of the legions marched in front lest the enemy might suspect any secret or sudden movement but intervals had been left in the ranks of the infantry affording room for the horses to gallop through At the same instant the line raised the shout and the cavalry charging at full speed poured on the enemy and spread at once a ge neral panic After this as succor had arrived almost too late to the 1party surrounded so now they were allowed intire rest the fresh troops taking on them selves the whole business of the fight Nor was that either long or dubious The enemy were routed and fled to their camp which the Romans advancing to attack they crowded altogether in the remotest part of it Their flight being obstructed by the narrowness of the gates the greater number climbed up on the mounds and ramparts to try if they could either de fend themselves with the aid of the advantageous ground or get over by any means and escape One part of the rampart happening to be badly compacted sunk under the weight of the multitude who stood on it and fell into the trench On which crying out that the gods had opened that pass to give them safety they made their way out most of them leaving their 154 LIVY arms behind By this battle the power of the Etru rians was a second time effectually crushed so that engaging to furnish a year s pay and corn for two months with the dictator s permission they sent am bassadors to Rome to treat of peace This was refused but a truce for two years was granted to them The dictator returned into the city in triumph I have seen it asserted that tranquillity was restored into Etruria by the dictator without any memorable battle only by composing the dissensions of the Arretians and effecting a reconciliation between the Cilnian fa mily and the commons Marcus Valerius was elected consul before the expiration of his dictatorship many have believed without his soliciting the office and even while he was absent and that the election was held by an interrex In one point all agree that be held the consulship with Quintus Appuleius Pansa 6 During this consulate of Marcus Valerius and Quintus Appuleius affairs abroad wore a very peace able aspect Their losses sustained in war together with the truce kept the Etrurians quiet The Sam nites depressed by the misfortunes of many years had not yet become dissatisfied with their new alliance At Rome also the carrying away of such multitudes to colonies rendered the commons tranquil and light ened their burdens But that all things might not stagnate in a dead calm a contention was excited be tween the principal persons in the commonwealth pa tricians on one hand and plebeians on the other by the two Ogulnii Quintus and Cneius plebeian tri bunes who seeking every where occasions of crimi nating the patricians in the hearing of the people and having found other attempts fruitless engaged in a scheme calculated to inflame not the lowest class of the commons but their chief men the plebeians of consular and triumphal rank to the completion of whose honors nothing was now wanting but the offices of the priesthood which were not yet laid open to them A U C 452 B C 300 They therefore pub lished a proposal for a law that whereas there were HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 155 then four augurs and four pontiffs and it had heen de termined that the number of priests should be aug mented the four additional pontiffs and five augurs should all be chosen out of the commons How the college of augurs could be reduced to the number of four except by the death of two I do not understand  for it is a rule among the augurs that their number should be composed of threes so that the three ancient tribes the Ramnes Titienses and Luceres should have each its own augur or in case there should be occasion for more that each should increase its num ber of augurs in equal proportion with the rest in like mariner as when by the addition of five to four they made up the number nine so that there were three to each tribe However as it was proposed that they should be chosen out of the commons the patricians were as highly offended at the proceeding as when they saw the consulship made common  yet they pre tended that the business concerned not them so much as it did the gods  who would take care that their own worship should not be contaminated  that for their parts they only wished that no misfortune might en sue to the commonwealth But the true reason of their not making a vigorous opposition was that they were now accustomed to suffer defeat in such kind of disputes  and they saw their adversaries not as for merly grasping at objects which they could scarcely hope to reach the higher honors but already in pos session of all those advantages on the uncertain pros pect of which they had maintained the contest mani fold consulships censorships and triumphs 7 There was however a struggle between the sup porters and the opponents of the law maintained prin cipally by Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus After these had urged nearly the same topics respect ing the privileges of patricians and plebeians which had been formerly employed for and against the Lici nian law when the proposition was brought forward of opening the consulship to plebeians Decius is said to have drawn a lively description of his own father 156 LIVY such as many then present in the assembly had seen him girt in the Gabine dress standing on a spear in the attitude in which he had devoted himself for the people and the legions and to have added that  the consul Publius Decius was then deemed by the immor tal gods an offering equally pure and pious as if his colleague Titus Manlius had been devoted And might not the same Publius Decius have been with propriety chosen to perform the public worship of the Roman people  Was there any reason to appre hend that the gods would givfr less attention to his prayers than to those of Appius Claudius Did the latter perform his private acts of adoration with a purer mind or worship the gods more religiously than he  Who had any reason to complain of the vows offered in behalf of the commonwealth by so many plebeian consuls and dictators either on the commencement of their campaigns or in the heat of battle 1 Were the numbers of commanders reckoned during those years since business began to be transacted under the conduct and auspices of plebeians the same number of triumphs might be found The commons had now no reason to be dissatisfied with the behavior of such of their body as had attained nobility On the contrary they were fully convinced that in case of a sudden war breaking out the senate and people of Rome would not repose greater confidence in patrician than in plebeian com manders Which being the case said he  what god or man can deem it an impropriety if those whom you have honored with curule chairs with the purple bor dered gown with the palm vest and embroidered robe with the triumphal crown and laurel whose houses you have rendered conspicuous above others by affixing to them the spoils of conquered enemies should add to these the badges of augurs or pontiffs  If a person who has rode through the city in a gilt chariot and decorated with the ensigns of Jupiter supremely good and great has mounted the capitel should be seen with a chalice and wand  what impro priety I say that he should with his head veiled HISTORY OF HOME â BOOK X 157 slay a victim or take an augury in the citadel When in the inscription on a person s statue the consulship censorship and triumph shall be read with patience will the eyes of readers be unable to endure the addi tion of the office of augur or pontiff In truth with deference to the gods I say it I trust that we are through the kindness of the Roman people qualified in such a manner that we should by the dignity of our characters reflect back on the priesthood as much lustre as we should receive  and may demand rather on behalf of the gods than for our own sakes that those whom we worship in our private we may also worship in a public capacity 8  But why do I argue thus as if the cause of the patricians respecting the priesthood stood on untouched ground and as if we were not already in possession of one sacerdotal office of the highest class  We see plebeian decemvirs for performing sacrifices interpre ters of the sibylline prophecies and of the fates of the nation we also see them presidents of Apollo s festi val and of other religious performances Neither was any injustice done to the patricians when to the two commissioners for performing sacrifices an additional number was joined in favor of the plebeians nor is there now when a tribune a man of courage and acti vity wishes to add five places of augurs and four of pontiffs to which plebeians may be nominated  not Appius with intent to expel you from your places but that men of plebeian rank may assist you in the ma nagement of divine affairs with the same zeal with which they assist you in matters of human concern ment Blush not Appius at having a man

master of the horse A Sabine adventurer the first origin of your nobility either Attus Clausus or Appius Claudius which you will was admitted by the ancient patricians of those days into their number do not then on your part LIVY disdain to admit us into the number of priests We bring with us numerous honors all those honors in deed which have rendered your party so proud Lu cius Sextius was the first consul chosen out of the plebeians Caius Licinius Stolo the first master of the horse Caius Marcius Rutilus the first dictator and likewise censor  Quintus Publilius Philo the first pre tor On every one of these occasions was heard a re petition of the same arguments that the right of aus pices was vested in you  that you alone had the rights of ancestry  that you alone were legally intitled to the supreme command and the auspices both in peace and war The supreme command has hitherto been and will continue to be equally prosperous in plebeian hands as in patrician Have you never heard it said that the first created patricians were not men sent down from heaven but such as could cite their fathers that is nothing more than free born I can now cite my father a consul and my son will be able to cite a grandfather Citizens their opposition means nothing else than that we should never obtain any thing with out a previous refusal The patricians wish only for a dispute nor do they care what issue their disputes may have For my part be it advantageous happy and prosperous to you and to the commonwealth lam df opinion that this law should receive your sanction 9 The people ordered that the tribes should be in stantly called and there was every appearance that the law would be accepted It was deferred however for that day by a protest from which on the day fol lowing the tribunes were deterred and it passed with the approbation of a vast majority The pontiffs created were Publius Decius Mus the advocate for the law  Publius Sempronius Sophus Caius Marcius Rutilus and Marcus Livius Deuter The five augurs who were also plebeians were Caius Genucius Publius jElius Paetus Marcus Minucius Fessus Caius Mar cius and Titus Publilius Thus the number of the pontiffs was made eight that of the augurs nine In the same year Marcus Valerius consul procured a I HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 159 law to be passed concerning appeals more carefully enforcing the observance of it by additional sanctions This was the third time since the expulsion of the kings of this law being introduced and always by the same family The reason for renewing it so often was I believe no other than that the influence of a few was apt to prove too powerful for the liberty of the com mons However the Porcian law seems intended solely for the security of the persons of the citizens a severe penalty being thereby enacted against beating with stripes or putting to death a Roman citizen The Valerian law after forbidding a person who had appealed to be beaten with rods and beheaded added in case of any one acting contrary thereto that it shall yet be only deemed a wicked act This I suppose was judged of sufficient strength to enforce obedience to the law in those days so powerful was then men s sense of shame at present one would scarcely make use of such a threat seriously even on any ordinary occasion The jEquans rebelling the same consul conducted the war against them in which no memo rable event occurred for except ferocity they re tained nothing of their ancient condition The other consul Appuleius invested the town of Nequinum in Umbria The ground the same whereon Narnia now stands was so steep on one side even perpendicular as to render the town impregnable either by assault or works A U C 453 B C 299 That business therefore came unfinished into the hands of the suc ceeding consuls Marcus Fulvius Pretinus and Titus Manlius Torquatus We are told by Licinius Macer and Tubero that all the centuries named Quintus Fa bius though not a candidate consul for that year  but that he himself recommended to them to postpone the conferring the consulship on him until a year wherein there might be more employment for their arms  add iug that during the present year he might be more useful in the management of a city magistracy and thus neither dissembling what he aimed at nor yet making direct application for it he was appointed cu ICO LIVV rule edile with Lucius Papirius Cursor This I cannot aver as certain because Piso a more ancient writer of annals asserts that the curule ediles of that year were Caius Doinitius Calvinus son of Cneius and Spurius Carvilius Maximus son of Caius I am of opinion that this latter surname caused a mistake concerning the ediles  and that thence followed a story conform able to this mistake patched up out of the two elec tions of the ediles and of the consuls The general survey was performed this year by Publius Sempro nius Sophus and Publius Sulpicius Saverio censors and two tribes were added the Aniensian and Teren tine Such were the occurrences at Roige1 10 Meanwhile after much time had been lost in the tedious siege of Nequinum two of the townsmen whose houses were contiguous to the wall having formed a subterraneous passage came by that private way to the Roman advanced guards and being con ducted thence to the consul offered to give admittance to a body of armed men within the works and walls The proposal was thought to be such as ought neither to be rejected nor yet assented to without caution  With one of these men the other being detained as a hostage two spies were sent through the mine and certain information being received from them of the practicability of the design three hundred men in arms guided by the deserter entered the city and seized by night the nearest gate  which being broken open the Roman consul and his army took possession of the city without any opposition In this manner came Nequinum under the dominion of the Roman people A colony was sent thither as a barrier against the Umbrians and called Narnia from the river Nar The troops returned to Rome with abundance of spoil This year the Etrurians made preparations for war in violation of the truce But a vast army of the Gauls making an irruption into their territories while their attention was directed to another quarter suspended for a time the execution of their design They then relying on the abundance of money which they pos HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 1G1 sessed laid themselves out to make friends of the Gauls instead of enemies  in order that with their armies combined they might attack the Romans The barbarians made no objection to the alliance and a negotiation was opened for settling the price which being adjusted and paid the Etrurians having every thing else in readiness for commencing their opera tions desired them to accompany them in their march But this they refused alleging that  they had stipu lated a price for their assistance against the Romans  that the payment already made they had received in consideration of their not wasting the Etrurian terri tory or using their arms against the inhabitants that notwithstanding if it was the wish of the Etrurians they were still willing to engage in the war but on no other condition than that of being allowed a share of their lands and obtaining at length some permanent settlement Many assemblies of the states of Etruria were held on this subject without being able to come to any conclusion  not so much by reason of their aversion from the dismemberment of their territory as of the dread which every one felt of the consequences if they should fix in so close vicinity to themselves people of such a savage race The Gauls were there fore dismissed and carried home an immense sum of money acquired without toil or danger The report of a Gallic tumult in addition to an Etrurian war had caused serious apprehensions at Rome and with the less hesitation on that account an alliance was con cluded with the state of the Picentians 11 The province of Etruria fell by lot to the consul Titus Manlius who when he had but just entered the enemy s country as he was exercising the cavalry in wheeling about at full speed was thrown from his horse and almost killed on the spot three days after he died The Etrurians embracing this omen as it were of the future progress of the war and observing that the gods had commenced hostilities on their be half assumed new courage At Rome the news caused great affliction on account both of the loss of such a LIV VOL III L 162 LIVY man and of the unseasonableness of the juncture in somuch that the senate would have proceeded to order a dictator to be created but that an assembly held for the purpose of substituting a new consul was con ducted agreeably to the wishes of people of the first consequence All the votes and centuries concurred unanimously in appointing Marcus Valerius consul the same whom the senate would have ordered to be made dictator They then commanded him to proceed immediately into Etruria to the legions His coming gave such a check to the Etrurians that not one of them dared thenceforward to appear on the outside of their trenches their own fears operating as a blockade Nor could the new consul by wasting their lands and burning their houses draw them out to an engage ment  for not only country houses but numbers of their towns were seen smoking and in ashes on every side While this war proceeded more slowly than had been expected an account was received of the break ing out of another which was not without reason regarded as terrible in consequence of the heavy losses formerly sustained by both parties This account given by their new allies the Picentians was that the Sam Miles were taking measures for a renewal of hostilities and that they themselves had been solicited to join therein The Picentians received the thanks of the state  and a large share of the attention of the senate was turned from Etruria towards Samnium The pub  lie suffered also much distress from the dearness of provisions and would have felt the extremity of want according to the relation of those who make Fabius Maximus curule edile that year had not the vigilant activity of that man such as he had on many occasions displayed in the field been exerted now with equal zeal at home in the management of the market and in procuring and forming magazines of corn An inter regnum took place this year the reason of which is  not mentioned Appius Claudius and after him Publius Sulpicius were interreges A U C 464 B C 2S 8 The latter held an election of consuls and HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 103 chose Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Cneius Fulvius In the beginning of this year ambassadors came from the Lucanians to the new consuls with complaints that  the Samnites finding that they could not by any offers tempt them to take part in the war had marched an army in a hostile manner into their country which they were now laying waste  intending by these vio lent measures to force them into a compliance They declared that the nation of the Lucanians thought their former errors too many and were so firmly fixed in their resolution that they would rather undergo every kind of suffering and hardship than ever again violate the reverence due to the Roman name besought the senate to take the people of Lucania into their protec tion and defend them from the injustice and outrage of the Samnites and that on their part though the undertaking a war with the Samnites imposed on them a necessity of being faithful to the Romans they were nevertheless willing to give hostages 12 The deliberation of the senate was short They all to a man concurred in opinion that a compact should be entered into with the Lucanians and satis faction demanded from the Samnites accordingly a favorable answer was returned to the Lucanians and the alliance concluded Heralds were then sent to re quire of the Samnites that they should depart from the country of the allies and withdraw their troops from the Lucanian territory These were met by persons despatched for the purpose by the Samnites who gave them warning that  if they appeared at any assembly in Samnium they must not expect to depart in safety As soon as this was heard at Rome the senate voted and the people ordered that war should be declared against the Samnites The consuls then dividing the provinces between them Etruria fell to Scipio the Samnites to Fulvius and they set out by different routes each against the enemy allotted to him Sci pio while he expected a tedious campaign like that of the preceding year was met near Volaterra by the Etrurians in order of battle The fight lasted through 164 LIVY the greater part of the day while very many fell on both sides and night came on before it could be disco vered to which side victory inclined But the follow ing dawn showed the conqueror and the vanquished for the Etrurians had decamped in the dead of the night The Romans marching out with intent to re new the engagement and seeing their superiority ac knowleged by the departure of the enemy advanced to their camp and finding even this fortified post de serted took possession of it together with a vast quantity of spoil The consul then leading back his forces into the Faliscian territory and leaving his baggage with a small guard at Falerii set out with his troops lightly accoutred to ravage the enemy s coun try  and not only was the ground laid waste but their forts also and smaller towns were destroyed by fire He did not however lay siege to the cities into which the Etrurians had been hurried by their fears The other consul Fulvius fought the Samnites at Bovia num where he gained great honor and a complete victory Then attacking the town and soon after Au fidena he took both by assault This year a colony was carried out to Carseoli in the territory of the jEquicolae The consul Fulvius triumphed on his de feat of the Samnites 13 Shortly before the election of consuls a report prevailed that the Etrurians and Samnites were raising vast armies that the leaders of the Etrurians were in all their assemblies openly censured for not having procured the aid of the Gauls on any terms  and the magistrates of the Samnites arraigned for having op posed to the Romans an army destined to act against the Lucanians That in consequence the people were rising up in arms with all their own strength and that of their allies combined  and that this affair seemed not likely to be terminated without a contest of much greater difficulty than the former Although the candi dates for the consulship were men of illustrious cha racters yet this alarming intelligence turned the thoughts of all on Quintus Fabius Maximus who HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 165 sought not the employment at first and afterwards when he discovered their wishes even declined it  Why said he  should they impose such a difficult task on him who was now in the decline of life and had passed through a full course of labors and of the rewards of labor Neither the vigor of his body nor of his mind remained the same  and he dreaded For tune herself lest some god should think her too bounti ful to him and more constant than the course of human affairs allowed He had himself succeeded in gradual succession to the dignities of his predecessors and he beheld with great satisfaction others rising up to suc ceed to his There was no scarcity at Rome either of honors suited to men of the highest merit or of men of eminent merit suited to the highest honors This dis interested conduct instead of repressing increased while in fact it justified their zeal But thinking that this ought to be checked by respect for the laws he ordered that clause to be read aloud by which it is for bidden that the same person shall be re elected consul within ten years Such a clamor now arose that the law was scarcely heard  and the tribunes of the com mons declared that this  decree should be no impedi ment  for they would propose an order to the people that he should be exempted from the obligation of the laws Still he persisted in his opposition asking  To what purpose were laws enacted if they were eluded by the very persons who procured them  The laws now he said 1 instead of being rulers were overruled The people nevertheless proceeded to vote and as soon as each century was called in it immediately named Fabius consul Then at length overcome by the universal wish of the state he said  Romans may the gods approve your present and all your future proceedings But since with respect to me you intend to act according to your own wills let my interest find room with you with respect to my colleague I ear nestly request that you will place in the consulship with me Publius Decius a man with whom I have already experienced the utmost harmony in our joint MVY administration of that office  a man worthy of you worthy of his father The recommendation was deemed well founded and all the remaining centuries voted Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius consuls This year great numbers were prosecuted by the ediles for having in possession larger quantities of land than the state allowed and hardly any were acquitted by which means a very great restraint was laid on exor bitant covetousness 14 Whilst the new consuls A U C 455 B C 297 Quintus Fabius Maximus a fourth and Publius De cius Mus a third time were settling between them selves as to which should command against the Sam nites and which against the Etrurians and what num ber of forces would be sufficient for this and for that province and which would be the fitter commander in each war ambassadors arrived from Sutrium Ne pete and Falerii with intelligence that the states of Etruria were holding assemblies on the subject of suing for peace In consequence of this information the whole force of their arms was directed against Sam nium The consuls took different routes in order to secure the more ready supply of provisions and to leave the enemy in the greater uncertainty on what quarter the war would fall Fabius led his legions to wards Samnium through the territory of Sora and De cius his through that of Sidicinum As soon as they arrived at the frontiers both advanced briskly spread ing devastation wherever they came  but still took care to explore the country to a distance beyond where the troops were employed in plundering The enemy had posted themselves in readiness for battle in a retired valley near Tifernum  intending as soon as the Ro mans should enter it to fall on them with advantage of the ground  but they escaped the snare Fabius send ing away his baggage to a place of safety and setting a small guard over it gave notice to his soldiers that a battle was at hand and advanced to the place where he had been told the enemy lay in ambush The Sam nites disappointed in the hope of making an unex HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X  167 pected attack determined on a regular engagement They therefore marched out into the plain  and with a greater share of spirit than of hopes committed them selves to the disposal of fortune However whether in consequence of their having drawn together from every state the whole of the force which it possessed or that the consideration of their all being at stake heightened their courage they maintained even in open fight a formidable struggle Fabius when he saw that the enemy in no place gave way ordered his son Maximus and Marcus Valerius military tribunes with whom he hastened to the front to seek the cavalry and to exhort them that  if they remembered any in stance wherein the public had received advantage from the service of the horsemen they would on that day exert themselves to preserve inviolate the renown of that body  telling them that the enemy stood immova ble against the efforts of the infantry and the only hope remaining was in the charge of horse He ad dressed particularly both these youths and with the same cordiality loading them with praises and pro mises At the same time considering that in case that effort should a1so fail it would be necessary to accom plish by stratagem what his strength could not effect he ordered Scipio one of his lieutenants general to draw off the spearmen of the first legion out of the line to lead them round as secretly as possible to the nearest mountains  and in such direction as he could ascend without being seen to gain the heights and show himself suddenly on the rear of the enemy while their attention should be employed on the front The cavalry led on by the tribunes rushing forward unex pectedly before the van caused scarcely more confusion among the enemy than among their friends The line of the Samnites stood firm against the furious onset of the squadrons  it neither could be driven from its ground nor broken in any part The cavalry finding their attempts fruitless withdrew from the fight and retired behind the line of infantry On this the enemy assumed new spirits with increasing confidence in their 168 LIVY own prowess so that the Roman troops in the van would not have been able to support the contest had not the second line by the consul s order come up into the place of the first These fresh troops checked the progress of the Samnites who had now began to gain ground  and at this seasonable juncture their comrades appearing suddenly on the mountains and raising a shout occasioned in the Samnites a fear of greater danger than really threatened them Fabius called out aloud that his colleague Decius was ap proaching  on which all the soldiers elated with joy repeated eagerly that the other consul was come the legions were arrived This artifice while it produced a happy effect on the Romans filled the Samnites with such dismay that they thought of nothing but flight for they dreaded above all things lest fatigued as they were they should be overpowered by another army fresh and unhurt As they dispersed themselves on every side there was less effusion of blood than might have been expected considering the completeness of the victory There were three thousand four hundred slain  about three hundred and thirty made prisoners and twenty three military standards taken 15 The Apulians would have joined their forces to the Samnites before this battle had not the consul Publius Decius encamped in their neighborhood at Maleventum and finding means to bring them to an engagement put them to the rout Here likewise there was more of flight than of bloodshed Two thou sand of the Apulians were slain  but Decius despising such an enemy led his legions into Samnium There the two consular armies overrunning every part of the country during the space of five months laid it intirely waste There were in Samnium forty five places where Decius and eighty six where the other consul en camped Nor did they leave traces only of having been there as ramparts and trenches but other dread ful mementos of itâ general desolation and regions de populated Fabius also took the city of Cimetre where he made prisoners two thousand four hundred soldiers HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 169 and there were slain in the assault about four hundred and thirty Going thenoe to Rome to preside at the elections he used all expedition in despatching that business All the first called centuries voted Quintus Fabius consul Appius Claudius was a candidate a man of consular rank daring and ambitious and as he wished not more ardently for the attainment of that honor for himself than he did that the patricians might recover the possession of both places in the consulship he labored with all his own power supported by that of the whole body of the nobility to prevail on them to appoint him consul along with Quintus Fabius To this Fabius objected giving at first the same reasons which be had advanced the year before The nobles then all gathered round his seat and besought him to raise up the consulship out of the plebeian mire and to restore both to the office itself and to the patrician rank their original dignity Fabius then procuring silence allayed their warmth by a qualifying speech declaring that  he would have so managed as to have received the names of two patricians if he had seen an intention of appointing any other than himself to the consulship As things now stood he would not set so bad a precedent as to admit his own name among the candidates such a proceeding being contrary to the laws A U C 456 B C 296 Whereon Appius Claudius and Lucius Volumnius a plebeian who had likewise been colleagues in that office before were elected consuls The nobility reproached Fabius for declining to act in conjunction with Appius Claudius because he evidently excelled him in eloquence and political abilities 16 When the election was finished the former con suls were continued in command for six months and ordered to prosecute the war in Samnium Accord ingly during this next year in the consulate of Lucius Volumnius and Appius Claudius Publius Decius who had been left consul in Samnium by his colleague continued in the character of proconsul to spread de vastation in like manner as in the preceding year 170 LIVY through all parts of that country  until at last he drove the army of the Samnites which never dared to face him in the field intirely out of the country Thus expelled from home they bent their route to Etruria  and supposing that the business which they had often in vain endeavored to accomplish by embassies might now be negotiated with more effect when they were backed by such a powerful armed force and could in termix terror with their intreaties they demanded a meeting of the chiefs of Etruria  which being assem bled they set forth the great number of years during which they had waged war with the Romans in the cause of liberty  they had they said  endeavored with their own strength to sustain the weight of so great a war they had also made trial of the support of the adjoining nations which proved of little avail Unable longer to maintain the conflict they had sued to the Roman people for peace  and had again taken up arms because they felt peace attended with servi tude more grievous than war with liberty They had one only hope remaining which was the support which they expected from the Etrurians They knew that nation to be the most powerful in Italy in respect of arms men and money  to have the Gauls their closest neighbors born in the midst of war and arms of furi ous courage both from their natural temper and par ticularly against the people of Rome whom they boasted without infringing the truth of having made their prisoners and of having ransomed for gold If the Etrurians possessed the same spirit which formerly animated Porsena and their ancestors there was no thing to prevent their expelling the Romans from all the lands on this side of the Tiber and compelling them to fight for their own existence and not for the intolerable dominion which they assumed over Italy The Samnite army had come t6 them in readiness for action furnished with arms and subsistence and were willing to follow that instant even should they lead to the attack of the city of Rome itself 17 While they were engaged in these represents HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 171 tions and intriguing at Etruria the operations of the Romans in their own territories distressed them se verely  for Publius Decius when informed by his scouts of the departure of the Samnite army called a council and there said  Why do we ramble through the country carrying the war from one village to ano ther Why not attack the cities and fortified places No army now guards Samnium They have fled they are gone into voluntary exile The proposal being universally approved he marched to attack Murgantia a city of considerable strength  and so great was the ardor of the soldiers resulting from their affection to their commander and from their hopes of richer trea sure than could be found in pillaging the country places that in one day they took it by assault Here two thousand one hundred of the Samnites making resistance were surrounded and taken prisoners and abundance of other spoil fell into the hands of the vic tors Decius not choosing that the troops should be incumbered in their march with such heavy baggage ordered them to be called together and said to them  Do you intend to rest satisfied with this single vic tory and this booty or do you choose to cherish hopes proportioned to your bravery 1 All the cities of the Samnites and the property left in them are your own  since after so often defeating their legions you have finally driven them out of the country Sell those effects in your hands  and allure traders by a prospect of profit to follow you on your march I will from time to time supply you with goods for sale Let us go hence to the city of Itomulea where no great labor but greater gain awaits you They accordingly sold off the spoil and warmly adopting the general s plan proceeded to Romulea This town likewise was taken without works or engines and plundered  for as soon as the battalions approached it nothing could hinder the soldiers from mounting the walls  but hastily ap plying ladders they forced their way over the fortifi cations Two thousand three hundred men were slain six thousand taken prisoners and abundance of spoil LIVY fell into the hands of the soldiers This they were ob liged to sell in like manner as the former and though no rest was allowed them they proceeded never theless with the utmost alacrity to Ferentinum But here they met a greater share both of difficulty and danger the garrison made a vigorous defence and the place was strongly fortified both by nature and art However the soldiers now inured to plunder over came every obstacle Three thousand of the enemy were killed round the walls and the spoil was given to the troops In some annals the principal share of the honor of taking these cities is attributed to Maximus They say that Murgantia was taken by Decius Ro mulea and Ferentinum by Fabius Some ascribe this honor to the new consuls others not to both but to one of theseâ Lucius Volumnius whose province they say Samnium was 18 While things went on thus in Samnium and whoever it was that had the command and auspices another powerful combination composed of many states was formed in Etruria against the Romans the chief promoter of which was Gellius Egnatius a Sam nite Almost all the Etrurians had united in this hos tile design The neighboring states of Umbria were drawn in as it were by contagion  and auxiliaries were procured from the Gauls for hire all their seve ral numbers assembled at the camp of the Samnites When intelligence of this sudden commotion was re ceived at Rome the consul Lucius Volumnius had already set out for Samnium with the second and third legions and fifteen thousand of the allies  it was therefore resolved that Appius Claudius should without loss of time go into Etruria He took with him two Roman legions the first and fourth and twelve thousand allies and encamped at a small dis tance from the enemy However his early arrival though productive of one good effect the restraining by dread of the Roman name several states of Etru ria who were inclined to war yet was not followed by any very judicious or successful enterprise Several HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 173 battles were fought at times and places unfavorable and increasing confidence rendered the enemy daily more formidable  so that matters came nearly to such a state as that neither could the soldiers rely much on their leader nor the leader on his soldiers It ap pears in three several histories that a letter was sent by the consul to call his colleague from Samnium But I will not affirm what requires stronger proofs that point having been disputed between these two consuls a second time associated in the same office Appius denying that he sent any such and Volumnius affirming that he was called thither by a letter from him Volumnius had by this time taken three forts in Samnium in which three thousand of the enemy had been slain and about half that number made pri soners and a sedition having been raised among the Lucanians by the plebeians and the more indigent of the people be had to the great satisfaction of the nobles quelled it by sending thither Quintus Fabius proconsul with his own veteran army He left to Decius the ravaging of the country and proceeded with his troops into Etruria to his colleague where on his arrival the army in general received him with joy Appius if he did not write the letter being con scious of this had in my opinion just ground of dis pleasure  but if he had actually sent for assistance his disowning it as he did arose from an illiberal and ungrateful mind  for on going out to receive him when they had scarcely exchanged salutations he said  Is all well Lucius Volumnius How stand affairs in Samnium  What motive induced you to re move out of your province Volumnius answered that  affairs in Samnium were in a prosperous state and that he had come thither in compliance with the re quest in his letter Cut if that were a forged letter and that there was no occasion for him in Etruria he would instantly face about and depart  You may depart replied the other  no one detains you for it is a perfect inconsistency that when perhaps you are scarcely equal to the management of the war al 174 LIVY lotted to yourself you should vaunt of coming hither to succor others To this Volumnius rejoined  May Hercules direct all for the hest for his part he was better pleased that he had taken useless trouble than that any conjuncture should have arisen which bad made one consular army insufficient for Etruria 19 As the consuls were parting the lieutenants general and tribunes of Appius army gathered round them Some intreated their own general that he would not reject the voluntary offer of his colleague s assistance which he ought to have solicited the greater number used their endeavors to stop Volum nius beseeching him  not through a peevish dispute with his colleague to abandon the interest of the com monwealth  and represented to him that in case any misfortune should happen the blame would fall on the person who forsook the other not on the one forsaken  that the state of affairs was such that the credit and discredit of every success and failure in Etruria would be attributed to Lucius Volumnius  for no one would inquire what were the words of Appius but what the situation of the army Appius indeed had dismissed him but the commonwealth and the army required his stay Let him only make trial of the inclinations of the soldiers By such admonitions and intreaties they in a manner dragged the consuls to an assembly There longer discourses were made to the same pur port as had passed before in the presence of a few As Volumnius had the advantage of the argument so  did he show himself not deficient in oratory in despite of the extraordinary eloquence of his colleague On which Appius observed with a sneer that they ought to acknowlege themselves indebted to him in having a consul who among his other qualifications possessed eloquence also instead of being dumb and speechless as he was in their former consulate when particu larly during the first months he was not able so much as to open his lips  but now in his harangues even aspired after popularity Volumnius replied  How much more earnestly do I wish that you had learned HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 175 from me to act with spirit than I from you to speak with elegance I now make you a final proposal which will demonstrate not which is the better orator for that is not what the public wants but which is the better commander The provinces are Etruria and Samnium  make your choice  I with my own army will undertake to manage the business of either The soldiers then with loud clamors requested that they would in conjunction carry on the war in Etruria  when Volumnius perceiving that it was the general wish said  Since I have been mistaken in apprehend ing my colleague s meaning I will take care that there shall be no room for mistake with respect to the pur port of your wishes Signify by a shout whether you choose that I should stay or depart On this a shout was raised so loud that it brought the enemy out of their camp they snatched up their arms and marched forward in order of battle Volumnius likewise or dered the signal to be sounded and his troops to take the field It is said that Appius hesitated perceiving that whether he fought or remained inactive his col league would enjoy the honor of the victory and that afterwards dreading lest his own legions should follow Volumnius with the rest he gave the signal at the earnest desire of his men On neither side were the forces drawn up to advantage  for on the one Gellius Egnatius the Samttite general had gone out to forage with a few cohorts and his men entered on the fight as the violence of their passions prompted rather than under any directions or orders On the other the Roman armies neither marched out toge ther nor had time sufficient to form  Volumnius be gan to engage before Appius came up consequently their front in the battle was uneven  and by some ac cidental interchange of their usual opponents the Etrurians fought against Volumnius  and the Sam nites after delaying some time on account of the ab sence of their general against Appius We are told that Appius during the heat of the fight raising his Lauds towards heaven so as to be seen in the foremost 176 LIVY ranks prayed thus â Bellona if thou grantest us the victory this day I vow to thee a temple And that after this vow as if inspirited by the goddess he dis played a degree of courage equal to that of his col league and of the troops The generals performed every duty and each of their armies exerted with emulation its utmost vigor lest the other should be first victorious They therefore quickly broke and defeated the enemy who were ill able to withstand a force so much superior to any with which they had been accustomed to contend then pressing them as they gave ground and pursuing them closely as they fled they drove them into their camp There Gelliua and his Samnite cohorts interposing the fight was re newed for a time with some warmth But these being likewise soon dispersed the conquerors advanced to storm the camp  and Volumnius in person leading his troops against one of the gates while Appius fre quently invoking Bellona the victorious inflamed the courage of his men neither rampart nor trenches could prevent their breaking in The camp was taken and plundered and the spoil of which great abun dance was found was given up to the soldiers Of the enemy seven thousand three hundred were slain  and two thousand one hundred and twenty taken 20 While both the consuls with the whole force of the Romans pointed their exertions principally against their enemies in Etruria a new army was set on foot in Samnium  and with design to ravage the frontiers of the Roman empire passed over through the coun try of the Vescians into the Campanian and Faler nian territories where they committed great depreda tions Volumnius as he was hastening back to Sam nium by forced marches because the term for which Fabius and Decius had been continued in command was nearly expired heard of this army of Samnites and of the mischief which they had done in Campania determining therefore to afford protection to the al lies he altered his route towards that quarter When he arrived in the district of Cales he found marks of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 177 their recent ravages  and the people of that town in formed him that the enemy carried with them such a quantity of spoil that they could scarcely observe any order in their march  and that the commanders then directed publicly that the troops should go immedi ately to Samnium deposit the booty there and return to the business of the expedition as an engagement must not be hazarded while they were so heavily laden Notwithstanding that this account carried every appearance of truth he yet thought it necessary to obtain more certain information accordingly he de spatched some horsemen to seize on some of the strag gling marauders from these he learned on inquiry that the enemy lay at the river Vulturnus  that they intended to remove thence at the third watch  and that their route was towards Samnium On receiving this intelligence which could be depended on he put his troops in motion and sat down at such a distance from the enemy as was sufficient to prevent their dis covering his approach and at the same time left it in his power to surprise them as they should be coming out of their camp A long time before day he drew nigh to their post and sent persons who understood the Oscan language to discover how they were em ployed  these mixing with the enemy which they could easily do during the confusion in the night found that the standards had gone out thinly attended that the booty and those appointed to guard it were then setting out a contemptible train  each busied about his own affairs without any concert with the rest or much regard to orders This the consul judged the fittest lime for the attack and daylight now approaching he gave orders to sound the charge and fell on the enemy as they were marching out The Samnites being embarrassed with the spoil and very few armed were at a loss how to act Some quickened their pace and drove the prey before them  others baited deliberating whether it would be safer to advance or to return again to the camp  and while they hesitated they were overtaken and cut off The liv  vol in M 178 LIVY Romans had by this time passed over the rampart and filled the camp with slaughter and confusion the Samnite army had their disorder increased by a sud den insurrection of their prisoners some of whom getting loose set the rest at liberty while others snatched the arms which were tied up among the bag gage and being intermixed with the troops raised a tumult more terrible than the battle itself They then performed a memorable exploit for making an attack on Statins Minacius the general as he was passing between the ranks and encouraging his men they dis persed the horsemen who attended him gathered round himself and dragged him sitting on his horse a prisoner to the Roman consul This brought back the foremost battalions of the Samnites and the bat tle which seemed to have been already decided was renewed  but they could not support it long Six thousand of them were slain and two thousand fire hundred taken among whom were four military tri bunes together with thirty standards and what gave the conquerors greater joy than all seven thousand four hundred prisoners were recovered The spoil which had been taken from the allies was immense and the owners were summoned by a proclamation to claim and receive their property On the day ap pointed all the effects the owners of which did not appear were given to the soldiers who were obliged to sell them in order that they might have nothing to think of but their duty 21 The depredations committed on the lands of Campania had occasioned a violent alarm at Rome and it happened that about the same time intelligence was brought from Etruria that after the departure of Volumnius army all that country had risen up in arms together with Gellius Egnatius the leader of the Samnites that the Umbrians were invited to join in the insurrection and the Gauls tempted with high offers Terrified at this news the senate ordered the courts of justice to be shut and a levy to be made of men of every description Accordingly not only free HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 17 Â born men and the younger sort were obliged to enlist but cohorts were formed of the elder citizens and the sons of freedmen were incorporated in the centuries Plans were formed for the defence of the city and the chief command committed to the pretor Publius Sem pronius However the senate was exonerated of one half of their anxiety by a letter from the consul Lu cius Volumnius informing them that the army which had ravaged Campania had been defeated and dis persed  whereon they decreed a public thanksgiving for this success in the name of the victors The courts were opened after having been shut eighteen days and the thanksgiving was performed with much joy They then turned their thoughts to devising measures for the future security of the country depopulated by the Sam nites and with this view resolved that two colonies should be settled on the frontiers of the Vescian and Falernian territories one at the mouth of the river Liris which has received the name of Minturnae the other in the Vescian forest which borders on the Fa lernian territory where it is said stood Sinope a city of Grecians called thenceforth by the Roman colo nists Sinuessa The plebeian tribunes were charged to procure an order of the commons enjoining Publius Sempronius the pretor to create triumvirs for con ducting the colonies to those places But it was not easy to find people to give in their names because a settlement in those places was considered nearly as a perpetual advanced guard in a hostile country not as a provision of land From these employments the at tention of the senate was drawn away by the Etrurian war growing daily more formidable and by frequent letters from AppiUs warning them not to neglect the disturbances in that quarter Four nations he told them were uniting their arms the Etrurians the Samnites the Umbrians and the Gauls and they had already formed two separate camps one spot being insufficient to contain so great a multitude In consequence the time of the elections drawing nigh the consul Lucius Volumnitis was recalled to Rome to hold them Hav ISO LI W ing summoned an assembly of the people before the centuries were called to give their votes he spoke at length on the great importance of the Etrurian war and said that  even at the time when he himself acted there in conjunction with his colleague the war was too weighty to be managed by one general or one army and that it was now reported that the enemy had since that time gained an accession of the Umbrians and a numerous body of Gauls He desired them to  bear in mind that they were on that day to choose consuls who were to command in a war against four nations  for his own part were he not confident that the Roman people would concur in appointing to the consulship the man who was allowed beyond dispute to be the first commander at present in the world he would have immediately nominated a dictator 22 No doubt was entertained but that the universal choice would light on Quintus Fabius  and accord ingly the prerogative and all the first called centuries named him consul with Lucius Volumnius Fabius spoke to the same purpose as he had done two years before  but afterwards yielding to the general wish he applied himself to procure Decius to be appointed bis confederate  that he said  would be a prop to his declining age In the censorship and two consul ships in which they had been associated he had ex perienced that there could be no firmer support in pro moting the interest of the commonwealth than harmouy with a colleague At his advanced stage of life his mind could hardly conform itself to a new associate in command  and he could more easily act in concert with a temper to which he had been familiarised Volum nius subscribed to these sentiments bestowing due praises on Publius Decius and enumerating  the ad vantages resulting from concord between consuls and the evils arising from their disagreement in the conduct of military affairs  at the same time remarking  how near the extremity of danger matters had been brought by the late dispute between Appius and himself He warmly recommended to Decius and Fabius to  live HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 181 together with one mind and one spirit Observed that  they were men qualified by nature for military com mand  great in action but unpractised in the strife of words their talents were such as eminently became consuls As to the artful and the ingenious lawyers and orators such as Appius Claudius they ought to be kept at home to preside in the city and the forum  and to be appointed pretors for the administration of justice In these proceedings that day was spent and on the following the elections both of consuls and pre tor were held and were guided by the recommendations suggested by the consul Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were chosen consuls  Appius Claudius pretor all of them absent and by a decree of the senate fol lowed by an order of the commons Lucius Volumnius was continued in the command for another year 23 During that year many prodigies happened To avert the evils which they might portend the senate decreed a supplication for two days  the wine and frankincense for the sacrifices were furnished at the expense of the public and numerous crowds of men and women attended the performance This supplica tion was rendered remarkable by a quarrel which broke out among the matrons in the chapel of patrician chas tity which stands in the cattle market near the round temple of Hercules Virginia daughter of Aulus a patrician but married to Volumnius the consul a ple beian was on that account excluded by the matrons from sharing in the sacred rites a short altercation ensued which was afterwards through the intempe rance of passion incident to the sex kindled into a flame of contention Virginia boasted with truth that she had a right to enter the temple of patrician chastity as being of patrician birth and chaste in her character and besides the wife of one to whom she was be trothed a virgin and had no reason to be ashamed either of her husband or of his exploits or honors to her high spirited words she added importance by an extraordinary act In the long street where she re sided she inclosed with a partition a part of the house 182 LIVY of a size sufficient for a small chapel and there erected an altar Then calling together the plebeian matrons and complaining of the injurious behavior of the pa tricians she said  This altar I dedicate to plebeian chastity and exhort you that the same degree of emu lation which prevails among the men of this state on the point of valor may be maintained by the women on the point of chastity  and that you contribute yonr best care that this altar may have the credit of being attended with a greater degree of sanctity and by chaster women than the other Solemn rites were performed at this altar under the same regulations nearly with those at the more ancient one no person being allowed the privilege of taking part in the sacri fices except a woman of approved chastity and who was the wife of one husband This institution being afterwards debased by the admission of vicious cha racters and not only by matrons but women of every description sunk at last into oblivion During this year the Ogulnii Cneius and Quintus being curule ediles carried on prosecutions against several usurers  and these being condemned to pay fines out of the pro duce and for the use of the public the ediles made brazen thresholds in the capitol utensils of plate for three tables which were deposited in the chapel of Jupiter  a statue of Jupiter in a chariot drawn by four horses placed on the roof and images of the founders of the city in their infant state under the teats of the wolf at the Ruminal fig tree They also paved with square stones the roads from the Capuan gate to the temple of Mars The plebeian ediles likewise Lucius Elius Pectus and Caius Fulvius Corvus out of money levied as fines on farmers of the public pastures whom they had convicted of malpractices exhibited games and consecrated golden bowls in the temple of Ceres 24 Then came into the consulship Quintus Fabius a fifth time and Publius Decius a fourth A U C 457 B C 205 They had been colleagues in the censorship and twice in the consulship and were celebrated not more for their glorious achievements splendid as these HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 183 were than for the unanimity which had ever subsisted between them The interruption which this afterwards suffered was in my opinion owing to a jarring be tween the opposite parties rather than between them selves  the patricians endeavoring that Fabius should have Etruria for bis province without casting lots and the plebeians insisting that Decius should bring the matter to the decision of lots There was certainly a contention in the senate and the interest of Fabius being superior there the business was brought before the people Here between military men who laid greater stress on deeds than on words the debate was short Fabius said  that it was unreasonable that after he had planted a tree another should gather the fruit of it He had opened the Ciminian forest and made a way for the Roman arms through passes until then impracticable Why had they disturbed his repose at that time of his life if they intended to give the manage ment of the war to another Then in the way of a gentle reproof he observed that  instead of an asso ciate in command he had chosen an adversary and that Decius thought it too much that their unanimity should last through three consulates Declaring in fine that  he desired nothing farther than that if they thought him qualified for the command in the province they should send him thither He had sub mitted to the judgment of the senate and would now be governed by the authority of the people Publius Decius complained of injustice in the senate  and as serted that  the patricians had labored as long as pos sible to exclude the plebeians from all access to the higher honors and since merit by its own intrinsic power had prevailed so far as that it should not in any rank of men be precluded from the attainment of them they sought every expedient to render ineffectual not only the suffrages of the people but even the decisions of fortune converting all things to the aggrandisement of a few Former consuls had disposed of the provinces by lots now the senate bestowed a province on Fa bius at their pleasure If this was meant as a mark of 184 LIVY honor the merits of Fabius were so great towards the commonwealth and towards himself in particular that he would gladly contribute to the advancement of his reputation in every instance where its splendor could be increased without reflecting dishonor on himself But who did not see that when a war of difficulty and danger and out of the ordinary course was committed to only that one consul the other would be considered as useless and insignificant Fabius gloried in his ex ploits performed in Etruria Publius Decius wished for a like subject of glory and perhaps would utterly extinguish that fire which the other left smothered in such a manner that it often broke out anew in sudden conflagrations In fine honors and rewards he would concede to his colleague out of respect to his age and dignified character but when danger when a vigorous struggle with an enemy was before them he never did nor ever would willingly give place With respect to the present dispute this much he would gain at all events that a business appertaining to the jurisdiction of the people should be determined by an order of that people and not complimented away by the senate He prayed Jupiter supremely good and great and all the immortal gods not to grant him an equal chance with his colleague unless they intended to grant him equal ability and success in the management of the war It was certainly in its nature reasonable in the example salutary and concerned the reputation of the Roman people that the consuls should be men of such abili ties that either of them was fully equal to the com mand iu a war with Etruria Fabius after just re questing of the people that before the tribes were called in to give their votes they would hear the letters of the pretor Appius Claudius written from Etruria withdrew from the Comitium and the people not less unanimously than the senate decreed to him the pro vince of Etruria without having recourse to lots 25 Immediately almost all the younger citizens flocked together to the consul and cheerfully gave in their names earnestly desirous of serving under such HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 185 a commander Seeing so great a multitude collected round him he said My intention is to enlist only four thousand foot and six hundred horse such of you as give in your names to day and to morrow I will carry with me I am more solicitous to bring home all my soldiers rich than to employ a great multitude Ac cordingly with a competent number of men who pos sessed greater hopes and confidence because a nume rous army had not been required he marched to the town of Aharna from which the enemy were not far distant and proceeded to the camp of the pretor Ap pius When be came within a few miles of it he was met by some soldiers sent to cut wood attended by a guard Observing the lictors preceding him and learn ing that he was Fabius the consul they were filled with joy and expressed warm thanks to the gods and to the Roman people for having sent them such a com mander Then as they gathered round to pay their respects Fabius inquired whither they were going  and on their answering they were going to provide wood What do you tell me said he have you not a rampart raised about your camp â They had they replied  a double rampart and a trench  and notwithstanding were in great apprehension  Well then said he  you have abundance of wood  go back and level the rampart They accordingly returned to the camp and there levelling the rampart threw the soldiers who had remained in it and Appius himself into the greatest fright until with eager joy each called out to the rest that  they acted by order of the consul Quintus Fabius Next day they decamped and the pretor Appius was dismissed to Rome From that time the Romans had no fixed post the consul affirming that it was prejudicial to an army to lie in one spot and that by frequent marches and changing places it was rendered more healthy and more capa ble of brisk exertions and this he practised as long as the season permitted tlie winter being not yet ended Then in the beginning of spring leaving the second legion near Clusium which they formerly called the 186 LIVY Camertian and giving the command of the camp to Lucius Scipio as propretor he returned to Rome in order to adjust measures for carrying on the war either led thereto by his own judgment on finding it attended with greater difficulty than he had believed from report or being summoned by a decree of senate for both accounts are given Some choose to have it believed that he was forced to return by the practices of the pretor Appius Claudius who both in the se nate and before the people exaggerated as he was wont in all his letters the danger of the Etrurian war  contending that  one general or one army would not be sufficient to oppose four nations that whether these directed the whole of their combined force against him alone or acted separately in different parts there was reason to fear that he would be unable to provide effec tually against every emergency that he had left there but two Roman legions and that the foot and horse who came with Fabius did not amount to five thousand It was therefore his opinion that the consul Publius Decius should without delay join his colleague in Etruria and that the province of Samnium should be given to Lucius Volumnius But if the consul pre ferred going to his own province that then Volumnius should march a full consular army into Etruria to join the other commander The advice of the pretor was approved by a great part of the members  but Publius Decius recommended that every thing should be kept undetermined and open for Quintus Fabius until he should either come to Rome if he could do so without prejudice to the public or send some of his lieutenants from whom the senate might learn the real state of the war in Etruria and what number of troops and how many generals would be requisite for carrying it on 26 Fabius on his return to Rome qualified his discourses both in the senate and before the people in such a manner as to appear neither to exaggerate or lessen any particular relating to the war and to show that in agreeing to another general being joined with him he rather indulged the apprehensions of others HISTORY OF ROME BOOK X 187 than guarded against any danger to himself or the public  But if they chose he said  to give him an assistant and associate in command how could he over look Publius Decius the consul with whom he was perfectly acquainted as a colleague on so many occa sions  There was no man living whom he would ra ther wish to be joined in commission with him  with Publius Decius he should have forces sufficient and never too many enemies If however his colleague preferred any other employment let them then give him Lucius Volumnius as an assistant The disposal of every particular was left intirely to Fabius by the people and the senate and even by his colleague  while Decius having declared that he was ready to go either to Etruria or Samnium such general congratu lation and satisfaction took place that all men antici pated victory and felt as if a triumph not a war had been decreed to the consuls I find in some writers that Fabius and Decius immediately on their entering into office set out together for Etruria and no men tion is made of the casting of lots or of the disputes which I have related Others not satisfied with re lating those disputes have added charges of miscon duct laid by Appius before the people against Fabius when absent and a stubborn opposition maintained by the pretor against the consul when present and also another contention between the colleagues Decius insisting that each consul should attend to the care of his own separate province Certainty however be gins to appear from the time when both consuls set out for the campaign Now before these arrived in Etru ria the Senonian Gauls came in a vast body to Clu sium to attack the Roman legion encamped there Scipio who commanded in that post wishing to re medy the deficiency of his numbers by an advantage in the ground led his men up a hill which stood be tween the camp and the city but having in his haste neglected to examine the place when he came near the summit he found it already possessed by the ene my who had ascended on the other side The legion 188 LIVY was consequently attacked on the rear and surrounded by several battalions who pressed it on all sides Some writers say that the whole were cut off so that not one survived to give an account of the disaster and that no information of the misfortune reached the consuls who were at the time not far from Clusium until the Gallic horsemen came within vsight carrying the heads of the slain  some hanging before their horses breasts others on the points of their spears and expressing their triumph in songs according to their custom Others affirm that the defeat was by Umbrians not Gauls and that the loss sustained was not so great that a party of foragers under Lucius Manlius Torquatus lieutenant general being sur rounded Scipio the propretor brought up relief from the camp and renewing the battle defeated the Um brians lately victorious and retook the prisoners and spoil But it is more probable that this blow was suf fered from a Gallic than an Umbrian enemy  because during that year as was often the case at other times the danger principally apprehended by the public was that of a Gallic tumult for which reason notwith standing that both the consuls had marched against the enemy with four legions and a large body of Roman cavalry joined by a thousand chosen horsemen of Campania supplied on the occasion and a body of the allies and Latine confederates superior in number to the Romans two other armies were posted near the city on the side facing Etruria one in the Faliscian the other in the Vatican territory Cneins Fulvius and Lucius Postumins Me gellus both propretors being ordered to keep the troops stationed in those places 27 The consuls having crossed the Apennines came up with the combined forces in the territory of Sentinum and pitched their camp distant from them about four miles Several councils were then held by the enemy and their plan of operations was thus set tled  that they should not encamp together nor go out together to battle the Gauls were united to the Sammies the Umbrians to the Etrurians The day HISTORY OF ROME BOOK X 189 of battle was fixed The part of maintaining the fight was committed to the Sainnites and Gauls  and the Etrurians and Umbrians were ordered to attack the Roman camp during the heat of the engagement This plan was frustrated by three Clusian deserters who came over by night to Fabius  and after disclosing the above designs were sent back with presents in order that they might discover and bring intelligence of any new scheme which should be formed The consuls then wrote to Flavins and Postumius to move their armies the one from the Faliscian the other from the Vatican country towards Clusium  and to ruin the enemy s territory by every means in their power The news of these depredations drew the Etrurians from Sentinum to protect their own region The consuls in their absence practised every means to bring on an engagement For two days they endeavored by seve ral attacks to provoke the enemy to fight in which time however nothing worth mention was performed A few fell on each side  but still the minds of the Ro mans were so irritated as to wish for a general engage ment yet nothing decisive was hazarded On the third day both parties marched out their whole force to the field  here while the armies stood in order of battle a hind chased by a wolf from the mountains ran through the plain between the two lines there the animals turned their courses to different sides  the hind towards the Gauls the wolf towards the Romans Way was made between the ranks for the wolf the Gauls slew the hind with their javelins  on which one of the Roman soldiers in the van said  To that side where you see an animal sacred to Diana lying pros trate flight and slaughter are directed  on this side the victorious wolf of Mars safe and untouched re minds us of our founder and of our descent from that deity The Gauls were posted on the right wing the Samnites on the left against the latter Fabius drew up as his right wing the first and third legions  against the Gauls Decius formed the left wing of the fifth and sixth The second and fourth were employed 190 LIVY in the war in Samnium under the proconsul Lucius Volumnius The first encounter was supported with strength so equal on both sides that had the Etrurians and Umbrians been present at the action either in the field or at the camp in whichever place they might have employed their force the Romans must have been defeated 28 However although the victory was still unde cided Fortune not having declared in favor of either party yet the course of the fight was by no means similar on both right and left wings The Romans under Fabius rather repelled than offered assault and the contest was protracted until very late in the day for their general knew very well that both Samnites and Gauls were furious in the first onset so that to prevent their progress was as much as could well be effected It was known too that in a longer dispute the spirits of the Samnites gradually flagged and even the bodies of the Gauls remarkably ill able to bear labor and heat became quite relaxed and although in their first efforts they were more than men yet in their last they were less than women He therefore re served the strength of his men for the aforesaid rea sons until the time when the enemy were the more likely to be worsted Decius more impetuous as being in the prime of life and full flow of spirits ex erted his whole force to the utmost in the first encoun Â ter and thinking the infantry not sufficiently power ful brought up the cavalry to their aid Putting him self at the head of a troop of young horsemen of distin guished bravery he besought those youths the flower of the army to follow him and charge the enemy  telling them  they would reap a double share of glory if the victory should commence on the left wing and through their means Twice they compelled the Gal lic cavalry to give way At the second charge they advanced nearer and were briskly engaged in the midst of the enemy s squadrons when by a method of fighting to which they were utter strangers they were throwp into dismay A number of the enemy mounted HISTORY OF ROME 191 â BOOK X on chariots and cars made towards them with such a prodigious clatter from the trampling of the cattle and rolling of wheels as affrighted the horses of the Ro mans unaccustomed to such tumultuous operations By this means the victorious cavalry were dispersed through a panic and men and horses in their headlong flight were tumbled promiscuously on the ground The same cause produced disorder even in the batta lions of the legions  through the impetuosity of the horses and of the carriages which they dragged through the ranks many of the soldiers in the van were trodden or bruised to death  while the Gallic line as soOn as they saw their enemy in confusion pursued the advan tage nor allowed them time to take breath Decius calling aloud  Whither were they flying or what hope could they have in running away V strove to stop them as they turned their backs but finding that he could not by any efforts prevail on them to keep their posts so thoroughly were they dismayed he called on the name of his father Publius Deciu s and said  Why do I any longer defer the fate entailed on my family It is the appointment of destiny to our race that we should serve as expiatory victims to avert the public danger I will now offer the legions of the enemy together with myself a bloody sacrifice to Earth and the infernal gods Having thus said he commanded Marcus Livius a pontiff whom at his coming out to the field he had charged not to stir from him to dic tate the form of words in which he was to devote him self and the legions of the enemy for the army of the Roman people the Quirites He was accordingly de voted with the same imprecations and in the same habit in which his father Publius Decius had ordered himself to be devoted at the Veseris in the Latine war After this he added that  he carried along with him dismay and flight slaughter and blood and the wrath of the gods celestial and infernal that with the con tagious influence of the Furies the ministers of death whose victim he was he would infect the standards the weapons and the armor of the enemy and on the 192 LIVY same spot should be accomplished his perdition and that of the Gauls and Sanitates After uttering these execrations on himself and the foe he spurred forward his horse where he saw the line of the Gauls thickest and rushing on the enemy s weapons met his death 29 Thenceforward the battle seemed to be fought with a degree of force which could scarcely be deemed human The Romans on the loss of their general a circumstance which on other occasions is wont to in spire terror stopped their flight and reassumed spirit to begin the combat afresh The Gauls and espe cially those who encircled the consul s body as if de prived of reason cast their javelins at random without execution  some became so stupid as not to think of either fighting or flying  while on the other side Li vius the pontiff to whom Decius had transferred his lictors with ord ers to act as propretor cried out aloud that  the Romans were victorious being exempted from misfortune by the death of their consul That the Gauls and Sanmites were now the victims of Mo ther Earth and the infernal gods That Decius was summoning and dragging to himself the army devoted along with him  and that among the enemy all was full of dismay and the vengeance of all the furies While the soldiers were busy in restoring the fight they were joined by Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Caius Marcius with some reserved troops from the rear who had been sent by Quintus Fabius the consul to the support of his colleague These on being made acquainted with the fate of Decius were powerfully excited to brave every danger in the cause of the pub lic  but as the Gauls stood in close order with their shields formed into a fence before them little prospect of success appeared from a close fight The javelins which lay scattered between the two lines were there fore by order of the lieutenants general gathered up from the ground and thrown against the enemy s shields  and as most of them pierced the fence the long pointed ones even into their bodies their com pact band was overthrown in such a manner that a HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 193 great many who were unhurt yet fell as if thunder struck Such were the changes of fortune on the left wing of the Romans  on the right Fahius had at first protracted the time as we mentioned above in slow operations then as soon as he perceived that neither the shout nor the efforts of the enemy nor the wea pons which they threw retained their former force ordered the commanders of the cavalry to lead round their squadrons to the wing of the Samnites and on receiving the signal to charge them in flank with all possible violence he commanding at the same time his infantry to advance leisurely and drive the enemy from their ground When he saw that they were un able to maintain their posts and manifestly spent with fatigue drawing together all his reserves whom he bad kept fresh for that occasion he made a brisk push with the legions giving the cavalry the signal to charge The Samnites could not support the shock but fled precipitately to their camp passing by the line of the Gauls and leaving their allies to fight by themselves These stood in close order under cover of their shields  Fabius therefore having heard of the death of his colleague ordered the squadron of Campanian cavalry in number about five hundred to fall back from the ranks ride round and attack the rear of the Gallic line sending the chief strength of the third legion after these with directions that wher ever they should see the enemy s troops disordered by the charge to follow the blow and cut them to pieces before they recovered from their consternation After vowing a temple and the spoils which might fall into his hands to Jupiter the Victorious he proceeded to the camp of the Samnites whither all their forces were hurrying in confusion The gates not affording entrance to such very great numbers those who were necessarily excluded attempted resistance just at the foot of the rampart and here fell Gellius Egnatius the Samnite general These however were soon driven within the rampart the camp was taken after a slight dispute  and at the same time the Gauls were attacked LIV VOL III N 194 LIVY on the rear and overpowered There were slain of the enemy on that day twenty five thousand  eight thousand were taken prisoners Nor was the victory gained without loss of blood  for of the army of Pub lius Decius the killed amounted to seven thousand  of the army of Fabius to one thousand two hundred Fabius after sending persons to search for the body of his colleague bad the spoils of the enemy collected into a heap and burned them as an offering to Jupiter the Victorious The consul s body could not be found that day being hid under a heap of slaughtered Gauls  on the following it was discovered and brought to the ramp amidst abundance of tears shed by the soldiers Fabius discarding all concern about any other busi ness solemnised the obsequies of his colleague in the most honorable manner passing on him the high encoT miums which be had justly merited 30 During the same period Cneius Fulvius pro pretor made a progress in Etruria equal to his wishes  having besides the immense losses occasioned to the enemy by the devastation of their lands fought a battle with extraordinary success in which there were above three thousand of the Perusians and Clusians slain and twenty military standards taken The Sam nites in their flight passing through the Pelignian ter ritory were attacked on all sides by the Pelignians and out of five thousand one thousand were killed The glory pf the day in the affair at Sentinum was great when represented with a strict adherence to truth  but some have carried their exaggerations of it beyond the bounds of credibility asserting in their writings that there were in the army of the enemy forty thousand three hundred and thirty foot six thousand horse and one thousand chariots that is in cluding the Etrurians and Umbrians who they affirm were present in the engagement and to magnify like wise the number of Roman forces they add to the consuls another general Lucius Volumnius proconsul and his army to their legions In the greater number of annals that victory is ascribed intirely to the two HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 195 consuls  and it is mentioned that Volumnius was em ployed at the time in Samnium  that he compelled the army of the Samnites to retreat to Mount Tifernus and not retarded by the difficulty of the ground routed and dispersed them Quintus Fabius leaving Decius army in Etruria and leading off his own legions to the city triumphed over the Gauls Etrurians and Sam nites the soldiers attending his triumph These in their coarse military verses celebrated not more highly the conduct of Quintus Fabius than the illus trious death of Publius Decius  recalling to memory his self immolated father of whom the son might be considered as a glorious counterpart in respect of the issue which resulted both to himself and to the public Out of the spoil donations were made to the soldiers of eighty two asses1 to each with cloaks and vests rewards for service which in that age were far from contemptible 31 Notwithstanding these successes peace was not yet established either among the Samnites or Etru rians  for the latter at the instigation of the Peru sians resumed their arms as soon as the consul had withdrawn his troops  and the Samnites made preda tory incursions on the territories of Vescia and For miaj and also on the other side on those of jEsernia and the parts adjacent to the river Vulturnus Against these was sent the pretor Appius Claudius with the army formerly commanded by Decius In Etruria Fabius on the revival of hostilities slew four thou sand five hundred of the Perusiaus and took prisoners one thousand seven hundred and forty who were ran somed at the rate of three hundred and ten asses3 each All the rest of the spoil was bestowed on the soldiers The legions of the Samnites though pursued some by the pretor Appius Claudius the others by Lucius Vo lumnius proconsul formed a junction in the country of the Stellatians Here sat down on one side the whole body of the Samnites  and on the other Ap 1 5Â S d  U 196 LIVY pius and Volumnius with their forces united in one camp A battle ensued fought with the most rancor ous animosity one party being spurred on by rage against men who had so often renewed their attacks on them and the other now fighting in support of their last remaining hope The consequence was that there were slain of the Samnites sixteen thousand three hundred and two thousand and seven hundred made prisoners of the Roman army fell two thousand and seven hundred This year so successful in the operations of war was filled with distress at home arising from a pestilence and with anxiety occasioned by prodigies fpr accounts were received that in many places showers of earth had fallen and that very many persons in the army of Appius Claudius had been struck by lightning in consequence of which the books were consulted At this time Quintus Fa bius Gurges the consul s son having prosecuted some matrons before the people on a charge of adultery built with the money accruing from the fines which they were condemned to pay the temple of Venus which stands near the circus Still we have the wars of the Samnites on our hands notwithstanding that the relation of them has already extended in one con tinued course through four volumes of our history and through a period of fortyrsix years from the con sulate of Marcus Valerius and Aulus Cornelius who first carried the Roman arms into Samnium And not to recite the long train of disasters sustained by both nations and the toils which they underwent which however were not sufficient to subdue their stubborn fortitude  even in the course of the last year the Samnites with their own forces separately and also in conjunction with those of other nations had been defeated by four several armies and four gene rals of the Romans in the territory of Sentinum in that of the Pelignians at Tifernum and in the plains of the Stellatians had lost the general of the highest character in their nation  and now saw their allies in the war the Etrurians the Umbrians and the Gauls HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 197 in the same situation with themselves hut although destitute of support either in their own or in foreign resources yet did they not desist from the prosecution of hostilities So indefatigably though unsuccess fully did they struggle in defence of liberty and rather than not aspire after victory chose to subject themselves to repeated defeats Who does not find his patience tired either in writing or reading of wars of such continuance and which yet exhausted not the resolution of the parties concerned 32 Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were suc ceeded in the consulship by Lucius Postumius Megel lus and Marcus Atilius Regulus A U C 458 B C 294 The province of Samniutn was decreed to both in conjunction because intelligence had been received that the enemy had embodied three armies one for the recovery of Etruria  another to repeat their ra vages in Campania  and the third intended for the defence of their frontiers Sickness detained Postu mius at Rome but Atilius set out immediately with design to surprise the enemy in Samnium before they should have advanced beyond their own borders for such had been the directions of the senate The Ro mans met the enemy as if by mutual appointment at a spot where while they could be hindered not only from ravaging but even from entering the Samnite territory they could likewise binder the Samnites from continuing their progress into the countries which were quiet and the lands of the allies of the Roman people While they lay opposite to each other the Samnites attempted an enterprise which the Romans so often their conquerors would scarcely have ven tured to undertake  such is the rashness inspired by extreme despair this was an assault on the Roman camp And although this attempt so daring suc ceeded not in its full extent yet it was not without considerable effect There was a fog which continued through a great part of the day so thick as to exclude the light of the sun and to prevent not only the view of any thing beyond the rampart but scarcely the LIVY sight of each other when they should meet Depend ing on this as a covering to the design when the sun was but just risen and the light which he did afford was obscured by the fog the Samnites came up to an advanced guard of the Romans at one of the gates who were standing carelessly on their post In the f udden surprise these had neither courage nor strength to make resistance  an assault was then made through the Decuman gate in the rear of the camp the ques tor s quarters in consequence fell into the hands of the enemy and the questor Lucius Opimius Pansa was there slain on which a general alarm was given 33 The consul being roused by the tumult ordered two cohorts of the allies a Lucanian and Suessanian which happened to be nearest to defend the head quarters and led the companies of the legions down the principal street These ran into the ranks scarcely taking time to furnish themselves with arms  and as they distinguished the enemy by their shout rather than by sight could form no judgment how great their number might be  thus ignorant of the circumstances of their situation they at first drew back and suffered them to penetrate into the heart of the camp The consul asking them aloud whether they intended to let themselves be beaten out beyond the rampart and then to return again to storm their own camp they raised the shout and uniting their efforts stood their ground  then made advances pushed closely on the enemy and having forced them to give way drove them back without suffering their first terror to abate They soon beat them out beyond the gate and the ram part but not daring to pursue them because the dark ness of the weather made them apprehend an ambush and content with having cleared the camp they retired within the rampart having killed about three hundred of the enemy Of the Romans including the first ad vanced guard and the watchmen and those who were surprised at the questor s quarters two hundred and thirty perished This not unsuocessful piece of bold ness raised the spirits of the Samnites so high that HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 199 they not only prevented the Romans from marching forward jnto their country but even from procuring forage from their lands  and the foragers were obliged to go back into the quiet country of Sora News of these events being conveyed to Rome with circum stances of alarm magnified beyond the truth Lucius Postumius the consul though scarcely recovered from his illness was obliged to set out for the army How ever before his departure having issued a proclama tion that his troops should assemble at Sora he dedi cated the temple of Victory for the building of which he had provided when curule edile out of the money arising from fines and joining the army he advanced from Sora towards Samnium to the camp of his col league The Samnites despairing of being able to make head against the two armies retreated from thence on which the consuls separating proceeded by different routes to lay waste the enemy s lands and besiege their towns 34 Postumius attempted to make himself master of Milionia by storm  but not succeeding with regular works he carried his approaches to the walls and thus gained an entrance into the place The fight was continued in all parts of the city from the fourth hour until near the eighth and for a great part of the time without any decisive advantage the Romans at last gained possession of it Three thousand two hundred of the Samnites were killed four thousand two hun dred taken besides the other booty From thence the legions were conducted to Ferentinum out of which the inhabitants had during the night retired in silence through the opposite gate with all their effects which could be either carried or driven The consul on his arrival approached the walls with the same or der and circumspection as if he were to meet an oppo sition here equal to what he had experienced at Mili onia The troops perceiving a dead silence in the city and neither arms nor men on the towers and ram parts were eager to mount the deserted fortifications out he restrained them lest they might fall into a 200 LIVY snare He ordered two divisions of the confederate Latine horse to ride round the walls and explore every particular These horsemen observed one gate and at a little distance another on the same side standing wide open and on the roads leading from these every mark of the enemy having fled by night They then rode up leisurely to the gates from whence with perfect safety they took a clear view through strait streets quite across the city Returning to the consul they told him that the city was abandoned by the enemy as was plain from the solitude the tracks on their retreat and the things which in the confusion of the night they had left scattered up and down On hearing this the consul led round the army to that side of the city which had been examined and making the troops halt at a little distance from the gate gave  orders that five horsemen should ride into the city  and when they should have advanced a good way into it then if they saw all things safe three should re main there and the other two return to him with in telligence These returned and said that they had proceeded to a part of the town from which they had a view on every side and that nothing but silence and solitude reigned through the whole extent of it The consul immediately led some light armed cohorts into the city ordering the rest to fortify a camp in the mean time The soldiers who entered the town break ing open the doors found only a few persons disabled by age or sickness and such effects remaining as could not without difficulty be removed These were seized as plunder and it was discovered from the pri soners that several cities in that quarter had in pur suance of a concerted plan resolved on flight that their townspeople had gone off at the first watch and they believed that the same solitude would be found in the other places The accounts of the prisoner proved well founded and the consul took possession of the forsaken towns 35 The other consul Marcus Atilins met much greater difficulties in the war wherein he was engaged HISTORY OF ROME BOOK X 201 As he was marching his legions towards Luceria to which he was informed that the Samnites had laid siege the enemy met him on the border of the Luce rian territory Rage supplied them on this occasion with strength to equal his  the battle was stubbornly contested and the victory doubtful the issue how ever proved more calamitous on the side of the Ro mans both because they were unaccustomed to defeat and that on leaving the field they felt more sensibly than during the heat of the action the number of their wounds and the loss of men which they had sustained In consequence of this such dismay spread through the camp as had it seized them during the engage ment must have occasioned their overthrow Even as the matter stood they passed the night in great anx iety expecting every instant that the camp would be assaulted by the Samnites or that at the first light they should be obliged to stand a battle with an ap parently powerful foe On the side of the enemy however although there was less loss yet there was not greater courage As soon as day appeared they wished to retire without any more fighting  but there was only one road and that leading close by the post of their enemy  so that on their march it seemed as if they were advancing directly to attack the camp The consul therefore ordered his men to take arms and to follow him to the field giving directions to the lieutenants general tribunes and the prefects of the allies in what manner he would have each of them pet They all assured him that  they would do every thing in their power but that the soldiers were quite dejected  that from their own wounds and the groans of the dying they had passed the whole night without sleep  that if the enemy had approached the camp before day so great were the fears of the troops that they would certainly have deserted their standards Even ftt present they were restrained from flight merely by shame  and in other respects were little better than vanquished men This account made the consul judge it necessary to go himself among the sol 202 LIVY diers and speak to them  and as he came up to each he rebuked them for their backwardness in taking arms asking  Why they loitered and declined the fight If they did not choose to go out of the camp the enemy would come into it and they must fight in defence of their tents if they would not in defence of the rampart Men who have arms in their hands and contend with their foe have always a chance for vic tory  but the man who waits naked and unarmed for his enemy must suffer either death or slavery To these reprimands and rebukes they answered that  they were exhausted by the fatigue of the battle of yesterday and had no strength nor even blood re maining and besides the enemy appeared more nu merous than they were the day before The hostile army in the mean time drew near so that seeing every thing more distinctly as the distance grew less they asserted that the Samnites carried with them pal lisades for a rampart and evidently intended to draw lines of circumvallation round the camp On this the consul exclaimed with great earnestness against sub mitting to such an ignominious insult and from so dastardly a foe  Shall we even be blockaded said he  in our camp and die like cowards by famine rather than like men if death must be our lot by the sword May the gods be propitious and let every one act in the manner which he thinks becomes him The consul Marcus Atilius should no other accom pany him will go out even alone to face the enemy and will fall in the middle of the Samnite battalions rather thau see the Roman camp inclosed by their trenches The lieutenants general tribunes every troop of the cavalry and the principal centurions ex pressed their approbation of what the consul said  and the soldiers at length overcome by shame took up their arms but in a spiritless manner  and in the same spiritless manner marched out of the camp In a long train and that not every where connected me lancholy and seemingly subdued they proceeded to wards the enemy whose hopes and courage were not HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 203 more steady than theirs As soon therefore as these beheld the Roman standards a murmur spread from front to rear of the Samnites that as they had feared  the Romans were coming out to oppose their march  that there was no road open through which they could even fly thence in that spot they must fall or else cut down the enemy s ranks and make their way over their bodies 36 They then threw the baggage in a heap in the centre and with their arms prepared for battle formed their line each falling into his post There was now but a small interval between the two armies and both stood waiting until the shout and onset should be begun by their adversary Neither party had any inclination to fight and they would have sepa rated and taken different roads without coming to ac tion but that each had a dread of being harassed in retreat by the other Notwithstanding this reluc tance an engagement unavoidably began but without any vigor and with a shout which discovered neither resolution nor steadiness  nor did any move a foot from his post The Roman consul then in order to ipfuse life into the action ordered a few troops of cavalry to advance out of the line and charge  most of whom being thrown from their horses and the rest put in disorder several parties ran forward both from the Samnite line to cut off those who had fallen and from the Roman to protect their friends this roused some little spirit in the combatants but the Samnites had come forward with more briskness and also in great numbers and the disordered cavalry with their af frighted horses trod down their own party who came to their relief These were consequently the first who fled  and their example was followed by the whole Roman line And now the Samnites had no employment for their arms but against the rear of a flying enemy when the consul galloping on before his men to the gate of the camp posted there a body of cavalry with orders to treat as an enemy any person who should make towards the rampart whether Roman 204 LIVY or Samnite and placing himself in the way of his men as they pressed in disorder towards the camp denounced threats to the same purport  Whither are you going soldiers said he here also yon will find both men and arms  nor while your consul lives shall you pass the rampart unless you bring victory along with you Choose therefore which you will prefer fighting against your own countrymen or the enemy While the consul was thus speaking the cavalry gathered round with the points of their spears presented and ordered the infantry to return to the fight Not only his own brave spirit but fortune like wise aided the consul for the Samnites did not push their advantage  so that he had time to wheel round his battalions and to change his front from the camp towards the enemy The men then began to encourage each other to return to the battle while the centurions snatched the ensigns from the standard bearers and bore them forward pointing out to the soldiers the enemy coming on in a hurry few in number and with their ranks disordered At the same time the consul with his hands lifted up towards heaven and raising his voice so as to be heard at a distance vowed a temple to Jupiter Stator if the Roman army should rally from flight and renewing the battle defeat the Samnites All divisions of the army now united their efforts to restore the fight  officers soldiers in short the whole force both of cavalry and infantry  even the gods seemed to have looked with favor on the Ro man causes so speedily was a thorough change effected in the fortune of the day the enemy being repulsed from the camp and in a short time driven back to the spot where the battle had commenced Here they stopped being obstructed by the heap of baggage lying in their way where they had thrown it toge ther  and then to prevent the plundering of their ef fects formed round them a circle of troops On this the infantry assailed them vigorously in front while the cavalry wheeling fell on their rear  and being thus inclosed between the two they were all either HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 205 slain or taken prisoners The number of the prisoners was seven thousand three hundred who were all sent under the yoke  the killed amounted to four thousand eight hundred The victory was not obtained without loss of blood on the side of the Romans when the consul took an account of the loss sustained in the two days the number returned of soldiers lost was seven thousand three hundred During these transactions in Apulia the Samnites attempted to seize on Inte ramna a Roman colony situated on the Latine road but being disappointed in their design on the town em ployed their troops in ravaging the country  whence as they were driving off spoil consisting of men and cattle together with the colonists who fell into their hands they met the consul returning victorious from Luceria and not only lost their booty but marching in disorder in a long train and heavily encumbered were themselves cut to pieces The consul by procla mation summoned the owners to lnteramna to claim and receive again their property and leaving his army there went to Rome to hold the elections On his ap plying for a triumph that honor was refused him be cause he had lost so many thousands of his soldiers  and also because he had sent the prisoners under the yoke without imposing any conditions 37 The other consul Postumius finding no employ ment for his arms in Samnium led over his forces into Etruria where he first laid waste the lands of the Vol sinians and afterwards on their marching out to pro tect their country gained a decisive victory over them at a small distance from their own walls Two thou sand two hundred of the Etrurians were slain  the rest owed their safety to the city being so near The army was then led into the territory of Rusella and there not only were the lands wasted but the town itself taken More than two thousand men were made pri soners and somewhat less than that number killed on the walls But a peace effected that year in Etruria was still more important and honorable than the war had been Three very powerful cities of Etruria 206 LIVY Volsinii Perusia and Arretium made overtures of peace and having stipulated with the consul to fur nish clothing and corn for his army on condition of being permitted to send deputies to Rome they ob tained a truce for forty years and a fine was imposed on each state of five hundred thousand asses 1 to be immediately paid Postumius having demanded a tri umph from the senate in consideration of these ser vices rather in compliance with the general practice than in hope of succeeding and finding a strong oppo sition made to his request by one party out of enmity to himself by another out of friendship to his col league whose disappointment they wished to console by a similar refusal some objecting that he had been too dilatory in setting out from the city others that he had removed from Samnium into Etruria without orders from the senate  he addressed them thus  Conscript fathers I shall not carry my deference to your high dignity to such a length as to forget that I am consul The same authority of my office by which I carried on those wars shall now when the wars have been brought to a happy conclusion Sam nium and Etruria being subdued and victory and peace procured give me the recompense of a triumph With these words he left the senate On this arose a contention between the plebeian tribunes  some of them declaring that they would protest against his assuming a triumph in a method unprecedented others that they would support his pretensions in op position to their colleagues The affair came at length to be discussed before the people and the consul being summoned to attend he first represented that Marcus Horatius and Lucius Valerius when consuls and lately Caius Marcus Rutilus father of the present censor had triumphed not by direction of the senate but by that of the people  and then added that  he would in like manner have laid his request before the public had he not known that some plebeian tribunes the ab 1 16l4 lis 8d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 207 ject slaves of the nobles would have obstructed their passing an order on it But he did and ever should consider the universal approbation and will of ths people as equivalent to any order whatsoever Ac cordingly on the day following being supported by three plebeian tribunes in opposition to the protest of the other seven and the declared judgment of the senate he triumphed  and the people paid every ho nor to the day In the historical accounts which have been transmitted to us of this year there is some con fusion  Claudius asserts that Postumius after having taken several cities in Samnium was defeated and put to flight in Apulia and that being wounded himself he was obliged to take refuge with a few attendants in Luceria That the war in Etruria was conducted by Allius and that it was he who triumphed Fabius writes that the two consuls acted in conjunction both in Samnium and at Luceria that an army was led over into Etruria but by which of the consuls he has not mentioned  that at Luceria great numbers were slain on both sides  and that in that battle the temple of Jupiter Stator was vowed the same vow having been formerly made by Romulus but the fane only that is the area appropriated for the temple had been yet consecrated However in this year the state hav ing been twice bound by the same vow the senate to avoid the guilt of neglect in the case of a religious ob ligation ordered the fane to be erected 38 In the next year A U C 459 B C 293 we find a consul of a character eminently illustrious dis tinguished by the united splendor of his own and his father s glory Lucius Papirius Cursor We find like wise a war of the utmost importance and a victory of such consequence as no man excepting Lucius Papi rius the consul s father had ever before obtained over the Samnites It happened too that these had with the same care and pains as on the former occasion de corated their soldiers with the richest suits of splendid armor and they had likewise called in to their aid the power of the gods having as it were initiated tha 208 LIVY â oldiers by administering the military oath with the solemn ceremonies practised in ancient times and levied troops in every part of Samnium under an ordinance intirely new that  if any of the younger inhabitants should not attend the meeting according to the general s proclamation or shall depart without permission his head should be devoted to Jupiter Orders being then issued for all to assemble at Aquilonia the whole strength of Samnium came together amounting to forty thousand men There a piece of ground in the middle of the camp was inclosed with hurdles and boards and covered overhead with linen cloth the sides being all of an equal length about two hundred feet In this place sacrifices were performed according to directions read out of an old linen book the function of priest being discharged by a very old man called Ovius Pac cius w ho affirmed that he took these ceremonials from the ancient ritual of the Samnites being the same which their ancestors used when they had formed the secret design of wresting Capua from the Etrurians When the sacrifices were finished the general ordered a beadle to summons every one of those who were most highly distinguished by their birth or conduct these were introduced singly Besides the other exhibitions of the solemnity calculated to impress the mind with religious awe there were in the middle of the covered enclosure altars erected about which lay the victims slain and the centurions stood around with their swords drawn The soldier was led up to the altars rather like a victim than a performer in the ceremony and was bound by an oath not to divulge what he should see and hear in that place He was then compelled to swear in a dreadful kind of form containing execra tions on his own person on his family and race if he did not go to battle whithersoever the commanders should lead and if either he himself fled from the field or in case he should see any other flying did not immediately kill him At first some refusing to take the oath were put to death round the altars and lying among the carcasses of the victims served after HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 20 wards as a warning to others not to refuse it When those of the first rank in the Sammte nation had been bound under these solemnities the general nominated ten whom he desired to choose each a man and so to proceed until they should have filled up the number of sixteen thousand This body from the covering of the inclosure wherein the nobility had been thus devoted was called the linenlegion They were furnished with splendid armor and plumed helmets to distinguish them above the rest They had another body of forces amounting to somewhat more than twenty thousand not inferior to the linen legion either in personal ap pearance or renown in war or their equipment for service This number composing the main strength of the nation sat down at Aquilonia 39 On the other side the consuls set out from the city First Spurius Carvilius to whom had been de creed the veteran legions which Marcus Atilius the consul of the preceding year had left in the territory of Interamna marched at their head into Samnium  and while the enemy were busied in their superstitious rites and holding their secret meeting he took by storm the town of Amiternum Here were slain about two thousand eight hundred men  and four thousand two hundred and seventy were made prisoners Pa pirius with a new army which he raised in pursuance of a decree of the senate made himself master of the city of Duronia He took fewer prisoners than his colleague but slew much greater numbers Rich booty was acquired in both places The consuls then overrunning Samnium and wasting the province of Atinum with particular severity arrived Carvilius at dominium and Papirius at Aquilonia where the main force of the Samnites was posted Here for some time there was neither a cessation of action nor any vigor ous effort The day was generally spent in provoking the enemy when quiet and retiring when they offered resistance  in menacing rather than making an attack By which practice of beginning and then desisting even those trifling skirmishes were continually left LIV VOL III O 210 LIVY without a decision The other Roman camp was twenty miles distant and Papirius constantly consulted his absent colleague on every thing which he undertook while Carvilius on his part directed a greater share of his attention to Aquilonia where the state of affairs was more critical and important than to Cominium which he himself was besieging When Papirius had fully adjusted every measure preparatory to an en gagement he despatched a message to his colleague that  he intended if the auspices permitted to fight the enemy on the day following and that it would be necessary that he Carvilius should at the same time make an assault on Cominium with his utmost force that the Samnites there might have no leisure to send any succor to Aquilonia The messenger had the day for the performance of his journey and he returned in the night with an answer to the consul that his col league approved of the plan Papirius on sending off the messenger had instantly called an assembly where he descanted at large on the nature of the war in gene ral and on the mode at present adopted by the enemy in the equipment of their troops which certainly served for empty parade but could have no kind of efficacy towards ensuring success  for  plumes he said  made no wounds  that a Roman javelin would make its way through shields however painted and gilt and that the dazzling whiteness of their tunics would soon be be smeared with blood when the sword began its work His father had formerly cut off to a man a gold and silver army of the Samnites and such accoutrements had made a more respectable figure as spoils in the hands of the conquering foe than as arms in those of the wear ers Perhaps it was allotted by destiny to his name and family that they should be opposed in command against the most powerful efforts of the Samnites  and should bring home spoils of such beauty as to serve for ornaments to the public places The immortal gods were certainly on his side on account of the leagues so often solicited and so often broken Besides if a judgment might be formed of the sentiments of the HISTORY OF ROME BOOK X 211 deities they never were more hostile to any army than to that which in its abominable sacrifice was polluted with human blood mingled with that of cattle  which was in all events devoted to the wrath of the gods dreading on the one hand the deities who were wit nesses to the treaties concluded with the Romans  on the other the imprecations comprised in the oath which they took in contradiction to those treaties which they had before sworn to observe an oath which taken through compulsion they no doubt abhorred while they as certainly feared at once the gods their coun trymen and their enemies 40 The rage of the soldiers was inflamed to a high degree before but when the consul had recounted to them all these circumstances which he had learned from deserters they then filled with confidence in both divine and human aid with one universal shout de manded the battle  were vexed at the action being de ferred  impatient under the intended delay of a day and a night Papirius at the third watch having re ceived his colleague s letter arose in silence and sent the keeper of the chickens to take the auspices There was no one description of men in the camp who felt not earnest wishes for the fight the highest and the lowest were equally eager the general watching the ardor of the soldiers and the soldiers that of the gene ral This universal zeal spread even to those employed in taking the auspices  for the chickens having refused to feed the auspex ventured to misrepresent the omen and reported to the consul that they had fed voraci ously 1 The consul highly pleased and giving notice that the auspices were excellent and that they were to 1 When the auspices were to he taken from the chickens the keeper threw some of their food on the ground in their sight and opened the door of their coop If they did not come out if they came out slowly if they refused to feed or ate in a careless manner the omen was considered as bad On the contrary if they rushed out hastily and ate greedily so that some of the food fell from their mouths on the ground this was considered as an omen of the best import Livr act under the direction of the gods displayed the sig nal for battle Just as He was going out to the field be happened to receive intelligence fronj a deserter that twenty cohorts of Samaites consisting of about four hundred each had marched towards dominium Lest his colleague should be ignorant of this he in stantly despatched a messenger to him and then or dered the troops to advance with speed having already assigned to each division of the army its proper post and appointed general officers to command them The Command of the right wing he gave to Lucius Volum nius that of the left to Lucius Scipio that of the ca valry to the other lieuteaants general Caius Caedicius and Caius Trebonius He ordered Spurius Nautius to take off the panniers from the mules and to lead them round quickly together with his auxiliary cohorts to a rising ground in view and there to show himself during the heat of the engagement and to raise as much dust as possible While the general was employed in making these dispositions a dispute arose among the keepers of the chickens about the auspices of the day which was overheard by some Roman horsemen who deeming it a matter too important to be slighted in formed Spurius Papirius the consul s nephew that there was a doubt about the auspices The youth born in an age when that sort of learning which inculcates contempt of the gods was yet unknown examined into the affair that he might not carry an uncertain report to the consul and then acquainted him with it Hia answer was  I very much applaud your conduct and zeal However the person who officiates in taking the auspices if he makes a false report draws on his own head the evil portended but to the Roman people and their army the favorable omen reported to me is an excellent auspice He then commanded the centurions to place the keepers of the chickens in the front of the line The San nites likewise brought forward their standards followed by their main body armed and decorated in such a manner as to afford a magnificent show Before the shout was raised or the battle begun HISTORY OF HOME â BOOK X Â l the auspex wounded by a random cast of a javelin fell before the standards which being told to the con sul he said  The gods are present in the battle the guilty has met his punishment While the consul uttered these words a crow in front of him cawed with a clear voice  at which augury the consul being rejoiced and affirming that never had the gods dis played more evident demonstrations of their interposi tion in human affairs ordered the charge to be sounded and the shout to be raised 41 A furious conflict now ensued but with very unequal spirit in the combatants The Romans ac tuated by anger hope and ardor for conquest rushed to battle like men thirsting for their enemy s blood while the Samnites for the most part reluctantly as if compelled by necessity and religious dread rather stood on their defence than made an attack Nor would they familiarised as they were to defeats through a course of so many years have withstood the first shout and shock of the Romans had not another fear ope rating still more powerfully in their breasts restrained them from flying for they had before their eyes the whole scene exhibited at the secret sacrifice the armed priests the promiscuous carnage of men and cattle the altars besmeared with blood of victims and of their murdered countrymen  the dreadful curses and the direful form of imprecation in which they had called down perdition on their family and race Thus shackled they stood in their posts more afraid of their countrymen than of the enemy The Romans pushing the attack with vigor on both the Wings and in the centre made great havoc among them deprived as they were of the use of their faculties through their fears of the gods and of men and making but a faint opposition The slaughter had now almost reached to their standards when on one side appeared a cloud of dust as if raised by the marching of a numerous army this was caused by Spurius Nautius some say Octavius Metius commander of the auxiliary cohorts  for these took pains to raise a great quantity of dust S14 LIVY the servants of the camp mounted on the mules drag ging boughs of trees full of leaves along the ground Through this obscuration arms and standards were seen in front with cavalry closing the rear This ef fectually deceived not only the Samnites but the Ro mans themselves and the consul confirmed the mis take by calling out among the foremost battalions so that his voice reached also the enemy that  Cominium was taken  and that his victorious colleague was ap proaching  bidding his men  now make haste to com plete the defeat of the enemy before the other army should come in for a share of the glory This he said as he sat on horseback and then ordered the tribunes and centurions to open passages for the horse He had given previous directions to Trebonius and Caedi cius that when they should see him waving the point of his spear aloft they should cause the cavalry to charge the enemy with all possible violence Every particular as previously concerted was executed with the utmost exactness The passages were opened be tween the ranks the cavalry darted through and with the points of their spears presented rushed into the midst of the enemy s battalions breaking down the ranks wherever they charged Volumnius and Scipio seconded the blow and taking advantage of the ene my s disorder made a terrible slaughter Thus at tacked the cohorts called linteatae regardless of all restraints from either gods or men quitted their posts in confusion  the sworn and the unsworn all fled alike no longer dreading aught but the Romans The re mains of their infantry were driven into the camp at Aquilonia The nobility and cavalry directed their flight to Bovianum The horse were pursued by the Roman horse the infantry by their infantry while the wings proceeded by different roads the right to the camp of the Samnites the left to the city Volumnius succeeded first in gaining possession of the camp At the city Scipio met a stouter resistance not because the conquered troops there had gained courage but because walls were a better defence against armed men HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 215 than a rampart From these they repelled the enemy with stones Scipio considering that unless the busi ness were effected during their first panic and before they could recover their spirits the attack of so strong a town would be very tedious asked his soldiers  if they could endure without shame that the other wing should already have taken the camp and that they after all their success should be repulsed from the gates of the city V Then all of them loudly declaring their determination to the contrary he himself ad vanced the foremost to the gate with his shield raised over his head  the rest following under the like cover of their shields conjoined burst into the city and dis persing the Samnites who were near the gate took possession of the walls but were deterred from push ing forward by the smallness of their number 42 Of these transactions the consul was for some time ignorant and was busily employed in calling home his troops for the sun was now hastening to set and the approach of night rendered every place suspi cious and dangerous even to victorious troops Hav ing rode forward a considerable way he saw on the right the camp taken and heard on the left a shouting in the city with a confused noise of fighting and cries of terror This happened while the fight was going on at the gate When on riding up nearer he saw his own men on the walls and so much progress already made in the business pleased at having gained through the precipitate conduct of a few an opportunity of striking an important blow he ordered the troops whom he had sent back to the camp to be called out and to march to the attack of the city these having made good their entrance on the nearest side pro ceeded no farther because night approached Before morning however the town was abandoned by the enemy There were slain of the Samnites on that day at Aquilonia thirty thousand three hundred and forty taken three thousand eight hundred and seventy with ninety seven military standards One circumstance respecting Papirius is particularly mentioned by his LIVY toriaosâ that hardly ever was any general seen in the field with a more cheerful countenance  whether this was owing to his natural temper or to his confidence of success From the same firmness of mind it pro ceeded that he did not suffer himself to be diverted from the war by the dispute about the auspices and that in the heat of the battle when it was customary to vow temples to the immortal gods he vowed to Jo piter the victorious that if he should defeat the le gions of the enemy he would before he tasted of any generous liquor make a libation to him of a cup of wine and hoaey This kind of vow proved acceptable to the gods and they conducted the auspices to a for tunate issue 43 Like success attended the operations of the other consul at Cominium  leading up his forces to the walls at the first dawn he invested the city on every sidei and posted strong guards opposite to the gates to pre vent any sally being made Just as he was giving the signal the alarming message from his colleague touch ing the march of the twenty Samnite cohorts not only caused him to delay the assault but obliged him to call off a part of his troops when they were formed and ready to begin the attack He ordered Decjus Bru tus Scaeva a lieutenant general with the first legion twenty auxiliary cohorts and the cavalry to go and oppose the said detachment and in whatever place he should meet the foe there to stop and detain them and even to engage in battle should opportunity offer for it at all events not to suffer those troops to ap proach Cominium He then commanded the scaling ladders to be bronght up to the walls on every side of the city  and under a fence of closed shields advanced to the gates Thus at the same moment the gates were broken open and the assault made on every part of the rampart Though the Samnites before they saw the assailants on the works had possessed courage enough to oppose their approaches to the city yet now when the action was no longer carried on at a distance nor with missile weapons hut in close fight and when HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 217 those who had with difficulty gained the walls the most formidable obstruction in their way fought with ease on equal ground against an enemy inferior in strength they all forsook the towers and strongholds and were driven to the forum There for a short time they tried as a last effort to retrieve the fortune of the fight but soon throwing down their arms sur rendered to the consul to the number of fifteen thou sand four hundred  four thousand three hundred and eighty being slain Such was the course of events at dom1nium  such at Aquilonia In the middle space between the two cities where a third battle had been expected the enemy were not found  for when they were within seven miles of Cominium they were re called by their countrymen and had no part in either battle At night fall when they were now within sight of their camp nnd also of Aquilonia shouts from both places reaching them with equal violence induced them to halt then on the side of the camp which had been set on fire by the Romans the wide spreading flames discovered with more certainty the disaster which had happened and prevented their proceeding any farther In that same spot stretched on the ground at random nnder their arms they passed the whole night in great inquietude at one time wishing for at another dreading the light At the first dawn while they were still undetermined to what quarter they should direct their march they were obliged unpro tected as they were either by a rampart or advanced guard to betake themselves hastily to flight being descried by the cavalry who had gone in pursuit of the Samnites that left the town in the night These had likewise been perceived from the wails of Aquilonia and the legionary cohorts now joined in the pursuit The foot were unable to overtake them but the cavalry cut off about two hundred and eighty of their rear guard The rest with less loss than might have been expected in such a disorderly rout effected their escape to Bovianum leuving behind in their consternation 218 LIVY a great quantity of arms and eighteen military stan dards 44 The joy of one Roman army was enhanced by the success of the other Each consul with the ap probation of his colleague gave to his soldiers the plunder of the town which he had taken  and when the houses were cleared set them on fire Thus on the same day Aquilonia and Cominium were both re duced to ashes The consuls then united their camps where mutual congratulations took place between them and between their soldiers Here in the view of the two armies Carvilius bestowed on his men commenda tions and presents according to the desert of each  and Papirius likewise whose troops had been engaged in a variety of actions in the field in the assault of the camp and in that of the city presented Spurius Nau tius Spurius Papirius his nephew four centurions and a company of the spearmen with bracelets and crowns of gold â to Nautius on account of his beha vior at the head of his detachment when he hadÂ terri fied the enemy with the appearance as of a numerous army to young Papirius on account of his zealous exertions with the cavalry both in the battle and in harassing the Samnites in their flight by night when they withdrew privately from Aquilonia and to the centurions and company of soldiers because they were the first who gained possession of the gate and wall of that town All the horsemen he presented with gor gets and bracelets of silver on account of their distin guished conduct on many occasions A council was then held to consider of the propriety either of re moving both armies or one at least out of Samnium  in which it was concluded that the lower the strength of the Samnites was reduced the greater perseverance and vigor ought to be used in prosecuting the war until they should be effectually crushed that Samnium might be given up to the succeeding consuls in a state of per fect subjection As there was now no army of the enemy which could be supposed capable of disputing HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK X 210 the field they had only one mode of operation to pur sue the besieging of the cities  by the destruction of which they might be enabled to enrich their soldiers with the spoil and at the same time utterly to destroy the enemy reduced to the necessity of fighting their all being at stake The consuls therefore after de spatching letters to the senate and people of Rome containing accounts of the services which they had performed led away their legions to different quarters Papirius going to attack Sepinnm Carvilius to Vo lana 45 The letters of the consuls were heard with ex traordinary exultation both in the senate house and in the assembly of the people  and in a public thanks giving of four days continuance individuals concurred with hearty zeal in celebrating the public rejoicings These successes were not only important in themselves but peculiarly seasonable  for it happened that at the same time intelligence was brought of the Etrurians being again in arms The reflection naturally occurred how it would have been possible in case any misfor tune had happened in Samnium to have withstood the power of Etruria  which being encouraged by the con spiracy of the Samnites and seeing both the consuls and the whole force of the Romans employed against them had made use of that juncture in which the Ro mans had so much business on their hands for reviving hostilities Ambassadors from the allies being intro duced to the senate by the pretor Marcus Atilius com plained that their countries were wasted with fire and sword by the neighboring Etrurians because they had refused to revolt from the Romans  and they besought the conscript fathers to protect them from the violence and injustice of their common enemy The ambassa dors were answered that  the senate would take care that the allies should not repent their fidelity that  the Etrurians should shortly be in the same situation with the Samnites Notwithstanding which the bu siness respecting Etruria would have been prosecuted with less vigor had not information been received that LIVY the Faliscians likewise who had for many years lived in friendship with Rome had united their arms with those of the Etrurians The consideration of the near vicinity of that nation quickened the attention of the senate insomuch that they passed a decree that he ralds should be sent to demand satisfaction  which being refused war was declared against the Faliscians by direction of the senate and order of the people  and the consuls were desired to determine by lots which of them should lead an army from Samnium into Etruria Carvilius had in the mean time taken from the Samnites Volana Palumbinum and Hercu laneum  Volana after a siege of a few days Palumbi num the same day on w hich he approached the walls At Herculaneum it is true the consul had two regular engagements without any decisive advantage on either side and with greater loss than was suffered by the enemy but afterwards encamping on the spot he shut them up within their works besieged and took the town In these three towns were taken or slain ten thousand men of whom the prisoners composed somewhat the greater part On the consuls casting lots for the provinces Etruria fell to Carvilius to the great satisfaction of the soldiers who now found the cold too severe in Samnium Papirius was opposed at Sepinum with a more powerful force  he was obliged to fight often in pitched battles  often on a march and often under the walls of the city against the ir ruptions of the enemy and could neither besiege nor engage them on equal terms for the Samnites had not only the advantage of walls but likewise of numbers of men and arms to protect their walls At length after a great deal of fighting he forced them to submit to a regular siege This he carried on with vigor and made himself master of the city by means of his works and by storm The rage of the soldiers on this occa sion caused the greatest slaughter in the taking of the town  seven thousand four hundred fell by the sword  the number of the prisoners did not amount to three thousand The spoil of which the quantity was very HISTORY OF ROUE â BOOK X 221 great the whole substance of the Samnites being col lected in a few cities was given up to the soldiers 46 The snow had now intirely covered the face of the country and rendered the shelter of houses abso lutely necessary the consul therefore led home his troops from Samnium While he was on his way to Rome a triumph was decreed him with universal con sent  and accordingly he triumphed while in office and with extraordinary splendor considering the cir cumstances of those times The cavalry and infantry marched in the procession adorned with the honorable presents which they had received Great numbers of crowns were seen which had been bestowed as marks of honor for having saved the lives of citizens or for having first mounted walls or ramparts People s cu riosity was highly gratified in viewing the spoils of the Samnites and comparing them in respect of magni ficence and beauty with those taken by his father which were well known from being frequently exhi bited as ornaments of the public places Several pri soners of distinction renowned for their own exploits and those of their ancestors were led in the cavalcade There were carried in the train two millions and thirty three thousand asses in weight 1 said to be produced by the sale of the prisoners  and of silver taken in the cities one thousand three hundred and thirty pounds All the silver and brass were lodged in the tieasury no share of this part of the spoil being given to the soldiers The ill humor which this excited in the commons was farther exasperated by their being obliged to contribute by a tax to the payment of the army  whereas said they if the vain parade of con veying the produce of the spoil to the treasury had been disregarded donations might have been made to the soldiers and the pay of the army also supplied out of that fund The temple of Quirinus vowed by his father when dictator for that he himself had vowed it in the heat of battle I do not find in any ancient  49401 13s 6d 222 LIVY writer nor indeed could he in so short a time have finished the building of it the son in the office of consul dedicated and adorned with military spoils And of these so great was the abundance that not only that temple and the forum were decorated with them but quantities were also distributed among the allies and colonies in the neighborhood to serve as or naments to their temples and public places Immedi ately after his triumph he led his army into winter quarters in the territory of Vescia that country being exposed to the inroads of the Samnites Meanwhile in Etruria the consul Carvilius first laid siege to Troi lium when four hundred and seventy of the richest inhabitants offering a large sum of money for permis sion to leave the place he suffered them to depart the town with the remaining multitude he took by storm He afterwards reduced by force five forts strongly situated wherein were slain two thousand four hundred of the enemy and not quite two thou sand made prisoners To the Faliscians who sued for peace he granted a truce for a year on condition of their furnishing a hundred thousand asses in weight 1 and a year s pay for his army This business com pleted he returned home to a triumph which though it was less illustrious than that of his colleague in re spect of his share in the defeat of the Samnites was yet raised to an equality with it the whole honor of the campaign in Etruria belonging solely to him He carried into the treasury three hundred and ninety thousand asses in weight 2 Out of the remainder of the money accruing to the public from the spoils he contracted for the building of a temple to Fors Fortu na near to that dedicated to the same goddess by king Servius Tullius and gave to the soldiers out of the spoil one hundred and two asses3 each and double that sum to the centurions and horsemen  this dona tive was received the more gratefully on account of the parsimony of his colleague 1 3221 18Â id s 1259 7s 6d Â 6 Td HISTORY OF ROME â BOOR X 223 47 The favor of the consul saved from a trial be fore the

of his tory make in the beginning of their performance that I am going to write of a war the most memorable of all that were ever waged  that which the Carthagi nians under the conduct of Hannibal maintained with the Roman people for never did any other states and nations of more potent strength and resources en gage in a contest of arms  nor did these same nations at any other period possess so great a degree of power and strength The arts of war also practised by each party were not unknown to the other for they had already gained some experience of them in the first Punic war and so various was the fortune of this war so great its vicissitudes that the party which 232 LIVY proved in the end victorious was at times brought the nearest to the brink of ruin Besides they exerted in the dispute almost a greater degree of rancor than of strength the Romans being fired with indignation at a vanquished people presuming to take up arms against their conquerors the Carthaginians at the haughtiness and avarice which they thought the others showed in their imperious exercise of the superiority which they had acquired We are told that when Hamilcar was about to march at the head of an army into Spain after the conclusion of the war in Africa and was offering sacrifices on the occasion his son Hannibal then about nine years of age solicited him with boyish fondness to take him with him whereon he brought him up to the altars and compelled him to lay his hand on the consecrated victims and swear that as soon as it should be in his power he would show himself an enemy to the Roman people Being a man of high spirit he was deeply chagrined at the loss of Sicily and Sardinia for he considered Sicily as given up by his countrymen through too hasty de spair of their affairs and Sardinia as fraudulently snatched out of their hands by the Romans during the commotions in Africa with the additional insult of a farther tribute imposed on them 2 His mind was filled with these vexatious reflec tions  and during the five years that he was employed in Africa which followed soon after the late pacifica tion with Rome and likewise during nine years which he spent in extending the Carthaginian empire in Spain  his conduct was such as afforded a demon stration that he meditated a more important war than any in which he was then engaged  and that if he had lived some time longer the Carthaginians would have carried their arms into Italy under the command of Hamilcar instead of under that of Hannibal The death of Hamilcar which happened most seasonably for Rome and the unripe age of Hannibal occasioned the delay During an interval of about eight years between the demise of the father and the succession  HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXr 233 of the son the command was held by Hasdrubal whom it was said Hamilcar had first chosen as a fa rorite on account of his youthful beauty and after wards made him his son in law on account of his emi nent abilities in consequence of which connexion being supported by the interest of the Barcine faction which among the army and the commons was exceed ingly powerful he was invested with the command in chief in opposition to the wishes of the nobles He prosecuted his designs more frequently by means of policy than of force  and augmented the Carthaginian power considerably by forming connexions with the petty princes  and through the friendship of their leaders conciliating the regard of nations hitherto strangers But peace proved no security to himself One of the barbarians in resentment of his master having been put to death openly assassinated him and being seized by the persons present showed no kind of concern  nay even while racked with tor tures as if his exultation at having effected his pur pose had got the better of the pains the expression of his countenance was such as carried the appearance of a smile With this Hasdrubal who possessed a sur prising degree of skill in negotiation and in attaching foreign nations to his government the Romans renewed the treaty on the terms that the river Iberus should be the boundary of the two empires and that the Sa guntines who lay between them should retain their liberty 3 There was no room to doubt that the suffrages of the commons in appointing a successor to Hasdrubal would follow the direction pointed out by the leading voice of the army who had instantly carried young Hannibal to the head quarters and with one consent and universal acclamations saluted him general This youth when scarcely arrived at the age of manhood Hasdrubal had invited by letter to come to him  and that affair bad even been taken into deliberation in the senate where the Barcine faction showed a desire that Hannibal should be accustomed to military service 234 LIVY and succeed to the power of his father Hanno the leader of the other faction said  Although what Has drubal demands seems reasonable nevertheless I do not think that his request ought to be granted and when all turned their eyes on him with surprise at this ambiguous declaration he proceeded  Hasdrubal thinks that he is justly intitled to demand from the son the bloom of youth which he himself dedicated to the pleasures of Hannibal s father It would however be exceedingly improper in us instead of a military education to initiate our young men in the evil prac tices of generals Are we afraid lest too much time should pass before the son of Hamilcar acquires no tions of the unlimited authority and the parade of his father s sovereignty  or that after he had like a king bequeathed our armies as hereditary property to his son in law we should not soon enough become slaves to his son  I am of opinion that this youth should be kept at home where he will be amenable to the laws and to the magistrates  and that he should be taught to live on an equal footing with the rest of his coun trymen  otherwise this spark small as it is may hereafter kindle a terrible conflagration 4 A few particularly those of the best understand ing concurred in opinion with Hanno  but as it ge nerally happens the more numerous party prevailed over the more judicious Hannibal was sent into Spain and on his first arrival attracted the notice of the whole army The veteran soldiers imagined that Hamilcar was restored to them from the dead ob serving in him the same animated look and penetrating eye the same expression of countenance and the same features Then such was his behavior and so conciliating that in a short time the memory of bis father was the least among their inducements to esteem him Never man possessed a genius so admirably fitted to the discharge of offices so very opposite in their nature as obeying and commanding so that it was not easy to discern whether he were more beloved by the general or by the soldiers There was none to whom HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 235 Hasdrubal rather wished to intrust the command in any case where courage and activity were required nor did the soldiers ever feel a greater degree of con fidence and boldness under any other commander With perfect intrepidity in facing danger he pos sessed in the midst of the greatest perfect presence of mind No degree of labor could either fatigue his body or break bis spirit heat and cold he endured with equal firmness the quantity of his food and drink was limited by natural appetite not by the plea sure of the palate His seasons for sleeping and waking were not distinguished by the day or by the night whatever time he had to spare after business was finished that he gave to repose which however he never courted either by a soft bed or quiet retire ment  he was often seen covered with a cloak lying on the ground in the midst of the soldiers on guard and on the advanced posts His dress had nothing particular in it beyond that of others of the same rank his horses and his armor he was always re markably attentive to and whether he acted among the horsemen or the infantry he was eminently the first of either the foremost in advancing to the fight the last who quitted the field of battle These great virtues were counterbalanced in him by vices of equal magnitude inhuman cruelty  perfidy beyond that of a Carthaginian  a total disregard of truth and of every obligation deemed sacred  utterly devoid of all reverence for the gods he paid no regard to an oath no respect to religion Endowed with such a disposi tion a compound of virtues and vices he served under the command of Hasdrubal for three years during which he omitted no opportunity of improving himself in every particular both of theory and practice that could contribute to the forming of an accomplished general 5 But from the day on which he was declared chief he acted as if Italy had been decreed to him as his province and he had been commissioned to wage war with Rome Thinking every kind of delay imÂ 236 UVY prudent lest while be procrastinated some unforeseen event might disconcert his design as had been the case of his father Hamilcar and afterwards of Hasdrobal he determined to make war on the Saguntines and as an attack on them would certainly call forth the Roman arms be first led his army into the territory of the Olcadians a nation beyond the Iberus which though within the boundaries of the Carthaginians was not under their dominion in order that he might not seem to have aimed directly at the Saguntines but to be drawn on into a war with them by a series of events and by advancing progressively after the con quest of the adjoining nations from one place to the next contiguous Here he took and plundered Althea the capital of the nation abounding in wealth and this struck such terror into the smaller cities that they submitted to bis authority and to the imposition of a tribute He then led his army flushed with a victory and enriched with spoil into winter quarters at New Carthage Here by a liberal distribution of the booty and by discharging punctually the arrears of pay he firmly secured the attachment both of his own country men and of the allies and at the opening of the spring carried forward his arms against the Vaccaeans from whom he took by storm the cities Hermandica and Arbacala Arbacala by the bravery and number of its inhabitants was enabled to make a long defence Those who escaped from Hermandica joining the ex iles of the Olcadians the nation subdued in the prece ding summer roused up the Carpetans to arms and attacking Hannibal as he was returning from the coun try of the Vaccaeans not far from the river Tagus caused a good deal of disorder among his troops in cumbered as they were with spoil Hannibal avoided fighting and encamped on the bank then as soon as the enemy afforded him an opportunity he crossed the river by a ford and carried his rampart to such a dis tance from its edge as to leave room for the enemy to pass over resolving to attack them in their passage He gave orders to his cavalry that as soon as they HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 237 should see the troops advance into the water they should fall on them his infantry he formed on the bank with forty elephants in their front The Carpe tans with the addition of the Olcadians and Vaccaeans were one hundred thousand in number an army not to be overcome if a fight were to take place in an open plain These being naturally of an impetuous temper and confiding in their numbers believing also that the enemy s retreat was owing to fear and thinking that there was no obstruction to their gaining an immediate victory but the river lying in their way they raised the shout and without orders rushed from all parts into it every one by the shortest way At the same time a vast body of cavalry pushed from the opposite bank into the river and the conflict began in the middle of the channel where they fought on very unequal terms for in such a situation the infantry not being secure of footing and scarcely able to bear up against the stream were liable to be borne down by any shock from the horse though the rider were unarmed and took no trouble whereas a horseman having his limbs at li berty and his horse moving steadily even through the midst of the eddies could act either in close fight or at a distance Great numbers were swallowed up in the current while several whom the eddies of the river carried to the Carthaginians side were trodden to death by the elephants The hindmost who could more safely retreat to their own bank attempting to collect themselves into one body from the various parts to which their terror and confusion had dispersed them Hannibal not to give them time to recover from their consternation marched into the river with his infantry in close order and obliged them to fly from the bank Then by ravaging their country he reduced the Car petans also in a few days to submission And now all parts of the country beyond the Iberus except the territory of Saguntum was under subjection to the Carthaginians 6 A U C 534 B C 218 As yet there was no war with the Saguntines but disputes which seemed 238 LIVY likely to be productive of war were industriously fo mented between them and their neighbors particularly the Turdetans and the cause of these latter being espoused by the same persons who first sowed the seeds of the contention and plain proofs appearing that not an amicable discussion of rights but open force was the means intended to be used the Saguntines despatched ambassadors to Rome to implore assistance in the war which evidently threatened them with im mediate danger The consuls at Rome at that time were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempro nius Longus who after having introduced the ambas sadors to the senate proposed that the state of the public affairs should be taken into consideration It was re solved that ambassadors should be sent into Spain to inspect the affairs of the allies  instructed if they saw sufficient reason to warn Hannibal not to molest the Saguntines the confederates of the Roman people  and also to pass over into Africa to represent at Carthage the complaints of these to the Romans After this em bassy had been decreed and before it was despatched news arrived which no one had expected so soon that Saguntum was besieged The business was then laid in tire before the senate as if no resolution had yet passed Some were of opinion that the affair should be prosecuted with vigorous exertions both by sea and land and proposed that Spain and Africa should be decreed as the provinces of the consuls  others wished to direct the whole force of their arms against Spain and Hannibal while many thought that it would be imprudent to engage hastily in a matter of so great importance and that they ought to wait for the return of the ambassadors from Spain This opinion being deemed the safest was adopted  and the ambassadors Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tam philus were on that account despatched with the greater speed to Saguntum to Hannibal and in case of his refusing to desist from hostilities from thence to Carthage to insist on that general being delivered up to atone for the infraction of the treaty HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 239 7 While the Romans were employed in these deli berations and preparatory measures the siege of Sa guntum was prosecuted with the utmost vigor This city by far the most wealthy of any beyond the Iberus stood at the distance of about a mile from the sea the inhabitants are said to have come originally from the island Zacynthus and to have been joined by some of the Rutulian race from Ardea They had grown up in a very short time to this high degree of opulence by means of a profitable commerce both by sea and land aided by the increase of their numbers and their religious observance of compacts which they carried so far as to maintain the faith of all engagements in violate even should they tend to their own destruction Hannibal marched into their territory in a hostile man ner and after laying all the country waste attacked their city on three different sides There was an angle of the wall which stretched down into a vale more level and open than the rest of the ground round the place against this he resolved to carry on his ap proaches by means of which the battering ram might be advanced up to the walls But although the ground at some distance was commodious enough for the ma nagement of his machines yet when the works came to be applied to the purpose intended it was found to be no way favorable to the design  for it was over looked by a very large tower and as in that part danger was apprehended the wall had been raised to a height beyond that of the rest Besides as the great est share of fatigue and danger was expected there it was defended with the greater vigor by a band of chosen young men These at first with missile wea pons kept the enemy at a distance nor suffered them to carry on any of their works in safety In a little time they not only annoyed them from the tower and the walls but had the courage to sally out on the works and posts of the enemy in which tumultuary engagements the Saguntines generally suffered not a greater loss of men than the Carthaginians But Han nibal himself happening as he approached the wall 240 LIVY with too little caution to be wounded severely in the forepart of the thigh with a heavy javelin and falling in consequence of it such consternation and dismay spread through all the troops around him that they were very near deserting their posts 8 For some days following while the general s wound was under cure there was rather a blockade than a siege But although during this time there was a cessation of arms there was no intermission of the preparations either for attack or defence Hostilities therefore commenced anew with a greater degree of fury  and the machines began to be advanced and the battering rams to be brought up in a greater number of places so that in some parts there was scarcely room for the works The Carthaginian had great abundance of men  for it is credibly asserted that the number of his troops was not less than one hundred and fifty thousand the townsmen were obliged to have recourse to various shifts in order with their small numbers to execute every necessary measure and to make defence in so many different places  nor were tbey equal to the task  for now the walls began to be battered with the rams many parts of them were shat tered  in one place a large breach left the city quite exposed three towers in one range together with the whole extent of wall between them tumbled down with a prodigious crash  and so great was the breach that the Carthaginians looked on the town as already taken On which as if the wall had served equally for a covering to both parties the two armies rushed to battle Here was nothing like the disorderly kind of fight which usually happens in the assault of towns each party acting as opportunity offers advantage but regular lines were formed as if in the open plain on the ground between the ruins of the walls and the buildings of the city which stood at no great distance Their courage was animated to the greatest height on one side by hope on the other by despair the Car thaginian believing that only a few more efforts were necessary to render him master of the place the Sa HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 241 guntines forming with their bodies a bnlwark to their native city instead of its wall of which it had been stripped  not one of them giving ground lest be should make room for the enemy to enter by th e space The greater therefore the eagerness of the combatants and the closer their ranks the more wounds consequently were received no weapon falling without taking effect either in their bodies or armor 9 The Saguntines had a missile weapon called fa larica with a shaft of fir round except towards the end to which the iron was fastened  this part which was square as in a javelin they bound about with tow and daubed with pitch  it had an iron bead three feet long so that it could pierce both armor and body toge ther  but what rendered it most formidable was that being discharged with the middle part on fire and the motion itself increasing greatly the violence of the flame though it struck in the shield without penetra ting to the body it compelled the soldier to throw away his arms and left him without defence against succeeding blows Thus the contest long continued doubtful and the Saguntines finding that they suc ceeded in their defence beyond expectation assumed new courage  while the Carthaginian because he had not obtained the victory deemed himself vanquished On this the townsmen suddenly raised a shout pushed back the enemy among the ruins of the wall drove them off from that ground where they were embar rassed and confused and in fine compelled them to fly in disorder to their camp 10 In the mean time an account was received that ambassadors had arrived from Rome on which Han nibal sent messengers to the sea shore to meet them and to acquaint them that it would not be safe for them to come to him through the armed bands of so many savage nations and besides that in the present critical state of affairs he had not leisure to listen to embassies He saw clearly that on being refused audience they would proceed immediately to Carthage he therefore despatched messengers and letters beforehand to the LIV VOL III Q LIVY leaders of the Barcine faction charging them to pre pare their friends to act with spirit so that the other party should not be able to carry any point in favor of the Romans Thus the embassy there proved equally vain and fruitless excepting that the ambassadors were received and admitted to audience Hanno alone in opposition to the sentiments of the senate argued for their complying with the terms of the treaty and was heard with great attention rather out of the respect paid to the dignity of his character than from the ap probation of the hearers He said that  he had for merly charged and forewarned them as they regarded the gods who were guarantees and witnesses of the treaties not to send the son of Hamilcar to the army That man s shade said he  cannot be quiet nor any one descended from him nor will treaties with Rome subsist as long as one person of the Barcine blood and name exists As if with intent to supply fuel to fire you sent to your armies a young man burning with am bition for absolute power to which he could see but one road the exciting of wars one after another in order that he might live surrounded with arms and le gions You yourselves therefore have kindled this fire with which you are now scorched  your armies now in vest Saguntum a place which they are bound by treaty not to molest In a short time the Roman legions will invest Carthage under the guidance of those same dei ties who enabled them in the former war to take ven geance for the breach of treaties Are you strangers to that enemy or to yourselves or to the fortune at tending both nations  When ambassadors came from allies in favor of allies your worthy general disre garding the law of nations refused them admittance into his camp Nevertheless after meeting a repulse where ambassadors even from enemies are not refused access they have come to you requiring satisfaction in conformity to treaty They charge no crime on the public but demand the author of the transgression the person answerable for the offence The more modera tion there appears in their proceedings and the slower HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 243 they are in beginning a warfare so much the more un relenting I fear will prove the fury of their resent ment when they do begin Place before your eyes the islands jEgates and Eryx the calamities which you underwent on land and sea during the space of twenty four years nor were your troops then led by this boy but by his father Hamilcar another Mars as those men choose to call him But at that time we had not as we were bound by treaty avoided interfering with Taren tum in Italy as at present we do not avoid interfering with Saguntum Wherefore gods and men united to conquer us and the question which words could not determine  Which of the nations had infringed the treaty the issue of the war made known as an equi table judge giving victory to that side on which justice stood Hannibal is now raising works and towers against Carthage with his battering rams he is shaking the walls of Carthage The ruins of Saguntum oh  that I may prove a false prophet will fall on our heads and the war commenced against the Saguntines must be maintained against the Romans Some will say  Shall we then deliver up Hannibal I am sensi ble that with respect to him my authority is of little weight on account of the enmity between me and his father But as I rejoiced at the death of Hamilcar for this reason that had he lived we should now have been embroiled in a war with the Romans so do I hate and detest this youth as a fury and a firebrand kindling the like troubles at present Nor is it my opinion merely that he ought to be delivered up as an expia tion for the infraction of the treaty but that if no one demanded him he ought to be conveyed away to the remotest coasts whence no accounts of him nor even his name should ever reach us and where he would not be able to disturb the tranquillity of our state I therefore move you to resolve that ambassadors be sent instantly to Rome to make apologies to the senate others to order Hannibal to withdraw the troops from Saguntum and to deliver up Hannibal himself to the Romans in conformity to the treaty  and that a third 4t LIVY embassy be sent to make restitution to the Saguntines When Hanno had ended his discourse there was no occasion for any one to enter into a debate with him so intirely were almost the whole body of the senate in the interest of Hannibal and they blamed him as hav ing spoken with greater acrimony than even Valerius Flaccus the Roman ambassador They then answered the Roman ambassadors that  the war had been begun by the Saguntines not by Hannibal and that the Ro man people acted unjustly and unwisely if they pre ferred the interest of the Saguntines to that of the Car thaginians their earliest allies 11 While the Romans wasted time in sending em bassies Hannibal finding his soldiers fatigued with fighting and labor gave them a few days to rest ap pointing parties to guard the machines and works This interval he employed in reanimating his men stimu lating them at one time with resentment against the enemy at another with hope of rewards but a decla ration which he made in open assembly that on the capture of the city the spoil should be given to the soldiers inflamed them with such ardor that to all ap pearance if the signal had been given immediately no force could have withstood them The Saguntines as they had for some days enjoyed a respite from fighting neither offering nor sustaining an attack so they had never ceased either by day or night to labor hard in raising a new wall in that part where the city had been left exposed by the fall of the old one After this the operations of the besiegers were carried on with much greater briskness than before  nor could the besieged  well judgej whilst all places resounded with clamors of various kinds to what side they should first send suc cor or where it was most necessary Hannibal at tended in person to encourage a party of his men who were bringing forward a movable tower which ex ceeded in height all the fortifications of the city As soon as this had reached the proper distance and had by means of the engines for throwing darts and stones disposed in all its stories cleared the ramparts of all HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXI 245 who were to defend it then Hannibal seizing the op portunity sent about five hundred Africans with pick axes to undermine the wall at the bottom  which was not a difficult work because the cement was not strength ened with lime but the interstices filled up with clay according to the ancient method of building other parts of it therefore fell down together with those to which the strokes were applied and through these breaches several bands of soldiers made their way into the city They likewise there took possession of an eminence and collecting thither a number of engines for throwing darts and stones surrounded it with a wall in order that they might have a fortress within the city itself a citadel as it were to command it The Saguntines on their part raised an inner wall be tween that and the division of the city not yet taken Both sides exerted themselves to the utmost as well in forming their works as in fighting But the Saguntines while they raised defences for the inner parts con tracted daily the dimensions of the city At the same time the scarcity of all things increased in consequence of the long continuance of the siege while their ex pectations of foreign aid diminished  the Romans their only hope being at so great a distance and all the countries round being in the hands of the enemy However their sinking spirits were for a short time revived by Hannibal setting out suddenly on an expe dition against the Oretans and Carpetans for these two nations being exasperated by the severity used in levying soldiers had by detaining the commissaries afforded room to apprehend a revolt but receiving an unexpected check from the quick exertions of Hanni bal they laid aside the design of insurrection 12 In the mean time the vigor of the proceedings against Saguntum was not lessened  Maharbal son of Himilco whom Hannibal had left in the command pushing forward the operations with such activity that neither his countrymen nor the enemy perceived that the general was absent He not only engaged the Sa guntines several times with success but with three 246 LIVY battering rams demolished a considerable extent of the wall and when Hannibal arrived he showed him the whole ground covered with fresh ruins The troops were therefore led instantly against the citadel and after a furious engagement in which great loss was suffered on both sides part of the citadel was taken Small as were the hopes of in accommodation attempts were now made to bring it about by two persons  Alcon a Saguntine and Alorcus a Spaniard Alcon thinking that he might effect something by submissive intreaties went over to Hannibal by night without the knowlege of the Saguntines  but his piteous supplica tions making no impression and the terms offered by his enemy being full of rigor and such as might be expected from an enraged and not unsuccessful assail ant instead of an advocate he became a deserter af firming that if any man were to mention to the Sagun tines an accommodation on such conditions it would cost him his life  for it was required that they should make restitution to the Turdetans should deliver up all their gold and silver  and departing from the city with single garments should fix their residence in what ever place the Carthaginian should order When Al con declared that his countrymen would never accept these conditions of peace Alorcus insisting that when men s bodily powers are subdued their spirits are sub dued along with them undertook the office of mediator in the negotiation Now he was at this time a soldier in the service of Hannibal but connected with the state of Saguntum in friendship and hospitality Delivering up his sword to the enemy s guards he passed openly through the fortifications and was conducted at his own desire to the pretor A concourse of people of every kind having immediately assembled about the place the senate ordering the rest of the multitude to retire gave audience to Alorcus who addressed them in this manner 13  If your countryman Alcon after coming to the general to sue for peace had returned to you with the offered terms it would have been needless for me to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 247 have presented myself before you as I would not ap pear in the character either of a deputy from Hannibal or of a deserter But since he has remained with your enemy either through his own fault or yours  through his own if he counterfeited fear through yours if he who tells you truth is to be punished  I have come to you out of my regard to the ties of hospitality so long subsisting between us in order that you should not be ignorant that there are certain conditions on which you may obtain both peace and safety Now that what I say is merely out of regard to your interest and not from any other motive this alone is sufficient proof that so long as you were able to maintain a defence by your own strength or so long as you had hopes of suc cor from the Romans I never once mentioned peace to you Now when you neither have any hopes from the Romans nor can rely for defence either on your arms or walls I bring you terms of peace rather unavoidable than favorable And there may be some chance of carrying these into effect on this condition that as Hannibal dictates them in the spirit of a con queror so you should listen to them with the spirit of men conquered  that you consider not what you part with as loss for all things are the property of the victor but whatever is left to you as a gift The city a great part of which is already demolished and almost the whole of which he has in his possession he takes from you  your lands he leaves to you intending to assign a place where you may build a new town all your gold and silver both public and private property he orders to be brought to him  your persons with those of your wives and children he preserves inviolate pro vided you are satisfied to quit Saguntum without arms and with single garments These are the terms which as a victorious enemy he enjoins with these grievous and afflicting as they are your present circumstances counsel yon to comply I do not indeed despair but that when the intire disposal of every thing is given up to him he may remit somewhat of the severity of these articles But even these I think it advisable to 248 LIVY endure rather than to suffer yourselves to be slaugh tered and your wives and children seized and dragged into slavery before your eyes according to the practice of war 14 The surrounding crowd gradually approaching to hear this discourse had formed an assembly of the people conjoined with the senate when the men of principal distinction withdrawing suddenly before any answer was given collected all the gold and silver both from their private and public stores into the forum threw it into a fire hastily kindled for the purpose and then most of them cast themselves headlong in after it While the dismay and confusion which this occasioned filled every part of the city another uproar was heard from the citadel A tower after being battered for a long time had fallen down and a cohort of the Car thaginians having forced their way through the breach gave notice to their general that the place was destitute of the usual guards and watches Hannibal judging that such an opportunity admitted no delay assaulted the city with his whole force and instantly making himself master of it gave orders that every person of adult age should be put to the sword  which cruel order was proved however by the event to have been in a manner induced by the conduct of the people  for how could mercy have been extended to any of those who shutting themselves up with their wives and chil dren burned their houses over their heads or who being in arms continued fighting until stopped by death  15 In the town was found a vast quantity of spoil notwithstanding that the greater part of the effects had been purposely injured by the owners  and that during the carnage the rage of the assailants had made hardly any distinction of age although the prisoners were the property of the soldiers Nevertheless it appears that a large sum of money was brought into the treasury out of the price of goods exposed to sale and likewise that a great deal of valuable furniture and apparel was sent to Carthage Some writers have asserted that Sa HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 249 guntum was taken in the eighth month from the begin ning of the siege  that Hannibal then retired into win ter quarters to New Carthage and that in the fifth month after leaving Carthage he arrived again in Italy But if these accounts were true it is impossible that Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius could have been the consuls to whom in the beginning of the siege the ambassadors were sent from Saguntum and who during their office fought with Hannibal the one at the river Tieinus and both a considerable time after at the Trebia Either all these matters must have been transacted in less time or Saguntum must have been taken not first invested in the beginning of that year wherein Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius were consuls for the battle at the Trebia could not have happened so late as the year of Cn Servilius and Caius Flaminius because Caius Flaminius entered on the office of consul at Ariminum having been elected thereto by Tiberius Sempronius who after the engage ment at the Trebia had gone home to Rome for the purpose of electing consuls and when the election was finished returned into winter quarters to the army 16 The ambassadors returning from Carthage brought information to Rome that every thing tended to war and nearly at the same time news was re ceived of the destruction of Saguntum Grief seized the senate for the deplorable catastrophe of their allies and shame for not having afforded them suc cor  rage against the Carthaginians and such appre hensions for the public safety as if the enemy were already at their gates  so that their minds being agi tated by so many passions at once their meetings were scenes of confusion and disorder rather than of deli beration for  never they observed  had an enemy more enterprising and warlike entered the field with them  and at no other period had the Roman power been so unfit for great exertions or so deficient in practice As to the Sardinians Corsicans Istriatis and Illyrians they had only roused the Roman arms without affording them exercise and with the Gauls 250 LI VY the affair was really a tumult rather than a war The Carthaginians another kind of foe were crossing the Iberus  trained to arms during twenty three years in the most laborious service among the nations of Spain  accustomed to conquer on every occasion  habituated to the command of a most able general flushed with their late conquest of a very opulent city and bringing with them many Spanish states while the Gauls ever glad of an opportunity of fighting would doubtless be engaged in the expedition War must then be waged against all the world in the heart of Italy and under the walls of Rome 17 The provinces had been already named for the consuls but now they were ordered to cast lots Spain fell to Cornelius Africa with Sicily to Sempronius For the service of the year six legions were decreed with such a number of the troops of the allies as the consuls should deem requisite and a fleet as great as could be fitted out Of Romans were enlisted twenty four thousand foot and one thousand eight hundred horse of the allies forty thousand foot and four thou sand four hundred horse The fleet consisted of two hun dred and twenty ships of five banks of oars and twenty light galleys The question was then proposed to the people whether  they chose and ordered that war should be declared against the people of Carthage V This being determined on a general supplication was performed in the city and prayers offered to the gods that the war which the Roman people had ordered might have a prosperous and a happy issue The forces were divided between the consuls in this manner to Sempronius were assigned two legions containing each four thousand foot and three hundred horse and of the allies sixteen thousand foot and one thousand eight hundred horse with one hundred and sixty ships of war and twelve light galleys With these land and sea forces Tiberius Sempronius was sent to Sicily with intention that he should cross over to Africa in case the other consul should be able to prevent the Cartha ginians from entering Italy The army assigned to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 251 Cornelius was less numerous because Lucius Manlius a pretor was also sent into Gaul with a considerable force Of ships particularly Cornelius share was small sixty quinqueremes only w ere given him for it was not supposed either that the enemy would come by sea or that he would exert himself on that element Two Roman legions with their regular proportion of cavalry and of the allies fourteen thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse were assigned to him In this year the province of Gaul though not yet threatened with a Carthaginian war had posted in it two Roman legions and ten thousand confederate infantry with one thousand confederate horsemen and six hundred Roman 18 These adjustments being made they yet deter mined previous to the taking up arms to send Quin tus Fabius Marcus Livius Lucius iEmilius Caius Li cinius and Quintus Baebius men venerable on account of their age into Airica as ambassadors to require an explanation from the Carthaginians whether Hanni bal s attack on Saguntum had been authorised by the state  and in case they should acknowlege it as it was expected they would and defend that proceeding then to declare war against the people of Carthage When the Romans arrived at Carthage and were introduced to an audience of the senate Quintus Fabius without enlarging on the subject simply proposed the question as stated in their instructions on which one of the Carthaginians replied  Romans in your former em bassy you were too precipitate when you demanded that Hannibal should be delivered up as attacking Saguntum of his own authority But your present proceeding though hitherto milder in words is in effect more unreasonably severe A charge was made against Hannibal only when you required him to be delivered up now you endeavor to extort from us a confession of wrong committed and at the same in stant as if we had already pleaded guilty insist on re paration For myself I am of opinion that the ques tion proper to be asked is not whether Saguntum was LIVY attacked by public authority or private but whether justly or unjustly  for with respect to a subject of our government whether acting under direction of the public authority or not the right of inquiry and of punishing is exclusively our own The only point then that comes into discussion with you is whether the act was allowable according to treaty  Where fore since you chose that a distinction should be made between what commanders do by public autho rity and what of their own will there is a treaty sub sisting between us concluded by your consul Lutatius in which provision is made for the interest of the allies of both nations But there is no clause in favor of the Saguntines  for they were not at the time in alliance with you But then in the treaty entered into with Hasdrubal the Saguntines are expressly exempted from hostilities In answer to which I shall urge nothing but what I have learned from yourselves  for you asserted that the treaty which your consul Caius Lutatius at first concluded with us inasmuch as it had been concluded without either the approbation of the senate or an order of the people was not binding on you  and that for that reason another treaty was ratified anew under the sanction of public authority Now if your treaties do not bind you unless sanc tioned by your approbation and order surely the treaty of Hasdrubal under the same circumstances cannot be binding on us Cease therefore to talk of Saguntum and the Iberus and let your minds at length give birth to the burden of which they are long in labor The Roman then folding up a corner of his robe said  Here we bring you peace and war take which you choose Which proposal they an swered with an equal degree of peremtory heat call ing out that  he should give whichever he chose He then threw open the fold again and said that he gave war they with one voice replied that  they ac cepted it and with the same spirit with which they accepted it would prosecute it 19 This mode of a direct demand and declaration HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 253 of war was deemed suitable to the dignity of the Ro man people even before this time but more particu larly after the destruction of Saguntum than to enter into a verbal disquisition concerning the construction of treaties for if the business were to be decided by argument what simil1tude was there between the treaty of Hasdrubal and the former treaty of Lutatius which was altered  Since in the latter there was an express clause inserted that  it should be valid provided the people should ratify itbut in that of Hasdrubal there was no such provision Besides this treaty was con firmed in such a manner by the silent approbation of so many years during the remainder of his life that even after the death of its author no alteration was made in it although even were the former treaty adhered to there was sufficient security provided for the Sagun tines by the exempting from hostilities the allies of both nations there being no distinction made of those who then were or of those who sjiould afterwards become such And as it was evidently allowable to form new alliances who could think it reasonable either that persons should not be received into friendship on ac count of any degree of merit whatever  or that peo ple once taken under protection should not be de fended  The only restriction implied was that the allies of the Carthaginians should not be solicited to revolt nor revolting of their own accord should be received The Roman ambassadors in pursuance of their instructions received at Rome passed over from Carthage into Spain in order to make application to the several states of that country and either to en gage their alliance or at least to dissuade them from joining the Carthaginians They came first to the Bargusian by whom being favorably received because that people were dissatisfied with the Carthaginian government they roused the spirits of many powers on the farther side of the Iberus by the flattering pros pect of a change in their circumstances Thence they came to the Volscians whose answer which was re ported with applause through every part of Spain de 254 Ll VY terred the other states from joining in alliance with Rome For thus the oldest member of their assembly replied  Where is your sense of shame Romans when you require of us that we should prefer your friendship to that of the Carthaginians  The Sagun tines who embraced it have been abandoned by you  in which abandonment you their allies have shown greater cruelty than the Carthaginians their enemy showed in destroying them What I recommend is that you seek connexions where the fatal disaster of Saguntum is unknown To the states of Spain the ruins of that city will be both a melancholy and forci ble warning not to confide in the faith or alliance of Rome They were then ordered to depart immedi ately from the territories of the Volscians  nor did they afterwards meet from any assembly in Spain a more favorable reception  therefore after making a circuit through all parts of that country without effect ing any thing they passed over into Gaul 20 At Ruscino they encountered a new and terrify ing spectacle the people coming in arms to the assem bly for such is the custom of that country After displaying in magnificent terms the renown and the valor of the Roman people and the greatness of their empire they requested that the Gauls would not grant a passage through their cities and territories to the Carthaginian who was preparing to invade Italy On which we are told such a laugh was raised accompa nied by a general outcry of displeasure that the ma gistrates and the elder members of the assembly could with difficulty bring the younger men into order so unreasonable and so absurd did it appear to require that the Gauls should not suffer the war to pass into Italy but should draw it on themselves and expose their own lands to devastation instead of those of strangers When the uproar was at length appeased an answer was given to the ambassadors that  the Gauls had never received either any kindness from the Romans or ill treatment from the Carthaginians that should induce them to take arms either in favor of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 255 the former or in opposition to the latter On the con trary they had been informed that their countrymen were expelled by the Roman people from the lands and out of the limits of Italy compelled to pay tribute and subjected to indignities of every kind To the same application they received the same answer from the other assemblies in Gaul nor did they meet any very friendly or peaceable reception until they arrived at Marseilles There in consequence of the diligent inquiries made by those faithful allies they learned that the minds of the Gauls had been already prepos sessed in favor of Hannibal but that even he would find that nation not very tractable so ferocious and ungovernable were their tempers unless he frequently revived the attachment of their chiefs with gold of which hat people were remarkably greedy Having thus finished their progress through the states of Spain and Gaul the ambassadors returned to Rome shortly after the consuls had set out for their provinces and found the passions of every man warmly excited by the prospect of the approaching war for all accounts now agreed that the Carthaginians had passed the Iberus 21 Hannibal after taking Saguntum had retired into winter quarters at New Carthage where receiving information of all the transactions and resolutions which had passed at Rome and at Carthage and that he was not only the leader but likewise the cause of the war he determined no longer to defer his measures and having distributed and sold off the remains of the plunder he called together his Spanish troops and spoke to this effect  Fellow soldiers as we have al ready established peace through all the states of Spain we must either lay aside our arms and disband our forces or transfer the seat of war to other countries  for the way to make these nations florish with the blessings not only of peace but of victory is for us to seek glory and spoil from others Wherefore as we shall soon be called to service at a distance from home and as it is uncertain when you may see your families 256 tlVY and whatever is dear to you if any choose to visit your friends I now give you leave of absence At the beginning of spring I charge you to attend here in order that with the aid of the gods we may enter on a war from which we shall reap abundance both of honor and riches This voluntary offer of leave to revisit their homes was highly pleasing to almost every one of them  for they already longed to see their friends and foresaw a longer absence from them likely to happen This interval of rest renewed the powers of their minds and bodies enabling them to encounter every hardship anew for the fatigues they had al ready sustained and those they were soon to undergo appeared to be little thought of At the beginning of spring they therefore assembled according to orders Hannibal after reviewing the auxiliaries of the several nations went to Gades where he fulfilled his vows to Hercules and bound himself in new ones in case his future operations should be crowned with success Then dividing his attention between the measures re quisite for annoying the enemy and those necessary for defence lest while he should be making his way to Italy by land through Spain and Gaul Africa should be naked and open to an attack of the Romans from Sicily he resolved to provide for its security by send ing thither a strong body of forces In the room of these he required a reinforcement to be sent to him from Africa consisting chiefly of light armed spear men This he did with the view that the Africans serving in Spain and the Spaniards in Africa where each would be better soldiers at a distance from home they might be as it were mutual hostages for the good behavior of each other He sent into Africa of infantry thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty targeteers with eight hundred and seventy Balearic slingers  of cavalry collected from many na tions one thousand two hundred Part of these forces he ordered to garrison Carthage the rest to be distri buted through Africa At the same time he ordered four thousand chosen young men whom he had en HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXI 257 listed by means of commissaries sent among the several states to be conducted to Carthage both as an addi tion of strength and as hostages 22 Judging also that Spain ought not to be neglected in which opinion he was not the less confirmed by hav ing been acquainted with the tour made through it by the Roman ambassadors for the purpose of engaging the friendship of the chiefs he allotted that province to Hasdrubal his brother a man of talents and acti vity  and he formed his strength mostly of the troops from Africa giving him eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty African foot with three hundred Ligurians and five hundred Balearians To these bodies of in fantry were added four hundred and fifty horsemen of the Liby Phoenicians a race composed of a mixture of Phoenicians with Africans  of Numidians and Mauri tanians who inhabit the coast of the ocean to the number of oue thousarid eight hundred  a small band of the Ilergetans a Spanish nation amounting to two hundred horsemen  and that he might not be desti tute of any kind of force which might be useful in operations on land fourteen elephants Also for the defence of the sea coast because as the Romans had been formerly victorious at sea it was probable that they would now likewise exert themselves in the same line a fleet was assigned him of fifty quinqueremes two quadriremes and five triremes but of these only thirty two quinqueremes and the five triremes were fully equipped and manned with rowers From Gades he returned to Carthage the winter quarters of the army Then putting his troops in motion he led them by the city of Etovissa to the Iberus and the sea coast Here as is said he saw in his sleep a youth of divine figure who told him that he was sent by Jupiter to guide him into Italy and bade him therefore to follow and not turn his eyes to any side Filled with terror he followed at first without looking to either side or behind  but afterwards out of the curiosity natural to mankind considering what that could be at which he was forbidden to look back he could no longer restrain uv vol ill R 258 LIVY his eyes he then saw behind him a serpent of immense size moving along and felling all the bushes and trees in its way and after it followed a dark cloud with loud thundering in the air On which asking what was the nature of this great commotion or what it portended he was told that it meant the devastation of Italy he was then ordered to proceed in his course and not to inquire farther but let the decrees of the destinies remain in obscurity 23 Overjoyed at this vision he led his forces in three divisions over the lberus having sent forward emissaries to conciliate by presents the friendship of the Gauls through whose country the army was to pass and to explore the passes of the Alps The number of forces which he brought across the lberus was ninety thousand foot and twelve thousand horse He then reduced the Ilergetans the Bargusians the Ausetanians and the province of Lacetania which lay at the foot of the Pyrenean mountains The govern ment of all this tract he gave to Hanno with inten tion to retain the command of the narrow passes which lead from Spain into Gaul and to enable him to secure the possession of it assigned him a body of forces consisting of ten thousand foot and one thou sand horse When the army began to pass the defiles of the Pyrenees and a rumor spread with greater certainty among the barbarians that the war was in tended against the Romans three thousand of the Car petan foot left him and marched away actuated as clearly appeared not so much by dread of the enemy as of the great length of the march and the insu perable difficulty of crossing the Alps Hannibal considering that to recall or detain them by force might be attended with dangerous consequences and wishing to avoid every thing that might irritate the ferocious tempers of the rest sent home above ten thousand men in whom he had discovered an equal aversion from the service pretending that he had in like manner dismissed the Carpetans 24 Then lest delay and idleness should inspire HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 259 them with improper notions he crossed the Pyrenees with the rest of his forces and pitched his camp near the town of Illiberis The Gauls had been told that his operations were directed against Italy  neverthe less having been informed that the Spaniards on the other side of the Pyrenees bad been reduced by force ancr that a powerful guard was stationed in their coun try they were so much alarmed for their liberty that they hastily took arms and several states formed a general meeting at Ruscino When Hannibal was in formed of this dreading delay more than the power of the enemy he despatched envoys to their petty princes acquainting them that he wished to confer with them in person and proposing that either they should come nearer to Illiberis or that he would advance to Rus cino  that he would with great pleasure receive them in his camp or without hesitation go himself to theirs for he came into Gaul as a friend not as an enemy and meant not to draw a sword if the Gauls would allow him to hold his resolution until he arrived in Italy This passed through messengers but the Gauls immediately removed their camp to Illiberis came without reluctance to the Carthaginian and were so highly captivated by his presents that with great cheerfulness they conducted his army by the town of Ruscino through their territories  25 In Italy at this time nothing farther was known than that Hannibal had passed the Iberus intelligence of which had been brought to Rome by ambassadors from Marseilles  yet as if he had already passed the Alps the lioians engaging the concurrence of the In subrians began a revolt their motive for which was not their ancient enmity towards the Roman people but the offence which they lately conceived at the establishment of the colonies on the Po at Cremona and Placentia within the limits of the Gallic territo ries For this reason they hastily took arms and making an irruption into those very soils caused such terror and confusion that not only the country people but even the Roman commissioners who had come thither 260 LIVY to distribute the lands doubting their safety within the walls of Placentia fled to Mutina These were Caius Lutatius Caius Servilius and Titus Annius There is no doubt about the name of Lutatius  but some an nals instead of Caius Servilius and Titus Annius have Quintus Acilius and Caius Herennius others Eub lius Cornelius Asina and Caius Papirius Maso There is also an uncertainty whether ambassadors sent to expostulate with the Boians suffered violence or whether the ill treatment was offered to the commis sioners who were measuring out the lands While they were shut up in Mutina and the besiegers a peo ple quite unskilled in the arts of attacking towns and remarkably lazy with respect to all military opera tions lay inactive round the walls which they could not injure a pretended treaty for an accommodation was set on foot and the ambassadors being invited out to a conference by the chiefs of the Gauls were in violation not only of the laws of nations but of the faith pledged on the occasion seized and put into con finement the Gauls declaring that they would not set them at liberty unless their own hostages were re turned to them On hearing of this treatment of the ambassadors and the danger which threatened Mutina and the garrison Lucius Manlius the pretor inflamed with resentment led his army in a rapid march to wards that city The ground on both sides of the road was at that time covered with woods and mostly uninhabited Advancing into these places without having examined the country he fell into an ambush and with much difficulty after losing a great number of men made his way into the open plains Here be fortified a camp which the Gauls not having resolu tion to attack the soldiers recovered their spirits though it was evident that their strength was greatly diminished they then began their march anew and as long as their road lay through open grounds the enemy never appeared  but falling on their rear when the Romans again entered the woods they threw ali into fright and confusion slew eight hundred soldiers HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 261 and carried off six standards As soon as the troops had got clear of that difficult and troublesome pass the Gauls ceased from their attempts and the Romans from their fears and the latter afterwards easily se curing the safety of their march through the open country proceeded to Tanetum a small town on the Po Here by means of a temporary fortification which they raised the supply of provisions conveyed by the river and the aid of the Brescian Gauls they maintained their ground against the numerous forces of the enemy though daily augmented 26 When news of this sudden insurrection arrived at Rome and the senate understood that besides the Carthaginian war they had another to maintain with the Gauls they ordered Caius Atilius a pretor to march to the relief of Manlius with one Roman legion and five thousand allied troops enlisted by the consul in the late levy with these he arrived at Tanetum without any interruption  for the enemy through fear had re tired at his approach At the same time Publius Cor nelius having raised a new legion in the room of that which had been sent with the pretor set out from the city with sixty ships of war  and coasting along Etru ria Liguria and the Salyan mountains he arrived at Marseilles and pitched his camp on the nearest mouth of the Rhone  for that river dividing itself flows into the sea through several channels  scarcely believing yet that Hannibal had passed the Pyrenean moun tains But when he learned that he had even then employed in preparations for passing the Rhone being unable to determine in what place he might meet him and his men being not yet sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of the voyage he despatched three hun dred chosen horsemen guided by some Massilians and auxiliary Gauls to gain information of every particu lar and to take a view of the enemy without danger Hannibal procuring either by threats or presents an unmolested passage through the other provinces had arrived at the country of the Volcae a powerful state These possessed territories on both sides of the Rhone 202 LIVY but doubting their ability to repel the Carthaginian from the country on the hither side in order to avail themselves of the river as a defence they had trans ported almost all their effects beyond it and were ready in arms to defend the opposite bank Hannibal  by means of presents prevailed on the inhabitants of the other districts contiguous to the river and even on those of that very state who stayed in their own habi tations to collect ships from every quarter and to build others  themselves being desirous that his army should be transported and their country freed aa speedily as might be from the burden of such a mul titude of men A vast number of vessels therefore were brought together and of boats rudely constructed for the purpose of short passages Others were formed by hollowing single trees the Gauls first showing the way and afterwards the soldiers themselves encou raged by the plenty of timber and likewise by the easiness of the work hastily formed clumsy hulks to transport themselves and their effects regardless of every other circumstance provided they would but float and contain a burden 27 And now when all preparatory measures for ef fecting their passage were completed the enemy on the farther side threatened them with a violent oppo  sition covering the whole bank with horse and foot But in order to remove these out of his way Hanni bal ordered Hanno son of Bomilcar to set out by night at the first watch with a body of forces com posed mostly of Spaniards to march up the river to the distance of one day s journey and then crossing it as secretly as possible to lead round his detachment with all expedition that he might fall on the rear of the enemy when so required The Gauls who were given him as guides on the occasion informed him that at the distance of about twenty five miles above that place the river spreading round a small island showed the passage where it divided itself broader and the channel consequently shallower At this place felling timber with the utmost haste they formed rafts HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 263 for carrying over the men horses and other weighty matters As to the Spaniards they took no trouble about any means of conveyance but thrusting their clothes into leathern bags and resting their bodies on their bucklers placed under them swam over the river The rest of the troops having also passed over on the rafts joined together they encamped near the river and being fatigued by the march during the night and by the labor of the work refreshed themselves with rest for one day while their leader was earnestly stu dying how to execute the design in proper season Next day having marched from thence they made a signal by raising a smoke that they had effected their passage and were not far distant which being per ceived by Hannibal he gave the signal for his troops to pass the river The infantry had the boats equipped and in readiness and a line of larger vessels with the horsemen most of whom had their horses swimming near them crossed higher up the river in order to break the force of the current and thereby render the water smooth for the boats passing below The horses for the most part were led after the sterns by collars those only excepted which had been put on board the ships bridled and accoutred in order that the riders on their landing might have them ready for instant use 28 The Gauls ran down to the bank to meet them with various kinds of cries and songs according to their custom tossing their shields above their heads and with their right hands brandishing their javelins notwith standing the terrible appearance of such a vast number of ships together with the loud roaring of the river and the confused clamors of the mariners and soldiers both of those who were struggling to force their way through the violent current and of those who from the opposite bank encouraged their friends on their pas sage While they saw sufficient cause of terror on their front a more terrifying shout assailed them from behind where their camp was taken by Hanno Presently he came up  so that they were encompassed by dangers 264 LIVY such a vast number of soldiers being brought by tbe ships and another army quite unexpected pressing on their rear The Gauls finding that instead of being the assailants as they had intended they were even driven from their own ground made off hastily through the clearest opening that they could find and in the utmost confusion dispersed to their several towns Hannibal now looked with contempt on the boisterous menaces of this people and bringing over the rest of his forces at leisure encamped on the spot Various plans I should suppose were projected for conveying the ele phants across the river at least the accounts trans mitted of the manner in which it was performed are various Some relate that being brought all together to the river side the fiercest among them was provoked to anger by his keeper who pursued him by swimming as he fled into the water that this drew down the rest of the herd  and that each as soon as he lost the bot tom was by the mere force of the stream hurried to the opposite bank But it is more generally agreed that they were carried over on rafts and as this must have appeared the safer method it is now more easy to be lieve that the business was so effected One raft of two hundred feet in length and fifty in breadth was extended from the bank into the river the upper part of it being firmly fastened to the shore with several strong cables to prevent its being carried down with the stream and this was covered with a layer of earth like a bridge in order that the beasts might without fear walk on it as on solid ground Another raft of equal breadth and one hundred feet long was fastened to this and when the elephants being driven over the fixed raft as on a road the females going foremost passed over to the smaller one which was joined to it then the ropes with which this latter had been slightly tied were instantly loosed and it was towed away by several light vessels to the other bank When the first were thus landed it was brought back for the rest As long as they were driven as it were on a bridge con nected with the land they showed no signs of fear HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXI 2C5 they first began to be frightened when the raft being set loose they were separated from the rest and dragged into the deep then pressing close to one another as those on the outside drew back from the water they occasioned a good deal of disorder but terrified by seeing the water on every side of them they soon be  came quiet Some indeed becoming outrageous tum bled into the river but their own weight rendering them steady though their riders were thrown off they cautiously searched out the shallow parts and came safe to land 29 While thus employed in transporting the ele phants Hannibal had despatched five hundred Numi dian horsemen towards the camp of the Romans to discover where they lay what were their numbers and if possible what their designs This detachment of cavalry was met by the three hundred Roman horse sent as mentioned above from the mouth of the Rhone A battle ensued more furious than common between such small numbers  for besides many wounds there was a great loss of lives nearly equal on both sides and it was not until the Romans were thoroughly fatigued that the dismay and flight of the Numidians yielded them the victory On the side of the conquerors fell one hundred and sixty not all Romans however some of them being Gauls  and of the vanquished more than two hundred As this prelude and omen like wise of the war portended to the Romans a favorable issue on the whole so did it a victory not unbloody nor to be purchased without a dangerous struggle After this action the parties returned to their re spective commanders On the one hand Scipio could form no determination farther than to regulate bis measures by the designs and proceedings of the enemy  and on the other Hannibal was in doubt whether he should continue his march into Italy without intermis sion or come to an engagement with the first Roman army that threw itself in his way However from the thoughts of an immediate engagement he was diverted by the arrival of ambassadors from the Boians and of 2G6 LIVY a chieftain called Magalus who assuring him that they would he his guides on the march and companions in the dangers recommended him to reserve the first essay of his intire force for the attack of Italy and not previously to hazard any diminution of his strength His troops feared indeed the enemy for the memory of the former war was not yet obliterated but much more did they dread the extreme difficulty of the march and the passage of the Alps a matter exceedingly for midable at least by report and to people unacquainted with those mountains 30 Hannibal therefore as soon as he had determined to proceed forward and direct his operations against Italy called an assembly of the soldiers and endea vored by the different methods of reproof and exhor tation to mould their minds to his purpose  He won dered he said  what sudden terror could have taken possession of breasts hitherto always undaunted Du ring such a number of years in which they carried arms they were constantly victorious nor had left Spain until all the nations and countries comprehended be tween the two opposite seas were under subjection to Carthage Then seized with indignation at the Roman people demanding that every person concerned in the siege of Saguntum should be delivered into their hands as criminals they had passed the Iberus resolved to exterminate the Roman race and to set the world at liberty No one at that time thought the march too long though they were to continue it from the setting place of the sun to that of its rising Now when they saw by far the greater part of the journey accom plished after conquering the obstructions of the Pyre nean forests in the midst of the fiercest nations  after effecting their passage over so great a river as the Rhone in the face of so many thousands of Gauls op posing them  nay when they had the Alps within view the other side of which was a part of Italy just in the gates of their enemy s country they grew weary and haltedâ was it that they conceived the Alps to be any thing more than high mountains Suppose them higher HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 267 than the summits of the Pyrenees surely no part of the earth reached to the heaven nor was of a height insuperable by mankind These eminences in reality were inhabited cultivated produced and supported animals Were they passable by small parties and impassable by armies Those very ambassadors before their eyes had not been carried aloft on wings over the Alps Neither had their ancestors been natives of the soil but settlers who came from other countries into Italy and who crossed with safety those same hills often in vast bodies with their wives and children aa other colonies emigrate To a soldier carrying nothing with him but the implements of war what could be im passable or insuperable  In order to gain possession of Saguntum what toils what dangers did they not undergo for the space of eight months 1 Now when their object was Rome the capital of the world what difficulty or danger should be deemed capable of re tarding the enterprise  The Gauls formerly made themselves masters of those very places which the Car thaginians despaired of approaching Either there fore they must yield the superiority in spirit and cou rage to that nation which during a short time past they had so frequently overcome or they must look for the termination of their march in the field lying between the Tiber and the walls of Rome 31 When by these exhortations he had re animated their courage he ordered them to take refreshment and prepare for a march On the following day he proceeded upwards along the bank of the Rhone di recting his route towards the interior parts of Gaul not because that was the more direct road to the Alps but because he thought that the farther he withdrew from the sea the less probability there would be of his meeting with the Romans with whom he did not intend to come to battle until he should have arrived in Italy After a march of four days he came to the Island Here the rivers Isara and Rhone which run down from different parts of the Alps after encom passing a pretty large tract of ground unite their 268 LIVY streams and the plain inclosed between them is called The Island The adjacent country is inhabited by the Allobroges a nation even in those times inferior to none in Gaul in power and reputation but at that juncture weakened by discord Two brothers dis puted the sovereignty The elder who had been in vested with the government by name Brancus was dispossessed by the younger brother and a combina tion of the younger men  on which side though there was less justice there was more strength Most op portunely the parties in this dissension referred their pretensions to the judgment of Hannibal who being appointed arbitrator of the disputed sovereignty gave a decision agreeable to the sense of the senate and of the principal men in the state  that the government should be restored to the elder In requital of which favor he was assisted with a supply of provisions and plenty of all kind of necessaries particularly of cloth ing which the terrible accounts of the cold of the higher regions made it necessary to provide After settling the disputes of the Allobroges though now bent on proceeding to the Alps he took not the direct road thither but turned to the left into the country of the Tricastines  thence through the extreme bounda ries of the Vocontian territory he advanced into that of the Tricorians meeting no obstruction until he came to the river Druentia This also deriving its source from the Alps is of all the rivers in Gaul the most difficult to pass  for though conveying a vast body of water it admits not the use of ships  because being confined by no banks it flows in several and not al ways the same channels continually forming new shal lows and new whirlpools so that a person is in dan ger of missing his way  and besides rolling down loose gritty stones the footing is unsteady Happening too at that time to be swelled by rains it caused the ut most disorder amo ig the troops on their passage and which was much increased by their own hurry and confused clamors 32 In about three days after Hannibal s moving HISTORY OF ROME 269  BOOK XXI from the bank of the Rhone the consul Pnblius Cor nelius had come with his forces in order of battle to the camp of the enemy intending to fight them without delay But finding the fortifications aban doned and concluding that as they had got the start of him so far it would be difficult to overtake them he inarched back to the sea where his ships lay  for he judged that he might thus with greater ease and safety meet Hannibal on his descent from the Alps How ever not to leave Spain the province which the lots had assigned to his care destitute of the aid of Ro man troops he sent his brother Cneius Scipio with the greater part of his forces against Hasdrubal with the expectation not merely of protecting old allies and acquiring new but of driving him out of Spain He himself with a very small force repaired to Genoa proposing with the army which was stationed on the Po to provide for the security of Italy From the Druentia Hannibal passing through a tract in general level without any molestation from the Gauls inha biting those regions arrived at the Alps And now notwithstanding that the men had already conceived notions of the scene from report which in cases capa ble of misrepresentation generally goes beyond the truth yet the present view exhibited such objects as renewed all their terrors  the height of the mountains the snows almost touching the sky the wretched huts standing on the cliffs the cattle and beasts shivering with the cold the people squalid and in uncouth dress all things in short animate and inanimate stiffened with frost besides other circumstances more shocking to the sight than can be represented in words As they marched up the first acclivities they beheld the emir nences which hung over them covered with parties of the mountaineers who if they had posted themselves in the valleys out of view and rushing out suddenly had made an unexpected attack must have occasioned the most terrible havoc and dismay Hannibal com manded the troops to halt and having discovered from some Gauls whom he sent forward to examine the 270 LIVY ground that there was no passage on that side en camped in the widest valley which he could find where the whole circuit around consisted of rocks and pre cipices Then having gained intelligence by means of the same Gauls who differed not much from the others in language or manners and who had entered into conversation with them that the pass was blocked up only by day and that at night they separated to their several dwellings he advanced at the first dawn to the eminences as if with the design of forcing his way through the pass This feint he carried on through the whole day his men at the same time fortifying a camp in the spot where they were drawn up As soon as he understood that the mountaineers had retired from the heights and withdrawn their guards he made for a show a greater number of fires than was proportioned to the troops who remained in the camp and leaving behind the baggage with the cavalry and the greatest part of the infantry he himself with a light armed band composed of the most daring men in the army pushed rapidly through the pass and took post on those very eminences of which the enemy had been in possession 33 At the first dawn of the next day the rest of the army began to march forward IJy this time the mountaineers on a signal given were coming together out of their fortresses to their usual station  when on a sudden they perceived a part of the enemy over their heads in possession of their own strong post and the rest passing along the road Both these circum stances striking them at once they were for some time incapable of thought or of turning their eyes to any other object Afterwards when they observed the confusion in the pass and that the body of the enemy was disordered on their march by the hurry among themselves and particularly by the unruliness of the affrighted horses it was imagined that to augment in any degree the terror under which they already la bored were effectually to destroy them they there fore ran down the rocks in an oblique direction through HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 271 pathless and circuitous ways which habitual practice rendered easy to them  and now the Carthaginians had to contend at once with the Gauls and the disadvan tage of the ground  and there was a greater struggle among themselves than with the enemy for every one strove to get first out of danger But the greatest dis order was occasioned by the horses which affrighted at the dissonant clamors multiplied by the echoes from the woods and valleys became nearly unmanageable  and when they happened to receive a stroke or a wound grew so unruly as to overthrow numbers of men and heaps of baggage of all sorts  and as there were abrupt precipices on each side of the pass their violence cast down many to an immense depth so that  the fall of such great masses produced a dreadful ef fect Although these were shocking sights to Hanni bal yet he kept his place for a while and restrained the troops that were with him lest he should increase the tumult and confusion Afterwards seeing the line of the army broken and that there was danger of their being wholly deprived of their baggage in which case the effecting of their passage would answer no purpose he hastened down from the higher ground  and while by the mere rapidity of his motion he dispersed the forces of the enemy he at the same time increased the confusion among his own But this when the roads were cleared by the flight of the mountaineers was instantly remedied and the whole army was soon brought through the pass not only without disturbance but almost without noise He then seized a fort which was the capital of that district and several vil lages that lay round it and fed his army for three days with cattle taken from the fugitives During these three days as he was not incommoded by the moun taineers nor much by the nature of the ground he made a considerable progress in his march 34 He then reached the territory of another state which was thickly inhabited for a mountainous coun try  there he was very near suffering a defeat not by open force but by his own arts treachery and am 272 LIVY bush Some men of advanced age governors of their forts came to the Carthaginian as ambassadors with humble representations that  as the calamities of others had afforded them a profitable lesson they wished to make trial of the friendship rather than of the strength of the Carthaginians That they were therefore resolved to yield obedience to all his com mands and requested him to accept of provisions and guides on his march and hostages to insure the per formance of their engagements Hannibal neither hastily crediting nor yet slighting their offers lest if rejected they might declare openly against him after returning a favorable answer accepted the hostages and made use of the provisions which they had of their own accord brought to the road  but followed the guides not as through a friendly country but with the strictest order in his march The elephants and cavalry composed the van and he himself followed with the main body of the infantry carefully inspect ing every particular On their coming into a road narrower than the rest confined on one side by an impending hill the barbarians rising up on all sides from places where they had lain concealed assailed them in front and rear in close and in distant fight rolling down also huge rocks on the troops The most numerous body pressed on the rear There the main force of infantry was ready to oppose them  but had not that been very strong it must undoubtedly in such a difficult pass have suffered very great loss  even aa the case stood it was brought to the extremity of dan ger and almost to destruction  for whilst Hannibal hesitated to lead down his horsemen into the narrow road though he had left no kind of support at the back of the infantry the mountaineers rushing across and breaking through between the two divisions of the army took possession of the pass and Hannibal spent one night separated from his cavalry and baggage 35 Next day the barbarians having relaxed the violence of their attacks in the centre the troops were reunited and carried through the defile but not with HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 273 out loss the destruction however was greater among the beasts of burden than among the men Thence forward the mountaineers made their attacks in smaller parties more like robbers than an army at one time on the van at another on the rear just as the ground happened to afford them an advantage or as stragglers advancing before the rest or staying behind gave them an opportunity As the driving the elephants through the narrow roads even with all the haste that could be made occasioned much loss of time so wherever they went they effectually secured the troops from the ene my  who being unaccustomed to such creatures dared not to come near them On the ninth day the army completed the ascent to the summit of the Alps mostly through pathless tracts and wrong roads into which they had been led either by the treachery of their guides or when these were not trusted rashly on the strength of their own conjectures following the courses of the valleys On the summit they remained encamped two days in order to refresh the soldiers who were spent with toil and fighting and in this time several of the beasts which had fallen among the rocks following the tracts of the army came into the camp Tired as the troops were of struggling so long with hardships they found their terrors very much increased by a fall of snow this being the season of the setting of the constellation of the Pleiades 1 The troops were put in motion with the first light and as they marched slowly over ground which was intirely covered with snow dejection and despair being strongly marked in every face Hannibal went forward before the stan dards and ordering the soldiers to halt on a projecting eminence from which there was a wide extended prospect made them take a view of Italy and of the plains about the Po stretching along the foot of the mountains then told them that  they were now scaling the walls not only of Italy but of the city of Rome 1 The beginning of November LIV VOL III S 274 LIVY that all the rest would be plain and smooth and after one or at most a second battle they would have the bulwark and capital of Italy in their power and dispo sal The army then began to advance the enemy now desisting from any farther attempts on them ex cept by trifling parties for pillaging as opportunity offered But the way was much more difficult than it had been in the ascent the declivity on the Italian side of the Alps being in most places shorter and con sequently more perpendicular while the whole way was narrow and slippery so that the soldiers could not prevent their feet from sliding nor if they made the least false step could they on falling stop themselves in the place and thus men and beasts tumbled pro miscuously over one another 36 They then came to a ridge much narrower than the others and composed of rock so upright that a light armed soldier making the trial could with much difficulty by laying hold of bushes and roots which appeared here and there accomplish the descent In this place the precipice originally great had by a late falling away of the earth been increased to the depth of at least one thousand feet Here the cavalry stopped as if at the end of their journey and Hanni bal wondering what could be the cause of the troops halting was told that the cliff was impassable Then going up himself to view the place it seemed clear to him that he must lead his army in a circuit though ever so great and through tracts never trodden before That way however was found to be impracticable The old snow indeed had become hard and being co vered with the new of a moderate depth the men found good footing as they walked through it but when that was dissolved by the treading of so many men and beasts they then trod on the naked ice be low Here they were much impeded because the foot could take no hold on the smooth ice and was besides the more apt to slip on account of the declivity of the ground and whenever they attempted to rise either HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 275 by aid of the hands or knees these slipping they fell again  add to this that there were neither stumps nor roots within reach on which they could lean for sup port  so that they wallowed in the melted snow on one intire surface of slippery ice This the cattle some times penetrated as soon as their feet reached the lower bed  and sometimes when they lost their footing by striking more strongly with their hoofs in striving to keep themselves up they broke it intirely through  so that the greatest part of them as if caught in traps stuck fast in the hard and deep ice 37 At length after men and beasts were heartily fatigued to no purpose they fixed a camp on the sum mit  having with very great difficulty cleared even the ground which that required so great was the quantity of snow to be dug and carried off The soldiers were then employed to make a way down the steep through which alone it was possible to effect a passage  and as it was necessary to break the mass they felled and lopped a number of huge trees which stood near which they raised into a vast pile and as soon as a smart wind arose to forward the kindling of it set it on fire and then when the stone was violently heated made it crumble to pieces by pouring on vinegar When the rock was thus disjointed by the power of the heat they opened a way through it with iron in struments and inclined the descents in such a manner that not only the beasts of burden but even the ele phants could be brought down Four days were spent about this rock during which the cattle were nearly destroyed by hunger for the summits are for the most part bare and whatever little pasture there might have been was covered by the snow In the lower parts are valleys and some hills which enjoying the benefit of the sun with rivulets at the side of the woods are better suited to become the residence of human beings There the horses were sent out to pasture and the men fa tigued with their labor on the road allowed to rest for three days They then descended into the plains 270 LIVY where the climate and likewise the temper of the in habitants were of a still milder cast 38 In this manner as nearly as can be ascertained they accomplished their passage into Italy in the fifth month according to some authors after leaving New Carthage having spent fifteen days in crossing the Alps As to what number of forces Hannibal had when he arrived in Italy writers by no means agree Those who state them at the highest make them amount to one hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse while those who state them at the lowest say twenty thousand foot and six of horse The authority of Lucius Cincius Alimentus who writes that he was taken prisoner by Hannibal would have the greatest weight with me did he not confound the number hy adding the Gauls and Ligurians He says that in cluding these who it is more probable however flocked to him afterwards and so some writers assert there were brought into Italy eighty thousand foot and ten thousand horse and that he heard from Hannibal himself that from the time of his passing the Rhone he had lost thirty six thousand men together with a vast number of horses and other beasts of burden be fore he left the country of the Taurinians the next nation to the Gauls as he went down into Italy That he came through this state is agreed on by all I am therefore the more surprised at its remaining doubtful by what road he crossed the Alps and that the opi nion should commonly prevail that he passed over the Pennine hill and that from thence that summit of these mountains got its name Coelius says that he passed over the hill of Cremo Either of these passes would have led him not into the territory of the Taurinians but through that of the mountaineers called Salassians to the Libuan Gauls Nor is it probable that those  roads into Hither Gaul should at that time have been open  those especially which lead to the Pennine hill would have been blocked up by nations half Ger man And besides if the assertions of the inhabitants HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 277 be admitted as an argument of any weight it must be allowed that the Veragrians the inhabitants of that very hill deny that the name was given to these moun tains from any passage of the Carthaginians and al lege that it was so named from a person called by the mountaineers Penninus worshipped as a divinity on the highest top 39 Hannibal had now a favorable opportunity for commencing his operations the Taurinians the nation lying nearest in his way being at war with the Insu brians But he could not put his forces under arms to assist either party because they now felt most sen sibly while endeavoring to remedy them the maladies which they had before contracted for rest after toil plenty after scarcity and care of their persons after a course of filth and nastiness produced little effect in the various disorders of those whose bodies were grown squalid and filthy to a degree of brutality This con sideration induced the consul Publius Cornelius as soon as he arrived with the fleet at Pisae though the army which he received from Manlius and Atilius was composed of raw troops and dispirited by their late disgraces to hasten to the Po in order that he might engage the enemy before he should recover his vigor But by the time the consul came to Placentia Hanni bal had moved from his post and had taken by storm a city of the Taurinians the metropolis of the nation because it had refused an offer of his friendship and he would have drawn over to his side either by their fears or inclinations all the Gauls dwelling near the Po had riot the sudden arrival of Cornelius when they were watching for an occasion of revolting put a stop to their measures Hannibal likewise advanced towards them from the country of the Taurinians in expectation that as they had not yet resolved what party they would join his presence might determine them in his favor The armies were now almost within view of each other and the leaders though not yet thoroughly acquainted brought with them a degree of 278 LIVY mutual admiration  for the name of Hannibal even before the destruction of Saguntum was highly famed among the Romans and the very circumstance of Sci pio having been particularly chosen for the command supposed him a person of extraordinary merit They were exalted still higher in each other s opinion Sci pio by the celerity with which though left behind in Gaul he had met Hannibal at his coming down into Italy Hannibal by having not only formed but exe cuted the daring design of passing over the Alps Scipio however first crossed the Po and removed his camp to the river Ticinus where wishing to encou rage his soldiers before he led them out to battle he addressed them in a speech to this effect â 40  Soldiers if I were marching to battle at the head of the army which I had with me in Gaul I should have thought it needless to use any words to you for why exhort either those horsemen who with out difficulty defeated the enemy s cavalry at the river Rhone or those legions with whom I pursued this same enemy and obtained by their refusing to fight and actually flying before us an acknowlegement of victory  In the present state of things as that army which was enlisted for the province of Spain is em ployed with my brother Cneius Scipio under my aus pices in the place where it was the will of the senate and people of Rome that it should be employed and that I in order that you might have a consul to lead you against Hannibal and the Carthaginians have taken a voluntary part in this contest â as a new com mander I think it requisite to speak a few words to soldiers who are new to me Now that you should not be unacquainted either with the nature of the war or with the enemy know soldiers that you are to fight against men whom in the former war you con quered both on land and sea from whom you have exacted tribute for twenty years past from whom you took and still hold Sicily and Sardinia the prices of your victory In the present dispute consequently HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 279 the spirit of the parties will heâ yours that of con querors  theirs that of men conquered Nor is it confidence but necessity which now prompts them to fight unless you suppose that those who avoided fight ing when their force was intire have acquired greater confidence after the loss of two thirds of their infantry and cavalry in the passage over the Alps  after greater numbers have perished than survive But it may be said they are few indeed but vigorous in mind and body having a power and strength no force can with stand On the contrary they are but the resemblance mere shadows of men rendered lifeless by hunger cold filth and nastiness battered and disabled among the rocks and precipices Add to this their joints be numbed their sinews stiffened their limbs shrivelled by the frost their armor shattered and broken their horses lamed and enfeebled Such is the infantry such the cavalry with whom you are to fight You will have to deal not with enemies but the remains of enemies And nothing do I fear more than lest before you come to a battle the Alps may appear to have conquered Hannibal But perhaps it was right that it should be so that against a nation and commander guilty of a breach of treaties the gods themselves should commence the war and break the force of the enemy and that we who next to the gods were the party injured should then take it up and carry it on to a conclusion 41  In what I say on this head I am not afraid of being suspected of ostentatious boasting for the pur pose of encouraging you while my real sentiments are different I might have proceeded with my army into Spain my own province to which I had gone part of the way where I should have had my brother to assist me in council and to share the danger and instead of Hannibal I should have had Hasdrubal to contend with and certainly a less difficult war to manage Nevertheless as I sailed along the coast of Gaul hav ing heard of the approach of this enemy I landed Â  280 LIVY sent forward my cavalry and moved my camp to the Rhone In a battle fought by the cavalry the only part of my forces which had an opportunity of fight ing the enemy was routed  and because I could not on land overtake their body of infantry which was carried away with all the rapidity of flight I returned to my ships  and with the utmost expedition that I could make through such a long circuit by sea and land I have met him at the foot of the Alps Now whether do I appear to have fallen in unawares with this formidable foe while I wished to decline a contest with him or to have designedly thrown myself in the way of his route to challenge and force him to a trial of strength  I feel a strong desire to try whether in these twenty years past the earth has all at once pro duced a new breed of Carthaginians  or whether they are the same with those who fought at the islands JEgates whom you ransomed at Eryx at a valuation of eighteen denarii1 a head  and whether this Hanni bal be as he represents himself another Hercules equally renowned for his expeditions or one left by his father a subject a tributary and slave to the Ro 1 man people  who if he were not struck with madness as a punishment for the guilt of his behavior at Sagun tum would reflect if not on the conquest of his coun try at least on the acts of his own family on his fa ther on the treaties written by the hand of Hamilcar who in obedience to the commands of our consul withdrew his forces from Eryx  who agitated with extreme sorrow accepted the burdensome conditions imposed on the conquered Carthaginians and signed an engagement to evacuate Sicily and to pay tribute to the Roman people Wherefore soldiers I wish that you may fight not only with the same spirit which you usually show against other foes but with a degree of resentment and indignation as if you saw your own slaves suddenly taking arms against you We might Â 11 lis 7d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 281 have kept them shut up at Eryx until they perished with hunger the severest suffering that man can un dergo  we might have carried over our victorious fleet to Africa and in the space of a few days without op position have demolished Carthage At tbeir suppli cations we granted pardon we gave them liberty to depart from the place where we held them confined after conquering them we made peace with them af terwards when they were distressed by a war in Africa we considered them as infilled to our protection In return for these favors they follow the lead of a hot brained youth and come to invade our country I wish that on our side this contest was merely for glory and not for safety We are not to fight about the possession of Sicily and Sardinia the subjects of the former dispute but in defence of Italy  neither is there another army behind us which if we fail to conquer might withstand the enemy  nor are there other Alps during his passage over which new forces might be procured Here soldiers we must make a stand as if we were fighting under the walls of Rome Let every one persuade himself that he is protecting with his arms not only his own person but his wife and liis infant children Nor let him consider solely his own domestic concerns but frequently reflect that the senate and people of Rome look for safety at our hands  that our strength and our courage are now to determine what will henceforth be the condition of that city and of the Roman empire 42 Thus on the side of the Romans was the con sul employed Hannibal choosing to rouse the cou rage of his soldiers by the exhibition of facts bef ore he made use of words formed his troops in a circle and then placed in the middle the prisoners taken on the mountains bound in fetters when such arms as are used by the Gauls being thrown at their feet he or dered an interpreter to ask whether any of them were willing on the condition of being released from bonds â and in case of proving victorious of receiving each 282 tlVY a horse and armor â to hazard his life in a comhat they all to a man called for arms and the combat and when lots were cast to single out the parties every one wished himself to he the fortunate person who should be chosen for the trial while he on whom it had fallen dancing according to their custom eagerly snatched up the arms full of spirit and exulting with joy his companions congratulating him on his good fortune While they were fighting such were the sensations excited in the breasts not only of their comrades but of the spectators in general that the fate of those who died bravely was deemed not less happy than that of the successful combatants 43 The minds of his men being thus affected by the sight of several pairs of combatants he dismissed the remainder and then summoning an assembly ad dressed them it is said in the following manner  If soldiers you form a judgment of your own circum stances on the same principles which actuated you just now on the exhibition of a case wherein others were concerned we are conquerors  for that spec tacle was not intended as a gratification to you but a picture in some sort of your own situation Indeed I know not whether fortune has not imposed on you still stronger bonds and a more powerful necessity for usipg arms than on your prisoners You are in closed on the right and left by two seas without so much as even a single ship to aid an escape  hemmed in on the front by the Po a river larger and more vio lent than the Rhone and behind by the Alps which in your full strength and vigor you passed not without the utmost difficulty Here soldiers where you have first met the enemy you must conquer or die and the same fortune which compels you to fight holds out to you prizes of victory greater than which men seldom wish for at the hands of the immortal gods Were we by our bravery to recover only Sicily and Sardinia ravished from our fathers these would be a very am ple recompense But whatever the Romans have ac HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 283 quired and ama sed in consequence of their numerous triumphs the whole of this together with the owners is to become your property Animated then by the prospect of so rich a spoil take arms with the favor of the gods You have been hitherto employed in the pursuit of cattle through the waste mountains of Lusi tania and Celtiberia without any prospect of emolu ment from so many toils and dangers It is now time to make profitable and rich campaigns  and that after measuring such a length of way through so many mountains and rivers and so many armed nations you be at last abundantly rewarded for your labor Here Fortune has fixed the period of your toils here on your finishing your course of service will she give you ample retribution And do not imagine the vic tory to be as difficult as the character of the war is important Often has a despised enemy maintained a bloody contest and renowned nations and kings been vanquished by exertions of very moderate force  for setting aside singly the present splendor of the Ro man name in what one particular are they to be com pared with you Not to mention your service for the last twenty years performed with so great bravery and so great success you have effected a march to this place from the pillars of Hercules from the ocean and the remotest limits of the world  opening your way with your victorious arms through so many of the fiercest nations of Spain and Gaul You will now fight with an army of raw troops who during this very summer were beaten routed and besieged by the Gauls who as yet neither know nor are known by their commanders Ought I if not born at least edu cated in the very tent of that most illustrious general my father I who have subdued both Spain and Gaul the conqueror likewise not only of the Alpine tribes but what is much more of the Alps them selves  ought I to put myself in comparison with such a commander as theirs a general of six months standing who ran away from his own army to whom 284 LIVY if any one taking away the ensigns from both should â how this day the Carthaginians and the Romans I am confident that he would not know of which army he was consul On my part soldiers I esteem it a circumstance of no trivial import that there is not one of you who has not often been an eye witness of my performing some military exploit and to whom on the other hand I cannot as having been a specta tor and witness of his bravery recount his own honor able acts with the marks of time and place At the head of troops whom I have a thousand times honored with praises and presents I who have been a pupil to you all before I became your commander shall enter the field against men unknowing and unknown to each other 44  On whatever side I turn my eyes I see spirit and firmness a veteran body of infantry cavalry composed of the most gallant nations you our most brave and faithful allies and you Carthaginians ready to fight in the cause of your country and at the same time with the justest resentment We are the assail ants in the war and are carrying an invasion into Italy we shall fight therefore with so much the greater boldness and courage as he who makes the attack has ever more confidence and spirit than he who stands on the defensive Besides we are inflamed and stimulated by reflections on past sufferings by in juries and indignities for first they insisted that I your leader should be delivered up to punishment with every one concerned in the siege of Saguntum Had we been put into their hands there is no degree of torture which they would not have made us suffer That nation so unbounded are its cruelty and arro gance would have the whole world at its disposal thinks it has a right to impose regulations on us and to prescribe with whom we are to have peace with whom war circumscribes and shuts us up within bounda ries of mountains and rivers which we must not pass  yet observes not itself the limits which it establishes HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 285 You must not pass the Iberus  you must not meddle with the Saguntines  Saguntum is on our side of the Iberus you must not stir a foot Is it not enough that you take Sicily and Sardinia provinces which have been mine from the earliest times Will you take Spain also  when I shall have retired thenee you will pass over into Africa Will pass did I say  of the two consuls of the present year they have sent one to Africa the other to Spain There is nothing left to us any where unless we make good our claim by arms They may be timid and dastardly who can look for refuge behind them who can fly through safe and quiet roads and be received into their own terri tories and their own lands For your part necessity obliges you to be brave  and since every mean be tween victory and death is sunk out of reach you must resolve to conquer or should fortune be unfa vorable to meet death in battle rather than in flight If this determination be firmly fixed in every one of your breasts I affirm again you are conquerors The immortal gods never gave to man a more invigorating incentive to conquest 45 The courage of the soldiers on both sides being animated to the contest by these exhortations the Ro mans threw a bridge over the Ticinus and erected a fort on it for its security While they were employed in this work the Carthaginians sent Maharbal with a squadron of five hundred Numidian horse to ravage the lands of the allies of the Roman people He or dered him to spare the Gauls as much as possible and to endeavor by persuasion to bring over their chiefs to his side When the bridge was finished the Ro man army marched over into the country of the Insu brians and sat down at the distance of five miles from Victumviae At this place lay Hannibal s camp who perceiving the approach of a battle hastily recalled Maharbal and the horsemen and thinking that he could never apply too many arguments and encourage ments to inspirit his soldiers called them to an assem 286 LIVY bly with promises of several kinds of rewards to be conferred on them that the certain hope of these might animate their exertions in the fight  He would give them land he told them  in Italy Africa or Spain wherever they should choose exempt from all charges to the person who should receive it and to his children Should any prefer money to land he would give him an equivalent in silver To such of the allies as wished to become citizens of Carthage that privilege should be granted With regard to those who chose rather to return to their native homes he would take care that they should not have cause to wish for an exchange of situation with anyone of their countrymen To the slaves also who attended their masters he promised liberty engaging to give the owners two slaves in the room of each of these Then to give them full security for the performance of all this holding in his left hand a lamb and in his right hand a flint stone he prayed to Jupiter and the rest of the gods that if he did not fulfil these engagements they would slay him in like manner as he slew that lamb and after this imprecation he broke the ani mal s head with the stone This had such an effect that all the soldiers as if they had now received the surety of the gods for the ratification of their hopes and thinking that nothing delayed the enjoyment of their wishes but the battle not being begun with one mind and one voice demanded the fight 46 Nothing like the same alacrity appeared among the Romans who besides other matter were dispirited by some late prodigies A wolf had entered the camp and after tearing such as he met made his escape un hurt A swarm of bees also had pitched on a tree which hung over the general s tent After expiating these prodigies Scipio at the head of his cavalry and light spearmen set out towards the camp of the enemy in order to discover by a near view of their forces how great and of what kind they were and was met by Hannibal who had likewise advanced with his ca HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 287 valry to reconnoitre the adjacent grounds For some time neither party descried the other Afterwards the dust being raised in thicker clouds by the moving of so many men and horses gave notice of approaching ene mies both detachments halted and made ready for battle Scipio placed his spearmen and Gallic ca valry in front keeping the Romans and the body of allies which accompanied him as a reserve Hannibal drew the bridled cavalry into the centfe strengthening his wings with the Numidians The shout was scarcely raised before the spearmen fled to the second line then the battle was maintained by the cavalry for a con siderable time with doubtful success but afterwards in consequence of the confusion caused among the horses by the footmen being intermixed with them many of the riders fell from their seats and others on seeing their friends surrounded and distressed dis mounted to assist them so that the fight was now car ried on mostly on foot until the Numidians posted on the wings taking a small compass showedÂ themselves on the rear This terrified and dismayed the Romans whose fears were augmented by a wound received by the consul who was rescued from farther danger by the speedy intervention of his son just arrived at the age of maturity This is the same youth who is after wards to enjoy the renown of terminating this war and to receive the title of Africanus on account of his glo rious victory over Hannibal and the Carthaginians However very few fled precipitately except the spear men on whom the Numidians made the first charge The rest formed a compact body of cavalry who taking the consul into their centre and covering him not only with their arms but with their bodies without any disorder or precipitation in their retreat brought him back to the camp Coelius attributes the honor of saving the consul to a slave by nation a Ligurian but I rather wish the account to be true which gives it to his son  and so the fact is represented by most authors and generally believed LIVY 47 Such was the first battle with Hannibal in which it manifestly appeared that the Carthaginian was supe rior in cavalry and consequently that open plains such as those between the Po and the Alps were un favorable to the Romans in their operations Where fore the consul on the night following ordering his men to prepare in silence for a march decamped from the Ticinus and hastened to the Po in order that be fore the rafts sl1ould be loosened of which he had formed the bridge over that river he might carry over his forces without tumult or interruption from the enemy s pursuit They got as far as Placentia before Hannibal received any certain information of their de parture from the Ticinus Nevertheless he made pri soners six hundred men who delayed on the hither bank spending too much time in unbinding the raft He could not pass over the bridge because as soon as the extremities were untied the whole collection of rafts floated down with the current Coelius relates that Magcwith the cavalry and the Spanish infantry immediately swam over the river and that Hannibal himself led over the rest of the army through fords somewhat higher up forming the elephants in a line above them to break the force of the current These accounts can hardly gain credit with people ac quainted with the river Po j for it is not credible that the cavalry could stem such a violent current without losing their arms and horses even allowing that all the Spaniards were conveyed over on leathern bags in flated  besides that it would have cost a circuit of many days march to find fords in the Po through which an army heavily incumbered with baggage could make a passage Those authors seem to me more worthy of credit who relate that with difficulty after two days search a place was found where a bridge of rafts could be constructed  and that over this the ca valry and light armed Spaniards were sent forwards under Mago While Hannibal who waited on the same side of the river to give audience to embassies HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 289 1 from the Gauls was bringing over the heavy troops Mago and his horsemen in one day s march after Pâ passing the river came up with the enemy at Pla mt centia In a few days after Hannibal fortified a tf camp within six miles of Placentia  and next day â f drawing up his forces in the enemy s view offered lfâ them battle v 48 On the night following there was a violent out e Is rage committed in the Roman camp by the auxiliary Gauls  which however was attended with greater I  tumult than loss of lives A number of them amount ed ing to two thousand foot and two hundred horse kill ffr ing the guards at the gates deserted to Hannibal The Pn Carthaginian received them with expressions of much kindness and after animating their zeal by prospects of vast rewards dismissed them to their respective i states to engage the rest of their countrymen in his II interest Scipio apprehending that this outrage was a signal for a general revolt of the Gauls and that in  fected with the same treacherous spirit they would run  like madmen to arms though still very ill of his wound i marched away in silence at the fourth watch of the following night toward the river Trebia and removed i his camp to higher grounds and hills less advantageous to the operations of cavalry His departure was not so secret as at the Ticinus Hannibal therefore sending on first the Numidians afterwards all his cavalry would have caused great disorder at least in the rear of the army had not the Numidians out of their greediness for plunder turned aside into the forsaken camp of the Romans While searching narrowly every part of it without finding any prize to compensate for the loss of time they let the enemy slip out of their hands After wards coming within sight of the Romans when they had already passed the Trebia and were pitching their camp they cut off a few who loitered behind the rest on that side of the river Scipio unable to endure any longer the pain of his wound which was exasperated by the rough motion in travelling and at the same time judging it prudent to wait for his colleague for LIV VOL III T 290 LIVY he had by this time heard that be was recalled from Sicily chose a spot near the river which seemed the safest for a fixed station and there fortified his camp Hannibal took post at a small distance and though he felt much joy at the success of his cavalry yet finding no less cause of anxiety in the scarcity of necessaries daily increasing as he marched through an enemy s country without magazines prepared he sent a detach ment to the small town of Clastidium where the Ro mans had collected a large store of corn Here while the troops were preparing for an assault a prospect offered of the town being betrayed to them and accord ingly the commander of the garrison one Dasius a Brundusian for a bribe of no great amount only four hundred pieces of gold 1 surrendered Clastidium to Hannibal This served the Carthaginians as a granary while they lay encamped on the Trebia The prisoners who fell into his hands on the surrender of the garrison he treated without severity being desirous that at the commencement of his proceedings a good opinion should be conceived of his clemency 49 While the operations of the land forces on the Trebia were at a stand much was effected by land and sea in and round Sicily and the other islands adjacent to Italy both by Sempronius the consul and before his arrival Of twenty quinqueremes sent by the Cartha ginians with one thousand soldiers to ravage the toast of Italy nine arrived at Liparae eight at the island of Vulcan and three were driven by the current into the strait As soon as these were seen from Messana twelve ships were despatched by Hiero king of Syra cuse who happened to be then in that city waiting for the Roman consul and these took them without oppo sition and brought them into port to Messana From the prisoners it was discovered that besides the fleet of twenty ships to which they belonged and which had been sent against Italy another of thirty five quinque remes was on its way to Sicily to rouse their ancient 25i 16s 8d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 291 allies in their cause that their principal object was the getting possession of Lilybaeum and it was the opinion of the prisoners that the same storm by which they had been dispersed had driven the other fleet to the islands iEgates This intelligence just as he received it the king despatched in a letter to Marcus iEmilius the pretor whose province Sicily was and cautioned him to secure Lilybaeum with a strong garrison Immedi ately the lieutenants general and tribunes who were with the pretor were sent off to the several states with orders to keep their men attentive and alert in guarding their posts and that above all things Lilybaeum should be effectually secured A proclamation was also pub lished that besides every warlike preparation the mari ners should bring on board the ships provisions for ten days ready dressed so that no one should have any delay to prevent his embarking the moment the signal should be given and that through the whole extent of the coast those stationed at the watch towers should be vigilant in looking out for the approach of the ene my s fleet In consequence of these precautions not withstanding that the Carthaginians purposely slackened the course of their ships designing to reach Lilybaeum a little before day they were observed on their ap proach  for the moon shone through the whole night and Jthey came with their sails aloft in the same in stant the signal was made on the watch towers the alarm given in the town and the men embarked in the ships one half of the soldiers mounted guard on the walls and at the gates the other were on board the fleet On the other hand the Carthaginians perceiving that preparations were made for their reception re mained until daybreak at the mouth of their harbor employing the intermediate time in taking down their rigging and fitting their ships for action When day appeared they drew back their fleet into the open sea in order that they might have room for fighting and give the enemy s ships free egress from the harbor Nor did the Romans decline an engagement being em 292 LIVY boldened by the recollection of their former successes near that very spot and by confidence in the number and bravery of their men 50 When they got info the open sea the Romans showed a desire of coming up with the enemy and trying their strength with them in close fight The Carthaginians on the contrary wished to elude their attacks to effect the business by skill not by force and to make it a contest of ships not of men or arms for there was on board their fleet an abundance of mariners but a scarcity of soldiers and when a ship was grappled their number of fighting men to defend it was by no means equal to that of the enemy This circumstance being discovered the Romans assumed additional courage from the fulness of their numbers  and while the others were dispirited by their deficiency in that respect seven Carthaginian ships were quickly surrounded and the rest betook themselves to flight In the captured ships there were of soldiers and mari ners one thousand seven hundred among whom were three Carthaginian nobles The Roman fleet without loss returned into the harbor one ship only being bulged and even that brought into port Very soon after this battle before those who were at Messana had heard of it Tiberius Sempronius the consul came to that city On his entering the strait king Hiero with a fleet completely equipped sailed to meet him and going from the royal galley on board that of the consul congratulated him on his safe arrival with his ships and army After praying for a successful and happy issue to his expedition into Sicily he repre sented to him the state of the island and the attempt lately made by the Carthaginians assuring him that as he had in the early part of his life supported the Roman people in the former war so would he now advanced as he was in years support them still with the same degree of spirit that he would at his own expense furnish the consul s legions and the crews of his ships with corn and clothing and then acquainting him that HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 293 Lilybaeum and all the maritime states were exposed to imminent danger he informed him that there were many to whom a revolution would be highly agreeable for these reasons the consul judged that he ought with out making any delay to sail on directly to Lilybaeum whither he was accompanied by the king and his fleet On their passage they received the news of the fight of Lilybaeum of the discomfiture of the enemy and the capture of their ships  51 From Lilybaeum the consul after dismissing king Hiero with his fleet and leaving the pretor to defend the coast of Sicily sailed over to the island of Melita which was in the possession of the Carthagi nians Immediately on his arrival Hamilcar son of Gisgo commander of the garrison and somewhat less than two thousand soldiers together with the town and the island were surrendered into his hands From thence he returned in a few days to Lilybaeum where all the prisoners taken by the consul and by the pre tor except those who were of distinguished birth were sold by public auction When the consul thought that side of Sicily sufficiently secured he sailed over to the islands of Vulcan because there was a report that the Carthaginian fleet lay there  but he met with none at those islands for it happened that they had already passed over to ravage the coast of Italy and after laying waste the territory of Vibo were now threatening that city When he was on his return to Sicily he was informed of the descent made by the enemy on the territory of Vibo Letters were at the same time delivered to him from the senate containing an account of Hannibal s having entered Italy and also orders to come to the support of his colleague with all possible expedition So many objects de manding his attention at once he instantly embarked his troops and sent them by the upper sea to Arimi num  appointed Sextus Pomponius lieutenant gene ral with twenty ships of war to defend the territory of Vibo and the sea coast of Italy made up a fleet 284 LIVY of fifty sail for the pretor Marcus jEmilius and after settling the affairs of Sicily sailed himself with ten ships along the coast of Italy to Ariminum from whence he marched his army to the river Trebia and formed a junction with his colleague  52 And now both the consuls and the whole of the Roman strength being opposed to Hannibal afforded sufficient reason to suppose either that the Roman em pire would be effectually protected by that force or that there would be no room for any farther hopes Nevertheless Scipio dispirited by the event of the battle between the cavalry and by his own wound wished to defer coming to action while Sempronius whose spirit had yet met no check and who therefore possessed the greater confidence was impatient of any delay The lands between the Trebia and the Po were at that time inhabited by Gauls who during this struggle between two such potent nations showed no partiality to either party evidently intending to court the favor of the conqueror With this conduct the Romans were well satisfied provided they kept them selves intirely quiet but the Carthaginian was highly displeased giving out that he had come thither on an invitation from the Gauls to set them at liberty In order to gratify his resentment on that account and at the same time to maintain his troops with plunder he ordered two thousand foot and one thousand horse mostly Numidians with some Gauls intermixed to ravage the whole country from thence onward to the banks of the Po The Gauls destitute of support though they had hitherto kept their inclinations doubt ful being now compelled by necessity declared against the authors of their sufferings in favor of those who were to avenge them and sent ambassadors to the consul to implore the aid of the Romans for a country which was suffering severely in consequence of this too faithful attachment of its inhabitants to the people of Rome Scipio approved not either of the cause or of the season for undertaking it for he doubted the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 295 sincerity of that people both on account of many in stances of treacherous behavior and particularly though the others through length of time might have been forgotten on account of the recent perfidy of the Boians Sempronius on the contrary was of opi nion that it would be the strongest tie on the fidelity of the allies to let them see that the first who stood in need of aid had found protection He then while his colleague hesitated despatched his own cavalry joined by one thousand foot mostly light spearmen over the Trebia to protect the lands of the Gauls These fall ing unexpectedly on the enemy while they were straggling in disorder and most of them loaded with spoil caused great consternation slew many and drove the rest flying before them to their camp Though repulsed by the multitude which sallied out yet as soon as the rest of their party came up they again renewed the fight Success afterwards remained doubtful sometimes they retreated sometimes pur sued  but though at last the advantages were equal on both sides yet the honor of the victory was more generally attributed to the Romans 53 But to no one did it appear more important and complete than to the consul himself He was transported with joy at having obtained a victory with that part of the troops which under his associate had been defeated  The spirits of the soldiers he said  were now re vived  nor was there any one except his colleague who wished a delay of action He more disordered in mind than in body and reflecting on his wound shuddered at the thoughts of fighting and of arms But others ought not to sink into feebleness along with a sick man for to what purpose was farther delay or waste of time  What third consul or what other army was to be waited for  The Carthaginians were en camped in Italy almost within sight of the city Their designs did not aim at Sicily and Sardinia which were taken from them nor at the parts of Spain on this side of the Iberus but at the expulsion of the Romans from 296 LI VY the land of their fathers from the soil in which they were born What sighs would it draw from these said he  who were accustomed to carry war to the very walls of Carthage if they were to see us their offspring at the head of consular armies skulking within our camp in the heart of Italy and a Carthagi nian possessed of the dominion over the whole extent of country between the Alps and the Apennines In this manner did he argue sitting with his colleague and also at the head quarters as if he were haranguing an assembly He was besides incited to expeditious measures by the approach of the time of the elections for he feared lest the war should be protracted until the new consuls came into office  wishing likewise to secure the present opportunity and while his col league was indisposed of engrossing to himself the whole of the glory For these reasons while Scipio remonstrated in vain he issued orders to the soldiers to be ready for battle at a short warning Hannibal plainly perceiving what line of conduct would be more advantageous to the enemy scarcely entertained any distant hope that the consuls would enter on any ac tion without caution and foresight but understanding first from report and afterwards from experience that the temper of one of them was fiery and presumptuous and supposing his presumption augmented by the suc cess of the battle with the plundering party he then made little doubt but that he should soon have an op portunity of coming to actionâ an occasion which he was earnestly solicitous to improve while the troops of the enemy were raw while the more able of their commanders was by his wound rendered incapable of exertion and while the Gauls were disposed to act with vigor for he well knew that these whose num ber was very great would follow him with the less zeal in proportion as they were drawn away to a greater distance from home Thus wishing for a speedy engagement he intended should any delay be given to use every means to bring it about The Gauls HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXI 297 whom he employed as spies because they were the better fitted for it especially as men of that nation served in both camps brought intelligence that the Romans were prepared for battle on which the Car thaginian began to look about for a place where he might form au ambuscade 54 In the middle between the camps ran a rivulet whose banks were uncommonly steep the adjacent ground was covered with such herbs as grew in marshes with bushes and brambles which usually overspread uncultivated ground On examining the place him self and finding it to be capable of concealing even horsemen he said to Mago his brother  This is the spot which you must occupy Choose out from the whole number of horse and foot a hundred men of each and come with them to me at the first watch It is now time to take refreshment Thus the attending officers were dismissed In some little time Mago came with his chosen band and Hannibal said  I see you are very able men but that you may be strong not only in spirit but in number let each of you choose nine like yourselves out of the troops and companies  Mago will show you the place where you are to lie in wait You will have to deal with an enemy who is blind with respect to these stratagems of war Hav ing thus sent off this detachment of one thousand horse and one thousand foot under Mago Hannibal ordered the Numidian cavalry to cross the river Trebia at the first light to ride up to the enemy s gates and dig charging their weapons against their men on guard to draw them out to battle  and then as soon as the fight should be commenced to retreat leisurely and by that means draw them on to the other side of the river These were his orders to the Numidians To the other officers both of cavalry and infantry he gave direc  tions to cause their men to take refreshment and then under arms and with their horses accoutred to wait the signal On the alarm first given by the Numi dians Sempronius eager for action led out first all 298 LIVY the cavalry being full of confidence in that part of his force then six thousand foot and at last the whole body of infantry to the ground previously fixed on in the plan which he had adopted It was then winter and the weather snowy in Whose places which lie be tween the Alps and the Apennines and the cold was rendered exceedingly intense by the proximity of ri vers and marshes Besides this both men and horses being drawn out in a hurry without having first taken food or used any precaution to guard against the in temperature of the air were quite chilled and as they approached the river the more piercing were the blasts which assailed them But having in pursuit of the flying Numidians entered the river which by rain in the night was swelled so high as to reach their breasts their bodies on coming out were all so perfectly be numbed that they were scarcely capable of holding their arms and as the day advanced they also grew faint through hunger 55 Meanwhile Hannibal s soldiers had fires made before their tents oil was distributed to every com pany to lubricate their joints and they had at leisure refreshed themselves with food As soon therefore as intelligence was brought that the enemy had passed tbe river they took arms with sprightly vigor both of mind and body and thus advanced to battle Hanni bal placed in the van the Balearians and light armed troops amounting to about eight thousand and in a second line his heavier armed infantry the main power and strength of his army The flanks he covered with ten thousand cavalry  and dividing the elephants placed half of them on the extremity of each wing The consul seeing his cavalry who pressed the pursuit with disorderly haste taken at a disadvantage by the Numidians suddenly turning on them recalled them by the signal for retreat and posted them on the flanks of the foot His army consisted of eighteen thousand Romans twenty thousand of the allies and Latine con federates besides the auxiliary troops of the Cenoma HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 299 nians the only Gallic state that continued faithful to their cause This was the force employed in that en gagement The battle was begun by the Balearians who being too powerfully opposed by the legions the light armed troops were hastily drawn off to the wings which circumstance proved the cause of the Roman ca valry being quickly overpowered  for being in number but four thousand they had before been hardly able to maintain their ground against ten thousand especially as they were fatigued and the others mostly fresh but now they were overwhelmed under a cloud as it were of javelins thrown by the Balearians Besides this the elephants advancing in the extremities of the wings so terrified the horses as to occasion a general rout The fight between the infantry was maintained by an equality of spirit rather than of strength  for with respect to the latter the Carthaginians had brought theirs fresh into the battle invigorated by food  the Romans on the contrary were enfeebled by fasting and fatigue and their limbs stiffened and be numbed with cold They would notwithstanding have maintained their ground by dint of courage had the conflict rested solely between them and the infantry But the Balearians after the discomfiture of the ca valry poured darts on their flanks and the elephants had now made their way to the centre of the line of the infantry while Mage with his Numidians as soon as the army had passed by their lurking place without observing them started up at once and caused dread ful confusion and terror in the rear 56 Encompassed by so many perils the line not withstanding stood for a long time unbroken even which was most surprising to all by the attack of the elephants The light infantry stationed for that pur pose plying these briskly with iron javelins made them turn back  and then following them behind darted their weapons into them under the tails in which part the skin being softest it is easy to wound them When they were by these means put into dis order and ready to vent their fury on their own party 300 i LIVY Hannibal ordered them to be driven away from the centre towards the extremity of the left wing against the auxiliary Gauls These they instantly put to open flight which spread new terror among the Romans They were now obliged to fight in the form of a circle when about ten thousand of them having no other means of escape forced their way with great slaugh ter through the centre of the African line which was composed of the Gallic auxiliaries  and as they could neither return to their camp from which they were shut out by the river nor by reason of the heavy rain discover in what part they could assist their friends they proceeded straight to Placentia After this several similar irruptions were made from all quarters and those who pushed towards the river were either drowned in the eddies or hesitating to enter the water were cut off Some who in their flight dispersed themselves over the country falling in with the tracks of the body of troops which had retreated followed them to Placentia  others from their fears of the enemy assumed boldness to attempt the stream and accomplishing their passage arrived at the camp The rain mixed with snow and the intolerable seve rity of the cold destroyed great numbers of men and horses and almost all the elephants The Carthagi nians continued the pursuit no farther than the river Trebia and returned to their camp so benumbed with the cold as to be scarcely capable of feeling joy for the victory  insomuch that though during the follow ing night the guard of the Roman camp and a great part at least of their soldiers passed the Trebia on rafts the Carthaginians either perceived nothing of the matter through the noise made by the fain or being by weariness and wounds disabled to move pretended that they did not perceive it and 4b e enemy lying quiet the consul Scipio led the troops in silence to Placentia and thence across the Po to Cremona lest the two armies wintering in one colony should be too great a burden  57 The news of this disaster caused such conster HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 301 nation in Rome that people supposed the enemy would come directly to attack the city and they could see no hope nor aid to enable them to repel an assault from the walls and gales One consul had been de feated at the Ticinns the other recalled from Sicily and now that both the consuls and two consular armies had been defeated what other commanders what other legions were there whom they could call to their sup port  While they were possessed by such desponding fears the consul Sempronius arrived for though the enemy s cavalry were scattered over the whole face of the country in search of plunder yet he had passed through the midst of them with the utmost hazard and with a greater degree of boldness than of prudence  or of hope either of escaping notice or of being able to make resistance in case he were discovered After holding the election of consuls the only business which rendered his presence particularly necessary at the time he returned to his winter quarters The consuls elected were Cneius Servilius and Caius Flaminius Even in their winter quarters the Romans were not allowed to rest the Numidian cavalry spreading them selves round on every side  the Celtiberians and Lusi tanians doing the same where the ground was too diffi cult for the horse so that no provisions of any kind could be brought in except what were conveyed on the Po in ships There was near Placentia a maga zine fortified with strong works and supplied with a numerous garrison In hopes of gaining possession of this stronghold Hannibal marched at the head of his cavalry and light infantry and judging that the suc cess of the enterprise would depend principally on the design being kept secret made the attack by night but he did not escape the vigilance of the guards as a shout was instantly raised so loud that it was heard even at Placentia In consequence of this the consul came to the spot before day with his cavalry having ordered the legions to follow in order of battle Mean while the action began between the cavalry in which 302 LIVY Hannibal being wounded and retiring from the fight his men became dispirited  and the defence of the fortress was effectually maintained After this taking but a few days to rest and scarcely allowing time for his wound to be thoroughly healed he set out to lay siege to Victumviae This had been fortified by the Romans for a magazine in the time of the Gallic war Afterwards numbers of people from all the neighbor ing states fixing their residence round it made it a populous place and at this juncture fear of the ene my s depredations had driven into it the greater part of the country people The multitude thus composed being excited to a warmth of courage by the report of the gallant defence made by the garrison near Placen tia snatched up arms and marched out to meet Han nibal The parties engaged on the road in the order of march rather than of battle and as there was on one side nothing more than a disorderly crowd on the other a leader confident of his soldiers and a soldiery confident of their leader a number not less than thirty five thousand was routed by a small party Next day they capitulated and received a garrison within their walls They were then ordered to deliver up their arms with which they had no sooner complied than a signal was suddenly given to the conquerors to sack the city as if taken by storm Nor have writers in cases of the like nature mentioned any one cala mity which was not suffered on this occasion every outrage which lust cruelty and inhuman insolence could dictate being practised on those wretched peo ple Such were Hannibal s enterprises during the winter 58 After this he gave rest to his troops but not for any great length of time only while the cold was into lerable On the first and even uncertain appearances of spring he left his winter quarters and marched towards Etruria  determined either by force or per suasion to prevail on that nation to join him as he had already managed the Gauls and Ligurians As he HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 303 was attempting to cross the Apennines he was encoun tered by a storm so furious that its effects almost equalled in severity the disasters of the Alps The rain which was attended with a high wind being driven directly into the men s faces they at first halted because they must either have cast away their arms or if they persisted to struggle forward would be whirled round by the hurricane and thrown on the ground Afterwards scarcely able to respire they turned their backs to the wind and for a while sat down But now the whole atmosphere resounded with loud thunder and lightnings flashed between the tremendous peals by which all were stunned and re duced by terror nearly to a state of insensibility At length the violence of the rain abating and the fury of the wind increasing the more necessary it was judged to pitch their camp on the very spot where they had been surprised by the tempest But this was in a manner beginning their toils anew for neither could they well spread their canvass nor fix the poles and such tents as they did get raised they could not keep standing the wind tearing and sweeping off every thing in its way And soon after the water being raised aloft by the force of the wind and congealed by the cold which prevailed above the summits of the mountains came down in such a torrent of snowy hail that the men giving over all their endeavors threw themselves flat on their faces buried under rather than protected by their coverings This was followed by cold so intense that when they wished to rise from among the wretched crowd of prostrated men and cat tle they were for a long time unable to effect it their sinews being so stiffly frozen that they were scarcely able to bend their joints In some time when after many efforts they at length regained the power of mo tion and recovered some degree of spirits and when fires began to be kindled in a few places every one who was unable to assist himself had recourse to the aid of others Two days they remained in that spot 304 LIVY as if pent up by an enemy Great numbers of men and cattle perished and likewise seven of the elephants which had survived the battle at the Trebia 59 Descending therefore from the Apennines he di rected his route back towards Placentia and having marched ten miles pitched his camp Next day he led out against the enemy twelve thousand foot and five thousand horse Nor did the consul Sempronius for he had by this time returned from Rome decline a battle  and during that day the armies lay en camped within three miles of each other On the fol lowing they fought with the greatest bravery and with variable success At the first onset the superiority was so great on the side of the Romans that they not only had the better in the fight but drove the enemy from their ground pursued them to their camp and presently attacked the camp itself Hannibal after posting a few to defend the rampart and gates collected the rest in close order in the middle of the camp or dering them to watch attentively the signal for sallying forth It was now near the ninth hour of the day when the Roman having fatigued his troops without effect and seeing no prospect of success gave the sig nal for retreat As soon as Hannibal perceived that they slackened their efforts and were retiring from the camp be instantly sent out bis cavalry against them on the right and left and he himself at the head of the main body of infantry rushed out in the middle Seldom has there been a fight more desperate and never perhaps one more remarkable for the loss on both sides than this would have been had the daylight allowed it to continue but night put a stop to the battle while its fury was at the highest The num bers slain therefore were not great in proportion to the violence of the conflict and as both parties had met nearly equal success so they separated with equal loss On neither side fell more than six hundred foot and half that number of horse But the loss of the Romans was more considerable in regard of the qua HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 305 lity than of the number of their slain  for among the killed were several of equestrian rank five military tribunes and three prefects of the allies Immedi ately after this battle Hannibal removed into Liguria  Sempronius to Luca On Hannibal s arrival among the Ligurians that people in order to convince him of their sincerity in the treaty of peace and alliance which they had concluded delivered into his bands two Ro man questors Caius Fulvius and Lucius Lucretius with two military tribunes and five persons of eques trian rank mostly the sons of senators all of whom they had seized in a treacherous manner 60 While these transactions passed in Italy Cneius Cornelius Scipio who was sent with the fleet and army into Spain after his departure from the mouth of the Rhone sailing round the Pyrenean mountains put into Emporiae where he disembarked his army and begin ning with the Lacetans partly by renewing old treaties partly by forming new ones he brought under the do minion of the Romans the whole coast as far as the river Iberus The reputation of clemency which he acquired by these means had the most powerful effect not only on the maritime states but on the more bar barous nations in the interior and mountainous parts insomuch that besides agreeing to terms of peace they concluded also an alliance with him and several strong cohorts of auxiliaries were raised among them The country on this side the Iberus was the province of Hanno whom Hannibal had left behind for the defence of that tract Seeing therefore a necessity before the whole country should join the enemy of exerting him self to obviate that evil he encamped his forces within sightxif them and offered them battle this offer the Roman did not hesitate to accept for knowing that he must fight Hanno and Hasdrubal he was better pleased to engage each of them separately than to have to deal with both together Nor was the dispute very strongly contested Six thousand of the enemy were slain and two thousand taken besides the guard liv vol in u 306 LIVY of the camp for that also was stormed and the general himself and many principal officers made prisoners The town of Scissis too which stood not far from the camp fell into the hands of the conquerors The spoil of this town consisted of articles of trifling value  the furniture was mean suiting harbarians and the slaves of little price But the camp amply enriched the sol diers with the effects not only of the army just now conquerors but likewise with those of the army serv ing under Hannibal who to avoid being incumbered on their march with heavy baggage had left almost all their valuable substance on that side of the Pyre nees 61 Hasdrubal before any certain account of this disaster reached him had crossed the Iberus with eight thousand foot and one thousand horse intending to meet the Romans at their first arrival as soon as he was informed of the ruin of affairs at Scissis and the loss of the camp he turned his route towards the sea Not far from Tarraco meeting the soldiers belonging  to the fleet and the mariners scattered and straggling through the country among whom success as is usual had begotten negligence he detached his cavalry in several parties against them and with great slaughter and greater affright drove them to their ships But not daring to continue longer in that quarter lest he might be surprised by Scipio he withdrew to the other side of the Iberus On the other band Scipio on hearing of this new enemy hastened to the spot with all expe dition and after punishing a few of the commanders of ships and leaving a small garrison at Tarraco returned with the fleet to Emporiae Scarcely had he departed when Hasdrubal arrived and having prevailed on the state of the Illergetans which had given hostages to Scipio to change sides he with the young men of that state ravaged the lands of those who adhered with fidelity to their alliance with the Romans Afterwards on finding that Scipio was roused thereby from his winter quarters he again intirely evacuated the coun HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXI 307 try on this side of the Iherus Scipio leading his army 10 take vengeance on the Illergetans thus abandoned by the author of their revolt and driving them all into Athanagia invested the city which was the capital of the state In the space of a few days he reduced them to intire submission and obedience compelled thein to give a greater number of hostages than before and also to pay a sum of money as a fine From thence he pro ceeded against the Ausetanians near the Iberus who had likewise joined in a league with the Carthaginians After he had invested their city the Lacetans attempted by night to bring succor to their neighbors but he surprised them by an ambuscade when they were close to the city and just about to enter twelve thousand of them were slain and the rest mostly without their arms dispersing up and down through the country fled to their homes by different ways Neither would the besieged have beeu able to make a defence but for the severity of the winter which obstructed the opera tions of the besiegers The siege lasted thirty days during which the snow lay seldom less than four feet deep and it had covered over the machines and engines of the Romans in such a manner as that of itself alone it proved a sufficient defence against the fires which were often thrown on them by the enemy At last Hamusitus their chieftain having fled away to Has drubal they capitulated on the terms of paying twenty talents of silver 1 The army then returned into winter quarters at Tarraco 62 During this winter at Rome and in its vicinity many prodigies either happened or as is not unusual when people s minds have once taken a turn towards superstition many were reported and credulously ad mitted Among others it was said that an infant of a reputable family and only six months old had in the herb market called out  Io triumphe that in the cattle market an ox had of his own accord mounted 3875 so8 tlVY up to the third story of a house whence being af frighted by the noise and bustle of the inhabitants he threw himself down  that a light had appeared in the sky in the form of ships  that the temple of Hope in the herb market was struck by lightning that at La nuvium the spear of Juno had shaken of itself and that a crow had flown into the temple of Juno and pitched on the very couch that in the district of Ami ternum in many places apparitions of men in white garments had been seen at a distance but had not come close to any body that in Picenum a shower of stones had fallen at Ca re the divining tickets had diminished in size  in Gaul a wolf snatched the sword of a soldier on guard out of the scabbard and ran away with it With respect to the other prodigies the decemvirs were commanded to consult the books  but on account of the shower of stones in Picenum the nine days festival was ordered to be celebrated and the expiating of the rest one after another was almost the sole occupation of the state In the first place was performed a purification of the city vic tims of the greater kinds were offered to such gods as were pointed out by directions An offering of forty pounds weight of gold was carried to the temple of Juno at Lanuvium and the matrons dedicated a bra zen statue to Juno on the Aventine A lectisterniuin was ordered at Cajre where the divining tickets had diminished also a supplication to Fortune at Algi dum At Rome likewise a lectisternium was ordered in honor of the goddess Youth and a supplication to be performed by individuals at the temple of Hercules and then by the whole body of the people at all the several shrines To Genius five of the greater vic tims were offered and the pretor Caius Atilius Se rauus was ordered to vow certain performances in case the commonwealth should continue for ten years in its present state These expiations and vows be ing performed in conformity to the directions of the sibylline books people s

wintered at Placentia sent an edict and letter to the consul desiring that those troops should be ready in camp at Ariminum on the ides of March His design was to enter on the office of consul in his province  for he remembered his old disputes with the patricians the contests in which he had engaged with them when tribune of the commons and afterwards when consul first about the consulship his election to which they wanted to annul and then about a triumph He was besides hated by the patricians on account of a new law prejudicial to the senators introduced by Caius Claudius a plebeian tribune to which Caius Flaminius alone of all the pa tricians had given his support that no senator or son of a senator should be owner of a ship fit for sea voyages which contained more than three hundred amphoras 1 This size was thought sufficient for con veying the produce of their farms and every kind of traffic was deemed unbecoming a senator This busi ness had been contested with the utmost degree of heat and had procured to Flaminius the advocate for the law great hatred among the nobility but as great popu larity among the commons and in consequence of this a second consulship For these reasons sus pecting that they would by falsifying the auspices by the delay of celebrating the Latine festival and other impediments to which a consul was liable detain him in the city he pretended a journey and while yet in a private capacity went secretly into the province This step when it became known added fresh resent ment to the animosity which before this possessed the breasts of the senators they exclaimed that  Caius Flaminius now waged war not only with the senate but with the immortal gods That formerly 1 About ten tons 3 0 LIVY having been made consul under propitious

 and that he was the only person by whom they were hated that he had failed to proclaim the Latine festival and to perform on the Alban Mount the customary sacrifices to Jupiter La tiaris to go up to

manner more suitable to the dignity of supreme ma gistrate at Ariminum than at Rome and put on the consular robe in a public inn better than in his own dwelling They resolved unanimously that he should be recalled  that his return should be insisted on and that he should be compelled to perform in person all duties both to gods and men before he went to his province On this embassy for it was resolved that ambassadors should be sent went Quintus Terentius and Marcus Antistius whose arguments had no more weight with him than had the letter sent to him by the senate in his former consulate In a few days after he entered on his office and as he was offering a sacrifice on the occasion a calf after receiving a stroke made its escape out of the hands of those who officiated at the
