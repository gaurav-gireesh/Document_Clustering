PHILADELPHIA PUBLISHED BY D NEALL 1829  THK ANNALS OF TACITUS book r I The first form of government that prevailed at Rome was monarchy Liberty and the consulship were established by Lucius Junius Brutus Dictators were created in sudden emergencies only The juris diction of the decemvirs did not extend beyond two years and the consular authority of the military tri bunes soon expired The domination of Cinna ended in a short time and that of Sylla was not of long duration From Pompey and Crassus the whole power of the state devolved to Julius Csesar and after the struggle with Lepidus and Antony centred m Augustus who under the mild and well known title of Prince of the Senate took upon him the management of the commonwealth enfeebled as it was by an exhausting series of civil wars But the memorable transactions of the old republic as well in her day of adversity as in the tide of success have been recorded by writers of splendid genius Even in the time of Augustus there flourished a race of authors from whose abilities that period might have received ample justice but the spirit of adulation growing epidemic the dignity of the historic charac ter was lost What has been transmitted to us con cerning Tiberius Caligula Claudius and Nero can not be received without great mistrust During the lives of those emperors fear suppressed or disfigured the truth and after their deaths recent feelings gave an edge to resentment For this reason it is my in tention shortly to state some particulars relating to Augustus chiefly towards the close of his life and thence to follow downward the thread of my narra 4 THE ANNALS r tion through the reigns of Tiberius and his three immediate successors free from animosity and partial affection with the candour of a man who has no mo tives either of love or hatred to warp his integrity II The fate of Brutus and Cassius being decided the commonwealth had no longer an army engaged in the cause of public liberty The younger Pompey received a total overthrow on the coast of Sicily Lepidus was deprived of his legions and Marc An tony fell on his own sword In that situation the partisans of Julius Csesar had no leader but Octavius who laid aside the invidious title of Triumvir con tent with the more popular name of Consul and with the tribunitian power which he professed to assume for the protection of the people In a little time when he had allured to his interest the soldiery by a pro fusion of largesses the people by distribution of corn and the minds of men in general by the sweets of peace his views grew more aspiring By degrees and almost imperceptibly he drew into his own hands the authority of the senate the functions of the ma gistrates and the administration of the laws To these encroachments no opposition was made The true republicans had perished either in the field of battle or by the rigour of proscriptions of the re maining nobility the leading men were raised to wealth and honours in proportion to the alacrity with which they courted the yoke and all who in the dis traction of the times had risen to affluence preferred immediate ease and safety to the danger of contend ing for ancient freedom The provinces acquiesced under the new establishment weary of the mixed au thority of the senate and people  a mode of govern ment long distracted by contentions among the great and in the end rendered intolerable by the avarice of public magistrates while the laws afforded a feeble remedy disturbed by violence defeated by intrigue and undermined by bribery and corruption III In this state of affairs Augustus selected Clau dius Marcellus and Marcus Agrippa to prop and strengthen his administration The former who was u t i  4u J 4rt V   OF TACITUS 8 dignity of pontiff and sedile on the latter by his birth obscure but eminent for military talents and the com panion of all his victories he conferred the honour of two successive consulships and in a short time after upon the untimely death of Marcellus chose him for his son in law Tiberius Nero and Claudius Drusus the sons of his wife Livia were adorned with the title of Imperator though the succession in the house of Augustus was at that time well secured by other branches of the house of Csesar He had already adopted into the imperial family Caius and Lucius the two sons of Agrippa and to see them even be fore they had put on the manly gown considered as princes of the Roman youth and marked out as future consuls was his ardent desire though for political reasons he chose to disguise his sentiments To ob tain those honours for his family was the wish of his heart while under a show of coy reluctance he seem ed to reject them Agrippa departed this life and in a short time after his two sons were cut off Lucius Csesar on his road to join the army in Spain and Caius on his return from Armenia where he had re ceived a wound that impaired his health Whether they died by their own premature fate or the machi nations of their step mother Livia is to this day pro blematical Drusus had paid his debt to nature leav ing Tiberius the only surviving son in law of the emperor The current of court favour was now directed that way He was adopted by Augustus declared his colleague in the government his asso ciate in the tribunitian power and shown as the rising sun to the army not as before by the secret arts of Livia but with her open and avowed direction Augustus was now in the decline of life and Livia had gained unbounded influence over his affections By her contrivance Agrippa Posthumus the only sur i viving grandson of the emperor was banished to the isle of Planasia In praise of this young man much cannot be said he was a stranger to the liberal arts uncouth unformed and stupidly valuing himself on his bodily strength yet free from vice or the impu tation of crime a2 B THE ANNALS At this time Germanicus the immediate descend ant of Drusus was appointed to the command of eight legions on the Rhine By the emperor s direc tions Tiberius adopted him as his son though he had then issue of his own growing up to manhood The policy no doubt was to guard the succession with additional securities Augustus in that juncture had no war upon his hands that in Germany except ed  which was carried on not with a view to exten sion of empire or any solid advantage but solely to expiate the disgrace incurred by the loss of Varus and his legions A perfect calm prevailed at Rome the magistrates retained their ancient names the younger part of the community were born since the battle of Actium and the old during the civil wars how many were then living who had seen the con stitution of their country m IV The government thus overthrown nothing re mained of ancient manners or ancient spirit Of in dependence or the equal condition of Roman citizens no trace was left All ranks submitted to the will of the prince little solicitous about the present hour while Augustus in the vigour of health maintained at once his own dignity the honour of his house and the public tranquillity In process of time when worn with age and failing under bodily infirmities he seemed to approach the last act a new scene pre sented itself to the hopes of men Some amused them selves with ideas of ancient liberty many dreaded the horrors of a civil war and others wished for public commotion the greater part discussed with a variety of opinions the character of the new masters at that moment impending over the state  Agrippa was  rude and savage  disgrace added to his natural fe  rocity and in point of age and experience he was  by no means equal to the weight of empire Tibe  rius was matured by years he had gained a reputa  tion in war but the pride of the Claudian family  was inveterate in his nature and his inbred cruelty however suppressed with art announced itself in  various shapes Trained up in the imperial house in the very bosom of despotism Jie had been inured i OF TACITUS 7  from his youth to the pomp and pride of consulships  and triumphs During the years which he passed  in a seeming retreat but real exile in the isle of  Rhodes he meditated nothing so much as plans of  future vengeance clandestine pleasures and the arts  of dissimulation To these reflections the public added their dread of a mother raging with all the im potence of female ambition a whole people they said were to be enslaved by a woman and two young men who in the beginning would hang heavy on the state and in the end distract and rend it to pieces by their own dissensions V While these and other observations of a similar nature employed the public mind the health o f Au gustus declined apace The wickedness of his wife was not supposed to remain inactive A rumour pre vailed that Augustus had gone a few months before in a private manner with a select party and Fabius Maximus his confidential friend to the island of Pla nasia on a visit to Agrippa The meeting was said to be of the tenderest nature tears were shed by both and a scene of mutual affection followed From that interview hopes were conceived that the young prince would be once more restored to the favour and pro tection of his grandfather The secret soon transpired Fabius communicated the whole to his wife Marcia and by her it was conveyed fo Livia Augustus knew that he had been betrayed Maximus died soon after perhaps by his own hand but of that nothing can be said with certainty At his funeral Marcia was heard in the vehemence of distress and sorrow to accuse herself of being accessary to the death of her husband However that may be Tiberius had scarcely set foot in Illyricum when he received despatches from his mother requiring his immediate presence He ar rived at Nola but whether Augustus was still living or breathed his last must be left in doubt By Livia s order the palace and all the avenues were closely guarded  favourable accounts were issued from time to time and with that artifice mankind was amused till all proper measures were concerted At length 8 A U C 767 THE ANNALS the same report that announced the death of Augustus proclaimed Tiberius in possession of the supreme power VI The first exploit of the new reign was the mur der of Agrippa Posthumus A centurion of undaunted resolution attacked him by surprise Though unpro vided with arms the young man did not easily yield  he fell after a stout resistance Of this event Tibe rius made no report to the senate content with hint ing a pretended order of his deceased father by which the centurion charged with the custody of Agrippa s person was commanded to despatch him as soon as  the emperor breathed his last Augustus it is true had arraigned the character and conduct of the young man in terms of asperity he had even banished him by a decree of the senate but it is equally true that he never imbrued his hands in the blood of his kin dred  nor is it probable that for the security of a step son he would have doomed to death a descendant from himself The stronger presumption is that Ti berius and Livia the former impelled by his dread of a rival and the latter by the malice of a step mother were accomplices in the murder When the assassin in the military phrase reported to Tiberius that what he had given in orders was duly executed the reply of the new emperor was that he had given no such orders and for what was done the centurion must an swer before the senate A disavowal so very extraordinary gave the alarm to Sallustius Crispus a minister then in favour and trusted with the secrets of the court The warrant for the execution had passed through his hands He dreaded a public examination well aware that whe ther he disclosed the truth or attempted to disguise it his own danger would in either case be precisely the same To ward off the blow he remonstrated to Livia that the secret counsels of the imperial family the conduct of ministers and the actions of the cen turions ought to be veiled from the public eye By referring too much to the senate the prince would weaken his own authority that men should be ac A P 14 9 OF TACITUS countable to the sovereign only was a branch of the imperial prerogative and if Tiberius departed from it he ceased to reign VII At Rome in the mean time all things tended to a state of abject servitude Consuls senators and Roman knights contended with emulation who should be the most willing slaves The higher each person s rank the more he struggled for the foremost place in bondage All appeared with a studied countenance An air of gaiety might dishonour the memory of Au gustus and sadness would ill bent the opening of a new reign A motley farce was acted and grief and joy distress and flattery succeeding by turns were curiously mixed and blended The oath of fidelity to Tiberius was taken first by the two consuls Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Apuleius and by them adminis tered to Seius Strabo and Caius Turraruus the for mer prefect of the prsetorian bands  the latter con troller of the corn and public stores Their example was followed by the senate the army and the mass of the people To make every thing move from the consuls was the policy of Tiberius He affected the appearance of republican principles as if the constitution still subsisted and he himself had formed no design to destroy it The very proclamation by which he convened the senate professed no other authority than that of the tribunitian power conferred upon him by Augustus The proclamation itself was short and penned in modest terms importing that 44 the business of the meeting was to decree funeral  honours to his debased father as to himself he  could not leave the body that office of piety was  the only function that he presumed to exercise This was indeed the language of moderation but Augustus was no sooner dead than he assumed the supreme authority in his character of imperator he took upon him the whole military command he gave the word to the pretorian guards sentinels were sta tioned round the palace the soldiers appeared under arms the magnificence of a court was seen in all its forms guards attended him to the forum guards 10 THE ANNALS A U C 767 conducted him to the senate house all things an  nouriced the sovereign In his despatches to the army he was already the successor of Augustus he spoke the style and language of a recognised emperor without reserve and in the tone of power equivocal only when he addressed the senate The fact was Tiberius dreaded Germanicus A commander in chief who had so many legions under his direction who had formed connexions with the allies of Rome and was besides the idol of the people might choose to seize the government rather than linger in expectation For this reason the fathers were to be managed There was at the bottom ano ther motive  if in appearance he owed his elevation not to the intrigues of an ambitious mother or the adoption of a superannuated emperor but to the voice of the people it would redound more to hia glory The opportunity was also fair to pry into the temper and dispositions of the leading senators The event showed that his indecision was policy in dis guise He noted the words of men  he watched their looks  warped every circumstance into a crime  and hoarding all in his memory gathered rancour for a future day VIII At the first meeting of the senate the funeral of Augustus was the only subject of debate The emperor s will was brought forward by the vestal virgins Tiberius and Livia were declared his heirs The latter was adopted into the Julian family with the additional title of Augusta His grand children and their issue were next in succession  in the third degree he named the nobles of E me not indeed from motives of personal regard for the greater part had been for a long time obnoxious but a bequest so ge nerous and magnificent might gain the applause of future ages In the rest of his legacies the will was in the style of a Roman cUizen if we except the clauses whereby he gave to the Roman people four hundred thousand great sesterces to the inferior com monalty five and thirty thousand to each prsetorian soldier one thousand small sesterces and to every common man belonging to the legions three hundred A D 14 11 OF TACITUS he affected neither pomp nor grandeur The will be ing read the funeral honours were taken into consi deration The chief propositions were that the pro cession should pass through the triumphal gale this was moved by Asinius Gallus that the titles of all the lawi of Augustus and the names of the conquered nations should be carried before the body was the motion of Lucius Arruntius Valerius Messala was of opinion that the oath of fidelity to Tiberius should be renewed every year and being thereupon interrogated by the prince whether that motion was made with his pri vity I made it said Messala upon my own sugges tion  in matters of public concern however it may give umbrage the conviction of my own heart shall be the only rule of my conduct The age had left no other mode of flattery The senate with one voice insisted that the body should be borne to the funeral pile upon their own shoulders Tiberius assented with seeming condescension but real arrogance The Field of Mars was the place appointed for the ceremony A proclamation was issued warning the populace to re strain their zeal and not require that the last duties should be performed in the Forum as had been done with tumult and disorder at the funeral of Julius Csesar On the day appointed for the ceremony the sol diers were drawn up under arms a circumstance that served only to provoke the ridicule of all who remem bered the day or heard of it from their fathers when Csesar the dictator was put to death In that early period of slavery and in the first emotions of joy for liberty in vain recovered the blow for freedom seemed a murder to some and to others a glorious sacrifice But in the present juncture when a prince worn out with age who had grown gray in power and left a long train of heirs was to receive the last funeral ob sequies at such a time to call forth the military in or der to secure a quiet interment was a vain parade as ridiculous as it was unnecessary IX Augustus now became the subject of public dis cussion Frivolous circumstances engaged the atten tion of the greater number They observed that the 12 THE ANNALS A U C 767 anniversary of his accession to the imperial dignity was the day of his death He died at Nola in the same house and in the same chamber where Octavius his father breathed his last They called to mind in wonder and amaze the number of his consulships equal to those of Valerius Corvinus and Caius Marius put together The tribunitian power continued in his hands during a series of seven and thirty years he was saluted Imperator no less than one and twenty times and other titles of distinction were either in vented or revived to adorn his name Reflections of a different kind were made by thinking men They rejudged the life of the emperor and pronounced with freedom By his apologists it was argued  that  filial piety to his adopted father the distraction of  the times and the ruin of the laws made the part he took in the civil wars an act of necessity and  civil war can neither be undertaken or conducted on  principles of honour and strict justice To revenge  the death of Julius Csesar was the primary motive  To obtain that end he made concessions to Antony  and he temporized with Lepidus but when the lat  ter grew gray in sloth and the former fell a victim  to his voluptuous passions the commonwealth con  vulsed by party divisions had no resource but the  government of one There was however no mo  narchy no dictator content with the unassuming  title of Prince of the Senate he established peace  and settled the constitution The ocean and far  distant rivers marked his boundaries of the empire  The legions the provinces and the fleets of Rome  acted in concert with all the strength of system Justice was duly administered at home the allies  were treated with moderation and magnificent  structures rose to ador n the capital Violent mea sures were rarely adopted and never but for the  good of the whole X To this it was answered  Filial piety and the  distraction of the times were nothing but a colour to  varnish over the lust of dominion It was the am bition of Augustus that gained the veterans by a  profusion of largesses itwas ambition that raised A D 14 OF TACITUS  an army when ho was yet a young man and in a  private station By bribery and corruption he sc 44 duced to himself the forces of the consuls To the 44 friends of Pompey s party he wore a mask affecting republican principles he deceived the senate and  by an extorted decree possessed himself of the fas  Ces and the praetorian authority How long did the 44 consuls Hirtius and Pansa survive that event 44 They were both cut off Did they fall by the hand M of the enemy Who can be certain that Pansa did 44 not die by poison infused into his wound and Hir tius by the treachery of his own soldiers If that  was their fate is it clear that Augustus was not an  actor in that scene of iniquity  That he put him  self at the head of both their armies is a fact well  known Having extorted the consulship from a rc  luctant senate he threw off the mask and turned  against the commonwealth the arms which had  been entrusted to him in the cause of liberty against  Marc Antony What shall be said of the fury of  proscriptions He seized the lands of Roman citi  zens and divided them among his creatures These  were acts of violence to this hour unjustified even  by those who advised the measure To atone for the death of a father Brutus and 44 Cassius fell a sacrifice  so far perhaps may be al  lowed but whether that deadly feud when the good  of the commonwealth required it might not have 44 been to his immortal honour appeased in silence  may still be made a question Be it as it may the  younger Pompey was ruined by an insidious peace 4i and Lepidus was undone by treachery Marc An  tony relied upon the treaties of Tarentum and Brun  dusium  he went further ho married the sister of  Augustus and in consequence of that insidious al  liance lost his li e Peace it is true was soon af  ter established but what kind of peace The  slaughter of Lollius and Varus stained it in Ger  many and the massacre of the Varros the Egnatii and the Julii made Rome a theatre of blood From the public conduct of Augustus a transition Was made to his domestic character  Livia was Vol i â B 14  4 I C Tt THE ANNAL taken by force from Tit K 10 twfa bjt band she was then a jfi  â ž j   whether in that cond  ht v â  legal dis 4 ability to contract   iu i  n  ed  referred to the pon     v â  ference was a mocke  u i r  i V  jest His two favourites u V   dius Pollio were distinguished uy r r i Y  and debauchery To crown the whole 1 i        him with unbounded sway to the common u  fatal empress and to the Csesarian family a pern  cious step mother The honours due to the gods  were no longer sacred Augustus claimed equal wor  ship Temples were built and statues were erected  to him  a mortal man was adored and priests and   pontiffs were appointed to pay him impious homage  In calling Tiberius to the succession he neither  acted from the motives of private affection nor of  regard for the public welfare He knew the arro  gance and innate cruelty of the man and from the  contrast hoped to derive new lustre on himself That he knew the inward frame and cast of Tiberius appears from a fact that happened a few years before The business of granting to that prince a renewal of the tribunitian power was depending in the senate Augustus in his speech upon that occasion made honourable mention of him but at the same time threw out oblique reflections on his conduct his de portment and his manners With affected tender ness he seemed willing to palliate all defects but the malice of the apology wounded the deeper XI The rites of sepulture being performed a tem ple and religious worship were decreed to the memo ry of Augustus The senate now turned their suppli cations to Tiberius A direct answer could not be drawn from him  He talked of the magnitude and  the weight of empire he distrusted his own abilities  the comprehensive mind of Augustus was indeed  equal to the charge but for himself called as he  had been by that emperor to a share in the adminis v  tration he knew by experience that to direct the affairs of a great nation was to be in a state of A D 14 OF TACITUS 15  painful pre eminence exposed to danger and sub  ject to the vicissitudes of fortune In a city so well  provided with men of illustrious character was it  adviseable to confide the whole to a single ruler  The several departments of public business would  be better filled by a coalition of the best and ablest  citizens In this strain Tiberius delivered himself with dignity of sentiment it is true but nothing from the heart A profound master of dissimulation he had from nature or the force of habit the art of be  ing dark and unintelligible Even upon occasions when duplicity was useless he spoke in short and broken hints the sense suspended mysterious and indecisive Intending at present to conceal his sen timents he was of course more involved than ever The senators dreading nothing so much as the crime of knowing his character broke out in a strain of supplication they molted into tears they poured forth entreaties with uplifted hands they looked to the gods they turned to the statue of Augustus and at times fell prostrate at the knees of Tiberius Thus surrounded he called for a state paper and ordered it to be read It set forth an estimate of the empire and its resources the number of citizens the allies of Rome an account of the naval strength the names of the conquered kingdoms and provinces the sub sidies tributes and the amount of the revenue with the necessary disbursements of government and the demands for secret service The whole was in the hand writing of Augustus It concluded with his ad vice never to aim at an extension of empire  an im portant rule of policy but was it the result of wisdom  or did he view with a malignant eye the fame that might accrue to his successor  XII The senate still continuing with prostrate servility to press their suit Tiberius let fall an ex pression intimating that though unequal to the whole he was willing to undertake any part that might be committed to his care Inform us Csesar said Asinius Gallus what part do you choose Disconcerted by so unexpected a question Tiberius paused for a mo ment but soon collecting himself  To choose he 1C THE ANNALS A U C 767 said  or to decline any part would ill become the  man who wished to be dispensed with altogether Gallus saw displeasure working in his countenance With quickness and presence of mind he made an swer  The question was not put with intent to di  vide what in its nature is united and indivisible I  appealed to your own feelings I wished to draw  from you a confession that the commonwealth be  ing one body politic requires one mind to direct  it To this he added a panegyric on the charac ter of Augustus he expatiated on the victories ob tained by Tiberius and the civil employments which he had filled with honour to himself during a series of years But this soothing strain had no effect The resentment of Tiberius was not to be pacified Asinius Gallus had married Vipsania the daughter of Marcus Agrippa after her divorce from Tiberius By that connexion he seemed to aspire above the rank of a citizen and the spirit of his father Asinius Pollio was still living in the son XIII Lucius Arruntius delivered his sentiments nearly the same as Gallus had offered and in like manner gave offence Tiberius harboured in his breast no lurking sentiment to Arruntius but he was jealous of a man whom he saw flourishing in opulence an ardent spirit possessed of talents and high in the esteem of the public Augustus more over in a conversation not long before his death talking of the succession to the imperial dignity dis tinguished three several classes in the first he placed such as were worthy but would decline the honour in the se cond men of ambition but of inferior talents in the last such as had genius to plan and courage to undertake Marcus Lcpidus he said was every way qualified but unwilling Asinius Gallus had more ambition than merit Lucius Arruntius was not only equal to the task but if occasion oft ered would show a spirit of enterprise Of this anecdote with regard to the two first no doubt remains but instead of Arruntius Cneius Piso by some writers is said to have been named Except Lepidus they were after wards all cut off for constructive crimes artfully laid A D 14 OF TACITUS 17 to their charge by Tiberius In the course of their debate Quintus Haterius and Mamercus Scaurus had the misfortune to alarm that gloomy and suspicious temper the first by asking How long is it your  pleasure Csesar that the commonwealth shall want ahead to direct it Scaurus by saying Since  the prince has not interposed the tribunitian au  thority to prevent the report of the consuls there is  room to hope that he will yield to the entreaties of  the senate Tiberius took fire at what was said by Haterius and broke out with sudden vehemence  to Scaurus he made no reply resentment had taken root in his heart and for that reason was smothered in silence Fatigued at length by the clamours of the senate and the solicitation of individuals ho gave way by degrees not expressly declaring his consent but as he said to end the mutual trouble of repeated refusals and unwearied importunity It may be related as a  fact that Haterius on the following day attending at the palace to mitigate resentment by an apology narrowly escaped being put to death by the guards In a suppliant posture he clasped the emperor s knees and in that moment Tiberius entangled perhaps by the petitioner or making a false step fell to the ground This provoked the soldiers upon duty Haterius was saved from their fury but the danger that threatened a man of his illustrious character made no impression on the prince nor did he relent till Livia exerted all her power and influence Tibe rius yielded at length to the solicitations of his mo ther XIV The senate at their next meeting began to offer the incense of adulation to Livia It was pro posed to confer upon her the title of Parent that name was thought too general the more distinctive appellation of Mother of her Country was moved as an amendment It was further proposed with the general concurrence that to the name of the Emperor should be added The Son of Julia Tiberius op posed these several motions honours he said ought not to be lavished on women in what regarded his B2 18 A U C 767 THE ANNALS own rank he was determined to act with the strictest self denial This had the appearance of moderation but envy was the source By the honours intended to his mother he thought his own glory might bo eclipsed and in that spirit prevented a decree by which a lictor was ordered to attend her nor would he suffer an altar to be raised on account of her adop tion into the Julian family Other marks of distinc tion were proposed and rejected Germanicus waa more favourably treated for him Tiberius desired the rank of proconsul Special messengers were sent to invest him with his honours and at the same time to condole with him on the loss of Augustus Drusua was then at Rome and being consul designed in his favour nothing new was demanded By virtue of the imperial prerogative twelve candidates were named for the prsetorship That number had been settled by Augustus and though the senate entreated Tiberius to enlarge the lis he bound himself by an oath never to exceed the line already drawn XV The right of electing magistrates by public suffrage in the Field of Mars was now for the first time taken from the people at large and vested in the senate The will of the prince had before that time great influence in all elections but parties were formed among the tribes and sometimes with success To this encroachment the people made no opposition  they saw their rights taken from them  they grumbled and submitted The senators were pleased with the change They were now delivered from the necessi ty of humiliating condescensions in the course of their canvass and from the heavy expense of bribery and corruption The moderation of Tiberius was a further circumstance in favour of the measure four candi dates of his nomination were implicitly to be chosen without intrigue or contention and the prince con tent with that number promised not to stretch his prerogative The tribunes of the people applied for leave to celebrate at their own expense the games newly instituted in honour of Augustus and ordered to be added to the calendar under the title of the Au gustan Games A decree passed but the expense A D 14 QF TACITUS was to issue out of the treasury The tribunes were allowed to preside in the Circus dressed in trium phal robes but the pomp of splendid chariots was ex pressly denied The annual celebration of those games was afterwards transferred from the tribunes to that particular prator who has jurisdiction in all causes between strangers and the citizens of Kome XVI Such was the situation of affairs at Rome when a fierce and violent mutiny broke out among the legions in Pannonia For this insurrection there was no other motive than the licentious spirit which is apt to show itself in the beginning of a new reign and the hope of private advantage in the distractions of a civil war A summer camp had been formed for three legions under the command of Julius Blse sus The death of Augustus and the accession of Tiberius being known to the army the general granted a suspension of military duty as an interval of grief or joy The soldiers grew wanton in idle ness dissensions spread amongst them the vile and profligate had their circular audiences sloth and pleasure prevailed and all were willing to exchange a life of toil and discipline for repose and luxury There happened to be in the camp a busy incendiary by name Percennius formerly a leader of theatrical factions and ribw a common soldier a man fluent in words and by his early habits versed in tho art of exciting tumult and sedition Over the weak and ig norant and such as felt their minds alarmed with doubts and fears about the future condition of the service this pragmatical follow began to exert his in fluence In the dead of night he mixed in cabals and never failed at the close of day when the sober and well disposed retired to their tents to draw to gether the idle and most abandoned Having gained a number of proselytes he stood forth the orator of sedition and harangued his confederates in the fol lowing manner XVII  How long my fellow soldiers must we obey a small and despicable set of

The life and limb of a soldier are valued at  ten pence a day  out of that wretched pittance he  must find his clothing his tent equipage and his  arms with that fund he must bribe the centurion with that must purchase occasional exemptions Mjrom service and with that must pay for a remis  sion of punishment But blows and stripes from our  officers wounds from the enemy intense cold in winter and the fatigue of summer campaigns de  structive war in which every thing is hazarded  and peace by which nothing is gained are all the  soldier s portion  For these evils there is but one remedy left  Let us fix the conditions of our service let every  soldier receive a denarius a day and at the end of  sixteen years let him be entitled to his dismission  beyond that term no further service Without de  taining any man whatever and without forcing him  to follow the colours as a veteran let every soldier  receive the arrears that may be due to him let him  be paid in ready money on the spot and in the very  camp where he signalized his valour The prseto  rian cohorts receive two denarii for their daily pay  at the end of sixteen years they return to their fami  lies and is superior merit the

sented theirbodies seamed with stripes others pointed to their heads grown gray in the service numbers showed their tattered clothing and their persons al most naked At length the frenzy of the malcon tents knew no bounds Their first design was to in corporate the three legions into one  but which should give its name to the united body was the question mutual jealousy put an end to the project Another scheme took place the eagles of the three legions with the colours of the cohorts were crowded toge ther without preference or distinction They threw up sods of earth and began to raise a tribunal Amidst the tumult Blssus arrived he called aloud to all he laid hold of individuals he offered himself to their swords and  Here he said  behold your vic  tim imbrue your hands in the blood of your general Murder is a crime less horrible than treason to your 44 prince 1 will either live to command the legions  entrusted to mc or if you are determined to revolt despatch me first that when this frenzy is over you may wake to shame to horror and remorse XIX The work of raising a tribunal in spite of all his efforts still went on Heaps of turf were thrown up and rose breast high Conquered at length by the perseverance of their general the mutineers desisted Btesus exerted all his eloquence  Sedition and re volt he said  could not serve their cause the re  monstrances of the army ought to be conveyed to  the ear of the prince with respect and deference fc The demands which they now made were of the first impression unknown to former armies and 4 with the deified Augustus never attempted In the â present juncture when the prince was new to the  cares of government was that a time to add to S3 THE ANNALS A U C 767 his solicitude by tumult and insurrection If they  would still persist in the season of profound peace  to urge a claim never demanded even by the con  querors in a civil war why incur the guilt of rebel lion  why in violation of all military discipline  urge their pretensions sword in hand They might  depute their agents to treat with the prince and in  the presence of their general they might give their  instructions on the spot This proposal was ac cepted  with one voice they called out for the son of BIebsus then a military tribune The young officer undertook the charge His directions were to insist that at the expiration of sixteen years the soldier should be discharged from the service That point settled it would then be time to enumerate other grievances With this commission the general s son went forward on his journey A calm succeeded and lasted for some days But the minds of the soldiers were still in agitation their pride was roused the ge neral s son was now the orator of the army and force it was manifest had at length extorted what by gen tle measures could never be obtained XX Meanwhile the detached companies which be fore the disturbance had been sent to Nauportum to repair the roads the bridges and other military works having heard of the commotions in the camp seized the colours  and after ravaging the adjacent villages plundered Nauportum a place little inferior to a mu nicipal town They treated the centurions with de rision from derision they proceeded to opprobrious language and in the end to blows and open violence Aufidenus Rufus the prefect of the camp was the chief object of their fury  they dragged him out of his carriage and laying a heavy load on his back obliged him to march in the foremost ranks asking him with contemptuous insolence how he liked his burden and the length of his journey  Rufus had risen from a common man to the rank of centurion and was afterwards made prsefect of the camp In that station he endeavoured to recall the rigour of ancient discipline A veteran in the service and long inured to fatigue he was strict and rigorous in his A D 14 OF TACITUS 23 duty expecting from others what he had practised himself XXI The return of this tumultuous body renewed s the troubles of the camp The soldiers without con trol issued out of the lines and pillaged the country round Some more heavily loaded with booty than their comrades were apprehended by the orders of Blesus and after receiving due correction thrown 4o prison as an example to the rest The authority the general was still in force with the centurions Lnd such of the common men as retained a sense of their duty The delinquents however refused to sub mit  they were dragged along resisting with all their strength they clasped the knees of the multitude round them they called upon their fellow soldiers by name they implored the protection of the company to which they belonged they invoked the cohorts and the legions crying out to all that the same lot would shortly be their portion Against their general they omitted nothing that calumny could suggest they appealed to heaven they implored the gods they tried by every topic to excite compassion to inflame resentment to awaken terror and rouse the men to acts of violence A general insurrection followed the soldiers in a body rushed to the prison burst the gates unchained the prisoners and associated with themselves the vilest of the army a band of deserters and a desperate crew of malefactors then under con demnation for the enormity of their crimes XXII The flame of discord raged with redoubled fury New leaders joined the mutiny Amidst the crowd one of the common soldiers a fellow known by the name of Vibulenus mounted on the shoulders of his comrades before the tribunal of Blesus and addressed the multitude all wild with fury and eager to hear the language of sedition  My friends said he you have bravely interposed to save the lives  of these innocent these much injured men You  have restored them to new life But who will re  store my brother  who will give him to my arms   Sent hither from the German army in concert with you to settle measures for our common safety he 24 TIIE ANNALS A U C 767  was last night basely murdered by the hand of gla  diators whom Blsesus arms for your destruction 4i Answer me Blsesus where have you bestowed the  body  The very enemy allows the rites of sepul 44 ture When I have washed my brother with the  tears and printed kisses on his mangled body then  plunge your poniard in this wretched bosom I shall  die content if these my fellow soldiers perform the  last funeral office and bury in one grave two 44 wretched victims who knew no crime but that of  serving the common interest of the legion XXIII This speech Vibulenus rendered still more inflammatory by the vehemence of his manner by beating his breast by striking his forehead and pour ing a flood of tears A way being opened through the crowd he leaped from the men s shoulders and gro velling at the feet of individuals excited the passions of the multitude to the highest pitch of frenzy In their fury some fell upon the gladiators retained by Blsesus and loaded them with irons others seized the general s domestic train while numbers dispersed themselves on every side in quest of the body and if it had not been speedily known that no corpse could be found  that the slaves of Btesus averred under the torture that no murder had been committed and in fact that tho incendiary never had a brother Blsesus must have fallen a sacrifice The tribunes and the prsefect of the camp were obliged to save themselves by flight Their baggage was seized and plundered Lucilius the centurion was put to death This man by the sarcastic pleasantry of the soldiers had been nicknamed give me another because in chastising the soldiers when one rod was broke he was used to call for another and then another The rest of the centurions lay concealed in lurking places Out of the whole number Julius Clemens a man of prompt and busy talents was the favourite of the insurgents He was spared as a fit person to negociate the claims of the army Two of the legions the eighth and fif teenth were upon the point of coming to the decision of the sword the former bent on the destruction of Sirpicus a centurion and the latter determined to A D 14 25 OF TACITUS protect him The quarrel would have laid a scene of blood if the soldiers of the ninth legion had not by entreaty or by menacing the obstinate appeased the fury of both parties XXIV When the account of these transactions reached Tiberius that abstruse and gloomy temper which loved to brood in secret over all untoward events was so deeply aifected that he resolved with out delay to despatch his son Drusus with others of high rank and two prsetorian cohorts to quell the in surrection In their instructions no decisive orders were given they were left to act as emergencies might require To the cohorts was added a select detachment with a party of the pratorian horse and the flower of the Germans at that time the body guard of the emperor In the train which accompa nied Drusus Elius Sejanus was appointed by his counsels to guide the inexperience of the prince Se janus at that time in a joint commission with his father Strabo had the command of the pranorian bands and stood high in favour with Tiberius the army would of course consider him as the fountain of rewards and punishments As soon as they ap proached the camp the discontented legions by way of doing honour to Drusus advanced to meet him not indeed with colours displayed as is usual on such occasions but with a deep and solemn silence their dress neglected and their whole appearance un couth and sordid In their looks was seen an air of dejection and at fhe same time a sullen gloom that plainly showed a spirit of mutiny still working in their heart XXV Drusus was no sooner within the intrench ments than the malcontents secured the gates Sen tinels were posted at different stations while the rest in a body gathered round the tribunal Drusus stood in act to speak with his hand commanding silence The soldiers felt a variety of contending passions they looked around and viewing their numbers grew fierce at the sight they rent the air with shouts and were covered with confusion An indistinct and hol low murmur was heard a general uproar followed Vol i â C 26 THE ANNALS A U C 767 and soon afterwards a deep and awful silence The behaviour of the men varied with their passions  by turns inflamed with rage or depressed with fear Dru sus seized this moment and read his father s letter in substance stating that Tiberius had nothing so much at heart as the interest of the gallant legions with whom he had served in so many wars As soon as his grief for the loss of Augustus allowed him lei sure it was his intention to refer the case of the army to the wisdom of the senate In the mean time he sent his son to grant all the relief that could then be applied Ulterior demands he reserved for the delibe ration of the fathers  to enforce authority or to relax it was the lawful right of that assembly and the se nate beyond all doubt would distribute rewards and punishments with equal justice XXVI The soldiers made answer that they had appointed Julius Clemens to speak in their behalf That officer claimed a right of dismission from the service at the end of sixteen years all arrears then to be discharged in the mean time a denarius to he the soldier s daily pay and the practice of detaining the men beyond the period of their service under the name of veterans to be abolished forever In a busi ness of so much moment Drusus observed that the senate and the emperor must be consulted a general clamour followed  Why did he come so far since  he had no authority to augment their pay or to mitigate their sufferings The power of doing good  was not confided to him while every petty officer  inflicted blows and stripes and even death It had  been formerly the policy of Tiberius to elude the  claims of the army by taking shelter under the name  of Augustus and now Drusus comes to play the  same farce How long were they to be amused by  the visits of the emperor s son Could that be deemed  an equitable government that kept nothing in sus  pense but the good of the army When the soldier  is to be punished or a battle to be fought why not consult the senate According to the present sys  tem reward is to be always a subject of reference  while punishment is instant and without appeal A D 14 OF TACITUS XXVII The soldiers in a tumultuous body rushed from the tribunal breathing vengeance and where ever they met either the men belonging to the prse torian bands or the friends of Drusus threatening violence in hopes of ending the dispute by a sudden conflict Cneius Lentul us whose age and military cha racter gave him considerable weight was particularly obnoxious he was supposed to be the chief adviser of Drusus and an enemy to the proceedings of the army For the security of his person he went aside with Drusus intending to repair to the winter camp The mutineers gathered round him demanding with insolence  which way was he going  to the senate  perhaps to the emperor Was he there to show himself an enemy to the demands of the legions Nothing could restrain their fury they discharged a volley of stones and one of them taking place Len tulus wounded and covered with blood had nothing to expect but instant death when the guards that at tended Drusus came up in time and rescued him from destruction XXVIII The night that followed seemed big with some fatal disaster when an unexpected phenomenon put an end to the commotion In a clear and serene sky the moon was suddenly eclipsed This appear ance in its natural cause not understood by the sol diers was deemed a prognostic denouncing the fate of the army The planet in its languishing state re presented the condition of the legions if it recovered its former lustre the efforts of the men would be crowned with success To assist the moon in her labours the air resounded with the clangour of brazen instruments with the sound of trumpets and other warlike music The crowd in the mean time stood at gaze every gleam of light inspired the men with joy and the sudden gloom depressed their hearts with grief The clouds condensed and the moon was sup posed to be lost in utter darkness A melancholy horror seized the multitude and melancholy is sure to engender superstition A religious panic spread through the army The appearance in the heavens foretold eternal labour to the legions and all la 28 THE A NAL8 A U C 767 mented that by their crimes they had called down upon themselves the indignation of the gods Rrusus look advantage of the moment The opportunity was the effect of chance but rightly managed might conduce to the wisest purpose He gave orders that the men who by honest means were most in credit with the malcontents should go round from tent to tent Among these was Clemens the centurion They visited every part of the camp they applied to the guards on duty they conversed with the patrole and mixed with the sentinels at the gates They allured some by promises and by ter ror subdued the spirit of others How long shall  we besiege the son of the emperor Where will this confusion end Must we follow Percennius and Vi  bulenus  And shall we swear fidelity to those new commanders Will their funds supply the pay of the legions Have they lands to assign to the vete  ran soldier For them shall the Neros and the Drusi be deposed Are they to mount the vacant  throne the future sovereigns of Rome  Let us  since we were the last to enter into rebellion be the first to expiate our guilt by well timed repentance  Demands in favour of all proceed but slowly to  individuals indulgence is more easily granted de  serve it separately and the reward will follow This reasoning had its effect suspicion and mutual distrust began to take place the new raised soldiers went apart from the veterans the legions separated  a sense of duty revived in the breast of all the gates were no longer guarded and the colours at first pro miscuously crowded together were restored to their proper station XXIX At the return of day Drusus called an as sembly of the soldiers Though unused to public speaking he delivered himself with the eloquence of a man who felt his own importance and the dignity of his rank He condemned the past and applauded the present It was not he said a part of his charac ter to yield to menaces or to shrink from danger If lie saw them penitent if he heard the languago of re morse he would make a report in their favour and A D 14 29 OF TACITUS dispose his father to listen to their petition The sol diers answered in humble terms at their request the younger BUesus mentioned above with Lucius Apronius a Roman knight in the train of Drusus and Justus Catonius a centurion of the first rank were despatched as the delegates of the army In the councils afterwards held by Drusus various opinions were entertained and different measures pro posed To wait the return of the deputies and mean while to win the affections of the men by moderation was the advice of many Others were for immediate coercion  Lenity they said makes no impression on the vulgar mind The common men when not kept in subjection are fierce and turbulent yet ever ready to crouch and bend under proper authority  It was now the time while they were overwhelmed with superstition to infuse another fear and teach them to respect their general Tho authors of the late sedition ought to be made a public ex  ample Drusus by the bent of his nature prone to vindictive measures dosired that Percennius and Vibulenus might be brought before him By his orders they were put to death according to some writers in his own tent and there buried according to others their bodies were thrown over the intrench ments a spectacle for public view XXX Diligent search was made for the most ac tive incendiaries Some were found roving on the outside of the lines and instantly cut off by the cen turions or the prsetorian soldiers Others were de livered up to justice by their respective companies as an earnest of their own conversion The rigour of the winter which set in earlier than usual added to the afflictions of the army Heavy rains ensued and fell with such violence that the men could not venture from their tents To meet in parties and converse with their comrades was impossible The colours borne down by torrents that rushed through the camp were with difficulty secured Superstition still continued to fill the mind with terror In every thing that happened imagination saw the anger of the gods it was not without reason that the planets C2 30 THE ANNALS A U C 767 suffered an eclipse and storms and tempests burst from the angry elements The guilt of the army was the cause of all To avert impending vengeance the only expedient was to depart at once from a vile in auspicious camp the scene of so many crimes and by due atonement expiate their past offences in their winter quarters In this persuasion the eighth legion departed the fifteenth followed while the ninth re mained behind declaring aloud that they would wait for orders from Tiberius but they soon saw them selves deserted and therefore struck their tents wil ling to do by choice what in a little time would be an act of necessity Peace and good order being thus restored Drusus judged it unnecessary to wait till the return of the deputies and immediately set off for Rome XXXI About the same time and from the same causes another sedition broke out among the legions in Germany supported by greater numbers and every way more alarming The leaders of the mutiny flat tered themselves that Germanicus impatient of a new master would resign himself to the will of the legions and in that case they had no doubt but that every thing would fall before him Two armies in that juncture were formed on the banks of the Rhine one in Upper Germany commanded by Caius Silius the other in Lower Germany under Aulus Csecina Both were subordinate to Germanicus the commander in chief who was then in Gaul holding the assembly of the states and collecting the revenues of that nation The forces under Silius had not as yet revolted un decided wavering and cautious they judged it pru dent to wait the issue of the mutiny begun by others In Csecina s camp on the Lower Rhine the flame of discord was kindled to the utmost fury The one and twentieth and fifth legions began the insurrection the first and the twentieth followed their example they were all stationed together in a summer camp on the confines of the Ubians The campaign was in active  and as the calls of duty were slight the time of course was passed in repose and indolence New levies from Rome the refuse of that city had A D 14 OF TACITUS 31 lately joined the army Upon the first intelligence of the death of Augustus these men long addicted to licentiousness and averse from labour began to practise upon the ruder minds of their fellow soldiers The time they said was come when the veterans might claim their dismission from the service when the young soldier might augment his pay when the army in general might redress their grievances and retaliate the cruelty of the centurions It was not as in Pannonia a single Pereennius that inflamed the mutiny nor weie these arguments urged to men who saw on every side of them superior armies and of course trembled while they mediated a revolt There were numbers of busy incendiaries and many mouths to bawl sedition Their doctrine was that the fate of Rome was in their hands by their victories the empire flourished by their valour Germany was sub dued and from the country which they had con quered the emperors of Rome were proud to derive a title to adorn their names XXXII Csecina saw the danger but made no ef fort to suppress it The malcontents were numerous and their frenzy above all control insomuch that the general no longer retained his usual firmness The tumult broke out at once the soldiers fell upon the centurions the old and lasting cause of military dis content and in every insurrection the first to fall a sacrifice They seized their victims and without mercy dashed them on the ground in every legion the centurions amounted to sixty an equal number fell on each of them The soldiers laid on with their cudgels they wounded maimed and mangled their devoted officers and to complete their vengeance cast them dead or ready to expire over the intrench Wents Numbers were thrown into the Rhine One in particular by name Septimius fled to the tribunal and clasping the knees of his general hoped there to find a sanctuary The soldiers demanded him with contumacy and Csecina was obliged to give him to their fury Cassius Chserea the same who afterwards immortalized his name by the death of Caligula was 32 A V C 767 THE ANNALS then a centurion in the vigour of youth and of a spirit to face every danger He made head against all assailants and sword in hand cut his way through their thickest ranks From this time all was uproar and wild commotion No tribune gave orders no prtBfect of the camp was heard The leaders of the mutiny appointed sentinels they stationed the night watch and gave directions as emergencies required One mind inspired the whole body and this circum stance in the judgment of those who best knew the temper of the army was the sure sign of a faction not easy to be quelled In separate bodies nothing was done no single incendiary took upon him to direct together they set up a general shout and together all were silent Every thing moved in concert and even anarchy had the appearance of regular discipline XXXIII Meanwhile Germanicus engaged as has been mentioned with the states of Gaul received ad vice that Augustus was no more He had married Agrippina the grand daughter of that emperor and by her had several children Drusus the brother of Tiberius was his father and of course Livia was his grand mother Thus descended and thus allied he lived in perpetual anxiety The sullen aversion of his uncle and the secret malice of Livia embittered his days The hatred with which they pursued him was unjust and for that reason unrelenting The fact is Drusus was the delight of the Roman people they cherished his memory persuaded that if the sovereign power had devolved on him the old repub lic would have been restored At his death the af fections of mankind were transferred to his son From similar virtues the same conduct was expected Pos sessed of popular talents affable and obliging to all Germanicus presented a strong contrast to the harsh temper and clouded aspect of Tiberius The jealou sies that subsisted between the women added fuel to the flame Livia beheld the wife of Germanicus with the malice of a step mother and in return Agrip pina resented every thing with sensibility perhaps with indignation But the tenderness of her affection A D 14 OF TACITUS 33 for her husband softened her fiercer passions and gave a tincture of delicacy to that haughty spirit which nothing could subdue XXXIV Germanicus was now advanced nearer to the imperial dignity but his zeal for Tiberius rose in proportion He required from the Sequanians and the Belgic states the oath of fidelity to the emperor and being informed of the commotions that distracted the army he set forward without delay to appease the tumult The legions met him on the outside of the intrenchments with downcast eyes and all the exter nal symptoms of repentance He was however no sooner within the lines than the camp resounded with groans and bitter lamentations Some laid hold of the prince s hand as if going to kiss it but inserting his fingers in their mouths made him feel their bone less gums complaining that they had lost their teeth in the service others showed their bodies bent with age and drooping under a load of infirmities A tu multuous crowd gathered round the tribunal Ger manicus ordered them to form in their respective companies that the men might more distinctly hear his answer and to distinguish the cohorts he di rected the standards to bo ranged in proper order The soldiers obeyed but with reluctance Germani cus opened with the panegyric of Augustus he pro ceeded to the victories and triumphs obtained by Ti berius insisting chiefly on his exploits in Germany at the head of those very legions he succession he observed was quietly settled Italy consented both the Gauls remained in their duty and peace prevailed in every part of the empire XXXV Thus far Germanicus was heard with si lence or at worst with a low and hollow murmur He made a transition to the present disturbances Where is now the sense of military duty Where that an cient discipline the boast and honour of the Roman armies Whither have you driven the tribunes Where are the centurions At these words the whole multitude as if with one instinct threw off their clothes exposing their bodies seamed with wounds from the enemy and with lashes from the centurion 34 THE ANNALS A U C 767 A general outcry followed They complained of the price exacted for relaxations of duty they mentioned the miserable pittance which they received for their daily pay they set forth their various hardships and in particular their unremitting labour at the intrench ments the fatigue of carrying provisions wood and forage with a detail of other employments sometimes imposed by necessity and frequently to prevent idle ness in the camp The clamour of the veterans was outrageous they had served thirty years and more and when were they to expect a cessation of misery  They desired a retreat for old ago that they might not languish in despair and wait till the hand of death released them from their troubles Some demanded immediate payment of the legacies bequeathed by Augustus They offered up ardent vows for the suc cess of Germanicus assuring him if he wished to seize the sovereign power that they were to a man devoted to his service Struck with horror and dreading the contagion of so foul a crime Germanicus leaped from the tribunal The soldiers sword in hand opposed his passage and even threatened violence if he did not return The prince was resolved to perish rather than forfeit his honour He drew his sword and pointed it to his breast ready to plunge it to his heart The people near him stopped his hand but the crowd at a dis tance and even some who dared to advance had the insolence to bid him strike one in particular by name Calusidius presented a naked sword adding at the same time Take this it is sharper than your own This behaviour even in the moment of frenzy ap peared to the soldiers an atrocious act A pause ensued The friends of Germanicus seized the oppor tunity and conveyed him to his tent XXXVI A Council was immediately called It was well known that the insurgents were preparing a depu tation to the army on the Upper Rhine in order to engage them in the revolt and make it a common cause The city of the Ubians was devoted to de struction From the pillage of thaf place the plan of the mutineers was to proceed to greater lengths A D 14 OF TACITUS 35 and carry desolation into the provinces of Gaul The Germans at the same time knew the dissensions of the Roman army and if the Rhine were once aban doned stood in readiness to seize so advantageous a post The moment was full of perplexity To employ the auxiliary forces and the states in alliance with Rome against the revolted legions were to engage in a civil war To proceed with rigour might be dan gerous  and to pacify the men with largesses were an expedient altogether dishonourable Grant all or nothing the dilemma was either way big with mis chief After mature deliberation letters were framed in the name of Tiberius importing that at the end of twenty years the soldier should be entitled to his dis mission  that after sixteen he should be deemed a veteran still retained in the service but exempt from all duty except that of repelling the incursions of the enemy A promise was added that the legacies given by Augustus should not only be paid but increased to double the amount XXXVII The forgery was suspected by the soldiers They saw that the letter was an expedient to gain time They demanded immediate compliance and accordingly dismissions from the service were made out by the tribunes The payment of the money was deferred till the legions arrived in their winter quar ters The fifth and one and twentieth refused to stir from the camp till Germanicus with his own finances and the assistance of his friends made up the sum required The first and twentieth legions under the command of Csecina proceeded towards the city of the Ubians exhibiting as they marched a shameful spectacle while they carried amidst the colours and the Roman eagles the treasure extorted from their general Germanicus proceeded with ex pedition to the army on the Upper Rhine and there required the oath of fidelity to the emperor The se cond the thirteenth and sixteenth legions complied without hesitation The fourteenth stood for some time in suspense They made no demand but Ger manicus ordered dismissions from ths service ta ha THE ANNALS A U C 767 made out for the veterans and their money to be forthwith discharged XXXVIII Meanwhile a party of veterans belonging 3o the legions lately in commotion but at that time stationed in the territory of the Chajicians discovered the same spirit of disaffection but the firmness of Mennius the prefect of the camp suppressed the mischief in its birth He ordered two of the ringleaders to be seized and put to death au act of severity not strictly legal but in some degree justified by necessi ty He was obliged however to seek his safety by flight The soldiers pursued him Being detected in bis lurking placs he resolved to face his enemies and depend upon his own bravery It is not he said  against me the prsefect of the camp that this  outrage is committed it is treachery to Germani cus it is treason to the emperor The leaders of the mutiny were struck with terror In that moment he seized the standard and turning towards the river declared in a peremptory tone that whoever quitted his rank should surfer as a deserter The whole body marched into winter quarters murmuring discontent but not daring to disobey XXXIX During these transactions the deputies of the senate met Germanicus at the Ubian altar on his return from the Upper Rhine Two legions the first and twentieth were stationed at that place in winter quarters and with them the veterans lately ap pointed to follow the colours To minds in their con dition fluctuating between fear and conscious guilt every circumstance was a new alarm The deputies they were sure came with instructions to revoke and cancel the terms which violence had extorted The credulity of the common people never works by halves they believe without proof and soon find the author of what never happened Munatius Plancus a senator of consular rank and a principal person in the embassy was named as the framer of a decree that never existed but in the imagination of the sol diers In the dead of the night they rushed in a body to the head quarters of Germanicus demanding with A D 14 37 OF TACITUS rage and violence the purple standard which was there deposited They broke open the doors thoy  forced their way into the house and dragging their general out of his bed with menaces of instant death compelled him to surrender the standard Flushed with this exploit they ran wild through the streets and meeting the deputies then on their way to join the prince they poured forth a torrent of opprobrious language and threatened a general massacre Plancus was the first object of their fury That il lustrious citizen could not without dishonour to his character shrink back from a tumultuous rabble he was however compelled to take refuge in the camp of the first legion He there embraced the colours and laying hold of the eagles thought himself pro tected by the gods of the army But even that sanc tuary was no longer a place of shelter the soldiers forgot the religion of the camp and if Calpurnius the eagle bearer had not made a stout resistance a deed of horror unheard of even among barbarians had been impiously perpetrated and the blood of a   Roman ambassador in a Roman camp had stained the altar of the gods At the return of day when the general the men and the actions of all might be clearly distinguished Germanicus entered the camp He ordered Plancus to be conducted to his presence and seated him near himself on the tribunal He complained of the distractions of the time but im puted what had happened not so much to the mad ness of the soldiers as to the vengeance of the gods He explained the nature of the deputation f om the senate he stated the rights of ambassadors he painted forth in pathetic terms the indignity offered to a man of such high consideration as Plancus and lamented the disgrace that befel the legion The sol diers heard him like men astonished but not con vinced Germanicus thought proper to dismiss the deputies but to guard their persons ordered a de tachment of the auxiliary horse to escort them XL The conduct of Germanicus was censured by many of his friends  Why did he not withdraw to the army on the Upper Rhine Discipline was there Vol I â D 38 THE ANNALS A U C 767 in force and with proper assistance the mutiny  might have been crushed at once By dismissions  from the service by largesses and other feeble men  sures the disturbances were too much encouraged  If the general set no value on his own life why neg  lect the safety of his infant son Why hazard among  lawless men who had violr ted every sacred right  an affectionate wife at that time far advanced in her pregnancy Those tender pledges were the pro  perty of the state and should be restored to the em peror and the commonwealth Germanicus yielded to these remonstrances but the consent of Agrippina was still to be obtained Descended from Augustus she insisted that the grand daughter of that emperor had not so far degenerated as to shrink from danger Germanicus continued to urge his request he melted into tears he clasped her in his arms he embraced her infant son and at length prevailed A procession of disconsolate women moved slowly on and with them the wife of the commander in chief compelled to be a wanderer with her infant son in her arms A band of wretched women driven forth from their hus bands attended in her train Amongst those whom they left behind the scene of distress was not less af fecting XLI The camp presented a mournful spectacle Instead of a Roman general at the head of his legions instead of Germanicus in all the pomp and pride of authority the face of things resembled a city taken by storm Nothing was heard but shrieks and lamen tations The soldiers listened they came forth from their tents they stood astonished at the sight and  Why they said  wherefore those notes of sor row What means that mournful spectacle A train of noble matrons deserted left to themselves aban doned by all no centurion not so much as a sol  dier to accompany them The wife of the general undistinguished in the crowd without a guard and  without the train of attendants suited to her rank  proceeding on her way towards the people of Treves  to seek in a foreign state that protection which was denied her in a Koman camp To these reflections A D 14 OF TACITUS 39 shame and remorse succeeded and every breast was touched with sympathy All lamented the condition of Agrippina They called to mind the splendour of her father Agrippa they recollected the majesty of Augustus her grand father they remembered Dru sus her father in law her own personal accomplish ments her numerous issue and her virtue endeared her to the army Her son they said was a native of the camp he was educated in the tents of the legions and surnamed Caligula from the boots so called which to win the affections of the soldiers he wore in common with the meanest of the army Amidst these reflections the honour intended for the people of Treves made the deepest impression Stung by that idea they pressed forward to Agrippina they entreated her to stay they opposed her passage they ran in crowds to Germanicus imploring him not to let her depart The prince still warm with mixed emotions of grief and indignation addressed them in the following manner  XLII  My wife and child are ever dear to me but no more so than my father and the commonwealth  But the emperor will be safe in his own imperial dignity and the commonwealth has other armies to  fight her battles For my wife and children if from  their destruction you might derive additional glory  I could yield them up a sacrifice in such a cause at present 1 remove them from the rage of frantic men  If horrors are still to multiply let my blood glut your fury The great grandson of Augustus and the daughter in law of Tiberius need not be left to fill the

shall I now address you Shall I call you soldiers Soldiers who have dared  to besiege the son of your emperor who have made him a prisoner in his own intrenchments Can I call you citizens Citizens who

Augustus showed himself to the Ie  gions that fought at Actium and the majesty of his  countenance awed them into obedience The dis  tance between myself and those illustrious charac  tcrs I know is

so graciously bestowed upon you From  every other quarter of the empire Tiberius has re  ceived nothing but joyful tidings and must I wound  his ear with the news of your revolt Must he hear  from me that neither the soldiers raised by myself  nor the veterans who fought under him are willing to own his authority Must he be told that neither  dismissions from the service nor money lavishly granted can appease the fury of ungrateful men Must I inform him that here the centurions are  murdered that in this camp the tribunes are  driven from their post that here the ambassadors  of Rome are

inflamed with epidemic madness  XLIII  Why the other day when I endeavoured  to address you why was the sword which I aimed  at my breast why in that moment was it wrested  from me  Oh  my mistaken friends  The man who  presented his sword dealt more kindly by me I  could then have closed my eyes in peace I should  not have lived to see the disgrace of the legions  and all the horrors that followed After my death A D 14 J 41 OP TACITUS  you would have chosen another general regardless  indeed of my unhappy lot but still of spirit to re  venge the massacre of Varus and his three legions  May that revenge be still reserved for the Roman  sword  and may the gods withhold from the Belgic  states though now they court the opportunity the  vast renown of vindicating the Roman name and  humbling the pride of the German nations  and  may thy departed spirit adored Augustus who now art ranked among the gods and may thy image  Drusus my ever honoured father may thy me  mory inspire these unhappy men whom I now see  touched with remorse May your active energy  blot out the disgrace that sits heavy upon them  and may the rage of civil discord discharge itself on the enemies of Rome  And you my fellow sol diers whom I behold with altered looks whose  hearts begin to melt with sorrow and repentance if  you mean to preserve the ambassadors of the senate  if you intend to remain faithful to your prince and  to restore my wife and children detach yourselves at once from the contagion of guilty men withdraw from the seditious  that act will be a proof of your  remorse an earnest of returning virtue XLIV The soldiers were appeased by this ha rangue They acknowledged their guilt and the justice of the reproof In a suppliant tone they en treated Germanicus to select for punishment the most obnoxious to pardon the weakness of men drawn into error and lead them against the enemy They requested that his wife might be recalled and that his son the darling of the camp might not be sent a hostage to the states of Gaul Agrippina being then advanced in her pregnancy and the winter season approaching Germanicus judged it best to let her proceed on her journey His son he said should once more appear amongst them What remained to be done he left to themselves The soldiers were now incited by new sentiments and passions unfelt before they seized the ringleaders of the sedition and delivered them loaded with irons D2 42 THE ANNALS A U C 767 to Caius Citronius who commanded the first legion By that officer the delinquents were brought to im mediate justice The form of proceeding was as fol lows The legions under arms were ranged round the tribunal the criminal was set up to public view if the general voice pronounced him guilty he was thrown headlong down and put to instant death In this mode of punishment the soldier concurred with ardour by shedding the blood of others he thought his own guilt was expiated The measure however violent received no check from Germanicus What was done had no sanction from his orders The cruelty began with the soldiers and by consequence could be imputed to no one else The veterans fol lowed the example and in a few days afterwards were ordered to march into Rhsetia under colour of defend ing the province from the inroads of the Suevians but in truth to remove them from a camp polluted by rebellion and in the end made savage by the hor ror of military execution A strict review of the cen turions was the first care of Germanicus They wero all cited before him each in person gave in his name his rank the place of his birth he length of his ser vices the actions in which he had distinguished him self and the military honours which he had obtained If the tribunes or the legion in general reported in his favour he preserved his station if taxed by the general voice with avarice or cruelty he was dis charged from the service XLV Order and tranquillity were in this manner restored but at the distance of sixty miles at a place called Vetera riot and disorder still subsisted The fifth and twenty first legions were there in winter quarters In the late commotions these men wero the first and most active incendiaries The worst and blackest crimes were by them committed and now when the storm was in appeurance over they still re tained their former ferocity unreclaimed by the peni tence of others and undismayed by the fate of those who had suffered death To meet this new alarm Germanicus resolved to equip his fleet and with the A D 14 43 oP TACITUS auxiliary forces to Bail down the Rhine in order if the mutiny still subsisted to crush it at once by force of arms XLVI At Rome in the mean time where the issue of the commotions in Illyricum was yet unknown advice was received of the disorders that broke out in Germany The city was thrown into consterna tion All exclaimed against the conduct of Tiberius  To amuse the senate and the people both helpless  void of spirit and disarmed was the sole drift of  the emperor The flame of discord was in the mean time kindled up by the distant armies and two young men who had neither experience nor sufli  cient authority were sent in vain to quell the insur  rection Why did not Tiberius set out in person upon the first alarm The occasion called for his  presence At sight of him who had gained renown  in war and was moreover the fountain of rewards  and punishments the malcontents would have laid  down their arms Augustus though in the decline of life could make a progress into Germany and  shall Tiberius in the vigour of his days content  himself with the vain parade of attending the senate  there to amuse himself with petty disputes to cavil  about words and wrangle with the fathers Enough  was done at Rome to establish his system of slavery  and despotic power Measures should now be taken  to curb the spirit of the legions and teach them to  endure the leisure of repose XLVII Tiberius heard the murmurs of discontent but remained inflexible To keep possession of the capital and neither hazard his own safety nor that of the empire was his fixed resolution A crowd of reflections filled him with anxiety The German army was superior in strength that in Pannonia was the nearest the former had great resources in Gaul and Italy lay open to the latter To which should he give the preference  If he visited one the other might take umbrage By sending his sons he held the ba lance even and neither could be jealous It was be sides his maxim that the imperial dignity should not 44 THE ANNALS A U C 767 be suffered to tarnish in the eye of the public What is seen at a distance is most respected If Drusus and Germanicus reserved some points for the consi deration of their father the inexperience of youth would be a sufficient apology Should the mutineers persist with obstinacy there would still be time for the prince to interpose and either by rigour or con ciliating measures to restore the ancient discipline If he went in person and the insurgents spurned his authority what resource was left â These considera tions had their weight and yet to have the appear ance of being willing to face his armies was part of his policy He played this game so well that he seemed every day upon the point of leaving Rome He settled his train of attendants ordered his camp equipage equipped his fleets still contriving by specious pretences to give a colour to delay The winter season he said was near at hand and the weight of affairs at Rome claimed his attention The most discerning were for some time the dupes of his dissimulation The people were much longer amused delusion XLVIH Germanicus in the mean time was ready with his collected force to act against the rebel le gions He was willing notwithstanding to suspend his operations till time should show whether the late example had wrought the minds of the soldiers to submission and a due sense of their duty With this intent he sent despatches to Carina to inform that officer that he was advancing at the head of a power ful army resolved if justice was not previously exe cuted to put the whole body to the sword Cojcina communicated in a confidential manner his secret instructions to the standard bearers to the inferior of ficers and such of the private men as were known to be well affected He recommended to them to avert the danger that hung over the legions and in good time to secure their lives In times of peace he said there is always leisure to investigate the truth and separate the man of merit from the turbulent and se and the provinces were  A D 14 45 OF TACITUS ditious but war knows no distinction of cases the innocent and the guilty fall in one promiscuous car nage The officers thus instructed sounded the common men and finding thegreatcst partwell affected agreed at an hour approved of by Csecina to fall with sudden fury upon the leaders of the mutiny Having con certed their measures at a signal given they began the attack Â They rushed sword in hand into the tents and without mercy butchered their comrades who little thought they were so near their end A dread ful slaughter followed no cause assigned and no ex planation given Except tho authors of the measure no man knew from what motive the assault proceeded or where it would end XLIX In the civil wars recorded in history we no where find a scene of horror like the present No battle was fought there was no assault from an ad verse camp in the same tents where the day saw them eat their meal in peace and the night laid them down to rest comrades divide against their fellows darts and javelins are thrown with sudden fury up roar and confusion follow shouts and dying groans resound throughout the camp a scene of blood is laid wretches expire and the reason remains un known The event is left to chance Men of worth and honour perished in the fray for the guilty finding themselves the devoted objects snatched up their arms and joined the better cause Csecina re mained a tame spectator no officer no tribune at tempted to stop the wild commotion The fury of the soldiers had its free career and vengeance rioted in blood even to satiety Germanicus in a short time after entered the camp He saw a tragic spectacle and with tears in his eyes called it a massacre not an act of justice He ordered the dead bodies to be burnt The fury of the soldiers had not yet subsided  in the agitation of their minds they desired to be led against the enemy in order to expiate by tho blood of the barbarians the desolation theyjiad made The shades of their slaughtered friends could not be other wise appeased when their breasts were gashed with 40 THE ANNALS A U C 767 honourable wounds atonement would then be made Germanicus embraced the opportunity and throwing a bridge over the river advanced with an army of twelve thousand legionary soldiers six and twenty cohorts of the allies and eight squadrons of horse all free from disaffection and during the late commo tions strict observers of discipline  L The Germans posted at a small distance ex ulted in full security They saw with pleasure the cessation of arms occasioned by the death of Augus tus and the revolt of the legions inspired them with fresh courage The Romans by a forced march passed the Csesian forest and having levelled part of the rampart formerly begun by Tiberius pitched their tents on the spot In the front and rear of the camp they threw up intrenchments The flanks were for tified with a pile of trees hewn down for the pur pose Their way from that place lay through a gloomy forest but of two roads which was most eli gible was matter of doubt whether the shortest and most frequented or another more difficult and sel dom attempted but for that reason unsuspected by the enemy The longest road was preferred The army pushed on with vigour The scouts had brought intelligence that the approaehing night was a festival to be celebrated by the barbarians with joy and re velry In consequence of this information Csecina had orders to advance with the light cohorts and clear a passage through the woods The legions fol lowed at a moderate distance The brightness of the night favoured their design They arrived with rapid expedition at the villages of the Marsians and without delay formed a chain of posts to inclose the enemy on every side The barbarians were sunk in sleep and wine some stretched on the beds others at full length under the tables all in full security with out a guard without posts and without a sentinel on duty No appearance of war was seen nor could that be called a peace which was only the effect of savage riot the languor of a debauch LI Germanicus to spread the slaughter as wide as possible divided his men into four battalions The A D 14 OF TACITUS 47 country fifty miles round was laid waste with fire and sword  no compassion for sex or age no dis tinction of places holy or profane  nothing was sa cred In the general ruin the Temple of Tanfan which was held by the inhabitants in the highest ve neration was levelled to the ground Dreadful as the slaughter was it did not cost a drop of Roman blood Not so much as a wound was received The attack was made on the barbarians sunk in sleep dispersed in flight unarmed and incapable of resistance An account of the massacre soon reached the Bructe rians the Tubantes and the Usipetes Inflamed with resentment those nations took up arms and posting themselves to advantage surrounded the woods through which the Roman army was to pass Ger manicus informed of their motions marched in order of battle Part of the cavalry with the light cohorts formed the van the first legion followed to support them the baggage moved in the centre The left wing was closed by the twenty first legion and the right by the fifth The twentieth with the auxiliaries  brought up the rear The Germans in close ambush waited till the army stretched into the woods After skirmishing with the advanced party and both the flanks they fell with their whole strength upon the rear The light cohorts unable to sustain the shock of a close embodied enemy were thrown into disor der  when Germanicus riding at full speed to the twentieth legion cried aloud  The time is come  when you may efface by one bravo exploit the  guilt of the late sedition  charge with courage and  you gain immortal honour Roused by this ani mating strain the legion rushed to the attack and at the first onset broke the ranks of the enemy The barbarians fled to the open plain the Romans pur sued them with dreadful slaughter Meanwhile the van of the army passed the limits of the forest and began to throw up intrenchments From that time the march was unmolested The soldiers flushed with success and in the glory of this expedition losing all memory of former guilt were sent into winter quarters 48 A U C 767 THE ANNALS LII An account of these events arriving at Rome Tiberius was variously affected He received a degree  of pleasure but it was a pleasure mingled with anxie ty That the troubles in the camp were at an end he heard with satisfaction but he saw with a jealous spirit that by largesses and dismissions from the ser vice Germanicus had gained the affections of the le gions The glory of his arms was another circum stance that touched him nearly He though fit not withstanding to lay the whole account before the se nate He expatiated at large in praise of Germani cus but in terms of studied ostentation too elaborate to be thought sincere Of Drusus and the issue of the troubles in Illyricum he spoke with more reserve concise yet not without energy The concessions made by Germanicus to the legions on the Rhine were ratifir d in every article and at the same time extended to the army in Pannonia L1II In the course of the year died Julia the daughter of Augustus On account of her lascivious pleasures she had been formerly banished by her father to the Isle of Pandataria and afterward to Rhegium a city on the streights of Sicily During the life of her sons Caius and Lucius she became the wife of Tiberius and by the haughtiness of her car riage made him feel that she thought him beneath her rank The arrogance of her behaviour was the secret and most powerful motive for the retreat which that prince made to the Isle of Rhodes At his accession to the empire when he was master of the Roman world he saw her in a state of destitution banished covered with infamy and after the murder of Agrippa Posthumus without a ray of hope to comfort her Yet this could not appease the malice of Tiberius He ordered her to be starved to death concluding that after a tedious exile at a place remote a linger ing death in want and misery would pass unnoticed From the same root of bitterness sprung the cruel ly with which he persecuted Semprpnius Gracchus a man descended from a noble family possessed of talents and adorned with eloquence but eloquence vi ciously applied By his wit and rare accomplishments A D 14 OF TACITUS 49 he seduced the affections of Julia even in the lifetime of her husband Agrippa Nor did his passions stop there when she was afterwards married to Tiberius he was still a persevering adulterer and by secret ar tifices poisoned the mind of the wife against her hus band The letter to Augustus in which she treated the character of Tiberius with contempt was general ly thought to be his composition For these offences he was banished toCercina an island on the coast of Afri ca where he passed fourteen years in exile Soldiers at length were sent to put an end to his days The assassins found him on the point of a prominent neck of land with a countenance fixed in sorrow and de spair As soon as the ruffians approached he desired a short delay that he might write the sentiments of a dying man to his wife Alliaria Having despatched that business he presented his neck to the murderers stroke in his last moments worthy of the Sempro nian name His life was a series of degenerate actions The assassins according to some historians were not hired at Rome but sent from Africa by the proconsul Lucius Asprenas at the instigation of Tiberius who hoped to throw from himself the load of guilt and fix it on his tools of power The artifice did not suc ceed LIV In the course of this year was formed a new institution of religious rites In honour of Augustus a list of priests was added to the sacerdotal college in imitation of the order founded in ancient times by Titus Tatius to perpetuate the religious ceremo nies of the Sabines To create this new sodality the names of the most eminent citizens to the number of one and twenty were drawn by lot and Tiberiu Drusus Claudius and Germanicus were added It happened however that the games performed this year in honour of Augustus were disturbed by vio lent factions among the players In compliance with the wishes of Mecenas that passionate admirer of Bathyllus the comedian Augustus had always fa voured the exhibition of pantomimes He had himself a taste for those amusements and by mixing with the diversions of the multitude he thought he showed a Vol I â E 50 THE ANNALS A U C 768 popular condescension Tiberius was of a different character but the minds of men softened by luxury and during a long reign dissolved in pleasure could not easily conform to that austerity which suited the rigid temper of the prince LV In the consulship of Drusus Csesar and Caius Norbanus a triumph was decreed to Germanicus though the war was not yet brought to a conclusion The prince had concerted his plan of operations for the ensuing summer but he thought proper early in the spring to open the campaign by a sudden irrup tion into the territories of the Cattians a people dis tracted among themselves by the opposite factions of Arminius and jBegestes the former famous for his treachery to the Romans and the latter for unshaken fidelity Arminius was the common disturber of Ger many Segestes on the other hand had given re peated proofs of his pacific temper When measures were taken for a general insurrection he discovered the conspiracy and during the banquet which pre ceded the massacre of Varus he proposed that he himself Arminius and other chiefs should be seized and loaded with irons By that vigorous measure he was sure that the minds of the common people would be depressed with fear and having lost their chiefs none would dare to rise in arms The general of course would have leisure to discriminate the inno cent from the guilty But Varus was fated to perish and Arminius struck the blow In the present junc ture Segestes was compelled by the ardour of his countrymen to take up arms He still however re tained his former sentiments He had besides mo tives of a private nature his daughter whom he had promised in marriage to another chief was ravished from him by Arminius The father and the son in law were by consequence inveterate enemies and that connexion which between persons mutually well in clined forms the tenderest friendship served only to inflame the animosity of the two contending chiefs LVI Encouraged by these dissensions Germani cus appointed Csecina to the command of four legions fire thousand of the allies and the German recruits A D 15 51 OF TACITUS lately raised by hasty levies on this side of the Rhine He marched himself at the head of an equal legion ary force and double the number of auxiliaries On the ruins of a fort formerly built on Mount Taurus by his father Drusus he raised a fortification and proceeded by rapid marches against the Cattians To secure his retreat he left behind him Lucius Apro nius with orders to work at the roads and embank the rivers The dryness of the season uncommon in those parts and the low bed of waters in the rivers favoured his expedition but before his return the fall of heavy rains and the overflow of torrents might lay the country under water His arrival was so lit tle expected by the Cattians that their women and children were either taken prisoners or put to the sword The young and able bodied made their escape by swimming across the Adrana From the opposite liank they attemped to hinder a bridge from being thrown over the river but by a fierce discharge from the engines and a volley of darts they were driven from their post They offered terms of peace but without success Numbers submitted at discretion the rest abandoned their villages and fled for shelter into the woods The country round was laid waste Mattium the capital was destroyed by fire and the open plains were made a desert Germanicus marched his army back towards the Rhine the barbarians never daring to harass the rear as is their practice when pretending to retreat in a panic they wheel about on a sudden and return to the charge The Cheruscans meditated a sudden attack in favour of the Cattians but Csecina with an army of observation spread so warm an alarm that the enterprise was dropt The Marsians more bold and desperate risked a battle and were defeated LVII Germanicus in a short time afterwards re ceived a message from Segestes imploring protection from the fury of his countrymen who held him closely besieged Arminius had been the adviser of the war and was by consequence the idol of the people In a nation of savages the man of fierce and turbulent spirit is sure in times of commotion to be the leading j2 the axnaiS A U C 768 demagogue Among the deputies sent to Germani cus was Segimund the son of Segestes a young man who in the year famous for the revolt of Ger many was made by the Romans a priest of tho Ubian altar but soon after fired by the zeal that roused his whole nation he tore off his sacred vest ments and went over to his countrymen Conscious of this offence he hesitated for some time willing to decline the embassy till at length encouraged by the fame of Roman clemency he obeyed his father s or ders He met with a gracious reception and under a proper guard was conducted in safety to the fron tiers of Gaul Germanicus thought it of moment to change his purpose and marched back to the relief of Segestes He no sooner appeared before the place  than the enemy was attacked and put to the rout Segestes was set at liberty and with him a nu merous train of relatives and faithful followers several women of noble birth and in the number the daughter of Segestes then married to Arminius In her deportment no trace appeared of her father s character she breathed the spirit of her husband Not a tear was seen to start no supplicating tone was heard she stood in pensive silence her hands strained close to her bosom and her eyes fixed upon her womb then pregnant with the fruit of her mar riage At the same time was brought forth a load of spoils which in the slaughter of Varus and his le gions fell to the share of those who now surrendered to the Roman arms What chiefly attracted every eye was Segestes himself his stature of superior size and his countenance that of a man who knew neither guilt nor fear He spoke to this effect LVIII  It is not now the first time that Segestes has given proofs of his attachment to the cause of  Rome From the moment when I was enrolled a citizen by the deified Augustus your interest has  been the rule of my conduct Your friends I em  braced your enemies were mine In acting thus I  have not been guilty of treason to my country A  traitor I know is odious even to those who profit by  the treason I have been your friend because I A D 15 53 OF TACITUS  thought the interests of Germany and Rome were  interwoven with each other I have been your friend because I preferred peace to war Governed by these principles I addressed myself to Varus who  commanded your armies  before his tribunal I ex hibited an accusation against Arminius the ravisher  of my daughter and the violator of public treaties  But sloth and irresolution were the bane of that un  fortunate general From laws enfeebled and relaxed  I expected no relief I therefore desired earnestly â desired that Arminius and the other chiefs of the  conspiracy might be thrown into irons I did not  except myself With what zeal I pressed the mea  sure witness that fatal night which I wish had been  my last The horrors that followed demand our tears they cannot be justified Soon after that tragic event I confined Arminius in chains and from his faction I have suffered in my turn the  same indignity Admitted now to an interview with  Germanicus I prefer ancient friendship to new con nexions my voice is still for peace For myself I  have nothing in view my honour is dear to me and I desire to repel all suspicion of perfidy I  would if possible make terms for my countrymen if the can be induced to prefer a well timed repen  tance to calamity and ruin For my son and the errors of his youth I am a humble suppliant My  daughter indeed appears before you by necessity not by her own choice I acknowledge it It is yours to decide her fate it is yours to judge which ought to have most influence her husband or her father she is with child by Arminius and she sprung  from me Germanicus in his usual style of mo deration assured him that his children and relations nhould be protected as to himself he might depend upon a safe retreat in one of the old provinces He then marched back to the Rhine and there by the direction of Tiberius was honoured with the title of Imperator The wife of Arminius was delivered of a boy who was reared and educated at Ravenna The disasters which made him afterwards the sport of fortune shall bo related in their proper place E 2 54 A U C 768 THE ANNALS LIX The surrender of Segestes and his gracious reception from Germanicus being in a short time spread throughout Germany the feelings of men were various as their inclinations happened to be for peace or war Arminius by nature fierce and enter prising seeing in this juncture his wife for ever lost and the child in her womb a slave before its birth felt himself inflamed with tenfold fury He flew round the country of the Cheruscans spreading the flame of discord and in every quarter rousing the people to revenge he called aloud to arms to arms against Se gestes to arms against the Romans He spared no topic that could inflame resentment  Behold he cried  behold in Segestes the true character of a father in Germanicus an accomplished general in  the exploits of the Roman army the glory of a war like nation with mighty numbers they have led a  woman into captivity It was not in this manner that Arminius dealt with them three legions and  as many commanders fell a sacrifice to my revenge To the arts of traitors I am a stranger I wage  no war with women big with child My enemies  are worthy of a soldier I declare open hostility  and sword in hand I meet them in the field of bat  tie  Survey your religious groves the Roman ban  ners by me hung up and dedicated to the gods of  our country are there displayed they are the tro  phies of victory Let Segestes fly for shelter to the Roman provinces let him enjoy his bank on the side of Gaul and let him there meanly crouch  to make his son the priest of a foreign altar Pos terity will have reason to curse his memory fu  ture ages will detest the man whose crime it is that  we have seen between the Rhine and the Elbe rods  and axes the Roman habit and the Roman arms  To other nations punishments and taxes are yet  unknown they are happy for they are ignorant of  the Romans We have bravely thrown off the yoke we are free from burthens and since Augustus was  obliged to retreat that very Augustus whom his  countrymen have made a god and since Tiberius A D 15 55 OF TACITUS  that upstart emperor keeps aloof from Germany  shall we who have dared nobly for our liberties  shrink from a boy void of experience and an army ruined by their own divisions If your country is  dear to you if the glory of your ancestors is near your hearts if liberty is of any value if the enjoy ment of your natural rights is preferable to new  masters and foreign colonies follow Arminius I  will marshal you the way to glory and to freedom  Segestes has nothing in store but infamy chains and bondage LX By these incendiary speeches all Germany t was roused to action The Cheruscans took up arms i ind the neighbouring states followed their example Inguiomer a man long known and high in the esti mation of the Romans declared in favour of Armi nius he was uncle to that chieftain By adopting his measures he added strength to the confederacy Ger manicus saw the impending danger To cause a di  version and avoid the united strength of the enemy he ordered Csecina with forty Roman cohorts to penetrate into the territory of the Bructerians as far as the river Amisia Pedo at the head of the cavalry was directed to march along the confines of the Fri  sians Germanicus with four legions embarked on the lakes One common place of destination was ap pointed the foot the cavalry and the fleet arrived in due time The Chaucians joined the RTSman army the Bructerians set fire to their houses and abandoned their country Lucius Stertinius with a detachment of the light horse was ordered to pursue the fugitives That officer came up with the enemy and put the whole body to the rout Amidst the slaughter that followed some of the soldiers were intent on plunder Among the spoils was found the eagle of the nine teenth legion lost in the massacre of Varus The army pushed on with vigour to the farthest limit of tho Bructerians The whole country between the river Amisia and the Luppia was made a desert The Romans were now at a small distance from the forest of Teutoburgium where the bones of Vams and his legions were said to be still unburied 56 A U C 768 THE ANNALS LXI Touched by this affecting circumstance Ger manicus resolved to pay the last human office to the relics of that unfortunate commander and his slaugh tered soldiers The same tender sentiment diffused itself through the army some felt the touch of na ture for their relations others for their friends and all lamented the disasters of war and the wretched lot of human kind Carina was sent forward to ex plore the woods where the waters were out to throw up bridges and by heaping loads of earth on the swampy soil to secure a solid footing The army marched through a gloomy solitude The place pre sented an awful spectacle and the memory of a tragi cal event increased the horror of the scene The first camp of Varus appeared in view The extent of the ground and the three different inelosures forthe eagles still distinctly seen left no doubt that the whole was the work of the three legions Farther on were traced the ruins of a rampart and the hollow of a ditch well nigh filled up This was supposed to be the spot where the few who escaped the general massacre made their last effort and perished in the attempt The plains around were white with bones in some places thinly scattered in others lying in heaps as the men happened to fall in flight or in a body resisted to the last Fragments of javelins and the limbs of horses lay scattered about the field Human skulls were seen upon the trunks of trees In the adjacent woods stood the savage altars where the tribunes and principal centurions were offered up a sacrifice with barbarous rites Some of the soldiers who survived that dreadful day and afterwards broke their chains related circumstantially several particulars  Here  the commanders of the legions were put to the sword on thai spot the eagles were seized There  Varus received his first wound and this is the place  where he gave himself the mortal stab and died by  his own sword Yonder mound was the tribunal from  which Ajrminius harangued his countrymen here he fixed his gibbets there he dug the funeral  trenches and in that quarter he offered every mark A D IS 57 OF TACITUS  of scorn and insolence to the colours and the Roman  eagles LXII Six years had elapsed since the overthrow of Varus and now on the same spot the Roman army collected the bones of their slaughtered country men Whether they were burying the remains of strangers or of their own friends no man knew all however considered themselves as performing the last obsequies to their kindred and their brother sol diers While employed in this pious office their hearts were torn with contending passions by turns op pressed with grief and burning for revenge A monu ment to the memory of the dead was raised with turf Germanicus with his own hand laid the first sod dis charging at once the tribute due to the legions and sympathizing with the rest of the army The whole though an act of piety to the slain was condemned by Tiberius The malignity of his nature led him to misinterpret the actions of Germanicus perhaps ho was apprehensive that the view of a field covered with the unburied limbs of a slaughtered arjny might damp the ardour of the soldier and add to the ferocity of the enemy There might be another rea son for his displeasure Perhaps he thought that a general invested with the office of augur and other religious functions ought not to assist at the per formance of funeral rites LXIII Germanicus pressed forward by rapid marches in pursuit of Arminius who fled before him taking advantage of the defiles and difficult part of the country Having overtaken the barbarians and seeing his opportunity be ordered the cavalry to ad vance on the open plain and dislodge the enemy Arminius drew up his men in close compacted ranks and feigning a retreat to the forest suddenly wheeled about giving at the same time the signal to the troops that lay ambushed in the woods to rush out and begin the attack The Roman cavalry struck with surprise at the sudden appearance of a new army were thrown into disorder They fell back upon the cohorts sent to support them and a general conster nation followed The barbarians pursued their ad 58 THE ANNALS A U C 768 vantage and had well nigh driven the Romans into a morals well known to themselves but impractica ble to strangers when Germanicus came up with the legions in order of battle At the sight of a regular force the Germans were struck with terror The broken ranks of the Romans had time to rally Nothing decisive followed Both armies parted upon equal terms Germanicus marched back to the river Amisia and with his legions sailed across the lakes Part of the cavalry had orders to file along the sea coast and by a winding march return to the banks of the Rhine   Csecina at the head of his own division marched through a country of which he was not ignorant He ljad directions to pass the long bridges with all possi ble expedition The place so called is a narrow cause way constructed formerly by Lucius Domitius It stretches a great length of way between two prodi gious marshes The country round is one vast fen in some parts covered with a deep and slimy mud in others with a tenacious heavy clay intersected fre quently with rapid torrents A thick forest rising at some distance on a gradual acclivity inclosed the wiiole scene and formed a kind of amphitheatre Ar minius who knew the course of the country made a forced march and took post in the woods before the Romans encumbered with arms and heavy baggage arrived at the place CfEcina found a double difficul ty The bridges ruined by time were to be repaired and the enemy at the same time was to be repulsed He judged it necessary to pitch his camp as in that situation a sufficient number might work at the cause way while the rest were held in readiness to engage the enemy LXIV The barbarians made a vigorous effort to force the outposts and penetrate to the men working at the intrenchments They rushed forward with im petuous fury they wheeled about to the flanks they returned to charge in front A mingled shout arose from the labourers and the combatants All things seemed to conspire against the Romans the slimy soil if the men stood still sunk under them if they A D 15 59 OF TACITUS advanced it was too slippery for their feet The weight of the soldiers armour and the depth of wa ter made the management of the javelins almost im practicable The Cheruscans on the contrary were fighting in their own element they were used to fens and marshes their stature was large and their spears of a length to wound at a distance The legions began to give way when night came on and put an end to the unequal conflict The barbarians were too much flushed with success to complain of fatigue or to think of rest During the night they cut a channel for the waters and from the neighbouring hills let down a deluge into the valley The plains were laid under water and the half finished works being car ried a way by the flood the soldier saw that his labour was to begin again Csecina had been forty years in the service A man of his experience who had known the viccissitudes of war was not to be disconcerted He saw between the morass and the hills a plain of solid ground large enough for a small army To that spot having weighed all circumstances lie judged â it his best expedient to send the wounded with the heavy baggage and in the mean time to confine the Germans in their woods For this purpose he sta tioned the fifth legion in the right wing and the one and twent ieth in the left the first legion led the van and the twentieth brought up the rear LXV The night in both camps was busy and un quiet but from different causes The barbarians passed their time in jollity and carousing warlike Bongs and savage howlings kept a constant uproar while the woods and valleys rung with the hideous sound In the Roman camp the scene was different pale gleaming fires were seen no sound save that of low and hollow murmurs the soldiers lay extended at length under the palisades or wandered from tent to tent fatigued and weary yet scarce awake Ceocina Was disturbed by a terrible dream he thought that Quintilius Varus emerged from the fens and calling upon him to follow waved his hand to point the way Unwilling to obey the summons Crocina pushed the phantom from him At break of day the legions 60 A U Â 768 THE ANNALS which had been stationed in the wings through fear or a spirit of mutiny abandoned their post and seized a piece of solid ground beyond the morass Arminius though the opportunity was fair did not embrace it but soon after seeing the baggage fast in the mud or m the ditches the soldiers gathering round in tumult and disorder the eagles in confusion and as in such cases always happens each man acting for himself and deaf to the command of his officers he ordered his men to make a vigorous onset exclaiming as he advanced  Behold Varus and his legions their fate  once more has given them to our swords He charged at the head of a chosen band and by gashing and mangling the horses made a dreadful havoc Goaded by wounds and not able to keep their legs on a slimy soil which was made still more slip pery by the effusion of their own blood those animals in their fury threw their riders overturned all in their way and trampled under their feet the wretches that lay on the ground The chief distress was round the eagles to support them under a heavy volley of darts was difficult and to fix them in the swampy ground impossible Cecina exerting himself with undaunted vigour to sustain the ranks had his horse killed under him The barbarians were ready to surround him if the first legion had not come up to his assistance At length the rage for plunder natural to savages turned the fortune of the day Intent on booty the Germans desisted from the fight The Romans seized their advantage and towards the close of day gained a station on the solid ground Their distress how ever was not al an end intrenchments were to be raised earth to be brought their tools for digging and cutting the soil were lost no tents for the sol diers  no medicine for the wounded their provisions in a vile condition deformed with filth and blood a night big with horror hung over their heads and the ensuing day to a number of brave and gallant men might prove the last Thejspirit of the legions sunk and all lamented their condition â LXVI It happened in the course of the night that a horse broke loose and scared by the noise of the A D 15 61 OF TACITUS soldiers ran wild through the camp trampling down all that came in his way This accident spread a ge neral panic In the first hurry of surprise it was ge nerally believed that the Germans had stormed the intrenchments The soldiers rushed to the gates chiefly to that called the Decuman at the back of the camp remote from the enemy and the most like ly to favour their escape Csecina knew that it was a false alarm he tried to recal the men from their error he commanded he implored he laid hold of numbers but finding all without effect he threw himself on the ground and lay stretched at length across the passage At the sight of their general in that condition the men recoiled with horror from the outrage of trampling on his body In that interval the tribunes and centurions convinced the men that their fears were without foundation LXVII Csecina assembled his men in the part of the camp assigned for the eagles Having commanded silence he explained their situation and the necessi ty that called upon them to act like men  They had nothing to depend upon except their valour but  their valour must be cool deliberate guided by pru  dence Let all remain within the lines till the bar  barians in hopes of carrying the works advance to  the assault Then will be the time to sally out By M one brave effort they might open a passage to the  Rhine If they fled other woods and deeper fens  remain behind perhaps more savage enemies By one glorious victory they were sure of gaining every advantage honoured by their country loved  by their families and applauded by the whole  army The bright side of the military life being thus held forth he said nothing of the reverse His next care was to select a body of his bravest soldiers These he provided with horses as well from his own retinue as from those of the tribunes and centurions without favour or partiality distinguishing merit only The men thus mounted were to make the first im pression on the en Â y and the infantry had orders to support the rear LXVIII The Germans in the mean time were no Vol I â F 62 A U C 768 THE ANNALS less in agitation their hopes of conquest the love of plunder and the jarring counsels of their chiefs dis tracted every mind The measure proposed by Armi nius was to let the Romans break up their camp and surround them again in the narrow denies and in the bogs and marshes Inguiomer more fierce and vio lent and for that reason more acceptable to the ge nius of barbarians was for storming the camp it would be carried by a general assault the number of prisoners would be greater and the booty in better condition His advice prevailed At the point of day the attack began at the first onbet the Germans level led the fosse threw in heaps of hurdles and attempt ed a scalade The ramparts were thinly manned the soldiers who showed themselves put on the appear ance of a panic The barbarians climbed to the top of the works In that moment the signal was given to the cohorts clarions and trumpets sounded through the camp the Romans in a body and with one ge neral shout rushed on to the attack They fell upon the enemy in the rear crying aloud as they ad vanced Here are no woods no treacherous fens  we are here on equal ground and the gods will de  cide between us The barbarians had promised themselves an easy conquest The affair they ima gined would be with a handful of men but their sur prise rose in proportion when they heard the clangour of trumpets and saw the field glittering with arms Tho sudden terror magnified their danger To be elated with success and to droop in adversity is the genius of savage nations A dreadful slaughter fol lowed The two chiefs betook themselves to flight Arminius unhurt and Inguiomer dangerously wound ed No quarter was given to the common men The pursuit continued as long as day light and resentment lasted Night coming on the legions returned to their camp covered with new wounds and their provisions no better than the day before but health and food and vigour all things were foundin victory LXIX Meanwhile a report n spread round the country that the Roman army was cut to pieces and the Germans flushed with conquest were pouring A D 15 G3 OF TACITUS down to the invasion of Gaul The consternation was such that numbers proposed to demolish the bridge over the Rhine Vile as the project was there were men who through fear would have been hardy enough to carry it into execution if Agrippina had not prevented so foul a disgrace Superior to the weakness of her sex she took upon her with an he roic spirit the functions of a general officer She at tended to the wants of the men she distributed clothes to the indigent and medicines to the sick Pliny has left in his history of the wars in Germany a descrip tion of Agrippina at the head of the bridge reviewing the soldiers as they returned and with thanks and congratulations applauding their valour This con duct alarmed the jealous temper of Tiberius  Such  active zeal he said sprung from sinister motives  those popular virtues had not for their object the  enemies of Rome The soldiers were caressed for  other purposes What remained for the commander  if a woman can thus unsex herself at the head of  the eagles She reviews the legions and by larges  ses draws to herself the affections of the men Was  it not enough for her ambition that she showed her  son to the army and carried him from tent to tent  in the uniform of the common soldier with the title  of Csesar Caligula This woman towers above the  commanders of the legions and even above their  general officer She can suppress an insurrection  though the name and majesty of the prince makes no impression These were the reflections that planted thorns in the breast of Tiberius By the arts of Sejanus the malice of his heart was still more en venomed That minister studied the character of his master He practised on his passions and had the skill to sow in time the seeds of hatred which he knew would work in secret and at a distant day break out with collected force LXX Gcrmanicus who had sailed with the legions thought proper to lighten his ships in order to render them more fit for the navigation of the Northern seas full of sand banks and often dangerous hoth at the flood and the tide of ebb  With this view he disem THE ANNALS A U C 768 barked the second and the fourteenth legions and put them under the command of Publius Vitellius with directions to pursue their way over land Vitellius had at first a dry shore but the wind blowing hard from the north and the waves usual at the equinox rolling witli a prodigious swell the soldiers were car ried away by the torrrent The country was laid un der water The sea the shore and the fields pre sented one vast expanse The depths and shallows the quicksands and the solid ground were no more distinguished The men were overwhelmed by the waves and absorbed by the eddies Horses baggage and dead bodies were seen floating together The companies of the legions were mixed in wild confu sion sometimes breast high in water and often deeper Numbers were carried off by the flood and lost for ever Exhortations and mutual encouragement were of no avail Valour and cowardice prudence and temerity wisdom and folly perished without distinc tion Vitellius at length gained an eminence and drew the legions after him The night was passed in the utmost distress without fire without utensils many of the soldiers naked the greatest part wounded and ail in a condition worse than the horrors of a siege When the enemy is at the gates an honour able death still remains but here their fate was wretched and inglorious The return of day presented a new face of things the waters subsided and the land appeared The general pursued his march to the river Unsingis where Germanicus was arrived withhis fleet The two legions were taken on board A report of their total loss was spread far and wide and evory day gained credit till their safe return with Germa nicus proved the whole to be a false alarm LXXI Meanwhile Stertinius who had been de spatched to receive the surrender of Segimer the bro thef of Segestes conducted that chief together with his son to the city of the Ubians A free pardon was granted to both to Segimer without hesitation to the son who was known to have offered indignities to the body of Varus not without some delay Gaul Spain and Italy seemed to vie with each other in A D 15 OF TACITUS exertions to repair the losses of the army each nation offering according to their respective abilities a sup ply of arms of horses and money Germanicus thanked them for their zeal but received arms and horses only With his own funds he re ieved the wants of the soldiers and to obliterate or at least soften the recollection of past misfortunes he united with generosity the most conciliating manners He visited the sick he applauded their bravery he ex amined their wounds he encouraged some by pro mises he roused others to a sense of glory and in general filled all hearts with zeal for his person and the success of his arms LXXII Triumphal ornaments were this year de creed to Aulus Csecina Lucius Apronius and Caius Silius for their conduct under Germanicus The title of Father of his Country so often pressed upon him by the people Tiberius once more declined nor would he consent that men should be sworn on his acts though a vote for that purpose had passed the senate For this self denial he alleged the instability of hu man affairs and the danger of the sovereign always growing in proportion to the eminence on which he stands Popular as this sentiment was no man thought it sincere He who had lately revived in all its ri gour the law of violated majesty could not be consi dered as the friend of civil liberty The title indeed of that law was known in ancient times but the spi rit of it differed from the modern practice During the old republic the treachery that betrayed an army the seditious spirit that threw the state into convul sion tne corrupt administration that impaired the majesty of the Roman people were the objects of the law Men were arraigned for their actions but words were free Augustus was the first who warped the law to new devices The licentious spirit of Cassius Severus whose satirical pen had ridiculed the most eminent of both sexes excited the indignation of the prince and the pains and penalties of violated majesty were by a forced construction extended to defamatory libels After his example Tiberius being asked by the prator Pompeius Macer whether in 06 THE AXJiALS A U C 768 such prosecutions judgment should be pronounced returned for answer that the law must take its course The fact was Tiberius in his turn had felt the edge of satire in certain anonymous verses circulated at that time and keenly pointed at his pride his cruelty and his dissensions with his mother  LXXIII It will not be deemed an improper di gression if we state in this place the cases of two Roman knights Falanius and Rubrius both of nar row fortunes and both attacked under the new mode of prosecution A review of those proceedings will show the grievance in its origin and its progress how it gathered strength from the wily arts of Tibe rius from what causes it was for a time suppressed and afterwards revived in all its force till it proved in the end the most detestable invention that ever harassed mankind The charge against Falanius was that he had admitted into one of the fraternities then established in honour of Augustus one Cassius a comedian of profligate manners and further that in the sale of his gardens he had suffered a statue of Augustus to be put up to auction with the rest of his goods The crime alleged against Rubrius was that being sworn on the name of Augustus he was guilty of perjury Tiberius as soon as he was apprized of these proceedings wrote to the consulsâ that divine  honours were not decreed to the memory of his  father in order to lay snares for the people Cas  sius the player as well as others of his profession had often assisted in the games dedicated by Livia  to the memory of the deceased emperor and if his  statue in common with those of the gods in gene  ral was put up to sale with the house and gardens  the interests of religion would not be hurt A false  oath on the name of Augustus was the same as a  perjury in an appeal to Jupiter but the gods must 44 be their own avengers LXXIV In a short time after this transaction Granius Marcellus prator of Bythynia was accused of violated majesty by his own qusestor Csepio Cris pinus The charge was supported by Romanus Hispo a mercenary advocate who had then lately set up the A D IS 67 OF TACITUS trade of an informer that detestable trade which by the iniquity of the limes and the daring wickedness of the vile and profligate became afterwards the source of wealth and splendour Obscure and indi gent but bold and pragmatical this man by secret in formations pampered the cruelty of Tiberius and wriggled himself into favour By his detestable prac tices he became formidable to the first characters in Rome He gained the ear of the prince and the ha tred of mankind leaving an example by which the whole race of his followers rose from beggary and contempt to wealth and power till having wrought the destruction of the most eminent citizens they fell at last by their own pernicious arts The accusation brought by Csepio Crispinus charged Marcellus with having spoken defamatory words against Tibe rius The charge was big with danger while the accuser had the art to bring forward from the life of the emperor the worst of his vices ascribing all to the malignity of Marcellus The words were believed to be spoken because the facts were true Hispo the pleader added that the accused had placed his own statue higher than the Csesars and to a bust from which he had struck off the head of Au gustus united that of Tiberius The prince who had hitherto remained silent rose abruptly declaring in a tone of vehemencs that in a cause of that impor tance he would give his vote openly and under the sanction of an oath By this expedient the same ob ligation was to be imposed on the whole assembly But even then in that black period expiring liberty showed some signs of life Cneius Piso had the spirit to ask  In what rank Ceesar do you choose to give your voice If first your opinion must be mine if  last I may have the misfortune to differ from you Tiberius felt that his warmth had transported him too far He checked his ardour and had the moderation to consent that Marcellus should be acquitted on the law of violated majesty There remained behind a charge of peculation and that was referred to the proper jurisdiction LXXV The criminal proceedings before the senate 68 THE ANNALS A U C 768 were not enough to glut the malice of Tiberius he attended the ordinary courts of justice taking his seat near the corner of the tribunal that he might not displace the prsetor from his curule chair In his pre sence which had the effect of controlling the intrigues of the great several just decisions were pronounced but even this was big with mischief truth was served and liberty went to ruin Pius Aurelius a member of the senate complained to that assembly that by the making of a public road and laying an aqueduct the foundation of his house was ruined he therefore prayed to be indemnified The prsetors of the treasury opposed his petition Tiberius however struck with the justice of the case paid the value of the house The littleness of avarice was no part of his character When fair occasions called for liberality he was ready to open his purse and this munificent spirit he retained for a long time when every other virtue was extinguished Propertius Celer a man of prae torian family but distressed in his circumstances de sired to abdicate his rank of senator The state of indigence in which he lived being found to be the consequence of hereditary poverty he received a do nation of a thousand great sesterces A number of applications of the same nature followed soon after but Tiberius required that the allegations of each pe tition should be proved The austerity of his nature mixed with his best actions a leaven of harshness that embittered his favours By the rigour of the prince distress was silenced ingenuous minds chose to languish in obscurity rather than seek by humiliat ing confessions a precarious and at best a painful relief LXXVI In the course of this year the Tiber swelled by continual rains laid the level parts of the city under water When the flood subsided men and houses were washed away by the torrent Asmius Gallus proposed to consult the books of the Sybils but Tiberius dark and abstruse in matters of religion as well as civil business overruled the motion The care of preventing inundations for the future was committed to Ateius Capito and Lucius Arruntius i A D 15 op TACiTtra 69 The provinces of Achaia and Macedonia being found unequal to the taxes imposed upon them were re lieved from the expense ofsupporting a proconsular government and for the present transferred to the superintendence of the emperor Drusus in his awn name and that of his brother Germanicus exhibited a spectacle of gladiators and presided in person  de lighted more than became his rank with the effusion of blood and by consequence giving to the populace no favourable impression of his character Tibe rius it is said reproved him for his indiscretion Why he himself did not attend the public games various reasons were assigned According to some  numerous assemblies were not his taste and crowds  fatigued him Others ascribed it to the phlegmatic genius of the man fond of solitude and willing to avoid a comparison with the gracious manners of Augustus who was always a cheerful spectator on such occasions That he intended with covered ma lice to afford Drusus an opportunity of laying open the ferocity of his nature and thereby giving umbrage to the people seems rather a strained construction  yet even this was said at the time LXXVII The disorders occasioned by theatrical fictions in the preceding year broke out again with increasing fury Numbers of the common people and even many of the soldiers with their centurion ex erting themselves to quell the tumult and defend the magistrate were killed in the fray A tribune of the prsetorian guard was wounded on the occasion The affair was taken into consideration by the senate The fathers were on the point of passing a vote in vesting the prsetor with authority to order the players to be publicly whipped This was opposed by Hate mis Agrippa a tribune of the people who by his speech drew upon himself a sharp reply from Asi nius Gallus Tiberius with a deep reserve listened to the debate To see the senators amusing themselves with a show of liberty filled him with secret satisfac tion The motion however passed in the negative The authority of Augustus who had formerly decided that players were not liable to that mode of punish 70 THE ANNALS A U C 768 ment had great weight with the fathers and what was established by that prince Tiberius would not presume to alter To fix the salary of the players at a certain sum and to repress the zeal of their parti sans several decrees were passed the most material were  That no senator should enter the house of a pantomime performer that the Roman knights  should not attend the players in the street no ex  hibition to be presented in any place except the  theatre and all who engaged in riots were liable to  be banished by the sentence of the prsetor LXXVIII In consequence of a petition from Spain leave was given to erect a temple to Augustus in the colony of Terragon By this decree a precedent was held forth to all the provinces The people of Rome presented a petition praying that the payment of the hundredth part which was a tax on all vendible com modities imposed since the close of the civil wars might be remitted for the future Tiberius declared by public edict  That the support of the army de  pendod upon that fund and even with those re  sources the commonwealth was unequal to the  charge unless the veterans were retained in the ser  vice for the full term of twenty years By this art ful stroke the regulations limiting the time to sixteen years which had been extorted during the sedition in Germany were in effect repealed and rendered void for the future LXXIX A project to prevent inundations by giving a new course to the lakes and rivers that empty themselves into the Tiber was proposed to the senate by Lucius Arruntius and Atteius Capito The mu nicipal towns and colonies were heard in opposition to the measure The Florentines stated  That if the  Clanis were diverted from its channel and made to  flow by a new course into the Arno their whole  country would be ruined The inhabitants of In teramna made the like objection contending that  if  the Nan according to the plan proposed were di  videdinto various rivulets the most fertile plains  in Italy would be no better than a barren waste Noi did the people of ReatÂ remain silent they re A D 15 71 OF TACITUS monstrated that  if the communication by which the  lake Velinus fell into the Nar were obstructed the  adjacent country would be laid under water Na  ture had wisely provided for the interests of man  it was she that assigned to rivers their fountain  head their proper channel and their influx into the  sea Besides this the religion of the allies of Rome  claimed respect Considering the rivers of their country as under the patronage of tutelary gods they had in various places established forms of worship and dedicated their priests their altars  and their sacred groves The Tiber too deprived of  his tributary waters would be reduced not without indignation to an inglorious stream Convinced by this reasoning or deterred by the difficulty of the undertaking perhaps influenced by superstitious mo tives the senate went over to the opinion of Piso who declared against all innovation LXXX The government of Msesia was continued to Poppseus Sabinus with the superadded provinces of Achaia and Macedonia In the character of Tibe  rius it was a peculiar feature that he was ever un willing to remove men from their employments Hence the same person remained for life at the head of the same army or in the government of the same province For this conduct different reasons have been assigned By some we are told that he hated the pain of thinking and to a void further solicitude the choice which he once made was decided for life Others will have it that the malignity of his nature was the secret motive of a man who did not wish to see too many made happy by his favours The pro blem was solved by others in a different way His discernment they observe was quick and penetrating but his judgment slow and anxious He thought with subtlety amd refined till he embarrassed himself and though he never was the patron of virtue he de tested vice Superior merit made him tremble for 1 himself and he thought bad men a disgrace to the age In this manner divided between opposite exÂ tremes thinking without decision and reasoning but to hesitate he haa been known to appoint to the 72 A U C 768 THE ANNALS government of provinces men whom he never suf fered to depart from Rome LXXXI Of the consular elections either in this year or during the rest of his reign nothing can be said with precision His own speeches as well as the historians of the time are so much at variance that nothing like system can be traced We see the em peror in some instances holding the name of the candidate in reserve yet by an account of his birth his public conduct and his military services pointing directly to the man At other times he refuses even that satisfaction content with general directions to the candidates not to embroil the election by intrigue or bribery but to leave the whole to his management His custom in general was to profess that ho knew no candidates but those whose names he had trans mitted to the consuls others he said were free to offer themselves if from their merit or their interest they conceived hopes of success With speeches of this nature plausible indeed but unsubstantial the people were amused A show of liberty was held forth fair in appearance but deceitful and for that reason tending to plunge mankind in deeper servitude THE ANNALS OF TACITUS BOOK II 1 During the consulship of Sisenna Statilius Taurus and Lucius Libo the oriental kingdoms and by consequence the Roman provinces were thrown into commotion The name of discord was lighted up among the Parthians That restless people had sued for a king at the hands of Rome and after ac knowledging his title as a descendant from the line of the Arsacidcs began with their natural levity to Aespise him as an alien to the crown Vononcs was he name of this unpopular prince he had been for merly sent by his father Phraates as an hostage to Augustus The Eastern monarch made head against the armies of Rome and had driven her generals out of his dominions  but he endeavoured notwithstand ing by every mark of respect to conciliate the friend ship of Augustus As a pledge of sincerity he went the length of delivering up to the custody of the Ro mans even his own children not so much with a de sign to avert the terror of their arms as from want of confidence in the fidelity of his own subjects II After the death of Phraates and thc kings who succeeded him the leading men of the nation tired of civil slaughter sent Ambassadors to Rome with in structions to invite Vonones tho eldest son of Phra ates to the throne of his ancestors A nation ready to receive a sovereign from the will of Augustus pre sented to that emperor a scene truly magnificent He despatched Vonones richly loaded with presents The barbarians pleased as is their custom with the open ing of a new reign received the prince with all de monstrations of joy But disaffection soon took place Vol I â G 74 THE ANNALS A U C 769 they repented of their choice and saw with regTet the disgrace which their tame submission had brought upon their country The Parthians they said  were a degenerate race who meanly stooped to sue i  in another world and invited to reign over them an   exotic king trained up by the Romans fraught with  their maxims and tainted by their manners The  kingdom of the Arsacides was at length reduced to  a Roman province to be dealt out at the pleasure  of the emperor Where now the glory of those  gallant heroes who put Crassus to death and made  Marc Antony fly before them The slave of Ccesar  who crouched so many years in bondage gives the  law to the Parthians Such were the prejudices of the people The conduct of Vonones inflamed their indignation He renounced the manners of his coun try  was rarely seen in the sports of the chase  he took no delight in horsemanship and in his progress through the kingdom lolled at ease in a litter He disdained with fastidious pride to have his table served agreeably to the national taste his train of Greek attendants gave disgust and the paltry atten tion that secured the most trifling articles under a seal excited the contempt and ridicule of the people To be easy of access was want of dignity and courteous manners degraded the prince Virtues new to the Parthians were new vices Between his good and evil qualities no distinction was made they were foreign manners and for that reason detested III In this disposition of the public mind the crown was offered to Artabanus a descendant of Arsaces educated among the Dahi This prince after a de feat in his first engagement reinforced his army and gained possession of the crown Vonones fled to Ar menia where in that juncture the throne was va cant but an irresolute and wavering people could form no settled plan They turned their thoughts first  to Rome and next to the Parthians acting with al ternate treachery to both The insidious conduct of Marc Antony who allured their king Artavasdes to his friendship then loaded him with chains and basely murdered him was fresh in thoir minds Ar A D 16 OF TACITUS 75 taxias the son of that unfortunate prince conceived from that tragic event a rooted aversion to the Ro man name He ascended the throne his father and with tlie assistance of the Parthians stood at bay with Rome till he fell at last by the perfidy of his own re lations After his death Tigranes by the appoint ment of Augustus was raised to the throne Tibe rius Nero at the head of a powerful army conducted him to the capital of his dominions The reign of this prince was short His issue succeeded but the line became extinct notwithstanding the intermar riages of brother and sister allowed by the policy of eastern nations to strengthen the royal line By or der of Augustus Artavasdes succeeded To support his cause Rome exerted her strength and spilt the blood of her armies but without success The new king was driven from the throne IV In that juncture Caius Csesar was sent to compose the troubles in Armenia With the consent of the people that young commander placed the crown on the head of Ariobarzanes by birth a Mede dis  tinguished by his rare accomplishments and his grace ful figure After the death of this prince who lost his life by an accident the people refused obedience to his descendants A woman of the name of Erato succeeded but a female reign did not last long From that time the nation continued in a state of anarchy without a master yet not in possession of liberty It was in this posture of affairs that Vonones entered Armenia The people received him with open arms Artabanus in the mean time threatened to invade the kingdom The Armenians were not in force and Rome without undertaking an expensive war against the Parthians could not espouse their cause Vonones K fled for shelter to Creticus Silanus the governor of Syria That officer promised his protection but af  terwards thought proper to secure the person of the â prince leaving him under a strong guard to enjoy I the title of king and the parade of royalty The ef forts which Vonones made to escape from this mock dignity shall be related in due time  V Tiberius with his usual phlegm saw the storm  76 THE AXNALS A U C 769 gathering in the East Commotions in that part of the world might furnish an opportunity to remoTe Germanicus from an nrmy devoted to his person and to employ him in new scenes of action and in distant provinces where he could be exposed to the chance of war and more within the reach of treache ry Germanicus meanwhile finding the legions zeal ous in his service and the malice of Tiberius still implacable began to consider how he might strike a decisive blow and by one signal victory conclude the war For this purpose he reviewed his operations in the three last campaigns with the various turns of good and evil fortune which he had experienced He observed that  the Germans in a pitched battle or  on equal ground were always defeated  woods and  fens protected them  and the shortness of the sum  mer with the quick return of winter favoured their  cause It was not so much the sword of the enemy  as the fatigue of long and difficult marches that  thinned the Roman army The loss of military  weapons was an additional evil Horses were not to be procured in Gaul that country being well  nigh exhausted The baggage of the army liable  to ambuscades was always defended at great dis  advantage An expedition by sea promised better  success The army might penetrate at once into  the heart of the country and the Germans unap  prised of that mode of attack would be taken by  surprise The campaign would be sooner opened   the legions and their provisions might advance to  gether men and horses would arrive in good con tt dition and with the advantage of harbours for  the fleet and navigable rivers up the country the  war might be pushed to the very heart of Ger  many VL This plan of operations being judged the best he sent Publius Vitellius and Caius Cantius to con vene the states of Gaul and in the mean time committed the caro of building a fleet to Silius Antcius and Csecina A thousand vessels that num ber being deemed sufficient were soon in readiness buV not all

others were flat t ottomed that they might without difficulty run in upon the shore A great number had rudders at each end that by a sudden turn of the oars they might work with facility either way In many of the ships formed as well to carry sail as to advance with the stroke of the oar arches were raised on the decks of strength to bear the engines of war and at the same time afford room for horses and provisions The fleet thus equipped displayed a magnificent spectacle while the swell of the sails the alacrity of tho oars and the bustle of their soldiers struck a general ter ror The isle of Batavia was the place appointed for the general rendezvous The shore in those parts being easy of approach the troops might be speedily landed and again embarked with expedition so as to spread an alarm through the country The Rhine embracing in its course a few small islands flows in one united stream till it reaches the point of Bata via  where it branches off in two different channels one running with rapid force along the confines of Germany and till it fall into the ocean still retain ing its original name the other with a wider but less violent current washes the side of Gaul and by the inhabitants is called tho Wahal till at last losing itself in the Mcuse it takes the name of that river and through an immense opening discharges itself into the German Ocean VII While the fleet was preparing for the expedi tion Germanicus ordered Silius with a light detach ment to make an irruption into the territory of the Cattians Meanwhile having intelligence that the fort upon the river Luppia was invested he marched himself at tlie head of six legions to relieve the gar rison A sudden fall of heavy rains obliged Silius to desist from his enterprise He returned with a mo derate booty and two prisoners one the wife the other the daughter of Arpus prince of the Cattians Germanicus was not able to bring the Germans to an engagement He no sooner appeared before tha 78 THE ANNALS A U C 769 place than the enemy raised the siege and consulted their safety by flight It was found however that they had levelled to the ground the monument erect ed the year before to Varus and his legions and like wise an ancient altar dedicated to Drusus The prince rebuilt the altar and joined with the legions in equestrian games performed a funeral ceremony in honour of his father He did not judge it advisa ble to restore the tomb which had been erected to Varus and the legions but with a chain of fortified posts he secured the whole country between Fort Aliso and the Rhine VIII The fleet assembled at the place appointed Germanicus ordered the military stores to bo sent on board and having completed the embarkation of the legions and the allies sailed through the canal called the canal of Drusus invoking his father to assist the enterprise and by the memory of his ex ample to guide and animate his son now pursuing the same track of glory The fleet proceeded over the lakes and entering the German Ocean stretched away as far as the river Amisia There at a place of the same name on the left hand shore he landed his men leaving his ships safe at their moorings This measure was ill concerted The debarkation should have been made higher up the country and on the opposite bank where the enemy had taken post The mistake made it necessary to throw bridges over the river and in that business several days were consumed At low water the cavalry and the legions forded over the lestuary without difficulty but the rear consisting of the auxiliary forces was over thrown by the return of the tide and thrown into disorder The Batavians in particular eager to show their dexterity in swimming continued sporting in the waves till the rapidity of the current over whelmed them Some lost their lives Germanicus pitched his camp While he was employed in mark ing out the lines he received advice that the Angri varians whom he had left behind him were in mo tion To check their progress he sent a detachment f light infantry und er the command of Stertinius A D 16 or tacitus 79  who chastised the treachery of the barbarians and laid the country waste with fire and sword IX The Visnrgis flowed between the Romans and Cheruscans On the opposite bank Arminius pre sented himself He was attended by the principal German chiefs His business was to know whether Germanicus was with the army being answered in the affirmative he desired an interview with his bro ther known to the Romans by the name of Flavius a man of strict fidelity who some years before under the conduct of Tiberius lost an eye in battle The meeting was permitted Flavius advanced to the margin of the river Arminius from the opposite side saluted him and having ordered his guards to fall back required that the Roman archers should withdraw in like manner The two brothers being left to themselves Arminius fixed his eye on Flavius and Whence he said that deformity of feature  He was told the battle and the place where it happened And what continued Arminius has been your recom pense  I have received said Flavius an augmenta tion of pay a military chain an ornamented crown and other honours Arminius burst into a laugh of scorn and indignation  They are the wages he said  of a slave cheaply purchased X A warm altercation followed Flavius talked of the majesty of Rome the power of the Csesars the weight with which their vengeance falls on the obstinate and their clemency to the nations willing to submit He added Your wife and son are in the  hands of Rome and neither of them has been  treated like a captive Arminius on the contrary urged the rights of men born in freedom the laws of his country the plan of ancient liberty and the gods of Germany  Your mother he said joins with me in earnest supplication we both conjure you not to desert your family not to betray your  friends nor prefer the detested name of a traitor to  the vast renown of commanding armies in the de  fence of your country By degrees their passions rose to a pitch of fury insomuch that the river could not have restrained them from deciding their quarrel 80 THE ANNAL9 A U C 769 by the sword if Stertinius had not checked the im petuosity of Flavius who stood burning with resent ment and calling aloud for his horse and arms Ar minius behaved with equal fury in his slorm of passion denouncing vengeance and threatening the issue of a battle What he said was perfectly under stood He had commanded the auxiliaries of his coun try acting in conjunction with the legions and hav ing conversed in the Roman camp was able to interlard his discourse with Latin expressions XI On the following day the Germans appeared on the other side of the Visurgis drawn up in order of battle Germanicus till he had thrown bridges over the river and made each pass secure did not think it advisable to expose his legions to the hazard of an ongagement In the mean time to cause a diversion of the enemy he ordered the cavalry under the con duct of Stertinius and jEmilius one of the principal centurions to ford over at two different places Ca riovalda at the head of his Batavians advanced where the current was most rapid The Cheruscans feigned a flight Cariovalda pursuing with too much eagerness pushed on to a place encompassed with woods and fell into an ambuscade The enemy rushed onto the attack with impetuous fury They bore down all who resisted and pressed on such as gave way The Batavians formed a ring and were surrounded on every side The Germans at a dis tance discharged a volley of darts while some of them more eager than the rest fought hand to hand in close engagement Cariovalda sustained the shock with undaunted valour Finding himself at length in danger of being overpowered he exhorted his men to form in platoons and bravely opened a passage through the ranks of the enemy He rushed forward into the heat of the action but his horse being killed he fell under a shower of darts and died sword in hand Several of the prime nobility of his country perished with him The rest found their safety ei ther in their own valour or the timely succour of Stertinius aud iEniilhis who came up with the cavalry XII Germanicus in the mean lime having passed A D 16 CI OF TACITUS the Visurgis found by a deserter that Arminius had already fixed upon the spot for a general action and being reinforced by other nations then actually as sembled in a forest sacred to Hercules was deter mined in the dea of night to storm the Roman camp This intelligence was thought worthy of credit The fires of the enemy gleamed at a distance the scouts who advanced to reconnoitre their posts heard the neighing of horses and the bustle of a prodigious but undisciplined multitude In this important moment on the eve of a decisive battle the Roman general thought it a point of moment to explore the sentiments and inclinations of his men How to accomplish this with a degree of certainty was a difficult point  The  tribunes and centurions studied more to bring in  agreeable reports than to relate the truth The  freedmen still retained an original leaven of servili  ty and friends were prone to flattery In an assem  bly of the soldiers a few forward spirits took the  lead and the whole herd was ready to follow To  sound the real sentiments of the army the soldier  must be taken in his unguarded moments removed  from the eye of his officer at table with his com  rades when with frank simplicity he speaks his  mind and tells his hopes and fears without reserve XIII As soon as night came on the prince went forth through the augural gate covered with the skin of a wild beast A single attendant followed him He pursued his way through devious paths unknown to the sentinels stopping frequently near the tents and listening to his own fame The nobility of his descent was the topic with some others praised the dignity of his person the greater part talked of his patience his courage and that happy temperament which upon all occasions severe or lively still preserved the dignity of his character To such a commander the place to show their gratitude was the field of battle there the barbarians ought to suffer for their perfidy arid there the violator of public treaties should be doomed a sacrifice to the glory of Germanicus Amidst these discourses a soldier from the adverse camp who could speak the Roman language rode 82 A U C 769 THE ANNALS up to the intrenchments and in the name of Armi nius proclaimed aloud a promise of wives and lands to every deserter besides a hundred sesterces for his daily pay during the continuance of the war This was felt as an affront the soldiers cried out with in dignation  The dawn of day shall see us in the  field let Arminius risk a battle the lands of his  countrymen shall be ours by conquest and their  wives shall be carried off in captivity The offer is  an omcu of victory The wealth and the women of  Germany shall be the reward of valour At the third watch the enemy advanced to the intrench ments but perceiving the works properly guarded the cohorts under arms and all intent on duty they retreated without so much as throwing a single dart XIV Germanicus retired to rest and in his sleep was favoured with a joyful vision Being employed as he imagined at a sacrifice and the blood of the victim happening to stain his pontifical garment his grand mother Livia made him a present of another robe no less beautiful than magnificent Pleased with this prognostic which the auspices confirmed he called an assembly of the soldiers and in a speech acquainted them with his plan for the ensuing battle The open plain he observed was not the only spot where the Romans could engage with advantage Woods and forests were equally favourable The unwieldy buckler of the Germans and that enormous length of spear which amidst surrounding trees and interwoven thickets was scarcely manageable could not be compared to the Roman sword the javelin and their defensive armour so well adapted to the shape and motions of the body  Redouble your  blows he said and strike at the face of the enemy  They have neither helmets nor breast plates Their shields are neither riveted with iron nor covered  with hides they are nothing but ozier twigs inter  twined or slight boards daubed over with glaring  colours In the foremost ranks a few are provided  with pikes and javelins in the rest of their army  you see nothing but stakes hardened in the fire or  weapons too short for execution The aspect of A D 16 83 OF TACITUS 4Â their men may at first shfht be hideous in the  onset they may have bodily vigour but let them 44 feel the anguish of their wounds and they betake l4 themselves to flight impatient of pain void of ho  nour and regardless of their officers cowards in ad  versity and in the hour of success above all laws  both human and divine Do you wish my fellow  soldiers for an end of all your toils Are you weary  of tedious voyages and laborious marches Now is your opportunity one battle ends the war The  Elbe is nearer than the Rhine Beyond this spot  we have nothing to subdue It was here that Dru  bus my father triumphed and here Tiberius my M uncle reaped his laurels Exert one vigorous effort  and you make me their rival perhaps their equal in  glory This speech was received with acclama tions  and the ardour of the men blazing out at once the signal for the charge was given XV Arminius and the German chiefs omitted nothing that could rouse the courage of their men Behold they said the refuse of the Varian ar my a set of dastards in the field and rebels in  their camp With their backs seamed with stripes  their limbs enervated their strength exhausted by  tempestuous voyages dispirited weak and void of  hope they are given to our swords a sacrifice to  the gods and the victims of German valour To  avoid a fiercer enemy they fled to the ocean where  we could neither attack nor hang upon their rear In the ensuing battle the winds cannot befriend  them  their oars can give them no assistance Call to mind their pride their avarice and their cruelty  above all let us remember to act like men who have resolved to live in freedom or to die with  glory XVI By these and such like incentives the Ger mans were inflamed with uncommon ardour The chiefs conducted them burning with impatience to an open plain called the Idistavisian vale situate between the Visurgis and a chain of mountains The ground was of an irregular form narrow in some parts where the hills projected forward and in 84 A U C 769 THE A raiM others where the windings of the river made an open ing stretching into length In the rear of the Ger mans and at a small distance rose a thick forest the trees large and lofty with branches expanding near the top but the trunks bare towards the bottom and the intermediate space clear of underwood Of this plain and the approaches to the wood the barbarians took possession The Cheruscans apart from the rest took post on the hills to watch the fortune of the day and in good time to pour down with fury on the Roman army Germanicus ranged his men in the following order the Gauls and German auxiliaries formed the front of the line followed by a body of archers on foot and four legions with Germanicus at the head of two prsetorian cohorts and a select body of cavalry Four other legions with the light infantry the horse archers and the remainder of the allies brought up the rear The whole army pro ceeded in order of battle all instructed to preserve their ranks and to receive with firmness the first im pression of the enemy XVII The Cheruscans too impatient to keep their post rushed with impetuosity from their hills Ger manicus no sooner saw their motions than he sent a chosen body of horse to charge them in flank while Stertimus with another detachment wheeled round to fall upon the rear The general himself was ready if occasion required to second the attack at the head of the legions In that moment eight eagles were seen stretching with rapid wing towards the wood where they entered and disappeared This was re ceived as an omen of victory  Advance said Ger manicus the Roman birds have marshalledÂ you the  way Pursue the tutelar deities of the legions The infantry began the assault in front the cavalry at the same time charged the flank and rear The bar barians thrown into confusion presented an uncom mon spectacle those who had been stationed in the woods were driven forward to the plain and from the plain the foremost lines fled for shelter to the woods Between both the Cheruscans were driven down from their heights Arminius their chief per A D 16 OF TACITUS 85 formed wonders Wounded as he was he braved every danger with his voice with his hand with every effort still sustaining the combat He fell with fury on the archers and would have opened his way had not the Rhsetian cohorts with the Gauls and the Vindelici advanced their standards to oppose him Indebted to his own exertions and the vigour of his horse he escaped from the field and to disguise his person besmeared his face with his own blood If report is to be credited the Chaucians then serving the allies of Rome knew his person but connived at his escape By the like gallant behaviour or a similiar treach ery Inguiomer survived the havoc of the day A general carnage followed Numbers endeavouring to swim across the Visurgis perished in the attempt overwhelmed with darts or carried away by the vio lence of the current The multitude then plunged into the water obstructed one another and the banks giving way were crushed under the load Some were dastardly enough to seek their safety by climb ing up the trees where they hoped to skulk among the branches but the Roman archers in sport and derision took aim at the fugitives and in that man ner or by felling the trees they were all destroyed The victory was signal and cost the Romans little or no effusion of blood XVIII The slaughter lasted from the fifth hour to the close of day The country ten miles round was covered with mangled bodies and the arms of the vanquished Among the spoils was found a large quantity of fetters which the barbarians anti cipating a certain victory had prepared for the Ro man prisoners The legions on the field of battle pro claimed Tiberius Imperator and having raised a mount placed on the top of it a pile of German arms as the trophies of victory with an inscription at the base setting forth the names of the conquered na tions XIX To the German mind nothing could be so exasperating as thfs monument of Roman glory The wounds received in battle the desolation of their Vol I â H 86 A U C 769 THE ANNALS country and the wretched condition to which they were reduced were all as nothing compared to this insulting memorial Preparing but a little before to abandon their habitations and seek new settlements beyond the Elbe they changed their minds and once more resolved to try the hazard of a battle The no bles and the populace the old and the young all ranks and classes of men appeared in arms They pursued the Romans on their march they harassed the rear and often throw them into disorder Re solved at length to risk a battle they chose for that purpose a narrow and swampy plain inclosed on one side by a river and on the other by a thick wood at the back of which lay a deep morass A rampart formerly thrown up by the Angrivarians as a bar rier between themselves and the Cheruscans inclosed one side of the fen On this spot the barbarians sta tioned their infantry Their cavalry lay in ambush in the woods with intent as soon as the Romans ad vanced to attack them by surprise and cut off the rear of the army XX Germanicus had intelligence of all that pass ed Their stations their councils of war their public debates their secret resolutions were all discovered and their own devices were turned against themselves The command of the horse was given to Seius Tu bero with orders to form on the open plain The in fantry was so disposed that by an easy pass one divi sion might penetrate into the woods while the other carried the rampart by assault Whatever was diffi cult or arduous the general reserved for himself leaving all slighter operations to his officers On the level plain the cavalry bore down all before them but the rampart was not easily taken The soldiers who advanced to the attack were as much exposed to the darts of the enemy as if they had been before the walls of a regular fortification Germanicus saw the disadvantage Ho drew off the legions and or dered the engineers and slingers to play upon the works in order to drive the barbarians from their post A volley of darts was discharged from the bat tering machines with such incessant fury that the A D 16 87 OF TACITUS bravest of the Germans who dared to face every danger died under repeated wounds The enemy was dislodged from the rampart Germanicus at the head of the prsetorian cohorts advanced into tho woods the battle there was fierce and obstinate both sides fought hand to hand Behind the barba rians lay the morass in the rear of the Romans the river and the woods no room to retreat valour their only hope and victory their only safety XXI The martial spirit of the Germans yielded in nothing to the Romans but their weapons and their manner of fighting were a great disadvantage Pent up in a forest too close for such a multitude they could neither wound at a distance nor manage their weapons with their usual agility The Romans on the contrary with their bucklers close to the breast and their hands covered with the hilt of their swords found the large proportions of the enemy an easy mark They gashed the barbarians in the face and drove them from their ranks Arminius no longer fought with his usual ardour Ill success so often repeated depressed his spirit or perhaps the wound which he had received in the late engagement had exhausted his strength Inguiomer performing won ders and busy in every part of the field was aban doned by his fortune not by his courage Germani cus threw off his helmet that his person might bo better distinguished and rushing among the ranks exhorted his men to give no quarter He cried aloud  We have no need of prisoners extirpate the barba dians nothing less will end the war Tho day being far advanced he ordered one of the legions to quit the field in order to prepare an encampment the rest had their measure of revenge till the approach of night put an end to the effusion of blood In this battle the Roman cavalry fought with undecided success XXII Germanicus in a public harangue commend ed the valour of his army and afterwards raised a pile of arms as a trophy of victory with this splendid inscription The army of Tiberius Cesar having 88 A U C 769 THE ANNAL8  subdued the nations between the Rhine and the Elbe dedicates this monument to Mars to Jupiter  and Augustus Of the commander in chief no mention was made To soften envy he assumed no part of the praise content with deserving it Sterti nius marched into the territory of the Angrivarians with orders if they did not submit to lay the country waste The barbarians surrendered at discretion and received a general pardon XXIII The summer being now far advanced Ger manicus ordered some of the legions to return by land to winter quarters he himself sailed with the rest down the river Amisia to the main ocean The wea ther was favourable and the sea presented a perfeet calm unruffled by any motion except what was oc casioned by the dashing of the oars and the rapid motion of a thousand vessels under sail But this se renity did not last long the sky was overcast a storm of hail burst down with sudden fury squalls of wind drove the billows different ways and the pilot could no longer see what course to steer Unused to tho tempestuous element and terrified by the novelty of the danger the soldiers added to the alarm They interfered with the mariners they endeavoured to lend a helping hand  but activity without skill serv ed only to embarrass such as knew their duty The winds at last were collected to one point and tho storm blew directly from tho south In that climate the south wind is generally more tempestuous than in other seas Sweeping over the bleak German mountains it drives from the land a vast body of clouds that form a scene of impending horror which the vicinity of the northern regions ren ders still more formidable The ships were dispersed some were thrown on unknown islands surrounded with rocks or upon banks of sand that lay concealed beneath the waves At the turn of the tide the wind and the current with united force drove one way To lie at anchor w as impossible The billows broke over the ships with such violence that all the pumps at work could not discharge the water To lighten A D 1G 89 op TAcrrrs the vessels was the only expedient left  and acord ingly horses beasts of burden arms and baggage were thrown overboard XXIV The storms in other seas are inconsider able when compared to the fury of a northern tem pest The ocean in those parts is more boisterous than in any other of the known world and the rigour of Germany surpasses that of any other climate The danger of the fleet was by consequence more alarming the magnitude as well as the novelty of the mischief exceeding any former voyage under taken by the Romans No friendly shore at hand every coast in the possession of savage enemies the sea of a depth incredible vast in circumference and according to the received opinion without any nation towards the north or any continent to fix its boun dary A number of ships went to the bottom many were wrecked on distant islands secluded from the commerce of man The soldiers who were cast on shore perished by famine or prolonged a wretched existence by feeding on the carcases of horses thrown  up by the sea The vessel in which Germanicus sailed was driven far from the fleet to the coast inhabited by the Chau  cians There the disconsolate prince passed whole days and nights among pointed rocks wandering on the prominent beach his eyes fixed on the brawling deep and his heart imputing to himself the whole calamity It was with difficulty that his friends re strained him from burying himself in the same waves that swallowed up so many gallant soldiers At length the storm abated The wind and the tide serving at once some of the ships were seen making to the land all in a shattered condition few oars re maining and the clothes of the men stretched out for sails The crippled veseels were drawn in tow by such as were less disabled Germanicus refitted the fleet with all possible expedition and as soon as might be ordered some of the ships to coast along the islands in search of the soldiers who had been cast away By this diligence many were restored to their friends The Angrivarians lately reduced to suh H2 90 THE ANNALS A V C 769 jection returned a considerable number whom they had ransomed from their maritime neighbours Some were thrown on the coast of Britain and there re leased by the petty princes of the country According to the distance from which the men returned the ac count of their perils was swelled with marvellous ad ventures they talked of hurricanes and birds unheard of before of sea monsters and ambiguous forms partly man and partly fish things either seen or else the coinage of imaginations crazed with fear XXV The news of these disasters spreading far and wide the Germans began to think of renewing the war Nor was Germanicus less active to coun teract their designs He despatched Caius Silius with thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse to make war on the Cattians and in the mean time marched himself at the head of a greater force to invade the Marsians Malovendus the chief of that nation had lately surrendered to the protection of Rome From him intelligence was gained that the eagle of one of the legions commanded by Varus lay in a trench covered with earth in a neighbouring grove and the guard stationed there could make but â a feeble resistance Two parties were sent forward without delay one to attack the enemy in front and draw them from their post the other to enter the wood in the rear and recover the eagle Success at tended both expeditions Germanicus now resolved to penetrate into the heart of the country he carried destruction wherever he marched the enemy in every direction flying before him or if any where they made a stand either routed or put to the sword Ac cording to the account brought in by the prisoners a more general panic was never known All agreed that the Romans rose superior to adversity a race of men not to be subdued Their fleet destroyed their arms lost in the deep the coast of Germany co vered with the dead bodies of men and horses and yet said the astonished Germans they return undis mayed and with their former ferocity renew the charge as if calamity increased their numbers XXVI The Romans marched into winter quarters A D 16 91 OF TACITUS proud of their exploits and in their late success losing the memory of past misfortunes The prince with that munificence that graced his character paid to each soldier the amount of his loss Meanwhile the Germans weakened and disheartened by the ill suc cess of so many efforts began to think of pacific mea sures nor was it doubted but another summer if they dared to take the field would complete and end the war But Tiberius wished for nothing so much as the return of Germanicus His letters were all to that effect  It was time he said  to visit the  capital and enjoy the honours of a triumph already decreed Enough had been performed The pros  perous events of war were balanced by misfortunes  Important battles had been fought and victory had  often attended the Roman arms but the winds and  waves conspired and losses at sea not indeed im  putable to the general were very heavy disasters Â Tiberius added that he himself under the auspices w of Augustus had been sent nine times into Germa wny but it was to prudent counsels more than to  force of arms that he owed all his success It was  by policy that the Sicambrians were wrought to a  submission it was by management that the Sue  vians were drawn into an alliance with Rome and  it was the same conduct that made Maroboduus u listen to terms of peace The honour of the Roman  name was now revived in all its ancient lustre and  it was therefore time to leave the Cheruscans and  the hostile states of Germany to their own dissen  sions Germanicus notwithstanding these remonstrances requested leave to continue in the command for one year more Tiberius was not to be diverted from his purpose He plied Germanicus with new arguments and as a lure to young ambition threw out the offer of a second consulship which required personal at tendance at Rome He urged moreover that if the war continued some share of merit ought to be left to Drusus the brother of Germanicus for whom no other field of glory could be found It was in Germa ny only that Drusus could acquire the title of Imps 92 THE ANNALS A U C 769 rator Rome had no other enemies The laurel crown must be gained in that quarter of the world Germanicus saw through these pretences The object he knew was to stop him in the full career of fame with regret he resigned the command and returned to Rome XXVII About this time Libo Drusus descended from the Scribonian family was accused of a conspi racy against the state The history of this transaction in all its stages its rise its progress and its final issue shall be here laid open The detail will not be unin teresting since we are now arrived at that black period which engendered that race of men who for a series of years were the scourge and pest of so ciety Libo owed his ruin to his intimacy with Fir mius Catus a member of the senate Catus saw in his friend besides the impetuosity of youth a cast of mind susceptible of vain illusions and superstitious credulity He saw that the judicial astrology of the Chaldseans the mysteries of the Magi and the inter preters of dneams would be sure to make their im pression on a wild and distempered imagination In such a mind the flame of ambition might be easily kindled With that intent he urged the dignity of Libo s ancestors Pompey was his great grand father  Scribonia once the wife of Augustus was his aunt the two young Csesars were his relations and his house was crowded with images that displayed an illustrious line of ancestors Havmg thus inflamed his pride he contrived to engage the young man in a course of luxury and by consequence to involve him in a load of debt He watched him closely in the hour of wild profusion and in the scenes of distress that followed affecting with tender regard to be his constant companion yet lying in wait for evidence and playing the part of a friend to be at last a per nicious enemy XXVIII Having procured a competent number of witnesses and among them such of the slaves as knew their master s course of life Catus demanded an au dience of the emperor By the means of Flaccus Vescularious a Roman knight much in the conn A D 16 93 OF TACITUS denee of Tiberius he had beforehand disclosed the nature of his business The emperor refused to grant an interview and yet encouraged the informer wil ling through the same channel to receive further in telligence Libo in the mean time was raised to the dignity of prsefor He was a frequent guest at the imperial table In those convivial moments Tiberius never betrayed a symptom of suspicion With gentle expressions and looks of kindness that master of dissimulation knew how to hide the malice of his heart The follies of Libo s conduct might have been checked in the beginning but Tiberius chose to col lect materials for a future day It happened at last that one Junius who pretended to raise the dead by magic incantations was appointed at the request of Libo to exhibit the wonders of his art This man hastened with the secret to Fulcinius Trio at that time a noted informer who possessed dangerous ta lents and by any arts however pernicious wished to raiso himself into public notice Libo was cited to appear Trio applied to the consuls for a solemn hearing before the senate The fathers were convened to deliberate as the summons informed them on matters of moment and a charge of the blackest na ture XXIX Libo changed his dress In a mourning garb he went from house to house attended by a fe male train of the first distinction He importuned his friends and among them hoped to find some one willing to undertake his defence His application was without effect His friends deserted him with differ ent excuses but all from the common motive of fear On the day of trial sinking under his distress and faint with real or pretended illness he was carried in a litter to the senate house He entered the court supported by his brother At the sight of the empe ror he stretched forth his hands in the manner of a supplicant and in a pathetic tone endeavoured to conciliate favour Tiberius viewed him with a rigid and inflexible countenance He then proceeded to open the charge stating the particulars and the names 94 THE ANNALS A U C 769 of the accusers but in a style of moderation neither aggravating nor extenuating the offence XXX Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius two new accusers joined in support of the prosecution Being now four in number they could not agree among themselves which should take the lead The point was contested with much warmth Vibius at length observed that Libo came to the trial without an advocate to support him and therefore to end the dispute with his associates he undertook to detail in a plain and simple manner the heads of the charge Nothing could be more wild and extravagant than some of the articles He stated that Libo had made it a question to the fortune tellers whether he should ever be rich enough to cover with money the Appian road as far as Brundusium There Were other alle gations of the same stamp equally void of common sense or to speak more truly so weak and frivolous that they could move no passion but pity There was however one fact of a serious nature A paper was produced containing a list of the Csesars and also sev eral senators with remarks or notes which no man could decypher annexed to their names This was exhibited as the hand writing of Libo He insisted on his innocence It was proposed to put his slaves to the torture Their evidence by the estab lished rules of law was inadmissible By an ancient â ž decree of the senate it was ordained that where the master s life was in danger no slave should undergo  the question Tiberius by a master stroke of inven tion found an expedient to evade the law He di rected a sale of the slaves to be made to the public officer that the property being altered they might then be examined on a new principle unknown to former times Libo prayed an adjournment to the next day  Being returned to his own house he sent by his relation Publius Quirinius an humble petition to the emperor the answer was he must address Â the senate XXXI A party of soldiers surrounded Libo s honse and with the brutal rudeness of men insolent in an A D 16 95 OF TACITUS tbority forced their way into the vestibule deter mined to make themselves heard and seen by the family The prisoner was then at table intending to make an elegant banquet the last pleasure of his life but a mind in agony could relish nothing Dis tracted terrified he called on his servants to despatch him he laid hold of his slaves and endeavoured to force a sword into their hands The servants in agi tation made an effort to escape and in the struggle overturned the light that stood upon the table This to Libo was funereal darkness he seized the moment and gave himself two mortal stabs His groans alarmed the freedmen who crowded round their mas ter The soldiers followed and seeing him at the point of death had the decency to withdraw The prosecution however did not die with the unfortu nate victim It was resumed in the senate with un abating severity Tiberius made an end of the busi ness by declaring that if the criminal had not done justice on himself he intended notwithstanding the manifest proof of his guilt to have recommended him to the mercy of the fathers XXXII The estate of the deceased was divided among the informers Such of them as were of sena torian rank were promoted to the prsetorship without the form of an election Various motions were made in the senate Cotfa Messalinus proposed that the image of Libo should not be carried in the funeral processions of his kindred Cneius Lentulus that the surname of Drusus should be no longer assumed by the Scribonian family On the motion of Pomponius Flaccus days of public thanksgiving were voted and gifts were ordered to be presented to Jupiter Mars and Concord at the desire of Lucius Puppius Asinius Gallus Papius Mutilus and Lucius Apronius It was further decreed that the ides of September the day on which Libo despatched himself should be ob served as a festival Of these resolutions and their several authors I have thought proper to record the memory that adulation may be branded to all poste rity and that men may mark how long a servile spirit has been the canker of the commonwealth 96 A U C 769 THE ANNALS The tribe of astrologers and magicians by a decree of the senate was banished out ol Italy Two of the number suffered death namely Lucius Pituanius  and Publius Marcius The former was thrown head long from the Tarpeian rock  and the latter by or der of the consuls was executed at the sound of a trumpet on the outside of the Esquiline gate ac cording to the form prescribed by ancient usage XXXIII At the next meeting of the senate the luxury of the times became the subject of debate The business was introduced by Quintus Haterius of consular rank and Octavius Fronto who had dis charged the office of prater A law was passed pro hibiting the use of solid gold for the service of the table and further enacting that men should not dis grace themselves by the effeminate delicacy of silk apparel Fronto took a wider compass He proposed that the quantity of silver in every family the ex pense of furniture and the number of domestics should be limited by law The senators at that time did not confine themselves to the question depending before the assembly but every speaker was at liber ty to start new matter and submit to consideration whatever he thought conducive to the public good Asinius I alius rose in opposition to the opinion of Octavius Fronto  The commonwealth he said  had increased in grandeur and the wealth of indi  viduals grew with the growth of empire Nor was  this a modern innovation the same effect from the  same causes may be traced in the early period of  the commonwealth The Fabricii had their private  wealth and so had the Scipios but different in de gree Wealth is relative always in proportion to  the affluence of the times When the state was poor  frugality was the virtue of a citizen Does the em  piro flourish Individuals flourish with it In mat ters of domestic expense such as plate and retinue  the measure of economy or extravagance must be  determined by the circumstances of the family  Nothing is mean nothing superfluous but what iÂ  made so by the condition of the parties The for  tune of a senator as settled by law differs from the A D 16 97 OF TACITUS  qualifications of a Roman knight Has nature made a distinction between them No it is civil policy that draws the line and surely it is fit that they  who stand high in rank in honours and public sla  tion should live in suitable splendour not only fur nished with the necessaries but also with the ele  gancies of life High station is at best a post of  danger Will any one argue that men in office arc to drudge in business condemned to endless toil  without the means of repairing the waste of labour and without a comfort to sooth anxiety The apo logist of dissipation and luxury carried his point With an audience of congenial manners public vices deco rated with specious names were public virtues Ti berius closed the debate The times he said were not ripe for a censor but if corruption went on in creasing there would be no want of vigour to reform abuses of every kind XXXIV In the course of these debates Lucius Piso broke out with vehemence against the reigning vices of the times the spirit of intrigue that prevailed in the forum the venality of the courts of justice and the band of public informers who were ever armed with accusations and spread terror through all ranks and degrees of men For his part he abjured the city of Rome In some remote corner of the world he was determined to seek an obscure but safe retreat from he villany of abandoned men He spoke and left the senate house Tiberius heard him but not without inward mortification He endeavoured by every means in his power to appease his indignation and exerted all his interest with Piso s relations in order to dissuade him from his purpose In a short time after the same eminent person gave another proof of his firmness He had commenced a suit against Ur gulania a woman raised above the control of law by the friendship of Livia Disdaining to answer the process this haughty favourite took shelter in the im perial palace Piso persisted in his demand undis mayed by the resentment of Livia who considered his obstinacy as an affront to herself Tiberius thought fit to temporize with the passions of his mo Vol I â I 98 THE ANXALS A U C 769  ther He promised to attend the hearing of the cause in favour of Urgulania and that mark of filial com pliance he thought would not be considered as a stretch of power He set out accordingly from the palace his guards following at a distance He proceeded slowly through the streets amidst a concourse of people with an air of calm composure occasionally loitering in conver sation Piso s friends tried all in their power to make him desist from his suit but nothing could shake that resolute temper To end the controversy Livia thought good to pay the whole of his demand Piso by his firmness did honour to his character and Ti berius gained the popular applause Urgulania con tinued notwithstanding to tower above the condition of a citizen insomuch that being summoned as a witness in a matter depending before the senate her pride would not suffer her to appear A prsetor was sent to take her examination in private though by ancient usage the attendance of the vestal virgins whenever cited to give their testimony was never dispensed with either in the forum or the tribunals of justice XXXV Part of this year was remarkable for a to tal suspension of all public business Of this inactive state it would be scarce worth while to take notice if the different sentiments of Cneius Piso and Asinius Gallus did not seem to merit attention Tiberius gave notice that he intended to absent himself for some time from Rome Piso declared his opinion that in such a juncture the senate ought to attend with greater assiduity to the despatch of business The fa thers and the Roman knights might still discharge their respective functions  the dignity of the coin  monwealth required it Asinius Gallus saw with a jealous eye that his rival had taken the popular side and to counteract his design rose to oppose the mo tion  Nothing he said  could be truly great or  worthy of the Roman people unless conducted un  der the eye of the prince The affairs of state and  the great conflux of people not only from all parts  of Italy but from the provinces ought to be reserved A D 16 99 OF TACITUS  for the presence of the emperor Tiberius heard all that passed but remained silent A warm debate ensued At length the fathers agreed to adjourn all business till the prince returned to Rome XXXVI Upon another occasion the same Asinius Gallus had the spirit to clash even with the emperor He moved in form that the election of civil magi strates should take place at the end of five years that the officers who had the command of a legion and discharged that duty before they attained the prsetor ship should be declared prsetors elect without preju dice to the right of the sovereign to name twelve can didates This motion beyond all doubt had a deeper aim pointing directly at the policy of the times and the secret maxims of the court Tiberius affected to see a design to enlarge the sovereign authority and on that ground replied  that it was inconsistent with  his moderation to take upon him so vast a charge  The power to choose was a power to exclude and  the last was painful The elections even when an  nual were attended with many inconveniencies The  disappointed candidate was sure to repine at his  want of success and yet his disgrace was but of  short duration he consoled himself with hopes of bet  ter success in the following year Defer the election  for five years and the man rejected for that length  of time will find his spirit more deeply wounded  Moreover at the end of so long a period who can  answer that his character his family connexions  and his fortune will be the same To grow proud  in office is the nature of man extend his authority 4i to the space of five years and what will be the con sequence Every single magistrate will swell with  the pride of five The laws which have wisely  drawn the line will be subverted whereas at  present the time for soliciting as well as that of  enjoying public honours is fixed with precision with a republican spirit Tiberius strengthened the interests of despotism His next measure was a grant of money to certain senators whose fortunes were in ferior to their rank Nothing however in tho midst  100 THE ANNALS A U C 769 of such liberal donations struck the minds of men with so much wonder as the high tone with which he rejected the application of Marcus Hortalus a young man of distinction but embarrassed in his cir cumstances He was grandson to Hortensius the cele brated orator To prevent the extinction of that il lustrious family Augustus pressed him to marry and seconded his advice by a present of a thousand great sesterces The senate was sitting in the emperor s palace Hortalus attended Having stationed his four children before the door he rose in his place direct ing his eyes first to the statue of Hortensius among the famous orators then to the statue of Augustus and spoke to the following effect  My children con script fathers are now before you you see their  number and their helpless infancy They were not  mine by choice the command of Augustus made  me a father Let me add the merit of my ances  tors stood in so distinguished a light that the line  ought not to fail for want of issue As to myself the  distraction of the times left me nothing but difficul ties involved in distress destitute without popular  favour and above all not endowed with eloquence  that peculiar gift and fortune of my family I could  have passed my days in humble content resolved  that poverty should neither make me a disgrace te my ancestors nor a burthen to my friends The  advice of Augustus was a command I obeyed and  married Behold the issue of that alliance the pos  terity of consuls and dictators It is not the language  of vain glory that I utter it is the voice of a father  pleading for his children Receive them Csesar to your protection under your auspicious smiles  they may live to deserve your favour and to merit  public honours In the mean time let their tender  years claim compassion they are the grandchildren  of Hortensius and they were fostered by Augustus XXXVIII This speech made an impression in his favour but the inclination of the senate was sufficient to sour a temper like that of Tiberius He replied te Hortalus nearly in the following words If the trade  of begging is to be encouraged  if the poor are te A D 16 101 OP TACITUS  come hither in crowds to solicit for their children  the public funds may be exhausted and the craving  of individuals will remain unsatisfied To depart  from the question before the senate and open new  matter for the public service was no doubt the  practice of our ancestors but under that sanction  to introduce domestic concerns with a view to pri vate interest is an abuse of the privilege tending  directly to reduce the senate as well as the sove  reign to a painful dilemma Whether we comply  or refuse our consent either way we encounter pre judice Besides this mode of petitioning is not a w modest humble request it is a demand brought on  by surprise while other business is before us At  such a time the petitioner comes and with the age M and number of his children assails the passions of this assembly he does more he makes a sudden tran  sition to ourself and by violence of prayer hopes  to storm the treasury But let us remember that if  by our profusion we exhaust the public stock our  crimes must replace it You are not Hortalus now  to learn that the bounty of Augustus was his own voluntary act he gave you money but never in Mended that you should live a rent charge upon the  public By false compassion we injure the comma  nity industry will go to ruin sloth will predomi nate men will no longer depend upon themselves but having from their own conduct nothing to hope  or fear they will look to their neighbours for sup port they will first abandon their duty and then  be a burthen on the public Such were the reasonings of Tiberius His speech was well received by that class of men who are ever ready to applaud the vices no less than the virtues of their master others heard in silence or at most with a murmur of disapprobation Tiberius saw the impression on the minds of the fathers he paused and added that what he had said was a reply to Hortalus but if the senate judged it proper he was willing to give two hundred great sesterces to each of his sons The fathers expressed their thinks Hortalus made no answer perhaps through fe r or 102 THE ANNALS A U C 769 probably retaining still the spirit of his ancestors un broken by distress From this time Tiberius never relented While the house of Hortensius sunk into distress and poverty he looked on with unconcern and saw that illustrious family moulder into ruin XXXIX In the courso of this year the daring genius of a single slave well nigh involved the em pire in a civil war The name of this man was Clemens formerly retained in the service of Posthu mus Agrippa He was no sooner apprised of the death of Augustus than he conceived tho bold design of passing over to the isle of Planasia with intent by force or stratagem to carry off Agrippa and con vey him to the German army This enterprise con ceived by a slave was no indication of a grovelling mind _ He embarked on board a trading vessel deep ly laden and after a tedious passage arrived too late Agrippa was previously murdered The man was now resolved to act a nobler part Taking with him the ashes of the prince he sailed to Cosa a promon tory of Etruria and there remained concealed in the sequestered parts of the country till his hair and beard were grown into length He was of his mas ter s age and in form and stature not unlike him He began by his friends and agents to circulate a whis per that Agrippa was still living The story as is usual in the beginning of plots was helped about by clandestine arts By degrees the tools of this bold adventurer grew more hardy the weak and ignorant believed every thing and the bold and turbulent who wish for nothing so much as convulsions in the state received the news with joy and exultation While the report was gaining ground the author of it withdrew with caution from the public eye Truth he was aware is always brought to light by time and reflection while the lie of the day lives by bustle noise and precipitation The impostor was therefore resolved to keep the minds of men in a constant fer ment he visited the municipal towns but always in the dusk of the evening he went to one place he flew to another continually in motion never long any where but as soon as he made his impression A D 16 1 103 OF TACITUS leaving his fame behind him or flying before it to prepossess the people in some new quarter XL The miraculous escape of Agrippa was cur rently reported all over Italy At Rome the story was believed The impostor landed at Ostia amidst the acclamations of the rabble Clandestine meet ings were held in the capital Tiberius was thrown into the utmost perplexity Should he call forth his soldiers to subdue a slave Were it not more ad visable to leave the rumour to its own futility  On a sudden he was bent on vigorous measures and no thing was to be slighted he wavered fluctuated and to act with coolness seemed more advisable to be alarmed at trifles was unworthy of the prince The resolution of one moment gave way to the whim of the next and pride and fear alternately distracted him He resolved and decided nothing Weary of himself he left the whole to Salluslius Crispius That minister sent two of his creatures some say two soldiers to join the fictitious Agrippa as men de voted to his cause he gave them full instructions to supply him with money and profess thomselves ready â in his service to encounter every danger The men acted their parts and in the dead of night seizing their opportunity fell with a strong party upon the adventurer Having seized his person they dragged him in fetters with a gag in his mouth to the impe rial palace Being there interrogated by Tiberius  how he came to be Agrippa he is said to have an swered  as you came to be Csesar With undaunt ed resolution he refused to discover his accomplices Tiberius not choosing to hazard a public execution ordered him to be put to death in a sequestered part of the palace The body was privately conveyed away and though at the time there was reason to believe that many of the emperor s household and even several of the Roman knights and senators as sisted the impostor with their advice and money thÂ affair was dropt without further inquiry XLI Towards the end of the year a triumphal arch was erected near the Temple of Saturn in me mory of the Varian eagles retaken under the conduct 104 THK ANNA1S  A U C 76Â of Germanicus and the auspices of Tiberius Seve ral other public monuments were dedicated at the same time a temple to Fortune in the gardens on the banks of the Tiber which Julius Csesar had be queathed to the Roman people a chapel sacred to the Julian family and a statue of Augustus in the sub urbs called Bmillm In the consulship of Caius Csecilius and Lucius Pomponius Germanicus on the seventh before the calends of June enjoyed the glory of a triumph over the Cheruscans the Cattians the Angrivarians and the rest of the nations extending as far as the Elbe The spoils of the conquered the prisoners of war with various pictures of battles mountains and rivers were displayed with great pomp and splendour The war though the general was not suffered to reap the full harvest of his glory was considered by the popu lace as entirely finished Amidst the grandeur of this magnificent spectacle nothing appeared so striking as the graceful person of Germanicus with his five children mounted on the triumphal car The joy of 4 the multitude was not however without a tincture of melancholy Men remembered that Drusus the father of Germanicus was the darling of the people and yet proved unfortunate they called to mind young Marcellus blessed with all his country s wishes yet prematurely snatched away It happened they said by some fatality that whenever a favoured character was the delight of the Roman people their affec tions ended always in a general mourning XLII Tiberius gave a largess to the populace of three hundred sesterces to each man and ordered the distribution to be made in the name of Germanicus at the same time declaring himself his colleague in the consulship for the ensuing year These marks of good will were specious but by no man thought sin cere He was now resolved to remove the favourite of the people This however was to be done under colour of new honours He framed a pretence or took advantage of that which the posture of affairs presented to him Archelaus during a space of fifty years had swayed the sceptre of Cappadocia but A D 16 J OF TACITUS had the misfortune of being upon bad terms with the emperor who during his residence in the Isle of Rhodes had taken umbrage at the king s behaviour and from that moment harboured the deepest resent ment Archelaus it is true had shown him no mark of respect but that inattention did not originate in pride or arrogance It was the conduct recom mended by the confidential friends of Augustus at a time when Caius Csesar flourishing in favour was sent to arrange the affairs of the east In that junc ture to court the friendship of Tiberius would have been highly impolitic After the failure bf the Csesarian line and the ele vation of Tiberius letters to the eastern prince were despatched from the emperor s mother avowing her son s resentment but offering an entire remission of past offences provided he came in person to solicit his pardon Archelaus did not perceive the intended treachery or perceiving it thought it prudent to dis semble He risqued a journey to Rome Tiberius received him with pride and sullen aver sion The king of Cappadocia was arraigned before the senate and though he charge was without foundation a royal mind not used to acknowledge an equal much less to bend to the humiliating condition of a state criminal was naturally pierced to the quick Worn out with grief and drooping under the infirmi ties of age the unhappy monarch died of a broken heart or perhaps fell by his own hand His kingdom was reduced to a Roman province With this new source of wealth Tiberius declared himself able to di minish the tax of the hundredth penny and accordingly changed it to the two hundredth About this time died Antiochus and Philopater the former king of Commagena and the latter of Cilicia By their deaths their kingdoms were thrown into violent convulsions Two factions were at variance one which formed a largo majority was willing to submit to the govern ment of Rome the other contended for the independ ence of their monarchy In the same juncture the provinces of Syria and Judsea prayed to be relieved from the burden of oppressive taxes 106 A U C 770 THE ANNALS XLIII This state of affairs and the commotions in Armenia which have been already mentioned Tibe rius laid before the senate His conclusion was that to settle the troubles of the east recourse must be had to the wisdom of Germanicus As to himself he was now in the vale of years and Dnisus had neither ma turity of age nor experience The provinces beyond the Mediterranean were by a decree of the senate committed to Germanicus He was made commander in chief with supreme authority wherever he went over all other governors whether appointed by lot or the will of the prince At that time Creticus Silanus was the governor of Syria Ho had promised his daughter in marriage to Nero the eldest son of Ger manicus For that reason Tiberius recalled him from the province and in his place appointed Cneius Piso a man of violent passions impatient of control and fierce with all the spirit of his father that famous re publican who in the civil wars took up arms against Julius Csesar and rekindled the flame in Africa After that exploit he followed the fortunes of Bru tus and Cassius Being at length restored to hii country he disdained all public offices till Augustus prevailed upon him to accept of the consulship To the pride derived from such a father the son united the insolence of wealth acquired by his marriage with Plancina who besides her high descent possessed immoderate riches Proud of that connexion Piso thought himself scarcely second to Tiberius The emperor s sons were beneath his rank The govern ment of Syria he made no doubt was given to him as a bar to the hopes of Germanicus For this pur pose secret instructions were at the time said to have been given to him by Tiberius Plancina it is certain had her lesson from Livia with full instruction to mortify the pride of Agrippina with all the arts of fe male emulation The court of Tiberius divided between Drusus and Germanicus was a scene of domestic faction The emperor as was natural gave the preference to his own immediate issue but the preference had no other effect than that of attaching the friends of Germani A D 17 107 OF TACITUS cus more warmly to his interest They considered him by the maternal line of higher birth than Dru sus Marc Antony was his grand father and Augus tus Csesar his great uncle On the other hand Pom ponius Atticus the great grand father of Drusus hav ing never risen above the rank of a Roman knight seemed to tarnish the lustre of the Claudian line The merit of Agrippina weighed greatly in the scale She had brought to Germanicus a numerous offspring and her character free from blemish placed her in a point of view superior to the younger Livia the wifo of Drusus The two brothers amidst the heat of con tending parties lived in perfect harmony their friends were at variance but the princes loved each other XLIV Drusus was soon after sent to command the army in Illyricum In that school of military science he might improve in the ert of war and gain the af fections of the army The camp Tiberius thought would wean a young man from the dissolute man ners of the capital He had still another motive while his two sons were at the head of the legions he might live in security free from danger and every possible alarm But the ostensible reason for the ex pedition of Drusus was an application from the Sue vians praying the assistance of Rome against the Cheruscans who had turned their disappointed rage against their countrymen The fact was Germany being at thai time evacuated by the Romans the dif ferent nations of that country no longer dreading a foreign invasion began according to the genius of barbarians to quarrel among themselves The pre sent difference was a struggle for power between two rival states The strength on each side was nearly equal the abilities of the chiefs much upon a balance but the name of king was detested by the Suevians and by consequence Maroboduus was unpopular On the opposite side Arminius the champion of li berty was the idol of his country XLV Arminius took the field at the head of a con siderable army The Cheruscans and a large body of allies accustomed to fight under him followed his standard To these were added the Semnonss and 108 A U C 770 THE ANNALS the Langobards two Suevian nations revolted from Maroboduus By this defection the superiority had been decidedly with Arminius had not Ihguiomer  thrown his whole weight into the opposite scale For this conduct the pride of the man was the exciting motive Arminius was the son of Inguiomer s brother and the uncle now a veteran soldier disdained to serve under his nephew and obey the orders of a boy The two armies were drawn up in order of battle on both sides equal ardour and equal hopes of victory The Germans no longer carried on a desultory war in detached parties and irregular bodies their long conflict with the Romans had made them soldiers Discipline was introduced they followed the colours they supported the broken ranks and with prompt alacrity obeyed the word of command Arminius appeared on horseback rushed through the ranks and animating his men to deeds of valour He con gratulated them on the recovery of their liberty he gloried in the slaughter of Varus and his legions he pointed to the spoils of victory and the Roman wea pons then in hands of numbers he called JYIarobo  duus a coward and a fugitive who never fleshed his sword in battle but fled for shelter to the Hercynian forest where by negotiation by bribes and embassies he patched up an ignominious peace A traitor to his country and the slave of Csesar he was more an object of vengeance than Varus and his legions He conjured them to remember the battles they had fought and the glorious issue of all their labours  The Romans he said have abandoned Germany  they are exterminated and if men desire to know  who were the conquerors the event of the war will  tell XLVI Maroboduus in the mean time was not in active Of himself he talked in magnificent terms and of the enemy with contempt and indignation Holding Inguiomer by the hand  Behold he said  in this brave warrior the support and glory of the  Cheruscan lame To him they are indebted for the  success of their arms Arminius had no share in the conduct of the war a rash presumptuous man A D 17 109 OF TACITUS  without knowledge or experience he tears the laurel  from another s brow and founds his merit on fraud  and murder he fell by surprise upon three legions  and put an unsuspecting general with his whole  army to the sword All Germany has had reason to  rue the carnage of that day nor has Arminius any  thing to boast His wife and his son are languishing  in Roman chains Has my conduct producedsodread  ful a catastrophe Tiberius at the head of twelve legions advanced against me but the glory of the  German name suffered no diminution The peace K which followed was made on equal terms For that  treaty I have no reason to blush Hostilities were  suspended and you gained time to deliberate which  was most advisable war with Rome or a safe and  honourable peace The two armies were in this manner animated by their respective chiefs The several nations added their own private motives The Cheruscans took the field to maintain their ancient glory and the Langobards to defend their liberty recently recovered The Suevians aimed at an extension of territory No battle was ever fought with more inflamed resent ment and none with such equivocal success The right wing on both sides were put to flight A deci sive action was expected  when Maroboduus drew off his forces and encamped on the neighbouring hills  acknowledging by his retreat tho superior strength of tile enemy Desertion in a little time thinned his army He retired into the country of tho Marcoma nians and thence sent a deputation to Tiberius in hopes of obtaining succours The emperor s answer was that Maroboduus in the late war with the Che ruscans had given the Romans no assistance  there was therefore no pretence for the present application Drusus notwithstanding was despatched in the man ner already mentioned to secure the frontiers from the incursions of the enemy and to maintain the tran quillity of the empire XLV1I In the course of this year twelve principal cities in Asia were destroyed by an earthquake The calamity happened in the nipht and was for that Vol l â K 1 10  THE ANNALS A U C 770 reason the more disastrous no warning given and by consequence no time to escape The open fields in such dreadful convulsions are the usual refuge but J the earth opening in various places all who attempted to fly were buried in the yawning caverns Hills are said to have sunk and valleys rose to mountains Quick flashes of lightning showed all the horrors of the scene The city of Sardes suffered most and was relieved in proportion to the distress of the inhabi tants Besides a remission for five years of all taxes whether due to the public treasury or the coffers of the prince Tiberius promised a supply of one hun dred thousand great sesterces The city of Magnesia situate near mount Sipylus suffered in the next de gree and was considered accordingly The inhabi tants of Temnos Philadelphia Egcoa and Apollonia with the cities of Hierocsesarea Myrina Cyme Tmo lus as also the Mosthenians and the people called the Macedonians of Hyrcania were for the like term of five years exempted from all manner of imposts The senate resolved to send a person of their own order  to make an estimate of the mischief and grant suita  ble relief The affairs of Asia were at that time ad ministered by a man of consular dignity To avoid the jnalousy incident to officers of equal rank Mar cus Aletus who had risen no higher than the office of prsetor was the person commissioned to superin tend the business XLVIII Besides these acts of public munificence Tiberius showed in matters of a private nature Â spirit of liberality that did him the highest honour The estate of Emilia Musa who was possessed of a large fortune and died intestate leaving no lawful heir was claimed to the prince s use by the officer of the imperial exchequer Tiberius renounced his right in favour of iEmilius Lepidus who seemed to stand in some degree of relation to the deceased He gave up in like manner the rich possessions of Patuleius a Roman knight and though a considerable legacy was left to himself he resigned the whole to Marcus Servllius upon the ground of a former will duly at tested in which gervilius was constituted sols heir A D 17 or tacitm 111 For this disinterested conduct the reason assigned was that the dignity of two such illustrious citizens deserved to be supported In general it was a rule with Tiberius in all cases where he had no previous title from connexion or friendship not to accept any property as testamentary heir When humour ca price or passion induced a stranger to dismherit his kindred and make a disposition in favour of the prince he declared it an inofficious testament To honest and virtuous poverty he often showed himself a friend to prodigality he was an inflexible enemy In the class of spendthrifts he considered Vibidius Varro Marius Nepos Appius Appianus Cornelius Sylla and Quintus Vitellius These men undone by their own extravagance were either expelled the se nate or allowed to vacate their seats XLIX The plan undertaken by Augustus for the building of temples in the room of such as had been injured by time or damaged by fire was now com pleted Tiberius dedicated the various structures of their respective deities one near the Great Circus to  Bacchus Proserpine and Ceres originally raised in consequence of a vow made by Aulus Posthumius the dictator a temple to Flora near the same place formerly dedicated by Lucius and Marcus Publicius during their sedileship  another to Janus in the herb market founded by Caius Duillius the first who by a naval victory added lustre to the Roman name and triumphed over the Carthaginians The temple of Hope vowed by Atilius in the same Punic war was dedicated by Germanicus L Meanwhile the law of violated majesty went on with increasing fury A prosecution founded on that cruel device was set on foot against ApureiaVa rilia descended from a sister of Augustus and grand niece to that emperor She was charged with speaking defamatory words to the dishonour of Au justus and uttering sharp invectives against Tiberius and his mother Adultery was another head of ac cusation  though related to the C sarian family she had by her licentious conduct brought disgrace on that illustrious name The last article was thrown 112 THE ANNALS A U C 770 out of the case as a matter within the provisions of the Julian law With regard to her calumnious lan guage Tiberius desired that a distinction might be  made If it appeared in proof that she had spoken irreverently of Augustus the law he said should take its course  but personalities levelled at himself might pass with impunity A question was put by the conr sul touching tho liberties taken with the emperor s mother Tiberius made no reply At the nexi meeting of the senate he informed the fathers that words affecting Livia were by her own desire never to be imputed as a crime Varilia was acquitted on the law of majesty With regard to the charge of adultery Tiberius requested the fathers to soften the rigour of their sentence In conformity to ancient practice he was of opinion that the relations of the offender might remove her to the distance of two hun dred miles from Rome This mode of punishment was adopted Manlius her paramour was banished from Italy and Africa LI The office of prator becoming vacant by the death of Vipsanius Gallus the appointment of a suc cessor gave occasion to a warm and eager contest Haterius Agrippa nearly related to Germanicus was declared a candidate Drusus and Germanicus both still at Rome espoused his interest It was however a settled rule that the person who had the greatest number of children should be deemed to have the su perior title From this line of decision many of the lathers were unwilling to depart Tiberius saw with inward satisfaction the senate wavering between tho law and the wishes of his sons The law as may be imagined proved too feeble The two princes car ried the question though not without a strong con tention and by a small majority This however was no more than what often happened in better times when laws were still in force but had to strug gle with power and were often obliged to yield to superior interest L1I By the spirit of a bold and daring adventurer a war was this year kindled up in Africa This man a Numidian by birth and known by the name of Tac A D 17 113 OF TACITUS farinas had served in the Roman camp among the auxiliary troops He deserted afterwards and col lected together a body of freebooters accustomed to live by rapine and by consequence addicted to a life of warfare Tacfarinas had acquired some rudiments of military discipline He formed his rash levied numbers into companies of foot and squadrons of horse Having drawn over to his party the Musula nians a nation bordering on the wilds of Africa where they led a roving life without towns or fixed habitations he was no longer the chief of a band of robbers but with a higher title the general of a peo ple The neighbouring Moors a race of savages under the command of Mazippa jqined the confe deracy The two chiefs agreed to divide their troops into two separate bodies Tacfarinas with the flower of the army formed a regular camp arming his men after the Roman manner and training them to the art of war while Mazippa at the head of his light armed freebooters ravaged the country and marked his way with fire and sword The Cinithians a na tion by no means contemptible were forced to enter into the league At length Furius Camillus proconsul of Africay advanced to check the insurgents at the head of a legion and such of the allies as still remained under his command With this handful of men a slender force when compared to the numbers of the Moors and Numidians the Roman general determined to hazard a decisive action His chief care was not to strike the enemy with terror Their fears he knew would make them avoid an action and protract the wax The barbarians hoped to gain an easy victory and by their hopes were led on to their destruction Camillus drew up in order of battle His legion form ed the centre  in the wings were stationed the light cohorts and two squadrons of horse Nor did Tac farinas decline the conflict He engaged and was to tally routed By this victory the name of Camillus after an interval of many years seemed to retrieve its ancient honours From him who was the deliverer of Rome and his son who emulated the father s exr K 2 114 THE ANNALS A TJ C 77t ample all military fame was transplanted to other families till Camillus the conqueror of Tacfarinas once more revived the glory of his ancestors but he did it without their talents He had seen no service nor was he considered as an officer Tiberius for that reason was the more lavish in his praise Triumphal ornaments were decreed to him by the senate nor was he afterwards ruined by his merit His moder ation and the simplicity of his manners screened him from envy He enjoyed his honours with impu nity LIII Tiberius and Germanicus were joint consuls for the following year the former for the third time and the latter for the second Germanicus in this juncture was absent from Rome at the city of Nico polis in Achaia He had passed into Dalmatia on a visit to his brother Drusus From that place he sailed along the coast of Illyricum and after a tempestuous voyage in the Adriatic and the Ionian seas arrived at Nocopolis where he was invested with his new digni ty Hia fleet had suffered and took some days to refit for sea In the mean time he seized the opportunity to view the Bay of Aetium rendered famous by the great naval victory at that place He saw the tro phies consecrated by Augustus and the lines of Marc Antony s camp To him who was grand nephew to Augustus and grandson to Marc Antony the scene was interesting Every object reminded him of his ancestors and every circumstance awakened those tender sensations in which the heart unites regret and pleasure From Nicopolis he proceeded to Athens In that city the seat of valour and Of literature and for many years in alliance with Rome he showed his respect for the inhabitants by appearing without pomp attended only by a single lictor The Greeks exhausted their invention to do him honour inge nious in the arts of flattery they took care to blend with their compliments frequent mention of the re nowned exploits and memorable sayings of their an cestors  and thus by enhancing their own merit they thought they gave refinement and even value to adulation A D 18 116 OF TACITUS LIV From Athens Germanicus sailed to the island of Eubcea and thence to Lesbos where Agrippina was delivered of a daughter called Julia the last of her children From Lesbos he pursued his voyage along the coast of Asia and after visiting Perinthus and Byzantium two cities of Thrace sailed through the straits of the Propontic into the Euxine Sea led by curiosity to visit places renowned in story In his pro gress he attended every where to the complaints of the inhabitants whom he found distracted by their own intestine divisions or labouring under the tyran ny of the magistrates He redressed grievances and established good order wherever he went On his return from the Euxine he intended to visit Samothraeia famous for its rites and mysteries but the wind springing up from the north he was obliged to bear away from the coast He viewed the ruins of Troy and the remains of antiquity in that part of the world renowned for so many turns of fortune the theatre of illustrious actions and the origin of the Roman people He landed next at Colophon to con sult the oracle of the Clarian Apollo The responses at this place were not delivered like those at Delphos by a Pythian maid a priest officiates chosen by cus tom out of certain privileged families and generally a citizen of Miletus From such as apply to him he requires nothing but their number and their names Content with these particulars he descends into a cavern and after drinking from a secret spring though untinctured with learning and a stranger to poetry he breaks out in a strain of enthusiastic verse on the subject of every man s hopes and fears He is said to have foretold the approaching fate of Ger manicus but in the oracular style dark and enigma tical LV Piso in the mean time impatient to execute his evil purposes made his entry into Athens and with the tumult of a rude and disorderly train alarm ed the city In a public speech he thought fit to de claim against the inhabitants obliquely glancing at Germanicus who he said by ill judged condescen sions had impaired the dignity of the Roman name 116 A U C 77I THE ANNALS The civility of the prince he said was shown not to the men of Athens a race long since extirpated but to a vile heterogeneous mass the scum of various nations at one time in league with Mithridates against Sylla and afterwards with Marc Antony against Au gustus Ho went back to the times of Philip of Mace don  condemning in terms of reproach not only their feeble exertions in their struggle with that mo narch but also the ingratitude of a giddy populace to their best and ablest citizens To this behaviour Piso was instigated by a private pique against the Athe nians It happened that one Theophilus was con demned for forgery by the judgment of the Areopa gus Piso endeavoured to gain a pardon for this man but that upright judicature was inflexible After this prelude to the scenes which he was still to act Piso embarked and after a quick passage through the Cyclades arrived at Rhodes While he lay at the mouth of the harbour a storm arose and drove the vessel on the point of a rock Germanicus was then at Rhodes He knew the hostilities that had been already commenced against himself and might have left a man of that dangerous character to the mercy of the winds and waves but acting with his usual benevolence he sent off boats and galleys to save even an enemy from destruction Gratitude was not in the character of Piso He spent but a single day with his benefactor and to take his measures be forehand proceeded on his way to Syria Having reached that place he began by bribery by intrigue and cabals to draw to himself the affections of the le gions He caressed the lowest of the soldiers he dis missed the centurions of approved experience and removed all the tribunes who supported military disci pline  substituting in their room his own dependants and still worse the vile and profligate who had no thing but their crimes to recommend them Sloth prevailed in the camp licentiousness diffused itself through the cities and over the face of the country nothing was seen but a dissipated and disorderly band of soldiers By these practices Piso rose into A D i8 OF TACITUS in popularity insomuch that he was hailed the Father of the Legions His wife Plancina forgot the decencies of the female character She attended the troops in the field she reviewed the cavalry she railed with spleen and ma lice against Agrippina and did not even spare Ger manieus This behaviour it was generally believed had the approbation and countenance of Tiberius The consequence was that not only the weak and profligate were alienated from Germanicus but even the men of sober conduct who were inclined to re main in their duty went in a short time to pay their homage to the favourites of the emperor LVI Germanicus was fully apprised of these pro ceedings  but Armenia claimed his first attention He hastened without loss of time to regulate the affairs of that kingdom where caprice and levity marked the national character and the situation of the country encouraged the inconstancy of the people Armenia borders a great length of way upon the Roman pro vinces then stretches to a vast extent as far as the territory of the Medes Hemmed in by two great em pires that of Parthia and of Rome the Armenians are never steady to either but with their natural levity alternately at variance with each with the Romans from rooted aversion with the Parthians from motives of ambition and national jealousy In the present juncture the throne was vacant Vo nones being expelled the wishes of the people were fixed on Zeno the son of Polemon king of Pontus The young prince had shown from his earliest youth a decided inclination to Armenian manners The sports of the chase were his favourite amusement he delighted in carousing festivals and all the pastimes of savage life For these qualities he was high in esteem not only with the populace but also the grandees of the nation In this disposition of men s minds Germanicus entered the city of Artaxata and amidst the acclamations of the people placed the diadem on the head of Zeno The Armenians paid homage to their new master in the ardour of their zeal proclaiming him king by the name of Artaxias 118 THE ANNALS A U C 771 in allusion to the place of his coronation About the same time the Cappadocians who had been reduced I to the form of a province received Quintus Veranius as their governor The first measure of his adminis tration was to remit part of the taxes heretofore paid to their kings that from so mild a beginning the people might conceive a favourable idea of Roman moderation The Comagenians in like manner sub mitted to the government of a prsetor and Quintus Servseus was appointed to the office LVII In this manner tranquillity was established in the east The events were important and such as might have given Germanicus reason to congratulate himself but his joy was poisoned by the repeated hostilities and the insolence of Fiso This man had orders to march with a detachment of the legions into Armenia or at his option to give the command to his son He complied in neither instance The prince met him at Cyrrum the winter quarters of the tenth legion At that place they came to an inter view both with countenances adjusted to the occa  sion Piso with an air of intrepidity still disdaining a superior and Germanicus with the serenity of a man who wished to stifle his resentment The gen tle qualities of his nature inclined him at all times to moderation but his friends with the ulSual talent of men who love to make bad worse inflamed the quar rel They aggravated what was true they gave colour to falsehood  and omitted nothing to the disad vantage of Piso Plancina and their sons In the presence of a few select friends Germanicus came to an explanation  his language was in that measured style which anger and prudence combating each other usually inspire Piso made an arrogant apology The meeting broke up and both retired with smothered resentment From this time Piso rarely attended the tribunals of justice whenever he appeared in court his countenance plainly discovered ill will and sullen discontent At a banquet given by the Nabathean king a sudden expression fell from him and betrayed his real temper Golden crowns were presented to the company two for Germanicus A D 19 119 OF TACITUS and Agrippina were of a ponderous size while those for Piso and the rest were of inferior value Piqued at the distinction Piso exclaimed This feast is made  for the son of a Roman prince not of a Parthian  king In the instant he threw the present made to himself with peevish contempt on the ground de claiming with bitterness against the growth of luxury Germanicus heard his rude invective but still re mained master of himself LVIII About this time arrived ambassadors from Artabanus king of the Parthians with instructions to mention in terms of respect the ancient alliance between Rome and Parthia and the desire of the mo narch to renew their former friendship As an ear nest of respect for Germanicus Artabanus was willing to advance to an interview as far as the Euphrates  but he made it a condition that Vonones should be removed from Syria where his residence in the neighbourhood of Parthia gave him an opportunity to carry on secret negotiations with the nobles of the realm and in time to stir up a revolt Germanicus answered with condescension yet with dignity Of the alliance between Rome and Parthia he spoke with due regard and the royal visit he considered as an honour to himself Vonones was removed to Pornpeiopolis on the coast of Cilicia not so much to comply with the demands of the Parthian king as to curb the insolence of Piso then linked in ties of friendship with the exiled prince who had contrived by marks of respect and magnificent presents to pur chase the favour of Plancina LIX In the consulship of Marcus Silanus and Lu cius Norbanus Germanicus made a progress into Egypt to view the monuments of antiquity so much celebrated in that country For this journey the good of the province was his pretext In fact by opening the public granaries he reduced the price of corn and by pursuing popular measures he gained the good will of the inhabitants He appeared in public without a guard his feet uncovered after the Greek fashion and the rest of his apparel was also Greek In these particulars he took for his model 120 A U C 772 THE ANNALS the conduct of Publius Scipio who we are told did the same in Sicily while Rome was still convulsed by the distractions of the Punic war Tiberius as soon as he received advices from Egypt condemned this affectation of foreign manners but without asperity Another point appeared to him of greater moment Arrfong the rules established by Augustus it was a maxim of state policy that Egypt should be consider ed as forbidden ground which neither the senators nor the Roman knights should presume to tread without the express permission of the prince This was no doubt a wise precaution It was seen that whoe v er made himself master of Alexandria with the strong holds which by sea and land were the keys of the whole province might with a small force make head against the power of Rome and by blocking up that plentiful cor n country reduce all Italy to a fa mine Gcrmanicus without authority had entered Alexandria  and this to the jealous temper of Tibe rius was little short of a state crime LX Meanwhile Germanicus little suspecting hat he had incurred the emperor s displeasure determined to sail up the Nile He set out from Canopus a city built by the Spartans in memory of a pilot of that name who was buried on the spot at the time when Menelaus on his return from Troy was driven by adverse winds on the coast of Libya From Canopus the next place of note was a mouth of the river dedi cated to Hercules who was born as the inhabitants contend in that country He was according to them the first of the heroic line and his name being made another term for virtue was by the voice of succeeding ages bestowed on all who emulated the example of the Egyptian worthy Germanicus pro ceeded to the magnificent ruins of the city of Thebes where still was to be seen on ancient obelisks a pom pous description in Egyptian characters of the wealth and grandeur of the place From the account of an elderly priest who was desired to interpret the hieroglyphics of his country it appeared that Thebes at one time contained within her walls no less than seven hundred thousand men capable of bearing arms A D 19 121 or TACITUS Hat the whole army was called forth into the field by Rhamses one of the kings of Egypt and under the auspices of that monarch overran all Libya Ethiopia and in their progress subdued the Medes and Persians the Bactrians and the Scythians with the extensive regions inhabited by the Syrians the Armenians and their neighbours the Cappadocians By this conquest a tract of country extending from Bithynia on the Pontic Sea to the coast of Lycia in the Mediterranean was reduced to subjection The inscription further stated the tribute payed by the conquered nations the specific weight of gold and silver the quantity of arms the number of horses the offerings of ivory and of rich perfumes presented to the temples of Egypt the measure of grain and the various supplies administered by every nation making altogether a prodigious revenue no way in ferior to the taxes of late years collected either by Parthian despotism or the authority of Rome LXI In a country abounding with wonders the curiosity of Germanicus was not easily satisfied He saw the celebrated statue of Memnon which though wrought in stone when played upon by the rays of the sun returns a vocal sound He visited the pyra mids those stupendous structures raised by the emu lation of kings at an incredible expense amidst a waste of sands almost impassable He saw the pro digious bason formed by the labour of man to re ceive the overflowings of the Nile  and in other parts of the river where the channel is narrowed he ob served a depth of water so profound that the curio sity of travellers has never been able to explore the bottom The prince proceeded as far as Elphantine and Scyend the boundaries formerly of the Roman empire though now extended as far as the Red Sea LXII While Germanicus passed the summer in visiting the provinces of Egypt Drusus by his able conduct in Pannonia acquired no small degree of re putation He had the address to make the Germans turn their hostilities against themselves The power of Maroboduus was in its wane and his countrymen were by consequence encouraged io complete the Voli l â L 122 THE ANNALS A U C 772 ruin of that unfortunate prince Catualda a young man of rank who was formerly compelled by the in justice of Maroboduus to fly his country had taken  refuge among the Gothones The season of revenge  was at length arrived At the head of a strong force he entered the territory of the Marcomanians Hav ing seduced the leading nobles to his party he stormed the royal palace and took by assault a strong castle nearly adjoining where the Suevians had been ac customed to deposit their plunder A considerable booty fell into his hands He found besides a num ber of victuallers and traders from the Roman pro vinces  men who had been attracted to that part of the world by the liberty allowed to commerce and by the love of lucre were induced to remain till by force of habit they lost all remembrance of their native land LXIII Maroboduus finding himself deserted by his people had no resource but in the friendship of Tiberius He crossed the Danube where that river washes the confines of Noricum and thence sent his despatches to Rome not in the humble style of a prince driven from his throne but even in ruin with an elevation of mind worthy of his former grandeur The substance of his letter was that the nations who knew his fame in arms had made him offers of friend ship but he chose rather to rely on the protection of the Romans Tiberius promised him a safe retreat in Italy  with liberty if his affairs took a favourable turn to withdraw whenever his interest should invite him To the fathers he talked a different language Philip of Macedon he said was not so much to be dreaded by the Athenians nor Pyrrhus or Antio chus by the Roman people His speech on this oc casion is still extant we there find him magnifying the fortitude of the German chief and the ferocity of the nations over which he reigned with absolute power He sets forth the danger of a powerful enemy so near the Roman frontier and applauds himself for the wisdom of the measures that brought on the ruin of a great and warlike prince Maroboduus was re ceived at Ravenna and there held up to the Suevians A D 19 123 OF TACITUS if they dared to commence hostilities as a prince that might once more ascend the throne In the space however of eighteen years Maroboduus never once stirred out of Italy He grew gray in indolence and clinging too long to a wretched life survived his re putation Catualda experienced a like reverse of fortune and found no better refuge The Hermundurians led on by Vibillius their chief expelled him from the throne The Romans fixed his residence at Foro Julium a colony in Narbon Gaul The barbarians who fol lowed the fortunes of the two exiled kings were not suffered to incorporate with the people of the pro vinces  but to prevent the danger that might otherwise shake the public tranquillity were conducted beyond the Danube where they had allotments of land be tween the rivers Marus and Cusus under the com mand of Vannius a man born in the Quadian nation and by Tiberius made king of the colony LXIV The elevation of Artaxias to the throne of Armenia being about this time known at Rome the senate decreed the lesser triumph to Drusus and Ger mantcus Triumphal arches were raised near the Temple of Mars the avenger and the statues of the two princes were placed in a conspicuous point of view Tiberius rejoiced at these events and the more so as they were the effect of policy not of con quest By the same insidious arts he now began to plan the destruction of Rhescuporis king of Thrace Rhsemetalces at one time reigned sole monarch over that whole country After his death Augustus made a partition of the kingdom assigning to Rhescuporis the late king s brother one moiety and the other to Cotys son of the deceased monarch In this division of the kingdom the cultivated parts of the country the fertile vales and flourishing cities that lay conti guous to Greece fell to the share of Cotys the wild and barren places which were open to hostile incur sions were allotted to Rhescuporis The genius of the two kings resembled their s6il the milder virtues distinguished the character of Cotys ferocity ambi tion rapine and impatience of an equal were the 124 THE ANNAI A U C 772 prominent features of Rhescuporis The princes pre served at first a show of mutual concord in time Rhescuporis began to encroach on his nephew not indeed with open violence as he knew that Augustus the founder of both kingdoms might likewise prove the avenger of wrongs During that emperor s life he concealed his designs but he no sooner heard that Rome had changed masters than he threw off the mask and avowed his ambition With a band of freebooters he ravaged the country razed to the ground the strong holds and castles and by every act of hostility provoked a war LXV To keep things which were once settled in the same unaltered state was the principal care that occupied the anxious spirit of Tiberius He despatch ed a centurion to restrain the Thracian kings from an open rupture Cotys disbanded his forces Rhescu poris resolved to act with craft and subtlety He pro posed a conference which he had no doubt would terminate all their differences The time and place were fixed a negotiation was opened both pridces seeming willing to remove all difficulties Cotyj brought to the meeting a conciliating spirit the un cle meditated a stroke of perfidy To ratify the pre liminaries he proposed a banquet The parties met and protracted their festivity to a late hour of the night Amidst the joys of wine and in the moment of revelry Rhescuporis attacked his nephew unsus pecting and unprovided The deluded prince urged in vain the rights of kings the laws of hospitality and the gods of their forefathers He was loaded with irons His treacherous uncle made himself master of all Thrace and immediately sent despatches to in form Tiberius that a dangerous conspiracy against his life had been defeated by timely vigilance In the mean time under colour of an enterprise against the Basternians and the Scythians he made levies of hflrse and foot determined at all events to be pre pared for a defensive war LXVI Tiberius returned for answer that his con duct if found to be free from reproach would be his best protection but neither the senate nor the em A D 19  OF TACITUS 125 peror could prejudge the cause  the guilt or the in nocence of men must arise out of the facts He add ed that Rhescuporis would do well to release his nephew and make the best of his way to Rome in order to fix the criminality where it ought to fall A letter to this effect from the emperor was forwarded to the Thracian king of Latinius Pandus prsetor of My sia A band of soldiers went at the same time to demand that Cotys should be delivered into their cus tody Rhescuporis divided between hope and fear fluctuated for some time  he choose at length rather to answer for an actual crime than for the bare inten tion He murdered Cotys and spread a report that he died by his own hand Tiberius heard the news without emotion determined still to pursue his plan of fraud and treachery Latinius Pandus died in the interval Rhescuporis had always represented him as his inveterate enemy but the government of Mysia being now vacant Tiberius gave the administration of the province to Pomponius Flaccus a man of mili tary experience and upon the best terms with Rhes i cuporis A friend he knew might prove in the end the most fatal enemy That consideration determined lis choice LXVII Flaccus without loss of time arrived in Thrace He found Rhescuporis in a state of violent agitation conscious of his guilt and overwhelmed with doubt and fear He soothed him with gracious words and by plausible promises inveigled him to hazard his person within the lines of a Roman garri son Pretending there to do honour to the prince he appointed a guard to attend him The tribunes and centurions enticed him to go forward under their pro tection till having drawn him a considerable way they avowed their purpose and Rhescuporis found that he was a prisoner in close custody Ho was conducted to Rome where the widow of Cotys ac cused him before the senate His guilt was manifest  the senate decreed that he should pass the remainder of his days at a distance from his dominions The kingdom of Thrace was once more divided Rha3 metaloes son of the deposed king and always adverse L2

undertook the government of the kingdom in trust for the heir of Cotys according to the precedent of former times when the senate sent Marcus Lepidus to administer the affairs of Egypt in the capacity of regent and guardian to the children of Ptolemy Rhescuporis was conveyed to Alexan dria and there attempting to make his escape or perhaps unjustly charged with that design he was seized and put to death LXVIII About the same time Vonones who as has been mentioned was detained in Cilicia made a like attempt but with no better success Having corrupted the guards he intended to push his way into Armenia and thence to the Albanians and He niochians flattering himself that he should be able to penetrate into Scythia and there obtain protection from the reigning king who was his near relation With this intent he went on a hunting party and having watched his opportunity betook himself to flight Turning off from the sea coast he struck into the woods and rode at full speed towards the river Pyramus The inhabitants on the first alarm de molished the bridges The river was not fordable Vonones was found wandering along the banks and by order of Vibius Fronto the commander of the ca valry loaded with fetters He did not long survive Remnius a resumed veteran had been entrusted with the custody of his person This man in a sud den transport of pretended passion drew his sword and ran the unhappy prince through the body The secret cause of this violent act cannot now be ascer tained  the general opinion was that the soldier had been bribed to favour the king s escape and rather than be detected as an accomplice choose to be an assassin LXIX Germanicus on his return from Egypt found all his regulations in the civil as well as the mi litary line totally abolished or changed to a system directly contrary to his intentions Hence  new A D 19 OF TACITUS 127 source of dissension He condemned the conduct of Piso and in return met with nothing but contumacy and a spirit of opposition to all his measures Piso was at length determined to evacuate Syria hearing however that Germanicus was attacked by a sud den illness he changed his resolution He had soon after the mortification of learning that the disorder was abated At Antioch the news diffused a general joy The people of that place had offered vows for the recovery of the prince and having obtained the object of their wishes began by solemn rites to dis charge the obligations which they had imposed upon themselves Enraged at this proceeding Piso inter rupted the ceremonies by his lictors he drove the victims from the altars he spread terror and con fusion through the temples and dispersed the con gregation After this exploit he withdrew to Seleu cia At that place having advice that Germanicus was relapsed he resolved to make some stay in ex pectation of the event The prince suspected that poison had been secretly conveyed by Piso and that idea added to the malignity of his disorder A discovery was made of a singular nature Un der the floor and in the cavities of the walls a col lection of human bones was found with charms and magic verses and incantations The name of Ger manicus was graved on plates of lead fragments of human bodies not quite consumed to ashes were discovered in a putrid condition with a variety of those magic spells which according to the vulgar opinion are of potency to devote the souls of the living to the infernal gods Amidst the confusion oc casioned by these extraordinary circumstances mes sengers were sent by Piso to inquire after the health of Germanicus but those men were considered as spies who came to watch for intelligence LXX Germanicus was informed of all that passed Fear and indignation took possession of him by turns  If my doors he said  are to be besieged by my  enemies if interlopers are to see me at the pomt of 4 expiration what is the prospect that my wife has  before her  and what are my children to expect 128 A U C 772 THE

legions But  Germanicus is not yet deserted by all his enemies  may still have reason to repent and the murderer  will find that he has not long to enjoy the wages of  his guilt In this temper of mind he wrote a let ter to Piso in express terms disclaiming all friendship and connexion with him as some will have it he commanded him to depart from the province Piso in fact did not linger at Seleucia he embarked im mediately but slackened his course still willing to hover near the coast in hopes that the death of Ger manicus would leave the province open to his ambi tion LXXI The disorder intermitting for a short time Germanicus had an interval of hope But the fatal moment was approaching he sunk into a mortal languor and finding himself near his end took leave of his friends in words to the following effect  Were  I to die a natural death yet thus cut off in the  bloom of life from my family my children and my  country I might think it hard and call the gods se  vere in their dispensations Falling as I now do a â victim to the iniquity of Piso and his wife Planeina  I leave with you my friends the request of a dying  man You know the indignities that provoked me  beyond all enduring you know the snares that have been laid for me and you see tire anguish of heart  that brings me prematurely to my grave relate the  whole to my father and my brother The friends whom

the prosecutors and should my enemies attempt to screen themselves by plead  ing secret orders mankind will either not believe them or believing will not forgive them The friends of the dying prince clasped his hands and bound themselves by a solemn oath to revenge his death or perish in the attempt LXXII Germanicus turning to his wife and fix ing his eyes upon her earnestly conjured her by the memory of her husband and by their mutual chil dren to abate from the pride and fierceness of her  disposition To bend to the stroke of adversity and at her return to Rome not to provoke by vain com petition the resentment of enemies too high in power was all that was now left â Thus far with an audible voice he then whispered a secret caution which was supposed to point at the malignity of Tiberius In a short time after he breathed his last The provinces lamented their loss he was honoured by kings and regretted by the neighbouring nations such was his equal behaviour to the allies of Rome and such the humanity that endeared him even to the enemy Graceful in his person he charmed by his affability beloved when heard admired when only seen and in the highest elevation great without arrogance he maintained the dignity of his rank yet never gave envy reason to repine at his success LXXIII The funeral was plain and simple with out pomp or pageantry No images were carried in the procession Fond remembrance and the praises due to virtue were the best decorations Between him and Alexander men formed a parallel his time of 130 THE ANNALS rA U C 772 f  life the graces of his person the manner of his death and the small distance between the places where both  expired gave room for the comparison Both it was observed were of a comely form both of illustrious birth neither of them much exceeding the thirtieth year of his age and both died in a foreign land cut off by domestic treachery But Germanicus had qualities peculiar to himself he was mild and gra cious to his friends in his pleasures temperate an affectionate husband and by one wife the father of a numerous issue Nor was his military character any way inferior he had the bravery of Alexander with out his rashness and if he had not been recalled from Germany where he gained so many signal victories the entire conquest of that country had crowned his operations with immortal glory The power of the state was never in his hands Had he possessed the sole authority with the royal title and the preroga tive of a prince the progress of his arms would have made him equal to the conqueror of Darius while on the side of virtue his clemency his moderation his temperance and other amiable qualities gave him a decided superiority The body lay in state in the forum at Antioch where the funeral ceremony was  performed Whether any symptoms of poison were discovered is uncertain The people were divided into opposite parties and their opinions varied ac cordingly Some lamented a deceased prince and in minds so prepossessed suspicion amounted to proof others warped into the interests of Piso and all pro nounced according to the bias of their inclinations LXXIV In this juncture who was the fit person to govern the province became the subject of debate A council for this purpose was held by the comman ders of the legions and all of senatorian rank then on the spot A number of candidates appeared Af ter a short struggle the contest lay between Vibius Marsus and Cneius Sentius The question hung for some time in suspense Marsus at length withdrew his pretensions willing to yield to a senior officer who showed himself ambitious of the honour The first step of the new governor was to send to Rome a A D 19 13 woman of the name of Martina well known through out the province for her practices in the trade  poisoning and also for her intimacy with Plancin This measure was adopted at the request of Vitellii Veranius and a number of others who were th actually busy in collecting evidence and in prepari the charge with as much assiduity as if the prose cution had been already commenced in due form of law LXXV Meanwhile Agrippina pierced to the heart and her health impaired by affliction resolved not withstanding to surmount every obstacle that might retard the hand of justice She embarked for Italy with the ashes of Germanicus and her orphan chil dren All eyes beheld her with compassion all were grieved that a woman of the highest distinction so lately happy with the best of men and in the splen dour of a court seen with a universal homage should undertake a melancholy voyage with the urn of him she loved not sure of a just revenge alarmed for her self and by the fruitfulness of her marriage bed ex posed to calamities yet unknown Piso was at the isle of Coos He there received advice that Germa nicus was no more Transported with joy beyond all  bounds he hastened to the temples and offered victims as a public thanksgiving Plancina was still more ex travagant she laid aside her mourning for a deceased sister to celebrate in her gayest apparel an event so grateful to her heart  LXXVT The centurions flocked in crowds to Piso assuring him that the legions were devoted to his ser vice and for that reason exhorted him to resume a command unjustly taken from him Piso called a council of his friends his son Marcus Piso was for his returning to Rome without delay  What had been done might well be justified suspicions un supported by proof would soon evaporate and  vague reports were of no moment The long con tention with Germanicus might perhaps be cen sured it was unpopular but could not amount to  a crime Piso had lost his government and by that  circumstance the rage of his enemies would be ap 132 THE AN NAM A U C 772  peased To return to Syria were to enter into a  civil war with Sentius The centurions and soldiers  were not to be trusted The memory of Germani  cus was still recent and that affection for the  Csesarian family which had taken root in the minds  of all would operate throughout the army LXXVII Domitius Celer the intimate friend of Piso was of a contrary opinion  The opportunity he said  should be seized without delay Piso and not Sentius was the legal governor of Syria the  prsetorian jurisdiction the ensigns of magistracy  and the command of the legions were committed  to his care If the sword must be drawn who had  so much right on his side as the person who receiv  ed his commission from the emperor Public ru  mour should not be too soon encountered Give  the report of the day time to grow stale and it dies  of itself In the first heat of prejudice innocence  itself has often fallen a victim to popular clamour  If Piso at the head of an army stood at bay with  his enemies new emergencies which no wisdom   could foresee might unexpectedly assist his cause  Why should he hasten to the capital Was it his  interest to enter Rome with Agrippina bearing the  urn of Germanicus Did he mean unheard and  undefended to try the effect of female lamentation  or to be hurried to execution by the fury of a licen  tious rabble  Livia it is true is of your party and  Tiberius will favour you but both will act in se  cret and in fact none will grieve for Germanicus  with so much ostentation of sorrow as they who  in their hearts rejoice at the event LXXVIII The turbulent genius of Piso was easily satisfied with this reasoning He despatched letters to Tiberius charging Germanicus with pride and luxury and farther complaining that with views of ambition he had driven out of Syria the lawful governor duly appointed by the emperor That go vernor he added would now resume the command and by a faithful discharge of so important a trust demonstrate his zeal for the public service Thus de termined he ordered Domitius to sail for Syria keep A D 19 OF TACITC8 133 ing as much as possible in the open sea without touching at any of the islands or approaching too near to the main land Meanwhile deserters crowd ed in from all quarters Piso formed them into com panies  he armed the lowest followers of the army and with this hasty levy embarked for the continent He had not long been landed when a body of recruits marching to the legions in Syria fell in his way He drew them over to his party and by circular letters demanded succours from the petty kings of Cilicia The younger Pisb though he had objected to the measure was not inactive in his father s service LXXIX Piso s fleet and that which conveyed Agrippina met near the coast of Lycia and Pamphilia They beheld each other with animosity Both par ties were eager to come to action but they passed each other content with throwing out reproaches and opprobrious language Vibius Marsus summoned Piso  to appear at Rome and stand his trial Piso answered with derision  that he would be sure to  attend when the prsetor vested with jurisdiction in  matters of poison had cited the parties and ap  pointed a day Meanwhile Domitius who had land ed at Laodicea in the province of Syria advanced towards the winter quarters of the sixth legion expect ing in that corps to find the minds of the men ripe for mutiny and desertion By the vigilance of Pacuvius who commanded in those parts the attempt was frus trated Sentius by letters to Piso complained of these proceedings at the same time warning him nei ther to corrupt the army nor disturb the peace of the province His next care was to draught from the le gions all such soldiers as were known to be attached to Germanicus or adverse to his enemies He repre sented the attempts of Piso as an invasion of the im perial dignity and a war against the commonwealth Having excited the ardour of his men he marched into Cilicia prepared to decide the dispute by force of arms LXXX Piso found himself presned on every side and yet was determined not to abandon his enterprise He seized a strong hold in Cilicia called the castle of Vol I â M   A U C 772 Celendris With a body of deserters incorporated with the recruits lately intercepted and the auxiliaries sent by the kings of Cilicia he threw himself into the place resolved to hold out to the last To his forces he added his own slaves and those of Plancina form ing altogether a number equal to a legion To excite their courage he complained aloud that he the go vernor appointed by Tiberius was driven out of the province not by the legions for they invited him to return but by Sentius who with the specious colour of public motives varnished over his own private ani mosity He told his troops that they had only to show themselves in force and the aflFair would be de cided The soldiers of the adverse party at the sight of Piso whom they hailed the father of the legions would lay down their arms and submit to the man who not only had justice on his side but if necessary courage and resolution to maintain his rights Hav ing thus exhorted his people he drew them out be fore the walls of the castle on the summit of a craggy hill The place was every where else surrounded by the sea The veterans under Sentius advanced in regular order A body of reserve followed to support them On one side were seen skill and bravery on the other nothing but the advantage of the ground no courage to incite no hope to animate and no warlike weapons but only such rustic tools as the men were able to snatch up in the first tumult of a dangerous enterprise An engagement followed but the victory was no longer in suspense than while the Romans were employed in forcing their way up the ascent of the hill The steep being surmounted the Cicilians fled for shelter to their fortifications LXXXI The fleet under the command of Sentius lay at anchor under the walls of Celendris Piso made a sally with intent to seize the ships Being repulsed he showed himself before the works of the castle he complained of cruel injustice and tried by the force of pathetic language to soften the legions in his favour he called upon individuals by name and by ample promises hoped to raise a spirit of sedition His success was such that an eagle bearer of the A D 19 135 OF TACITUS sixth legion deserted to him with his standard Sen tius resolved to carry the place by assault The sig nal for the charge was given scaling ladders were advanced to the walls the foremost in courage began to mount to the top of the work while an incessant volley of darts and stones and flaming brands was poured in upon the garrison Piso desired to capitu late He offered to lay down his arms upon condi tion that he should remain in the castle till the em peror s pleasure touching the government of the pro vince should be finally declared The proposition was rejected Sentius allowed him safe conduct to Italy and shipping for his passage no other terms were granted LXXXII The indisposition of Germanicus was known at Rome some time before his death The news like all distant intelligence increased every moment and bad was made worse by exaggeration Grief and loud complaints filled every quarter of the city  Was it for this that Germanicus was sent to  distant regions  For this was the province of Sy  ria assigned to Piso  This is the consequence of private interviews between Livia and Plancina  When Drusus the father of Germanicus died it  was observed by men of reflection and observed  with truth that if the son of a despotic prince is the  friend of civil liberty his father never forgives his  virtues It was for this that Drusus and Gormani  cus were snatched away from the Roman people  They intended to restore the old constitution and  they perished in the cause Such were the senti ments that prevailed at Rome The fatal news at length arrived In that moment the passions of men knew no bounds Without waiting for an edict of the magistrates or a decree of the senate a cessation of all business took place the courts of justice were deserted  houses were shut up shrieks and groans burst out and at intervals a deep and awful silence followed A general mourning covered the face of the city The exterior forms of grief were observed but the an guish of the heart surpassed all outward show It 136  T   i i  U C 772  ppened before Germanicus expired that certain iders from Syria arrived at Rome with favourable  counts What was wished was easily believed ae news spread with rapidity he who heard imper fectly made his report with additions  others did the same  and thus the story went on gathering strength from mouth to mouth and diffusing universal joy The populace ran wild through the streets they threw open the gates of the temples night came on the hurry still continued assertion grew more confident in the dark and credulity listened with a greedy ear Tiberius saw the delusion but calmly left it to its own futility Time disclosed the truth the people renewed their sorrow with redoubled violence as if the prince had been torn from them a second time LXXXII1 The senate met to decree honours to his memory Friendship put itself to the stretch and men of talents exhausted their invention It was voted that the name of Germanicus should be insert ed in the Salian hymn that a curule chair adorned with a civic crown should be placed in the college of  Augustan priests that his statue wrought in ivory should be carried in the procession of the Circensian games and that the vacancy made by his death in the list of flamens and augurs should be filled from the Julian family only Triumphal arches were or dered to be erected at Rome on the Rhine and mount Amanus in Syria with inscriptions setting forth the splendour of his actions and in direct terms declar ing that he died in the service of his country At  ntioch where his remains were burnt a mausoleum as ordered and at Epidaphne where he died a tri unal in honour of his memory Of the several 1 atues and the places where they were to be worship I od it would be difficult to give a regular catalogue was farther proposed that a shield of pure gold ex ceding the ordinary size should be dedicated to him in the place allotted to orators of distinguished elo q uence Tiberius overruled the motion declaring his j intention to order one of the common size and4he sual metal Superior rank he said did not confer superior eloquence A place among the great writers A D 19 137 OF TACITUS of antiquity would be sufficient honour The eques trian order came to a resolution that the troop called the youthful squadron should for the future take its name from Germanicus and that his image should be carried at the head of their annual cavalcade on the ides of July Of these several institutions many are still subsisting some fell into disuse and others by length of time have been abolished LXXXIV While the tears of the public still flowed for Germanicus Livia the sister of that prince and the wife of Drusus was delivered of two sons at a birth In families of inferior rank events of this kind are rare and always matter of joy Tiberius was transported beyond measure He had the vanity to boast before the senate that so singular a blessing had never happened to any Roman of equal dignity It was the policy of that subtle spirit to extract from every occurrence and even from chance something that tended to his own glory The people however did not sympathize with the emperor They saw with regret the family of Drusus increasing and that of Germanicus in danger of being eclipsed IjXXXV In the course of this year several decrees against the licentiousness of female manners passed the senate It was ordained by a law that no woman whose grandfather father or husband was a Roman knight should be allowed to make her person venal The profligacy of Vistilia descended from a father of praetorian rank gave rise to this regulation She pre sented herself before the sediles and in form made a public profession of lewdness according to the rule established in ancient times when women registered as harlots by the magistrate had the privilege of lead ing a life of debauchery The principle of that law was that the very act of professing the character of a prostitute would be a punishment and perhaps operate as a restraint Titideus Labeo the husband of Vistilia was cited to assign a reason why so aban doned a woman had not been brought to condign punishment To exculpate himself he alleged that the sixty days allowed by law for the consultations necessary in matters of that nature were not elapsed M2     i â 772 atisfied with the answer the fathers thought it suf J 3ient to proceed against the adultress She was ba I ished to the isle of Seriphos The Egyptian and I ewish ceremonies were the next subject of debate j a decree of the senate four thousand of that de ception the descendants of enfranchised slaves all I ifected with foreign superstition and of age to carry i rms were transported to the island of Sardinia to Make war upon the freebooters who plundered the habitants and ravaged the country If the whole umber died in that unwholesome climate the loss it as said would be of no kind of moment The re naming sectaries were ordered at a certain day to epart out of Italy unless before that time they re ounced their impious worship LXXXVI The choice of a vestal virgin in the oom of Occia who had been with the greatest sanc ty of manners president of the order during the pace of seven and fifty years was by Tiberius re jrred to the senate Fonteius Agrippa and Domi tus Pollio made each of them an offer of his daugh 3r The emperor commended their zeal for the i ublic service The daughter of Pollio was preferred ler mother had never known but one husband and till continuing to live with him gave an example of onjugal fidelity whereas the divorce of Agrippa was considered as a blemish in the family That reason tnd that only determined the present choice The epulse of the disappointed candidate was softened by i present of a thousand great sesterces granted by Tiberius LXXXVII To appease the clamours of the people about the exhorbitant price of corn the sum to be j laid by the purchaser was ascertained Tiberius un dertaking to grant a bounty of two sesterces on the neasure as an encouragement to the vendor On this as on former occasions he refused the title of Father of his Country He even censured with  i degree of asperity the zeal of those who gave him  the appellation of Lord and Master and wanted to 1 dignify his administration with the epithet bf Divine In this manner eloquence was confined within nar A D 19 OF TACITUS 139 row limits What topic could be safely handled The emperor was the enemy of civil liberty and he detested flattery LXXXVUI In the memoirs of some of the senators of that day and also in the works of contemporary writers mention 1 find is made of letters from Ad gandestrius prince of the Cattians which were read in the senate They contained a proposal to despatch Arminius provided poison for that purpose were sent from Rome The answer was magnanimous the German was told that the Roman people were in the habit of waging war not by fraud and covert strata gem but sword in hand and in the field of battle In this instance Tiberius vied with the generals of an cient Rome who with scorn rejected the scheme of poisoning Pyrrhus and even delivered up the traitor who harboured that base design Arminius however did not long survive The Ro man army being withdrawn from Germany and Ma roboduus ruined he had the ambition to aim at he sovereign power The independent spirit of his countrymen declared against him A civil war en sued Arminius fought with alternate vicissitudes of fortune and fell at last by the treachery of his own relations a man of warlike genius and beyond all question the deliverer of Germany He had not like the kings and generals of a former day the infancy of Rome to cope with he had to struggle with a great and flourishing empire he attacked the Ro mans in the meridian of their glory He stood at bay for a number of years with equivocal success some times victorious often defeated but in the issue of the war still unconquered He died at the age of seven and thirty after twelve years of fame and power In the rude poetry of the barbarians his name is cele brated to this hour unknown indeed to the annalists of Greece who embellish nothing but their own story Even amongst the Romans the character of this illus trious chief has met with little justice absorbed as the people are in their veneration of antiquity while to the virtue of their own times they remain insensi ble and incurious THE ANNALS OF TACITUS BOOK III  AGRirpiNA pursued her voyage without inter sion Neither the rigour of the winter nor the gh navigation in that season of the year could r her resolution She arrived at the island of cyra opposite to the coast of Calabria At that 3e she remained a few days to appease the agita ta of a mind pierced to the quick and not yet ght in the school of affliction to submit with pa ice The news of her arrival spreading far and  e the intimate friends of the family and most of officers who had served under Germanicus with a nber of strangers from the municipal towns some ay their court others carried along with the cur t pressed forward in crowds to the city of Brun ium the nearest and most convenient port As n as the fleet came in sight of the harbour the coast the walls of the city the tops of the houses 1 every place that gave even a distant view were wded with spectators Compassion throbbed in every breast In the hurry of their first emotions men knew not what part to act should they receive 1 r with acclamations  or would silence best suit the casion Nothing was settled The fleet entered s harbour not with the alacrity usual among ma ilers but with a slow and solemn sound of the oar pressing deeper melancholy on every heart  Agrippina came forth leading two of her children th the urn of Germanicus in her hand and her es steadfastly fixed upon that precious object A neral groan was heard Men and women relations d strangers all joined in one promiscuous scene of A D 20 141 OF TACITUS sorrow varied only by the contrast between the at tendants of Agrippina and those who now received the first impression The former appeared with a languid air while the latter yielding to the sensation of the moment broke out with all the vehemence of  recent grief II Tiberius had ordered to Brundusium two prse torian cohorts The magistrates of Calabria Apulia and Campania had it in command to pay every mark of honour to the memory of the emperor s son The urn was borne on the shoulders of the centurions and tribunes preceded by the colours not displayed with military pomp but drooping in disorder with all the negligence of grief The fasces were inverted In the colonies through which they passed the populace in mourning and the knights in their purple robes threw into the flames rich perfumes spices and gar ments with other funeral offerings according to the ability of the place Even from distant towns the people came in crowds to meet the procession they presented victims they erected altars to the gods of departed souls and by their lamentations marked their sense of the public calamity Drusus advanced as far as Terracina accompanied by Claudius the brother of Germanicus and the children of the de ceased prince that had been left at Rome The con suls Marcus Valerius Messala and Marcus Aurelius Cotta who a little before had entered on their ma gistracy with the whole senate and a numerous body of citizens went out to meet the melancholy train The road was crowded no order kept no regular procession they walked and wept as inclination prompted Flattery had no share in the business where the court rejoiced in secret men could not weep themselves into favour Tiberius indeed dis sembled but he could not deceive Through the thin disguise the malignant heart was seed HI Neither the emperor nor his mother appeared in public They imagined perhaps that to be seen in a state of affliction might derogate front their dig nity or the better reason was that a number of prying eyes might unmask their inmost sentiments 142 THE ANNALS A U C 773 It does not appear either in the historians of the time or in the public journals that Antonia the mo ther of Germanicus took any part in the funeral ce remony Agrippina Drusus Claudius and the rest of the prince s relations are registered by name but of Antonia no mention is made She was probably hindered from attending by want of health or the sensibility of a mother might be unequal to so severe a trial To speak my own opinion I am inclined to believe that nothing but the emperor and his mother could restrain her from the last human office to her son If all three absented themselves equal affliction might be inferred and the uncle and grandmother might be supposed to find a precedent in the conduct of the mother IV The day on which tho remains of Germanicus were deposited in the tomb of Augustus was remark able for sorrow in various shapes A deep and mourn ful silence prevailed as if Rome v as become a desert and at intervals the general groan of a distracted multitude broke forth at once The streets were crowded the Field of Mars glittered with torches the soldiers were underarms themagistrates appeared without the ensigns of their authority and the peo ple stood ranged in their several tribes All with one voice despaired of the commonwealth they spoke their minds without reserve in the anguish of thoir hearts forgetting the master that reigned over them Nothing however touched Tiberius so near as the decided affection of the people for Agrippina who was styled the ornament of her country the only blood of Augustus and the last remaining model of ancient manners With hands upraised the people invoked the gods imploring them to protect the chil dren of Germanicus from the malice of pernicious enemies V There were at that time men of reflection who thought the whole of the ceremony short of that fu neral pomp which the occasion required The mag nificence displayed in honour of Drusus the father of Germanicus was put in contrast to the present fru gality  Augustus in the depth of winter went as D 20 of Tacitus 143 far as Ticinum to meet the body and never quit f ting it afterwards entered the city in the public pro  cession The bier was decorated with the images of  the Claudian and the Livian families tears were 4 shed in the forum a funeral oration was delivered  from the rostrum and every honour as well of an  cient as of modern invention was ofFered to the me  mory of the deceased How different was the case at present Even the distinctions usually granted  to persons of illustrious rank were refused to Ger  manicus The body was committed to the funeral  pile in a foreign land that was an act of necessity  but to compensate for the first deficiency too much  could not be done One day s journey was all that  a brother performed The uncle did not so much  as go to the city gate Where now the usage of  ancient times  Where the bed on which the image  of the deceased lay in state Where the verses in  honour of departed virtue  Where the funeral pane  gy c and tne tear that embalms the dead  If real  tears were not ready to gush where at least were   the forms of grief and where the decency of pre tended sorrow  VI Tiberius was not ignorant of what passed To appease the murmurs of the people he issued a pro clamation in which it was observed  that eminent  men had at various times fallen in the service of  their country though none were so sincerely lament  ed as Germanicus The regret shown on the pre  sent occasion did honour to the virtue of the people  and the imperial dignity  but grief must have its  bounds That which might be proper in private  families or in petty states would ill become the  grandeur of a people who gave laws to the world  Recent affliction must have its course The heart  overflows and in that discharge finds its best relief It is now time to act with fortitude Julius Csesar  lost an only daughter Augustus saw his grandsons  prematurely snatched away but their grief was in  ward only They bore the stroke of affliction with  silent dignity If the authority qf ancient times were requisite conjunctures might be mentioned in which the Roman people saw with unshaken  constancy the loss of their generals the overthrow  of their armies and the destruction of the noblest  families Whatever maybe the fate of noble fami  lies the commonwealth is immortal Let all resume their former occupations and since the Magalen  sian games were near at handvlet the diversions of  the season assuage the general sorrow VII The vacation from public business was now concluded The people returned to their ordinary functions and Drusus set out for tho army in Illyri cum At Rome in the mean time all were impatient to see Piso brought to justice That an offender of such magnitude should be suffered to roam at large through the delightful regions of Asia and Achaia roused the general indignation By such contumacy the law was eluded and the evidence was growing weaker every day The fact was Martina that no torious dealer in poison whom Sentius as has been mentioned ordered to be conveyed to Rome died suddenly at Brundusium Poison is said to have been found in the tangles of her hair but no trace of suicide appeared on any part of her body VIII Piso taking his measures in time sent his son to Rome with instructions to prepossess the em peror in his favour He went himself to seek an in terview with Drusus persuaded that he should find the prince not so much exasperated at the loss of a brother as pleased with an event that delivered him from a rival The son arrived at Rome Tiberius to show that nothing was prejudged gave the youth a gracious reception adding the presents usually be stowed on persons of rank on their return from the provinces Drusus saw the elder Piso and frankly told him that if what was rumoured abroad appeared to be founded in truth the charge demanded his keenest resentment but he rather hoped to find the whole unsupported by proof that no man might de serve to suffer for the death of Germanicus This answer was given in public no private audience was admitted The prince it was generally believed had his lesson from Tiberius it being improbable that a A D 20 145 OF TACITUS young man of a free and open disposition unhack neyed in the ways of business could have acted with that guarded reserve which marked the veteran in politics IX Piso crossed the gulf of Dalmatia and leaving his ships at Ancona went forward to Picenum From that place he pursued his journey on the Flaminian road and on his way met a legion marching from Pannonia to Rome in order to proceed from thence to serve in Africa This incident was variously can vassed by the people A criminal it was said pre sumes to join the soldiers on their march and even waylays them at their quarters to curry favour with his military friends Piso heard of these complaints and to avoid suspicion or because it is the nature of guilt to be always wavering and irresolute at Narni he embarked on the Nar and sailing down the Ti ber landed on the Field of Mars near the tomb of the Csesars This was another causo of popular discon tent in open day amidst a crowd of spectators he and his wife Plancina made their appearance the former surrounded by a tribe of clients and the latter by a train of female attendants all with an air of gay ety bold erect and confident Piso s house overlook ed the forum preparations were made for a sumptu ous entertainment the scene was adorned with splen did decorations and from the nature of the situation nothing could remain a secret The whole was ex posed to the public eye X On the following day Fulcinius Trio exhibited an accusation before the consuls To this proceeding Vitellius Veranius and others who had attended Germanicus into Asia made strong objections alleg ing that Trio had not so much as a colour to entitle him to the conduct of the prosecution As to them selves they did not mean to stand forth as accusers but they had the last commands of Germanicus and to the facts within their knowledge intended to ap pear as witnesses Trio waved his pretensions but still claimed a right to prosecute for former misde meanors That liberty was allowed Application was made to the emperor that the cause might be Vol I â N 146 A U C 773 THE ANNALS heard before himself The request was perfectly agreeable to the accused party who was not to learn that the senate and the people were prejudiced against him Tiberius ho knew was firm enough to resist popular clamour  and in conjunction with Livia had acted an underhand part in the business Besides this the truth he thought would be better investi gated before a single judge than in a mixed assembly where intrigue and party violence too often prevailed Tiberius however saw the importance of the cause and felt the imputations thrown out against himself To avoid a situation so nice and difficult he consented to hear in the presence of a few select friends the heads of the charge with the answers of the defend ant and then referred the whole to the consideration of the senate XI During these transactions Drusus returned from Illyricum For the captivity of Maroboduus and the prosperous events of the preceding summer an ovation had been decreed by the senate but he chose to postpone that honour and entered the city as a private man Piso moved that Titus Arruntius  T Vinicius Asinius Gallus serninus Marcellus and Sextus Pompeius might be assigned as advocates to defend his cause Under different pretexts they all excused themselves and in their room Marcus Lepidus Lucius Piso and Livineius Regulus were appointed The whole city was big with expectation It remained to be seen how far the friends of Ger manicus would act with firmness what resources Piso had left and whether Tiberius would speak his mind or continue as usual dark and impenetrable No juncture had ever occurred in which the people were so warmly interested none when in private discourse men made such bitter reflections and none when suspicion harboured such gloomy apprehen sions XII At the next meeting of the senate Tiberius in a premeditated speech explained his sentiments   Piso he observed had been the friend and chosen  lieutenant of Augustus and was lately named with  the approbation of the senate to assist Germanicui A D 20 147 OF TACITUS  in the administration of the eastern provinces  Whether in that station he had made it his business  by arrogance and by a contentious spirit to exas  perate the prince  whether he rejoiced at his death  and above all whether he was accessary to it were  questions that called for a strict but fair inquiry  If he who was only second in command exceeded  the limits of his commission regardless of the duty  which he owed to his superior officer if he beheld Â the death of Germanicus and the loss which I have  suffered with unnatural with fell delight from that  moment he becomes the object of my fixed aver  sion I forbid him to enter my palace he is my  own personal enemy But the emperor must not  revenge the private quarrels of Tiberius Should  murder be brought home to him a crime of that  magnitude which in the cause of the meanest citi  zen calls aloud for vengeance is not to be forgiven it will be yours conscript fathers to administer con  solation to the children of Germanicus it will be  yours to assuage the sorrows of an afflicted father  and a grandmother overwhelmed with grief  In the course of the inquiry it will be material  to know whether Piso endeavoured with a seditious  spirit to incite the army to a revolt Did he try  by sinister arts to seduce the affections of the sol  diers  Was his sword drawn to recover possession K of the province  Are these things true or are they  the mere suggestions of the prosecutors with intent to aggravate the charge Their zeal it must be  owned has been intemperate By laying the body  naked at Antioch and exposing it to public view  what good end could be answered Why were fo  rejgn nations alarmed with a report of poison when  the fact is still problematical and remains to be tried J lament the loss of my son and shall ever  lament it but notwithstanding all my feelings it is  competent to the defendant to repel the charge he  is at liberty to bring forward whatever may tend tÂ  establish his innocence and even to arraign the  conduct of Germanicus if any blame can be im puted to him It is not for me to abridge any part THE ANNALS A U C 773 Jie defence My affections it is true are inter oven with the cause but you will not for that  reason take imputations for guilt nor allegations  for conclusive proof And since either the ties  of consanguinity or motives of friendship have en  gaged able advocates to patronize the party accused  let them exert their zeal their talents and their  eloquence In the same manner I exhort the prose  cutors let them act with the same constancy with  equal ardour The only distinction which the pre  rogative of the prince can grant is that the cause shall be tried in this court and not in the forum  in the presence of the senate not before the common  tribunals In all things else let the forms of law  be observed The tears of Drusus and my own  afflictions are foreign to the question  let no man  regard our interest throw it out of the case and  discard from your minds the little calumnies that  may glance at myself XIII Two days were allowed to the prosecutors to support their charge six to prepare the defence and three for hearing it Fulcinius Trio began The ground he took was the avarice and tyranny with which Piso conducted himself during his administra tion in Spain This was starting from a period too remote Though convicted on that point the de fendant might still repel the present charge  and if acquitted he might be guilty of higher crimes Ful cinius was followed by Servseus Veranius and Vitel lius all three exerting Lhemselvcs with equal zeal but the latter with superior eloquence The points insisted upon wereâ That Piso incited by malice lo  Germanicus and his own ambitious views diffused  a spirit of licentiousness through the Roman army  He corrupted the soldiery and suffered the allies of  Rome to be plundered with impunity In conse  quence of those pernicious acts the vile and profli gate hailed him father of the legions But his  conduct was hostile to all good men and more di rectly to the friends of Germanicus To fill the l measure of his iniquity he had recourse to magic  arts and the prince was destroyed by poison Piso A D 20 149 oP TACITUS â 4 and his wife Planeina were known to have assisted 44 in superstitious rites and impious sacrifices And yet the prisoner did not stop there he was guilty  of rebellion he appeared in arms against the state  and before he could be brought to justice as a citi  zen he was conquered as an enemy XIV The defence in every article except that which related to the crime of poison was weak and ineffectual The charge of debauching the soldiers by bribery the rapacity of his creatures and the in suits offered to Germanicus were stubborn facts and could not be denied The crime of poisoning seemed to be sufficiently answered It was left on weak ground by the managers of the prosecution All they had to urge in support of that article was a bare al legation that Piso at an entertainment given by Ger manicus being placed on a couch above the prince had contrived with his own hands to mingle poison with the victuals An attempt of the kind in the midst of servants not his own under the eye of num bers and in the very presence of Germanicus seemed improbable and indeed absurd To refute it altoge ther Piso made a tender of his slaves to be ques tioned on the rack demanding at the same time that the domestics of Germanicus who waited that day at tabic should undergo the like examination But no thing made an impression on the judges For differ ent reasons they were all implacable Tiberius on account of the war levied in Syria the senators from a full persuasion that treachery had a hand in the death of Germanicus A motion was made for the production of all letters written to the criminal by Tiberius and Livia This was opposed with vehe mence not only by Piso but also by the emperor The clamours of the populace who surrounded the senate house were heard within doors The cry was if Piso escaped by the judgment of the fathers he should die by the hands of the people They had already seized his statues and in their fury dragged them to the place of execution called the Gemonise with intent to break them into fragments By order of Tiberius they were rescued out of their hands Piso was conveyed home N2 nnals A U C 773 in a litter guarded by a tribune of the prsetoriaji bands but whether that officer was sent to protect him from the populace or to see justice executed was left to conjecture and vague reports XV Plancina no less than her husband was an object of public detestation but protected by court favour she was thought to be out of the reach of her enemies What Tiberius would do was uncertain While she supposed herself involved in the fate of Piso without a gleam of better hope her language was that of a woman willing to share all chances with her husband and if he was doomed to fall deter mined to perish with him Having in the mean time by the interest of Livia obtained her pardon she be gan to change her tone and pursue a separate interest Finding himself thus abandoned Piso despaired of his cause Without further struggle he intended to re sign himself to his fate but by the advice of his sons he resumed his courage and once more appear ed before the senate The prosecution was renewed with vigour the fathers spoke in terms of acrimony every thing was adverse and the prisoner plainly saw that his fate was decided In this distress nothing af fected him so deeply as the behaviour of Tiberius who sat in sullen silence neither proVoked to anger nor softened by compassion with his usual art stifling every emotion of the heart Piso was conducted back to his house He there wrote a few lines in appear ance preparing his defence for the ensuing day and having sealed the paper delivered it to one of his freedmen The usual attentions to his person filled up his time till at a late hour of the night his wife having left the room he ordered the door to be made fast In the morning he was found dead his throat cut and his sword lying near him on the ground XVI I remember to have heard from men advanced in years that a bundle of papers not produced at the trial was often seen in the hands of Piso containing as his friends attested the letters of Tiberius full of instructions hostile to Germanicus These docu ments would have transferred the guilt to the empe ror but by the delusive promises of Sejanus they A D 20 151 OF TACITUS were all suppressed It was also confidently said that Piso did not lay violent hands on himself but died by the stroke of an assassin For the truth of these as sertions I do not mean to be answerable I state the facts as I heard them related by men with whom I conversed in my youth and the anecdotes of such men may be deemed worthy of attention Tiberius attended the next meeting of the senate He there complained with seeming anxiety that the death of Piso was  intended to reflect dishonour on himself He sent for the freedman who had received the paper sealed up as already stated and inquired particularly about his master how he passed the last of his days  and what happened in the course of the nig ht The man answered in some instances with caution and in others off his guard The emperor produced Piso s letter and read it to the senate It was nearly in the following words  Oppressed by the 4i malice of my enemies and falling under a load of  imputed guilt without a friend to espouse the truth  or shelter innocence I call the immortal gods to wit ness that to you Csesar I have through life pre  served my faith inviolate For your mother I have  ever felt the sincerest veneration I conjure you  both to take my sons under your protection Cneius  Piso is innocent Nothing that Iiappened in Asia  can be imputed to him since he remained during the  whole time at Rome His brother Marcus when I  returned to the province of Syria was strenuous  against the measure Would to heaven that I had yielded to the advice of a young man and that my 44 authority had not silenced all opposition For him  I offer my fervent prayers let not the errors of the  father bring down ruin on the son If in the course  of five and forty years I have been devoted to your  service if Augustus made me his colleague in the 4i consulship if the remembrance of our early friend 4i ship can now avail by all those ties I implore your ii mercy for my unhappy son It is the request of 44 a dying father the last I shall ever make He made no mention of Plancina XVII Tiberius declared his opinion that Marcus THE ANNALS A U C 773 I j g under the control of his father ought not t werable for the civil war He mentioned tV 1 due to an illustrious house and even la rr 4 ntH the unhappy lot of the deceased though li j   upon him by misconduct He spoke in fa vour of i lancina but with an air of embarrassment conscious of his own duplicity The intercession of his mother was a colour for the part he acted but thinking men were by no means satisfied On the contrary their hatred of Livia was more embittered than ever They exclaimed without reserve  Shall  the grandmother admit to her presence a woman  stained with the blood of her grandson  Shall she  converse in familiar freedom with a murderess  Must she receive to her arms an abandoned woman  and by her influence rescue her from the vengeance  of the senate  The laws protect the meanest citi  zen but in the case of Germanicus they have lost  their vigour Vitellius and Veranius poured forth  their eloquence in the cause of a prince cut off by  treachery while the emperor and his mother side  with Plancina That pernicious woman may now  with impunity continue her trade of poisoning she  may practise her detestable arts on the life of Agrip  pina and her children she may proceed in her ini  quity and with the blood of an illustrious but un  happy family glut the rage of a dissembling uncle  and a worthless grandmother For two days to gether Rome was amused with a mock trial of Plan cina Tiberius in the mean time exhorted Piso s sons to stand forth in defence of their mother The charge was opened the witnesses were examined and the orators spared neither zeal nor eloquence in sup port of the prosecution no reply was made the wretched condition of a helpless woman began to ope rate on the feelings of the fathers and prejudice was melted into pity Aurelius Cotta the consul was the first that gave his vote according to a settled rule whenever the question was put by the emperor The opinion of Gotta was that the name of Piso should be rased out of the public registers that part of his estate should be confiscated and the rest granted A D 20 OF TACITUS to Cneius Piso upon condition that he changed  family name and that his brother Marcus dives i of all civil honours should be condemned to banisi V ment for the space of ten years with a sum however of fifty thousand great sesterces for his support In deference to the solicitations of Livia it was proposed to grant a free pardon to Plancina XVIII This sentence in many particulars was mitigated by Tiberius The family name he said ought not to be abolished while that of Marc Antony who appeared in arms against his country as well as that of Julius Antonius who by his intrigues disho noured the house of Augustus subsisted still and figured in the Roman annals Marcus Piso was left in possession of his civil dignities and his father s for tune Avarice as has been already observed was not the passion of Tiberius On this occasion the disgrace incurred by the partiality shown to Plancina softened his temper and made him the more willing to extend his mercy to the son Valerius Messalinus moved that a golden statue might be erected in the temple of Mars the Avenger An altar to Venge ance was proposed by Csecina Severus Both these motions were overruled by the emperor The principle on which he argued was that public monuments however proper in cases of foreign conquest were not suited to the present juncture Domestic calamity should be lamented and as soon as possible consigned to oblivion Messalinus added to his motion a vote of thanks to Tiberius and Livia to Antonia Agrippina and Dru sus for their zeal in bringing to justice the enemies of Germanicus The name of Claudius was not mentioned Lucius Asprenas desired to know whe ther that omission was intended The consequence was that Claudius was inserted in the vote Upon an occasion like this it is impossible not to pause for a moment to make a reflection that naturally rises out of the subject When we review what has been doing in the world is it not evident that in all trans actions whether of ancient or of modern date some strange caprice of fortune turns all human wisdom to 4 THE ANNALS A U C 773 4 jest  In the juncture before us Claudius figured  so little on the stage of public business that there was scarce a man in Rome who did not seem by the  voice of fame and the wishes of the people designed for the sovereign power rather than the very person whom fate in that instant cherished in obscurity to make him at a future period master of the Roman world XIX The senate a few days afterwards on the motion of Tiberius granted the sacerdotal dignity to Vitellius Veranius and Servseus Fulcinius Trio received a promise of the emperor s favour in his road to honours but was at the same time admo nished to restrain the ardour of his genius lest by over heated vehemence he might mar his eloquence In this manner ended the inquiry concerning the death of Germanicus a subject which has been va riously represented not only by men of that day but by all subsequent writers It remains to this hour the problem of history A cloud forever hangs over the most important transactions while on the one hand credulity adopts for fact the report of the day and on the other politicians warp and disguise the truth between both parties two different accounts go down from age to age and gain strength with pos terity Drusus thought it time to enjoy the honours of a public entry For this purpose he went out of the city and having assisted at the ceremony of the au spices returned with the splendour of an ovation In a few days after he lost his mother Vipsania of all the children of Agrippa the only one that died a na tural death The rest were brought to a tragic end some as is well known by the murderer s stroke and others as is generally believed by poison or by famine XX In the same year Tacfarinas the Numidian chief whom we have seen defeated by Camillus in a former campaign once more commenced hostilities in Africa He began by sudden incursions depending for his safety on the rapidity of his flight Embold ened by success he attacked several towns and vil A D 20  155 OF TACITUS lages and went off enriched with plunder At length at a place near the river Pagida he hemmed in a Ro man cohort and held them closely besieged Decrius a gallant and experienced officer who commanded the fort considered the blockade as a disgrace to the Roman arms Having exhorted his men to face the enemy on the open plain he marched out and formed in order of battle At the first onset the barbarians made an impression The cohort gave way Decrius braved every danger Amidst a volley of darts he opposed his person to Up the flight of his men he called aloud to tiio siar ird bearers charging them not to incur the s i r  1 infamy of yielding to an undisciplined rabb   ie collection of runaways and deserters Hi were ineffectual Covered with wounds and   v pierced through he still persisted with und n   valour till at last aban doned by his troops r bravely sword in hand XXI Lucius Apr nm  ho had succeeded Camil lus as proconsul ol Vi received the account of this defeat with indignation The disgrace of the Roman arms touched him more than the glory that accrued to the barbarians He resolved to expiate the infamy by a dreadful punishment founded in deed upon ancient precedent and recorded m history  but in modern times fallen into disuse He ordered the cohort whose behaviour had been so ignominious to be deoimated  every man upon whom the lot fell died under repeated blows of the cudgel The conse quence of this severity was that a body of five hun dred veterans stationed in garrison at Thala main tained their post against the attempts of Tacfarinas and even routed the troops lately flushed with vic tory In this action Rufus Helvius a common sol dier obtained the glory of saving the life of a Roman citizen He was rewarded by Apronius with a spear and collar Tiberius ordered the civic crown to be added observing at the same time that the proconsul had the power of granting that reward  yet he cen sured the omission without asperity pleased that something was reserved for himself Tacfarinas finding his Numidians unwilling after 156 THE ANNALS A U C 773 their defeat to undertake a siege changed his plan of operations He chose a roving kind of war if the Romans advanced quick in retreat and as soon as the pursuit was over wheeling round to hang upon the rear By this desultory mode of skirmishing the wily African baffled and fatigued the Roman army till having ravaged the country near the sea coast and loaded his men with booty he was obliged to pitch his camp In that situation Apronius Csesianus son of the proconsul at the head of the cavalry the auxi liary cohorts and a body of light infantry draughted from the legions gave battle to the Numidian and having gained a complete victory obliged him to fly to his wilds and deserts  XXII At Rome in the rr n time a prosecution was carried on against Lepida a woman of illustrious birth descended from the milian family and great grand daughter both to Sylla and Pompey She was married to Publius Quirinius a citizen of great wealth far advanced in years but without children to inherit his estate The wife was charged with an attempt to pass a supposititious child for his legitimate issue Other articles were added such as adultery dealing in poison and consultations with Chaldean astrolo gers concerning the fate of the imperial family Her brother Manius Lepidus undertook her defence Quirinius had repudiated her and yet after his di vorce attacked her with implacable resentment This circumstance notwithstanding the guilt and in famy of Lepida rendered her an object of compassion In the course of the proceeding the real sentiments of Tiberius eluded all discovery Fluctuating between opposite passions he mixed and shifted mercy and re sentment in such quick succession that where he would fix it was impossible to guess He desired that the crime of violated majesty might bo thrown out of the case and in a short time after ordered Marcus Servilius of consular rank and the rest of the wit nesses to prove the very facts over which he pre tended to draw a veil He removed the slaves of Lepida who had been placed under a military guard to the custody of the consuls nor would he suffer A D 20 J 157 OF TACITUS them to be examined under the torture upon any point that concerned himself or his family He ex empted Drusus though consul elect from the rule that required him to give the first vote This by some was considered as a true republican principle that the fathers might give their voices free and un influenced by the example of the prince Others called it a stroke of subtle cruelty it being by no means probable that Drusus would decline to speak in order of time if a sentence of condemnation had not been already fixed XXIII The celebration of the public games sus pended the trial for some days In that interval Le pida accompanied by a train of illustrious women entered the theatre in a pathetic strain she invoked her ancestors she called on Pompey in his own thea tre that monument of grandeur and addressed her self to the images of that illustrious man Her grief made an impression tears gushed from the eyes of the people and indignation soon succeeding bitter exe crations were thrown out against Quirinius  a su  perannuated dotard sprung from a mean extraction  to whom in the decline of life a noble dame for  merly intended to bo the wife of Lucius Csesar and  by consequence the grand daughter of Augustus  was joined in wedlock that he good man might  raise heirs to his estate Notwithstanding these clamours the slaves of Lepida were put to the ques tion Their evidence amounted to full proof of her guilt and on the motion of Rubellius Blandus she was forbid the use of fire and water Even Drusus gave his assent though a milder sentence would have been agreeable to the wishes of a considerable num ber By the interest of Scaurus her former husband who had a daughter by her the confiscation of her property was remitted At the close of the proceed ings Tiberius informed the fathers that he had exa mined the slaves of Quirinius and their evidence left him no room to doubt of a formed design to poison her husband XXIV The families of the first consequence at Rome began to feol with regret that their numbers Vol I â O 158 A U C 773 THE ANNALS were thinned by repeated misfortunes The Calpur nian house had lately suffered by the loss of Piso and the jEmilian was impaired by the condemnation of Lepida In order to make some amends Decius Sila nus was restored to the Juniau family The particu lars of his case seem to merit some attention The life of Augustus was variously chequered  he was suc cessful against his country and m his family often unhappy The mtrigues of his daughter and grand daughter embittered his days He ordered them both to depart from Rome and punished the adulterers with death or banishment To the commerce natural be tween the sexes that emperor gave the naipe of sacri lege and violated majesty  and under colour of this new device forgot at once the lenity of former times and even the laws enacted by himself But the tragic issue that befel offenders of this kind with other me morable events of that period shall be the subject of a distinct history if when the work now on hand is finished my life shall be protracted in health and vi gour for a new undertaking With regard to Silanus who had a criminal con nexion willi the grand daughter of Augustus his of fence drew upon him no greater vengeance than a total exclusion from the friendship of the emperor That exclusion as Silanus understood it implied a sentence of banishment He retired into voluntary exile and never till the reign of Tiberius presumed to apply either to the prince or senate for permission to return to his country For Jhe favour extended to him he was indebted to the weight and influence of his bro ther Marcus Silanus who added to his high rank the fame of distinguished eloquence Marcus prevailed with the emperor and in a full meeting of the senate expressed his sense of the obligation Tiberius an swered that  the return of Decius Silanus after a  long absence was an event agreeable to all It was  however no more than his legal right No law had  abridged his liberty no decree of the senate was in  force against him And yet it was impossible for the  prince to forget the wrongs done to Augustus nor  could the return of Silanus either efface his crime or A D 20 OF TACITUS cancel what had been settled by an injured em peror From this time Decius Silanus lived at Rome a private citizen without honours or prefer ment XXV The next care of the senate was to soften the rigour of the law Papia Poppsea a law made by Au gustus in the decline of life when the Julian institu tions were found ineffectual The policy was to enforce by additional sanctions the penalties of celi bacy and thereby increase the revenue Marriage however was not brought into fashion To be with out heirs was still considered as a state that gave great advantages Prosecutors multiplied and numbers were every day drawn into danger Informers were the interpreters of justice and chicane and malice wrought the ruin of families The community la boured at first under the vices of the times alid afterwards under the snares of law From this re flection if we here go back to trace the origin of civil institutions and the progress of that complex system which has grown up to harass mankind the digression will not be incurious nor altogether foreign to our purpose    XXVI In the early ages of the world men led a life of innocence and simplicity Free from irregular passions they knew no corruption of manners and void of guilt they had no need of laws In the na tural emotion of the heart they found incitements to virtue and rewards were unnecessary Having no inordinate desires they coveted nothing and pains and penalties were unknown In process of time when all equality was overturned and in the place of tem perance and moderation ambition and violence began to trample on the rights of man then monarchy was established in several nations unlimited absolute and flourishing at this hour Some states indeed in their first formation or at least soon after they had made an experiment of kings preferred a government by law and law in its origin was like the manners of the age plain and simple Of the several political constitutions known in the world that of Crete esta blished by Minos that of Sparta by Lycurgns and that of Athens by Solon have been chiefly cele brated In the latter however we see simplicity giving way to complication and refinement At Rome the reign of Romulus was the reign of despotism His will was the law Numa Pompilius introduced the rites and ceremonies of religion and by establish ing forms of worship strengthened the civil union Some improvements were added by Tullus Hostilius and some by Ancus Martius But the true legislator was Servius Tullius the author of that best policy which made even kings the subjects of the laws XXVII After the expulsion of TaTquin the peo ple to secure their rights from powerful factions in the senate and to prevent the effects of civil discord were obliged to modify the constitution by new regu lations With this view the decemvirs were created Those magistrates by adopting from the wisdom of other nations what appeared worthy of selection framed a body of laws entitled the Twelve Tables All sound legislation ended there It is true that af ter that time new statutes were enacted but if we except a few suggested by the vices of the times and passed on the spur of the occasion they were for the most part made in the conflict of parties and for the worst of purposes in some instances to lay open to ambition the road to honours in others to work the downfall of illustrious citizens and in general with pernicious motives Hence the Gracchi and the Sa turnini those turbulent demagogues and hence the violent spirit of Drusus that famous partisan of the senate who by largesses and open bribery supported the claims of the nobility and by specious promises induced the allies of Rome to espouse his cause de ceiving them at first and between the senate and the popular leaders making them in the end the bubble of contending factions Hence a wild variety of con tradictory laws In the social war which involved all Italy and the civil commotions that followed new ordinances were established but with the same con tentious spirit till at length Lucius Sylla the dicta tor by repealing several laws by amending others ini y or ir 114 a ode of his own gave a chock A D 20 161 OF TACITUS to the rage of legislation But the respite was but short The fiery genius of Lepidus preferred a num ber of seditious decrees and the tribunes of the peo ple resuming their ancient powers alarmed the state with tumult and popular commotions The general good was no longer thought of new characters ap peared in the great scene of public business and new statutes were enacted In a corrupt republic vice in creased and laws were multiplied XXVIII Pompey at length in his third consulship was chosen to correct abuses and introduce a refor mation of manners His remedies were more perni cious than the mischief He made laws and broke them he had recourse to arms and by force of arms was ruined From that time during a period of twenty years the rage of civil discord threw every thing into confusion Justice was silent tho man ners were corrupted vice triumphed with impunity and virtue met with sure destruction At length Augustus in his sixth consulship finding himself esta blished without a rival repealed the acts passed by himself during the triumvirate and gave a new sys tem useful indeed to the public tranquillity but sub versive of the constitution fit only for the govern ment of one The chains of slavery were closely riveted and spies of state were appointed To ex cite and animate the diligence of those new o fFicers the law Papia Poppsea held forth rewards By that law the people under the fiction of universal parent were declared heirs to the vacant possessions of such as lived in celibacy regardless of the privileges annexed to the paternal character To enforce this regulation informers were encouraged The genius of those men knew no bounds they harassed the city of Rome and stretched their harpy hands all over Italy Wherever they found a citizen they found a man to be plundered Numbers were ruin ed and all were struck with terror To stop the pro gress of the mischief Tiberius ordered a set of com missioners to be drawn by lot five of consular rank five prsetorians and a like number from the body of the seriate Under their direction the law was ex 0 1 162 A U C 773 THE ANNALS plained ensnaring subtleties were removed and the evil though not wholly cured was palliated for the present XXIX About this time Nero the eldest son of Germanicus was entering on the state of manhood Tiberius recommended him to the favour of the senate adding his request that the young prince might be excused from serving the office of the vi gintivirate with leave five years earlier than the time limited by law to stand candidate for the ques torship As a precedent for this indulgence he cited the example of Augustus who had made the like ap plication for himself and his brother Drusus The proposal was a mockery and accordingly men heard it with derision Even in the reign of Augustus there were in all probability numbers who laughed in secret at the new way of commanding by petition The artifice however was at that time not impolitic r the grandeur of the Ctcsars was in its infancy and the forms of the old republic were still remembered With regard to the request made by Tiberius it may he observed that the relation between the step father and the sons of his wife did not create so tender ark interest as the natural affection of a grand father for his grand son The senate not only granted what was asked but added a seat in the pontifical college The day on which the young prince made his first appearance in the forum was distinguished by a largess to the people who saw with pleasure a son of Germanicus rising to the estate of manhood His marriage with Julia the daughter of Drusus was soon after celebrated and diffused a general satisfac tion But another match then in contemplation be tween the son of Claudius and a daughter of Seja nus was received by the people with every mark of discontent Men objected that the lustre of the im perial family would be tarnished and the ambition of Sejanus already suspected would when strength ened by that connexion tower above the rank of a citizen XXX Towards the close of the year died two men of distinguished character namely Lucius Vo A D 20 OF TACITUS 163 lusius and Sallustius Crispus The former was of an ancient family at all times highly honoured though never raised above the prsetorian rank The deceased was the first of his house that rose to the consulship When it was afterwards necessary to regulate the classes of the equestrian order he was for that purpose advanced to the dignity of censor In the course of his time he accumulated an immo derate fortune and laid the foundation of that rank and splendour in which his family flourished after him The ancestors of Crispus were of equestrian rank By the maternal line he was grand nephew to Caius Sallustius the accomplished Roman historian Being adopted by that illustrious writer he assumed the fa mily name and though the road to honours lay open before him the example of Msecenas was the model on which he formed his conduct Never aspiring to the rank of senator he lived in a degree of splendour that eclipsed the consular magistrates and even the commanders of armies who had triumphed for their victories The austerity of ancient manners was to his taste In his apparel and equipage he was gay and costly in his style of living fond of elegance and even of luxury Uniting in his character oppo site qualities he was at once a man of pleasure and a statesman of consummate ability The vigour of his mind though often relaxed in indolence was such as qualified him for the most arduous affairs When occasion called he returned to business with an clas tic spring that showed he gained new strength from inactivity While Msecenas lived and flourished Crispus acted the second character Succeeding af terwards to that minister he took the lead in the ca binet the first in favour and in all secret transactions the confidential manager Agrippa Posthumus was cut off under his direction In the decline of life he retained the appearance of power without the reality a reverse of fortune which had been felt by Msecenas and which by some fatality is the usual end of all who bask in the sunshine of a court â Between the prince and his favourite weariness and satiety sue 164 A U C 774 TIIE ANNALS ceed to the ardour of affection and both begin to wean themselves from each other the prince when the power of giving is exhausted and the minister when avarice has no more to crave XXXI The year which we are now to open stands distinguished by the joint consulship of the father and the son Tiberius for the fourth time and Drusus the second It is true that two years before Ger manicus shared the same honour but their union was not founded in sincerity and mutual esteem Throughout that year Tiberius beheld his colleague with a malignant eye The tie of affinity between them was not so close as the present Tiberius had scarce entered on the office in conjunction with Dru sus when pretending to recruit his health he remo ved into Campania perhaps even then meditating that long retreat which was afterwards his plan of life perhaps intending to give Drusus the honour of discharging the consular functions without the assist ance of his father An incident soon occurred in itself of little moment but by the heat of party it kin dled to a flame and afforded to the young consul an opportunity to gain the popular esteem A complaint was made to the senate by Domitius Corbulo for merly one of the praters stating that Lucius Sylla a youth of illustrious rank had refused in a late show of gladiators to give place to his superior in point of years The grave and elderly were on the side of Corbulo They saw the rights of age infringed and the example of ancient manners treated with contempt Mamercus Scaurus and Lucius Arruntius undertook the defence of Sylla and with the rest of his relations formed a party in his favour A warm debate ensued The practice of good times was stated and several decrees enforcing the reverence due to age were cited as decisi e authority Drusus by a qualifying speech allayed the ferment Corbulo declared him self satisfied by the apology made by Mamercus Scaurus who was uncle as well as father in law to Sylla and besides the most eloquent orator of his  time That business being thus amicably settled the state of the public roads was made the subject of de A D 21 OF TACITUS 165 bate hy the same Corbulo The highways he said were in a bad condition throughout Italy neglected every where and in some places impassable He im puted the mischief to the fraudulent practices of con tractors and the inattention of the magistrates He was desired to superintend the business but the ad vantage whatever it was that accrued to the public did not counterbalance the ruin of individuals who Buffered both in reputation and fortune by the harsh decision of Corbulo and the confiscation of their eifects XXXII In a short time after the senate received despatches from Tiberius with intelligence that Africa was again alarmed by the incursions of Tae farinas The occasion the emperor said required a proconsul of military talents and vigour equal to the fatigues of war but the choice was left to the judg ment of the fathers Sextus Pompeius seized this opportunity to launch out in a bitter invective against Marcus Lepidus v iom he styled a man void of cou rage destitute of fortune a disgrace to his ancestors and by no means fit to be entrusted with the go vernment of Asia which had then fallen to his lot The senate was of a different opinion What was called want of courage according to them was mild ness of disposition his indigence was a misfortune not a disgrace nor could it be deemed a fair objec tion to a man who in narrow circumstances sup  ported the dignity of his ancestors and lived in ho nourable poverty with an unblemished character He was therefore declared proconsul of Asia The choice of a governor to command in Africa was by a decree reserved for the decision of the emperor XXXIII In the course of the debate a motion was made by Csecina Severus that the governors of pro vinces should be no longer accompanied by their wives He prefaced the business with repeated de clarations that between him and his wife who had brought him six children the truest harmony subsist ed  and yet the law which he now proposed had ever been the rule of his own conduct insomuch that in a series of forty years during which time he had 166 A U C 774 THE ANNALS served as many campaigns his wife always remained in Italy  It was with good reason he said  that  in former times women were neither allowed to  visit the allies of Rome nor to have any intercourse  with foreign nations The softer sex brought many  inconveniences  in times of peace they were prone  to luxury and in war easily alarmed A female train in the march of a Roman army presented  an image of savage manners it had the appearance  of barbariajjs going to battle  That women are by nature feeble and soon over  come by hardship was not the only objection other  qualities entered into the female character such as  pride revenge and cruelty and ambition The love  of power is the predominant passion of the sex and  in the exercise of it they know no bounds They  appear in the ranks they march with the troops  and they entice the centurions to their party We  have seen in a late instance a woman reviewing  the cohorts and directing the exercise of the le gions Have we forgot that as often as rapacity  and extortion have been laid to the account of the  husband the wife has proved the principal offender  She no sooner enters the province than her party is 44 formed The unprincipled attend to pay their ho  mage She becomes a politician she takes the lead  in business and gives a separate audience The  husband and the wife appear in public with their distinct train of attendants Two tribunals are  established and the female edict dicta ted by caprice  and tyranny is sure to be obeyed By the Oppian  and other laws the wife was formerly restrained within due bounds at present all decorum is laid  aside women give the law in families they preside in the tribunals of justice and aspire to be eom  manders in chief XXXIV To this speech a small number assented the rest received it with a murmur of disapproba tion The business they said was not in form be fore the fathers and a question of that importance ought not to be drawn into debate by a self created censor like Csecina His argument was answered by A D 21 OF TACITUS 167 Valerius Messalinus a man who derived from hia father Messala the celebrated orator no inconsider able share of eloquence  The rigour he said  of  ancient manners has taken a milder tone The  enemy is not at the gates of Rome and the pro  vinces have no hostile intentions In favour of the  tender sex some concessions ought to be made  especially since it is now known by experience that  the wife so far from being a burden to the province  is scarcely felt in the private economy of the hus  band She is no more than a sharer in his splen  dour and dignity In time of peace what danger  from her presence  War indeed calls for vigour  and men should go unencumbered to the field  When the campaign is over where can the general  so well repose from toil and labour as in the bosom  of a wife whose tenderness relieves his pain and  sweetens every care  But woman it has been said  are prone to avarice and ambition what shall be  said of the magistrates Have they always been  free from irregular passions  and if not will it fol 4 low that men are to be no longer trusted with the  administration of the provinces  We are told that  the vices of the wife have their influence on the  manners of the husband  and is it therefore true  that in a life of celibacy we are sure of finding un  blemished honour   The Oppian laws were formerly deemed expe  dient the policy of the times required them but  the manners have varied since and with the man  ners the law has been modified We strive in vain  under borrowed terms to hide our own defects  the  truth is if the wife exceeds the bounds of the female  character the blame falls on the husband In two  or three instances we may have seen that the men  were weak and too uxorious and shall we for that reason take from the commander of armies the  most endearing comforts of marriage the mutual  joy in prosperity and in affliction the balm that  heals his sorrows  By the restraint now proposed  the weaker sex will be left in a state of destitution  the sport of their own caprice and a prey to the 168 A U C 774 THE ANNALS  passions of the profligate seducer The presence of  the husband is scarce sufficient to guard the sanc  tity of the marriage bed what must be the conse  quence if they are separated and as it were  divorced for a number of years  In that interval  the nuptial union may be obliterated from the mind  Let us if we can prevent disorder in the provinces  but let us not forget the manners of the capital In this debate Drusus delivered his sentiments He touched upon the subject of his own marriage and added that the princes of the imperial house were liable to the frequent necessity of visiting distant pro vinces How often did it happen that Augustus made a progress in the West and in the East accompanied by Livia his wife  As to himself he had commanded in Illyricum and was ready if the state required to serve in any part of the empire but he should serve with regret if he was to be torn from an affectionate wife the faithful mother of all his children In con sequence of these reasonings CiEcina s motion fell to the ground XXXV The senate at their next meeting received letters from Tiberius in which after complaining ob liquely that the burden of all public business was thrown on himself he named Manius Lepidus and Junius Blsesus for the proconsulship of Africa leav ing the choice of one of them to the determination of the fathers Both were heard Lepidus with a de gree of earnestness desired to be excused alleging the infirmities of his constitution and the care due to his children who except a daughter then fit for the married state were all of tender years Lepidus had still a better reason but he chose to suppress it it was nevertheless well understood that Blsesus was uncle to Sejanus and of course had the prevailing influence Blsesus in his turn declined the office but with affected coyness Flattery knew on which side its interest lay and by consequence the slaves of power knew how to conquer such feeble reluctance Blsesus was of course appointed XXXVI A public grievance which had long been felt with secret discontent was soon after brought  A D 21 OP TACITUS 169 before the fathers A licentious spirit of defamation prevailed at Rome and reigned without control The vile and profligate launched out with virulence against the best members of society and the statues of the Csesars were a sanctuary where the assassins of every honest name found protection The freed men and even the slaves poured out a torrent of abuse and after lifting their hands against their pa trons or their masters resorted to the same asylum where they grew more formidable in their insolence Caius Cestius a member of the senate complained of this enormity  Princes he said  represented the  gods but the gods lent a favourable ear to none but the just Neither the capitol nor the temples  were places of refuge where guilt might find a shel  ter and even encouragement In a late prosecution  Annia Rufilla was found guilty of manifest fraud  and if such a woman might with impunity in the forum and even in the portal of the senate insult  him with opprobrious language and even with  menaces if such contumacy were permitted and  the emperor s statue gave a sanction to evil prac  tices insomuch that he could obtain no redress all  good order was at an end and the laws were no better than a dead letter Others spoke to the same effect Facts still more atrocious were stated and with one voice the whole assembly called on Drusus for exemplary punishment Rufilla was cited to appear and being convicted the fathers or dered her to be imprisoned in the common jail XXXVII Confidius jEquus and Cselius Cursor two Roman knights who had preferred a false charge of violated majesty against Magius Csecilianus then one of the prsetors were for that offence condemned a t the desire of Tiberius From this act of justice as well as the sentence against Rufilla Drusus de rived no small share of popularity Men Were willing to allow that by residing at Rome and by mixing in social meetings he made some atonement for the dark and sullen spirit of his father The luxurious passions of a young man were easily excused Let him said Vol Iâ P 170 THE ANNALS A U C 774 the people indulge his taste for pleasure let him pass his day in the glare of public spectacles and his night in social revelry rather than live sequestered from mankind without a joy to cheer him in painful vigils and the gloom of solitude brooding over his cares and thinking only to engender mischief XXXVIII The ruin of eminent citizens had not yet appeased the rage of Tiberius and his crew of in formers An accusation was preferred by Ancharius Priscus against Csesius Cordus proconsul of Crete for peculation and violated majesty The last arti cle was at that time the burden of every prosecu tion Antistius Vetus a man of the first consequence in Macedonia had been accused of adultery and ac quitted This gave umbrage to Tiberius He cen sured the judges and ordered Vetus to be tried on the usual charge of violated majesty He represented him as a man of a turbulent spirit and an accom plice with Rhescuporis at the time when that barba rian having put his nephew Cotys to death was on the eve of a war with Rome Vetus fell a sacrifice He was interdicted from fire and water with an ad ditional sentence that he should be confined to some island not contiguous either to Macedonia or Thrace Since the partition of the latter kingdom between Rhsemetalces and the sons of Cotys to whom Tre bellienus Rufus was appointed guardian that country continued in a state of tumult and hostility to Rome The people saw with minds exasperated the griev ances inflicted on the natives and having no pros pect of redress accused Trebellienus no less than Rhsemetalces In the same juncture the Cselaletans the Odrysseans Dians and other adjacent states in one general revolt had recourse to arms They took the field under their own respective chiefs men of no consideration and all by their meanness and incapa city reduced to one common level Hence no con certed plan no spirit of union By one party the country was laid waste another passed over mount Hsemus with a design to draw distant nations into their confederacy while the most numerous and best A D 21 OF TACITCS 171 disciplined troops sat down before Philippopolis a city founded by Philip of Macedon and there held Rhsemetalces closely besieged XXXIX On the first intelligence of this revolt Publius Velleius who commanded an army in the neighbourhood sent a detachment of horse and light infantry in pursuit of the insurgents who spread them selves over the country either with a view to plun der or to reinforce their numbers He himself marched in force to raise the siege He was successful in every quarter the freebooters were put to the sword and dissensions breaking out among the besiegers Rhsemetalces made a sally in the moment when the Roman army came up to his relief The barbarians abandoned the place Of these events however pros perous there is no room to speak in the pomp of military language a rabble of savages without dis cipline and almost without weapons cannot be called an army nor was that a battle where the enemy was cut to pieces without the effusion of Roman blood XL In the course of the same year a rebellion broke out among the cities of Gaul occasioned by the load of debt that oppressed the common people The principal leaders of the revolt were Julius Floras and Julius Sacrovir the former a man of weight among the Treveri and the latter among the jEduans They were both of illustrious birth Their ancestors had deserved well of the Romans and for their services received the freedom of the city at a time when that privilege was rare and the reward of merit only By these incendiaries secret meetings were held the fierce and daring were drawn into the league toge ther with such as languished in poverty or being conscious of their crimes had nothing left but to grow desperate in guilt Florus undertook to kindle the flame of rebellion in Belgia and Sacrovir to rouse the neighbouring Gauls The plan thus settled they caballed in private held frequent meetings and left no topic untouched that could inflame the minds of the people  Tributes they said  were levied  with unabating rigour usurious interest oppressed  the poor and their haughty masters continued to 172 THE ANNALS A U C 774  lord it over them with pride and arrogance By the  murder of Germanicus disaffection was diffused  among the legions and the opportunity to strike the  blow for liberty was now arrived Reflect on the  numbers we can bring into the field  remember the  impoverished state of Italy At Rome every war  like principle is extinguished The strength of their  armies is mouldered away They have no national  strength but depend altogether on foreign nations  to fight their battles XLI A general spirit of revolt prevailed in every part of Gaul Scarce a city was free from commo tion The flame blazed out among the Andecavians and the people of Tours  but by the diligence of Acilius Aviola who marched from Lyons at the head of a cohort the insurgents in the former province were reduced to obedience The same commander with a legionary force detached by Visellius Varro from the Lower Germany marched into the territory of Tours and quelled the insurrection In this ex pedition some of the principal chiefs in Gaul joined the Roman army not with zeal for the cause but pretending friendship in order with surer effect to be traitors in the end Even Sacrovir fought with the Romans he was seen in the heat of action with his head uncovered in order as he gave out to sig nalize his courage and fidelity but in truth as was afterwards collected from the prisoners to avoid be ing aimed at by the darts of his countrymen An account of these disturbances was transmitted to Ti berius He doubted the intelligence and by his in decision prolonged the war XLII Julius Florus in the mean time continued to exert his most vigorous efforts A regiment of horse raised formerly among the Treveri but train ed to the Roman discipline happened to be quartered at Treves He tampered with those troops in hopes of beginning the war by a general massacre of the Roman merchants A small number listened to his advice but the rest continued in their duty Florus was followed by a rabble of debtors and a number of his own dependants He marched towards the forest A D 21 or tacitus 173 of Arden but was intercepted by the legions detached by Visellius and Caius Silius from the two armies on the Rhine A party of those troops was ordered for ward under the command Â f Julius Indus a native of Treves who was then at variance with Florus and for that reason burned with impatience to encounter his enemy He gave battle to the rebels and over an ill appointed and undisciplined multitude gained a complete victory Florus lay for some time con cealed in lurking places but at length finding himself unable to elude the search of the Roman soldiers and seeing the defiles and passages guarded on every side he died by his own sword The people of Treves after this event returned to their duty XLIII The jEduan commotions were not so easily quelled The state was rich and powerful and the force necessary to subdue the insurrection lay at a considerable distance Sacrovir strained every nerve to support his cause He seized the city of Augus todunum the capital of the ffiduans and took into his custody the flower of the young nobility who re sorted thither from all parts of Gaul as to a school of science and liberal education By detaining those pledges he hoped to attach to his interest their parents and relations He supplied the young men with arms which had been prepared with secrecy by his directions His numbers amounted to less than forty thousand a fifth part of which were armed after the manner of the legions the rest carried hunting poles knives and other instruments of the chase He had besides pressed into his service a body of slaves reared up to the trade of gladiators and according to the custom of the country clad with an entire plate of iron In the language of Gaul they were called Crupellarians Their armour was impenetrable to the stroke of the enemy but at the same time ren dered the men too unwieldy for the attack The ad joining provinces had not taken up arms but a num ber of individuals caught the infection and joined the rebel army Sacrovir gained a further advantage from the jealousies subsisting between the Roman ge nerals Each claimed to himself the conduct of the P 2  174 THE ANNALS A U C 774 war and the dispute continued till Varro rmding himself impaired by age gave up the point to Silius who was then in the vigour of his days XLIV Meanwhile a report prevailed at Rome that not only the Eduans and the Treviri but several other cities of Gaul to the number of sixty four had thrown off the yoke Germany it was added had joined the league and Spain was wavering The rumour as usually happens was magnified by the credulity of the populace Good men felt for their country the greater part detesting the present sys tem and wishing for nothing so much as a change enjoyed the confusion and triumphed in the common danger Invective did not spare Tiberius w In a  difficult and alarming crisis he was busy in settling  the forms of some new prosecution Did he mean to proceed by way of information against Julius  Sacrovir Was that chieftain to be accused of vio  lated majesty  The revolt plainly showed that there  still existed men of undaunted valour who were  resolved at the point of the sword to defy his let  ters written in blood to the senate and war with  all its dangers was preferable to a sanguinary  peace under a despotic tyrant Amidst these murmurs of discontent Tiberius appeared with an unruffled temper never once changing his look his place of abode or his habits of life Is this to be as cribed to magnanimity  or did he know by secret in telligence that the whole was either false or magni fied beyond the truth XLV Silius in the mean time having sent before him a body of auxiliaries marched at the head of two legions into the territory of the Sequanians a people at the extremity of Gaul bordering on the jEduans and confederates in the war He laid waste the coun try and proceeded by rapid marches to Augustodu num Nothing could equal the ardour of the legions the standard bearers with emulation gave every proof of their alacrity the common soldiers declared with one voice that they wanted no repose the night ought not to be lost in sleep let them but see the enemy they asked no more victory was sure to fol A D 21 175 OF TACITUS low At the distance of twelve miles from Augusto dunum Sacrovir appeared in force His line of battle was formed on the open plain The gladiators in complete armour were stationed in the centre his cohorts in the two wings and his half armed multi tude in the rear He was himself mounted on a su perb horse attended by a number of chiefs He rode through the ranks haranguing his men he called to mind the glory of their ancestors their brave exploits against the Romans and the eternal honour of suc ceeding in the cause of liberty A defeat he said would bring with it infamy and chains and bondage XLVI The speech was short and the soldiers heard it without emotion The legions advanced in regular order A band of raw recruits lately levied in the towns of Gaul could not sustain a sight so terrible The faculties of eyes and ears were lost in confusion By the Romans victory was already an ticipated To exhort them was unnecessary yet Si lius thought proper to inflame their ardour  The  disgrace he said  would be great if the victo  rious legions who had conquered in Germany  were now to consider the Gauls as an equal enemy  The rebels of Tours have been chastised by a single cohort a detachment of the cavalry crushed the  insurgents at Treves and a handful of this very  army gave the Sequanians a total overthrow The  jEduans are now before you not an army but an  effeminate race abounding in wealth and enervated  by luxury Charge with valour and to pursue the  runaways will be your only trouble This speech was received with a general shout The rebels were soon hemmed in by the cavalry the front of their line gave way at the first onset of the infantry and the wings were put to flight The men in iron ar mour still kept their ranks No impression could be made by swords and javelins The Romans had re course to their hatchets and pickaxes With these as if battering a wall they fell upon the enormous load and crushed both men and armour Some at tacked with clubs and pitchforks The unwieldy and defenceless enemy lay on the ground an inanimate 176 THE ANNALS A U C 774 mass without an effort to rise Sacrovir threw him self into the town of Augustodunum but in a short time fearing to be given up a prisoner withdrew with his most faithful adherents to  a villa in the neighbourhood where he put an end to his life His followers having first set fire to the place turned their swords against themselves and perished in one general carnage XLVII Tiberius at length thought fit to write to the senate on the subject of these commotions In one and the same letter he gave an account of the war begun and ended He neither magnified nor disguised the truth but in plain terms ascribed the whole success to the valour of his officers and the wisdom of his councils Why he did not go in per son or send his son Drusus the same letter explained his reason  The extent and majesty of the empire  claimed his utmost care It was not for the dignity  of the prince on the revolt of one or two cities to  relinquish the seat of government But now since  he could not be supposed to be under any kind qf  alarm it was his intention to show himself to the provinces in order by his presence to allay the  ferment and restore the public tranquillity Vows for his return and solemn festivals with other usual ceremonies were decreed by the senate Dolabella intending to display his genius in the trade of flattery succeeded so far as to show his meanness and absur dity He proposed that the emperor on his return from Campania should enter the city with the splen dour of an ovation This occasioned a letter to the senate from Tiberius wherein he observed  that af  ter conquering fierce and warlike nations and hav ing in his youth received and declined triumphal  honours he was not such a novice to glory as to  desire in the evening of his days the vain parade  of a public entry for an excursion that was little more than a party of pleasure to the suburbs ot  Rome XLVIII About this time Tiberius wrote to the se nate requesting that a public funeral might be decreed to Sulpieius Quirinius  a man no way related to the   A D 21 177 OF TACIT0S ancient patrician family of the Sulpicii He was born at Lanuvium a municipal town he distinguish ed himself by his military services had considerable talents for business and was raised by Augustus to the honour of the consulship Having afterwards stormed and taken the strong holds of the Homona densians in Cilicia he obtained triumphal honours He attended Caius Caisar in his expedition to Arme nia the chief director of his councils and made use of that opportunity to pay his court with secrecy to Tiberius while that prince resided in the isle of Rhodes This anecdote Tiberius mentioned in his letter declaring himself in gracious terms well pleased with the good offices of Quirinius and at the same time reflecting with a degree of acrimony on Marcus Lollius to whose conduct he imputed the dissensions between himself and Caius Csesar But the character of Quirinius was held in no esteem his unrelenting prosecution of Lepida already related was still remembered  and the sordid avarice of the man even in old age and in the height of power left a stain upon his memory XLIX The year closed with a prosecution of a singular nature Caius Lutorius Priscus a Roman knight was the author of an applauded poem on the death of Germanicus and for his composition had received a reward from Tiberius The crime laid to his charge was that when Drusus lay ill he prepared another elegy from which he hoped if the young prince died to derive still greater emolument With the vanity of a poet Lutorius read his verses at the house of Publius Petronius in the presence of Vitel lia the mother in law of that senator Several wo men of distinction were of the party As soon as the prosecutor opened the heads of his accusation the confidential friends of the author were struck with terror The fact was admitted by all except Vitellia she had the memory of a liberal minded woman and could recollect nothing Credit however was given to the rest of the evidence Haterius Agrippa con sul elect was the first to give his opinion he proposed that the unfortunate poet should suffer death 178 A U C 774 THE ANNALS L Manius Lepidus opposed the motion He spoke as follows  If in our deliberations conscript fathers  we advert to nothing but the flagitious sentiments  by which Lutorius has discovered the malignity of  his heart and wounded the ear of others neither  the dungeon nor the rope nor the torments which  the law ordains for slaves would be adequate to the enormity of his guilt But on the other hand  however great the depravity of mankind there are  degrees of punishment The clemency of the  prince interposes often to mitigate the rigour of the law the wisdom of our ancestors has delivered  down to us a system of justice founded in mercy  and you have on many occasions followed their  example If between error in judgment and malig  nity of heart a distinction is to be made if words  and criminal actions are not to be confounded the  case before us admits a sentence which at once will reach the offence and leave us no reason to blush either for our moderation or our severity The complaints of the emperor when the guilty by a  voluntary death have prevented the effect of his  clemency have been heard by us all Lutorius lives and should he continue to do so will the  state be in danger His death will neither pro  mote the public interest nor serve as an example to  others Productions such as his the effusions of a  wild and irregular fancy may well be left to flutter  for a time and then like all frivolous things to be  forgotten Nothing serious or important is to be ex  pected from him who betrays himself not in the  hearing of men but in a circle of women And my  voice is against him let him be condemned to ex  ile let his effects be confiscated let fire and water  be interdicted This is my opinion the same as I  should give had he been in due form convicted on  the law of violated majesty LI Rubellius Blandus of consular rank was the only person that assented to the opinion of Lepidus The rest concurred with Agrippa The poet was hur ried away and strangled in a dungeon Concerning these proceedings Tiberius wrote to the senate in his  1 22 179 OF TACITUS w style ambiguous and inexplicable He com  b led the zeal of the fathers even in a matter of 10 importance but he desired that for the future riu alone should not be punished with so much j pitation He praised the humanity of Lepidus yjt  ound no fault with Agrippa This produced a 1 e by which it was enacted that no sentence of  pronation should for the future be sent to the l ary till the tenth day after passing it and in the interval execution was to be suspended The fathers however were not to have the power of rejudging their own acts or revoking their sentence The ap peal was to be to Tiberius and no time could soften that implacable temper LII Caius Sulpicius and Decimus Heterius were the next consuls The year was free from foreign commotions but at Rome new laws were expected to check the growth of luxury and that apprehension spread a general alarm The prodigality of the times had risen to the highest pitch In many articles of expense and those the heaviest the real price might be concealed i but the cost of the table was too well understood The profusion with which luxury was maintained could not remain a secret It was there fore apprehended that a prince addicted to the fru gality of ancient manners would endeavour by severe i emulations to control the mischief The subject was opened in the senate by Caius Bi bulus one of the sediles his colleague joined to sup port him They stated that the sumptuary laws were fallen into contempt The extravagance in fur niture and utensils though prohibited grew every day more enormous insomuch that by modern pe nalties the mischief was not to be cured The se nate without further debate referred the whole to the consideration of the emperor Tiberius weighed every circumstance he knew that passions which had taken root could not be easily weeded out of the heart he considered how far coercive measures might be a public grievance If an unsuccessful attempt gave a victory to vice the defeat he saw would be a disgrace to government and tho necessity of waging 160 THE ANNALS A U C 775 continual war against the characters and fortunes of the most eminent citizens was what he wished to avoid After mature deliberation he sent his thoughts in writing to the senate in substance as follows LIU  Upon any other question conscript fathers  it would perhaps be expedient that I should attend  the debate in person and in my place lay before  you what I conceivo to be for the advantage of the  commonwealth At present it may be better that  my eyes should not survey the scene In so mixed  an assembly many no doubt by their looks and  manner might he apt to betray a consciousness of  their own vicious habits The attention of the se  nate would naturally fix upon such men and I 44 should of course be led to watch their behaviour 44 in that case the guilty would as it were be taken  in the fact Had the sediles whose zeal deserves  commendation applied in the first instance to me 1 should perhaps have thought it advisable to con  nive at vices that have gathered strength from time  rather than expose to the world the inveteracy of  the mischief and the feebleness of legal remedies  Those magistrates it must be acknowledged have  performed their duty with a spirit which every civil  officer would do well to emulate As to myself to remain silent were a desertion of the public and 1i to speak out may be impolitic The part which 1 sustain is neither that of sedile prsetor or consul  From the emperor something more than the minute  detail of business is expected The pre eminence  is painful while individuals claim the merit of all  the good that is done and if men transgress the  blame is transferred to the prince At the expense  of one all are guilty If a reform is in truth intend  ed where must it begin and how am I to restore 4i the simplicity of ancient times Must I abridge 44 your villas those vast domains where tracts of land are laid out for ornament Must I retrench the  number of slaves so great at present that every 44 family seems a nation in itself What shall be said  of massy heaps of gold and silver  of statues  wrought in brass and an infinite collection of pic A D 2 181 OF TACITUS  tures all indeed highly finished the perfection of art How shall we reform the taste for dress  which according to the reigning fashion is so ex  quisitely nice that the sexes are scarce distinguish  ed  How are we to deal with the peculiar articles  of female vanity and in particular with that rage  for jewels and precious trinkets which drains the  empire of its wealth and sends in exchange for  bawbles the money of the commonwealth to foreign  nations and even to the enemies of Rome LIV  That these abuses are the subject of dis  cussion at every table and the topic of complaint  in all private circles I am not now to learn And  yet let a law be made with proper sanctions and  the very men who call for a reform will be the  first to make objections The public peace they  will say is disturbed illustrious families are in  dangÂ r of ruin and all without distinction must  live in dread of rigorous inquiries and the harpies  of the law It is with the body politic as the body 4 natural in the latter chronical disorders in time  grown obstinate call for harsh and violent reme  dies Just so in the distempers of the mind the  heart sick to the very core with vice corrupted  and corrupting requires an antidote as strong as  the poison that inflames our passions Many whole  some laws were made by our ancestors and many  by Augustus  the former are grown obsolete and  the latter to the disgrace of the age are fallen  into contempt and by consequence luxury riots  without control The reason is obvious while  there is no law in force to1 prevent abuses men  proceed with caution that the magnitude of the  mischief may not provoke the authority of the le  gislature but when positive institutions are found  inadequate the case is very different unbridled  passions take their course with impunity and all  transgress without fear or shame  Why was frugality the practice of ancient times   because each individual was a law to himself he  knew how to moderate his desires because we â were then the inhabitants of a single city Eves Vol I â Q 182 A U C 775 THE ANNALS  Italy when reduced to subjection afforded but few  incentives to luxury Foreign victories taught us to dissipate the property of others and the civil wars   made us prodigal of our own But after all is the  mischief which the sediles make the ground of their  complaint the worst of our grievances  Compare it with other evils and it vanishes into nothing  Italy stands in need of foreign supplies and yet no  reformer tells us how much the commonwealth is  every day at the mercy of the winds and waves  The produce of colonies is imported to maintain  our pride and luxury to feed the master of the seil and to supply his slaves with the necessaries of life  Should those resources fail will our groves our vil  las and our spacious pleasure grounds be sufficient  to satisfy our wants  That care is left to the sove  reign Should he neglect that essential duty the  commonwealth is lost With regard to other evils  the remedy is in the breast of every individual Men of rank may be restrained by principle the  poor by indigence and the rich by satiety These  are my sentiments If notwithstanding any ma  gistrate should be of opinion that more may be done if he feels within himself vigour and indus  try to oppose the torrent I honour the firmness of  his character and cheerfully resign to abler hands a  great part of my own solicitude But when he has  declaimed against corruption if his zeal is to eva porate in a florid speech if the violence of party  resentments which his patriot cares have roused is  to point at me while the censor of the manners  enjoys the fame of his eloquence believe me con  script fathers I am not more than another ambi  tious of making enemies To encounter animosi  ties for the most part unprovoked and often   unjust is too much my lot at present and yet for  the interest of the community it is a tax which I am  willing to pay But if I deprecate new hostilities Â permit me with your consent to avoid all such as  may be excited without due consideration useless to  the state and to me big with every disadvantage LV This letter being read the senate released the A D 22 183 OP TACITUS rediles from all farther care about the business Lux ury went on with boundless profusion It began soon after the battle of Actium and continued to flourish for the space of a century down to the time when Galba attained the imperial dignity At that period the manners changed and temperance became the fashion Of this revolution in the modes of life a short account will not be improper While the old constitution still subsisted pomp and splendour were often the ruin of the most illustrious families To conciliate the favour of the populace and of the al lies of Rome including even kings and princes was the great object of a Roman citizen In proportion to his wealth his grandeur and the magnificence of his retinue his importance rose and with it the num ber of his clients But when the best blood in Rome was spilt by imperial tyranny and to be eminent was to be marked out for destruction it became the inter est of the great to lay aside all vain ostentation and adopt a more humble plan of life At the same time a new race of men from the municipal towns the co lonies and tire provinces found their way not only to Rome but even into the senate The strangers thus incorporated brought with them their natural parsimony In the course of a long life many of them either by their own frugality or a tide of success in their affairs accumulated immoderate riches yet even in affluence avarice was their ruling passion But the cause which above all others contributed to the revival of ancient economy was the character of Vespasian a man of primitive temperance and rigid austerity All agreed to imitate so excellent a model Respect for the priuce did more than all the pains and penalties of the law And yet it may be true that in the nature of things there is a principle of rotation in consequence of which the manners like the seasons are subject to periodical changes Nor is it certain that in the former ages of the world every thing was better than in the times that succeeded The present age has produced in moral conduct and the liberal arts a number of bright examples which posterity will do well to imitate May the contest with anti 184 A U C 775 THE ANNALS quity continue but let it be a generous emulation for superior virtue and may that spirit go down to fliture times LVI Tiberius gained by these proceedings a con siderable share of popularity His moderation in the business of the intended reform gave satisfaction to all ranks and conditions The people saw with plea sure the tribe of informers disappointed in their views In this favourable moment Tiberius by let ters to the senate desired that his son Drusus might be invested with the tribunitian dignity That spe cious title importing nothing less than sovereign power was invented by Augustus at a time when the name of king or dictator was not only unconsti tutional but universally detested And yet a new name was wanted to overtop the magistrates and the forms of the constitution In that power usurped Marcus Agrippa became his colleague  and after his death Tiberius Nero succeeded By the last promo tion it was the policy of Augustus to mark out the line of succession and thereby check the views of as  piring men He was sure that Tiberius would act an under part and besides his own name was a tower of strength Tiberius in the present juncture followed the precedent left by Augustus During the life of Germanrcus he held the balance even between the two young princes reserving to himself the power of deciding when he should see occasion In the letter which opened the matter to the senate after invoking the gods and fervently praying that the measure might be of advantage to the commonwealth he in troduced the character of Drusus but in a guarded style never exceeding the bounds of truth The prince he said had a wife and three children and was then of the age which he himself had attained when raised by Augustus to the same honour Nor eould the favour now requested be deemed prema ture Drusus had gone through a probation of eight years the proofs of his merit were seditions quelled wars happily terminated the splendour of a triumph and two consulships There was therefore no danger that he would be a novice in public business A D 22 183 OF TACITUS LVII The senate was not taken by surprise  the emperor s intention had been foreseen and flattery was ready with her servile strain Invention not withstanding was at a loss for novelty Statues were decreed to Tiberius and his son altars were raised to the gods temples were built and triumphal arches erected with other honours of a similar nature Mar cus Silanus aimed at something new Willing at the expense of the consular dignity to pay a compliment to the princes he proposed that in all public and pri vate registers the year should no longer take its date from the names of the consuls but from the persons invested with the tribunitian power Quintus Hate rius went still farther he moved that the decrees of that day should be fixed up in the senate house in letters of gold His motion was treated with con tempt and ridicule The fathers saw with indigna tion a superannuated senator who on the verge of life could incur present infamy without a prospect of future wages LVIII Amidst these transactions the government of Africa was continued to Junius Blsesus The proconsulship of Asia happening then to be vacant was demanded by Servius Maluginensis the priest of Jupiter In support of his claim he contended  that the inability of a priest in his station to go out  of Italy was a vulgar error The order to which  he belonged differed in nothing from that of Mars 44 and Romulus If the priest of the two last were  eligible to foreign governments whence arose his  incapacity  No prohibitory law was ever passed by the people the books of religious ceremonies are  silent on the subject In particular cases when the  ministers of Jupiter were detained either by illness  or by public business one of the pontiffs officiated  in his place After the tragical death of Cornelius  Merula a space of no less than seventy six years  elapsed without any nomination to the office did  the interests of religion suffer in the mean time   During that whole period the sacerdotal function  was suspended without prejudice to the established worship and why should not his absence be ex Q 2 186 A U C 775 THE ANNALS  cused during the year of proconsular government   That some of his predecessors had been restrained  by the authority of the chief pontiff was a fact not  to be controverted but the restraint in those cases  was the effect of private animosity At present by â Â the indulgence of the gods the chief pontiff is the  chief of men a stranger to all petty jealousies un  influenced by the cabals of a party and superior to  the little motives of a private station L1X Lentulus the augur and several other sena tors opposed the motion A debate ensued with so much diversity of opinion that the question was re ferred to tho decision of the supreme pontiff Tibe rius was not in haste to determine the point Irt his letters to the senate he mentioned nothing but the honours decreed to Drusus on his elevation to the tribunitian power and those he thought good to mo dify with certain restrictions He censured in direct terms the resolution proposed by Silanus and4 like wise the motion of Haterius for fixing up the decrees in letters of gold condemning both as unconstitu tional and repugnant to ancient usage Letters from Drusus were at the same time read in the senate modest in the style and turn of expression but in the general opinion denoting prido and arrogance  Rome they said  was reduced to an humble con  dition when a young man raised to the highest dig 5 nity declines to return thanks to the gods in their own temples when he disdains to honour the se  nate with his presence and refuses to attend ihe  usual auspices in his native city Was it war that  detained him i or did he dread the inconvenience of  a long jÂ urney when he was only visiting the coast  of Campania or pursuing his pleasures on the lakes  This is the education of him who is to be the fu  ture master of the Roman world  He is tutored in the political school of his father Tiberius may  have his reasons for withdrawing himself from the  public eye the infirmities of age and the labours of his life afford a colourable pretext but for  Drusus what apology can be made  Pride rank  pride is his only motive A D 22 OF TACITUS LX To strengthen the foundation of his own power was the constant policy of Tiberius Intent on that object he still preserved the forms of the consti tution and amused the senate with a phantom of li berty All petitions from the provinces were referred to that assembly About this time the right of hav ing sanctuaries and of multiplying the number with out limitation was assumed by all the cities of Greece The temples in that country were crowded by the most abandoned slaves debtors screened them selves from their creditors and criminals fled from justice The magistrates were no longer able to con trol a seditious populace who carried their crimes under a mask of piety to the altar of their gods An order was therefore made that the several cities should send their deputies to Rome with a state of their respective claims Some places finding their pretensions brought to the test thought proper to de cline the inquiry The rights of others were founded on traditional superstition and superstition was not willing to renounce her errors Some of the cities relied on the merit of their ancestors in the service of Rome The business came at length to a hearing A day more august and splendid cannot be figured to the imagination We now behold a Roman senate sitting in judgment on the grants of the old republic discussing the treaties and conventions of confederate nations deliberating on the acts of kings while kings were able to make a stand against the power of Rome and above all reviewing the various systems of reli gion which had been for ages established in the be lief of mankind These were the important subjects and to give still greater dignity to the scene the se nate met as was the practice in good times with authority to inquire and liberty to determine LXI The case of the Ephesians was the first brought forward It was stated in their behalf that Diana and Apollo were not as generally supposed born in the ishf of Delos but in the Ortygian Grove on the banks of the river Cenchri which flows with in the territories of Ephesus In that sacred recess Latona taking shelter under an olive tree was deli 188 THE ANNALS A U C 775 vered of those two deities The tree was still to be seen in a flourishing state and the grove became a consecrated spot It was there that Apollo after having slain the Cyclops found a retreat from the vengeance of Jupiter it was there that Bacchus af ter his victories gave a free pardon to such of the Amazons as fled for protection to the altar and it was there that Hercules having conquered Lydia established a temple with rites and ceremonies which neither the Persian kings nor the Macedonian con queror presumed to violate The Romans at all times paid the strictest regard to the sanctity of the place LXII The Magnesians were the next in order They relied on the ordinances of Lucius Scipio con firmed and ratified by Lucius Sylla the former vic torious over Antiochus and the latter over Mithri datcs In the wars which were waged under their conduct the Magnesians adhered with fidelity to the cause of Home and to reward their services the temple of Diana Leucophryne was by those com manders declared a sanctuary The people of Aphro disium and also of Stratonice produced a decree of Csesar the dictator and another of Augustus com memorating the zeal with which those states with stood the Parthian invasion and preserved to the last their attachment to the interest of Rome The Aphro disians claimed the temple of Venus the Stratoni ceans worshipped Jupiter and Diana Trivia The city of Hierocsesarea deduced their ceremonies from remote antiquity alleging that they had for ages adored a Persian Diana in a temple consecrated by Cyrus Several orders made by Pcrpenna by Isauricus and other Roman generals were also cited whereby it appeared that those sanctuaries with a precinct two miles round were declared holy ground The inhabitants of Cyprus claimed three sanctuaries the first and most ancient dedicated by Aerias to the Paphian Venus the second by Amathus the son of Aerias in honour of the Amathusian Venus and tlis third to the Salaminian Jove by Teucer the son of Telamon when that hero was obliged to fly from thÂ rcge of his father A Oi 1ACITUS 18  LXIII Several other cities appeared by their de puties but the senate weary of the number and of the party spirit with which different places were espoused came to a resolution to refer the whole to the consuls and wait their report on the merits of each distinctive case The consuls went through the inquiry Besides the temples already mentioned they found at Pergamos the sanctuary of iEsculapius  confirmed by authentic proof The titles of other places being all deduced from ages too remote were lost in the darkness of antiquity In this number was the oracle of Apollo by which it was pretended that the people of Smyrna were commanded to build a temple to Venus Stratonice and another of the same god directing a temple and a statue to Nep tune in the isle of Tenos The Sardians and the people of Miletus were content with a more modern date The former relied on the privileges granted by Alexander and the latter on the authority of Darius Diana was the tutelar deity in one of those cities and Apollo in the other The statue of Au gustus was held to be a sanctuary by the inhabitants of Crete Several decrees were passed with due at tention to the religious tenets of the people yet limiting the number of sanctuaries These regula tions were ordered to be engraved in brass and fixed up in the respective temples as lasting monuments to ascertain the rights now established and prevent the future claims of national pride or Blind super stition LXIV About this time a fit of illness threatened the life of Livia Her danger was so alarming that it occasioned the emperor s return to Rome Hitherto the mother and son had lived on terms of mutual regard or at worst with hatred well disguised Li via not long before had raised a statue to Augustus near1 the theatre of Marcellus In the votive inscrip tion her own name preceded that of the emperor To the jealous temper of Tiberius this was an offence against the imperial dignity His resentment how ever was suppressed and for that reason was thought to haTe sunk the deeper The senate proceeded 1 190  THE ANNALS A U C 775 order supplications for the recovery ofLivia with so lemn games on the occasion in which the pontiffs the augurs the college of fifteen with that of the septemvirs and the sodality of Augustan priests were to conduct the ceremonies Lucius Apronius moved that the heralds at arms should likewise officiate Tiberius opposed the motion It proceeded he said on a mistaken principle He mentioned the distinct functions of the several orders of the priesthood and made it clear from ancient precedents that the he rald had never been admitted to that participation of honour The fraternity of Augustan priests was call ed forth with good reason since that order belonged in a peculiar manner to the family for which public vows were to be offered LXV To give in detail the several motions and resolutions of the time is not within the plan of this work And yet when virtue and fair integrity do honour to the heart or when a slavish spirit brands the character in either case it is my intention to se lect the particular instances In this I apprehend consists the chief part of the historian s duty It is his to rejudge the conduct of men that generous ac tions may be snatched from oblivion and that the author of pernicious counsels and the perpetrator of evil deeds may see beforehand the infamy that awaits them at the tribunal of posterity In general a black and shameful period lies before me The age was sunk to the lowest depth of sordid adulation in somuch that not only the most illustrious citizens in order to secure their pre eminence were obliged to crouch and bend the knee but men of consular and prsetorian rank and the whole body of the senate tried with emulation which should be the most obse quious slave We are informed by tradition that Tiberius as ofi en as he went from the senate house was used to say in Greek  Devoted men how they  rush headlong into bondage Even he the enemy of civil liberty was disgusted with adulation he played the tyrant and despised the voluntary slave LXVI From acts of base compliance the next step of degenerate men was to deeds of horror Caius Si A L tan us proconsul of Asia was accused of rapine and extortion by the people of the province The conduct of the cause was undertaken by Mamercus Scaurus of consular rank  by Junius Otho at that time prav tor and Brutidius Niger one of the sediles The complaint was aggravated by an additional charge of irreverence to the divinity of Augustus and disaffec tion to Tiberius Mamercus affected to grace himself by citing the bright examples of a former day Scipio Africanus he observed prosecuted Lucius Cotta Cato the censor appeared against Servius Galba an d Marcus Scaurus against Publius Rutilius as if those great and excellent men had instituted prosecu tions for constructive crimes like the present as if Scaurus the grandfather of the prosecutor had de scended to so vile an office It was reserved for Ma mercus to degenerate into an informer and tarnish the lustre of his ancestors Junius Otho another pro secutor had been by profession the teaches of a school Raised from that obscurity by the patronage of Seja nus he obtained a seat in the senate and hoped by flagitious deeds to efface the meanness of his origin Brutidius was a different character Adorned with liberal accomplishments and formed for great things he was sure of reaching the first honours of the state had he been willing to walk in the paths of virtue His impatience ruined him Eager to outstrip his equals and then to rise over his superiors he enlarged his views and began to soar above his most flattering hopes but his ambition led him to the precipice from which good men have often fallen when not content with slow but sure success they have hurried on with too much ardour and ended their career in ruin LXVII Gellius Poplicola who had been qurastor to Silanus and Marcus Paconius his lieutenant listed on the side of the prosecution Silanus beyond all doubt was guilty both of rapine and oppression  but in his case a number of circumstances dangerous even to innocence conspired against him Besides the persons already mentioned the most able orators of Asia men who were chosen on account of their eloquence united their strength Against that pow  192 THE ANNALS A U C 775 erful combination Silanus stood alone obliged with out any powers of oratory to make his own defence with fear and trembling a situation that might disarm the noblest talents Tiberius helped to increase his difficulties With a stern tone of voice and a con tracted brow he pressed the defendant with sudden questions never suffering him to pause a moment either to repel or elude the charge Silanus was obliged to admit several points rather than seem to refute or baffle the inquiry of the emperor His very slaves to make them competent witnesses were sold by auction to the public officer and to make de struction sure Tiberius added the crime of violated majesty that none of the prisoner s family or friends might presume to assist in the defence Silanus de sired an adjournment of a few days In thatinterval abandoning all his hopes he sent a memorial to Ti berius in a style sufficiently humble but still with the spirit of a man who felt himself oppressed and dared to speak the language of reproach LXVI1I Tiberius remained inflexible but to give the colour of precedent to his final sentence he or 4 dcred the proceedings against Volesus Messala who had also been proconsul of Asia with the record of Augustus and the decree made on that occasion to be read He then collected the votes beginning with Lucius Piso That senator after some flou rishes in praise of the emperor s clemency concluded that Silanus should be interdicted from fire and wa ter and banished to the isle of Gyarus The fathers concurred in the same opinion when Cneius Lentu lus proposed by way of mitigation that the estate which descended to Silanus from his mother should not be included in the general forfeiture but vested in the grandson Tiberius agreed to the amendment The business seemed to be at an end when Cornelius Dolabella rose to show that his servile spirit had not deserted him He launched out into a sharp invec tive against the morals of Silanus grafting on it a motion that no man of dissolute manners should be eligible to the government of provinces and of this incapacity the emperor should be the the sole judge  A Â 22 OF TACITUS 193  When a crime is committed the law takes cogni  sanco of it and inflicts the punishment But a law  to prevent the offence would be at once an act of  mercy to bad men and a blessing to the provinces LXIX Tiberius spoke in reply   To the reports he said  which were current to the disadvantage of  Silanus he was no stranger But laws ought to  have a better foundation than public rumour The V governors of provinces had often disappointed the  hopes and sometimes the fears of mankind By  important scenes of action the powers of the mind  are roused the heart expands to meet the occasion  while on the other hand feeble spirits shrink from  a great opportunity and grow less by elevation  The prince can never be fully informed and it is  not fit that he should see with the eyes of others  The arts of ambitious rivals may deceive him In  human affairs nothing can be foreseen with certain  ty and without facts laws can have no operation  Till men have acted they cannot be judged It  was the wisdom of our ancestors to keep the sword  of justice in the scabbard till actual offences drew  it forth In a system so just in itself and so long  established innovations ought not to be rashly made  The cares of government are a burden to the sove  reign and his prerogative wants no enlargement  Extend his authority and you abridge the rights of the subjÂ ct When the laws in being are suffi  cient there is no occasion to resort to the will of the  prince This was no doubt a constitutional speech Fronv a man little studious of popularity it was received with universal approbation Tiberius did not stop here whon his own private resentment was not pro voked ho knew that moderation was the best policy with that view he thought proper to add that Gya rus was a dreary island uncultivated and inhospita ble In honour therefore of the Julian family and from motives of lenity to a man who was a member of the senate he proposed to change the place of ba nishment to the isle of Cythera and this he said was the request of Torquata sister to Silanus and a Vol I â R 141E Ai 4iS jA U C 775 vesta virgin of distinguished sanctity The fathers ed the prosecution and sentence of condemnation was pronounced Lucius Ennius a Roman knigkt who had melted down a silver statue of the emperor and converted it to domestic uses was accused on the law of majesty Tiberius stopt the proceedings Against this act of lenity Ateius Capito protested openly contending with an air of ancient liberty that  the right of the senate to hear and determine  ought not to be retrenched especially when a crime  of that magnitude called for vindictive justice The  prince in his own case might be slow to resent but  let him not be generous at the expense of the pub  lie This language blunt as it was gave no offence to Tiberius he saw the drift of the speech and dis regarding the tone with which it was uttered persisted in his resolution Capito brought disgrace on his name Accomplished as he was in the science of laws both human and divine he possessed besides a num ber of virtues that adorned his private character but by this act of servile flattery he sullied the lustre of a distinguished name LXXI A question that concerned a point of reli gion was the next subject of debate The Roman knights had vowed a statue for the recovery of Livia to fortune the equestrian In what temple this should be placed was the doubt At Rome there were various structures sacred to the goddess but none un der that specific title Upon inquiry it was found that there was at Antium a temple with that particu lar denomination and it being Considered that the whole system of rites and ceremonies and the several temples and images of the gods throughout Italy were subject to the supreme authority of Rome it was resolved that the votive present should be placed  Antium This being a point of religious ceremony iberius took the opportunity to determine the ques n which had been for some time in suspense con rning Servius Maluginensis the priest of Jupiter  A D 22 J op tacitus 195 He produced and read a decree of the pontifical col lege whereby it appeared that the priest of Jupiter when his health required it or when he obtained a dispensation from the supreme pontiff might absent himself from the duties of his function two nights at most provided it was not during the public ceremo nies nor more than twice in the course of the year From this regulation made by Augustus it was evi dent that a year s absence and of course a proconsu lar government was incompatible with the sacerdotal function The authority of Lucius Metellus who when high pontiff would not suffer Aulus Posthu mius a priest of Jupiter to depart from Rome was also cited It followed that the province of Asia could not be granted to Maluginensis It fell to the lot of the person of consular rank who stood next in seniority LXXII During these transactions Marcus Lepi dus petitioned the senate for leave to repair and de corate at his own expense the basilisk of Paulus that noble monument of the 2milian family The display of private munificence in public works which embellished the city wus not yet fallen into disuse In the reign of Augustus without any objection from that emperor Taurus Phillippus and Balbus with the spoils which they had taken from the enemy or with the superfluity of their own immoderate wealth added greatly to the ornament of Rome and by con sequence to the honour of their families Encou raged by this example hut with a fortune much infe rior Lepidus revived the glory of his ancestors The theatre of Pompey had been destroyed by fire ana the remaining branches of the family not being equal to the expense of so great a structure Tiberius de clared his intention to build a new edifice with the original name He congratulated the senate that the damage occasioned by the late fire was confined to that single building For this he said they were obliged to the vigilance of Sejanus The senate decreed a statue to be placed in the theatre of Pom pey in honour of the favourite In a short time af 1 THE    terwards when triumpl  â    Junius Blsesus the proconsul or jiinca numux made no scruple to declare that his motive for be stowing that high reward was to pay a compliment to Sejanus as the proconsul was his uncle LXXIII I Blsesus however had fairly earned his honours Tacfarinas often repulsed was never de feated He found resources in the interior parts of Africa and returned to the conflict with new vigour He had at length the arrogance to send an embassy to Tiberius demanding lands for himself and hia army or nothing should make an end of the war Ti berius it is said was upon no occasion so little mas ter of himself It was an insult to the imperial  majesty and the Roman name Shall a deserter  a wandering vagabond presume to treat on equal terms Even Spartacus though he had defeated  consular armies and spread desolation with sword  and fire through the realms of Italy was not allow  ed to negotiate terms of peace though the com  monwealth at that time was well nigh exhausted  by Sertorius and the Mithridatic war Even then no compromise was admitted the dignity of the  state was saved And shall a flourishing empire de  scer d so low as to compound with Tacfarinas and  by granting lands become the purchaser of peace  at the hands of a freebooter and a robber Stung by these reflections Tiberius ordered Blsesus to se duce the followers of Tacfarinas by promises of a free pardon to all who should lay down their arms but as to their chief he must strain every nerve to secure the person of that daring adventurer LXXIV The promised amnesty reduced the num bers of the enemy and Blsesus adopting a new mode of war turned the arts of the wily Numidian against himself Unequal to the legions in a pitched battle Tacfarinas depended altogether upon the rapidity of his motions he divided his men into small parties he showed himself in sudden incursions fled before a regular force and knew where to lie in ambush The Romans accordingly marched in three columns by as A D 22 J OF TACITUS 197 many different routes In the quarter where the Africans ravaged the country near Leptis and then fled for shelter to the Germantcs Cornelius Scipio the proconsul s lieutenant advanced with his divi sion In another quarter where Cirta lay exposed to the barbarians the younger Blecsus the proconsul s bob commanded a second detachment ln tliB inter mediate part of the country the commander jn chief marched at the head of a chosen body of troops At all convenient places he threw up entrenchments and appointed garrisons securing every station by a regular chain of posts The barbarians found themselves counteracted on every s de Wherever they turned the Romans were at hand in front in flank and in the rear Numbers were surrounded and either put to the sword or taken prisoners To spread the alarm the Roman army was again subdivided into smaller parties un der the command of centurions of approved valour and experience Nor was the campaign closed as osual at the end of the summer Instead of retiring to winter quarters in the old provinces Blsesus kept the field he increased the number of his posts and garrisons and sent out detachments lightly armed with guides acquainted with the course of the coun try Tacfarinas could no longer stand at bay He shifted his huts and wandered from place to place At length his brother was taken prisoner and Blsesus thought it time to close the campaign His retreat was sudden and premature The province was still open to incursions and the flame of war though suppressed was not extinguished Tiberius how ever considered the enemy as completely vanquished Besides the honours already granted to Blsesus he ordered that the legions should salute him by the title of Imferator according to the ancient custom of the Roman armies in the pride of victory flushed with the generous ardour of warlike spirits In the time of the republic this was a frequent custom in somuch that several at the same time without pre s or distinction enjoyed that military honour R 2 Il was often allowed by Augustus ana Â Â â žy Zi  us for the last time With him the
