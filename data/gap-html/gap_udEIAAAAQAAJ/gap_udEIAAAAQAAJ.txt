   1 THE FIRST AND THIRTY THIRD BOOKS OF PLINY S NATURAL HISTORY A SPECIMEN OF A PROPOSED TRANSLATION OF THE WHOLE WORK WITH NOTES c By JOHN BOSTOCK M D F R S L S 6 S AND H S H R I MEMBER OF THE MEDICO CHIRURQICAL OF THE ASTRONOMICAL AND OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETIES C C LONDON PRINTED FOR BALDWIN AND CRADOCK 1828 2a L  C Baldwin Printer New Bridge street London PREFACE The Natural History of Pliny has been always regarded as one of the most precious remains of anti quity I conceive therefore that it will be unnecessary for me to make any observations either on the value of the original or on the addition that our literature would receive from a correct translation of it It may be suffi cient to remark that it will enable us to learn the state both of the sciences and of the arts among the Romans and to ascertain the progress which they had made in the knowledge of nature My object in the proposed work is to present the English reader with a faithful translation and to give it as much as possible in the style of the original That this is an undertaking of some difficulty every one will admit who is acquainted with the variety of topics on which the author treats and with the mode in which he conveys his information Partly owing to the imperfect state of the manuscripts and partly depending on the nature of the subject we are frequently at a loss to develope the meaning of the author and where we have not this obstacle to contend against it is often difficult to transfer the meaning into our language without destroy ing the air of the original With respect to notes and illustrations it is not easy for a translator to prescribe to himself the correct method which he ought to pursue Without some assistance of this kind the text would be often unintelligible and yet to give all that might be appended in the way of com mentary would lead to an endless accumulation of matter B 2 4 PREFACE Feeling these difficulties and aware of the quantity of time and labour that must necessarily be devoted to such an undertaking even in the most favourable circum stances I have resolved to lay before the public the fol lowing specimen of the manner in which I propose to execute the translation in order that they may judge of my competency to the undertaking and that I may be able to profit by any remarks that are made on this portion of the work in the farther prosecution of it I have selected the 33d book in addition to the 1st as one with which I was previously familiar and which I think may be considered as exhibiting a fair specimen of the merits of the original 1 Upper Bedford Place Sept 23 1828 1 The editions of Pliny which I have used are that of Dalecamp fol Franc 1599 of De Laet 12mo Elz L B 1635 the Var of Gronovius 8vo L B 1669 and that of Valpy 8vo Lond 1826 which may be considered as combining the editions of Harduin and Brotier I have generally followed the text of this edition I have frequently found advantage in referring to the translation of Holland a writer highly commendable for his diligence but whose style which must have been at all times harsh and paraphrastical is now completely antiquated His translation was published in 1635 he appears to have followed the text of Dalecamp The French translation of Pinet published in 1566 allowing for the period when it was written is a work of much merit but it has been superseded by the elaborate translation executed by Poinsinet de Sivri in conjunction with other learned individuals which was published between the years 1771 and 1782 The text of Harduin has been employed in this work The sense of the author is given with correctness and elegance but I conceive that the translator has failed in conveying an idea of the style of the original Something may pro bably depend on the idiom of the French language which does not easily admit of the concise abruptness which is so characteristic of Pliny I conceive it to be the duty of a translator to transfuse into his version as far as it can be accomplished not merely the ideas of the author but the language in which they are cloathed THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PLINY BOOK I DEDICATION C PLINIUS SECUNDUS TO HIS FRIEND TIT0S VESPASIAN This treatise on Natural History a novel work in Roman literature which I have just completed I have determined to dedicate in a diffuse epistle to you most pleasant1 emperor an appellation peculiarly suitable to you while on account of his age it is less appropriate to your illustrious father For still thou ne er would st quite despise The trifles that I write if I may be allowed to quote the words of Catullus my fellow countryman 3 a military term which you well understand For he as you know by altering the old words  made himself some 1 Jucundissime it is not easy to find an epithet in our language which will cerrectly express the meaning of the original at the same time that it is sufficiently dignified and respectful â Lamb s trans Carm i 1 4 of the original 3 Conterraneus we have no word in English which expresses the idea intended by the original and which is at the same time a military term There is indeed some reason to doubt whether the word now inserted in the text was the one employed by the author see note in Valpy p 174 also an observation in Cigalino s dissertation on the native country of Pliny in Valpy p 8  Permutatis prioribus seetabis  it appears that what were commonly called sudaria napkins Catullus calls sudaria Saetaba Ssetabian napkins Carm xii 14 xxv 7 probably from their having been made at Saetabis the individuals mentioned in the text who as Catullus informs us gave him the napkins had visited Sfctabis in a military capacity see Lamb s Catullus p 135 and 149 6 DEDICATION what obscure because he was anxious that his works should please his friends the Veranioli and the Fabulli At the same time this my importunity may effect what you complained of my not having done in another too forward epistle of mine it will put upon record and let all the world know on what terms of equality you live with us You who have had the honour of a triumph and of the censorship have been six times consul and have shared in the tribunate and what is still more honourable whilst you held them in conjunction with your father you have presided over the equestrian order and have been the prefect of the praetorians 5 all this you have done for the service of the republic and at the same time have regarded me as a fellow soldier and a messmate Nor has the extent of your prosperity produced any change in you except that it has given you the power of doing good to the utmost of your wishes And whilst all these circumstances increase the veneration which other persons feel for you with respect to myself they have made me so bold as to wish to become more familiar You must therefore place this to your own account and blame yourself for any fault of this kind that I may commit But although I have laid aside my blushes 6 I have not gained my object for you still awe me and keep me at a distance by the majesty of your understanding In no one does the force of eloquence and of tribunitian oratory blaze out more powerfully With what glowing language do you thunder forth the praises of your father How dearly do you love your brother How admirable is your talent for poetry What a fertility of genius do you possess so as to enable you to imitate your bro ther But who is there that is bold enough to form an estimate on these points if he is to be judged by you and more especially if you are challenged to do so For the case of those who merely publish their works is very different from that of those who expressly dedicate them to you In the former case I might say 5 The narrative of Suetonius may serve to illustrate the observation of Pliny Triumphavit Titus cum patre censuramque gessit una Eidem collega et in tribunicia potestate et in septem consularibus fuit Recep taque ad se prope omnium officiorum cura cum patris nomine et epistolas ipse dictaret et edicta conscriberet orationesque in Senatu recitaret etiam quaestoris vice prefecturam quoque prtetorii suscepit nunquam ad id tempus nisi ab Equite Romano administratum Valpy s ed p 946 6  Perfricui faciem see note in Valpy p 176 DEDICATION 7 Emperor  why do you read these things They are written only for the common people for farmers or mechanics or for those who have nothing else to do why do you trouble yourself with them Indeed when I undertook this work I did not expect that you would sit in judgment on me I considered your situation much too elevated for you to descend to such an office Besides we possess the right of openly rejecting the opinion of men of learn ing M Tullius himself whose genius is beyond all competition uses this privilege and remarkable as it may appear employs an advocate in his own defence I do not write for very learned people I do not wish my works to be read by Manius Persius but by Junius Congus 8 And if Lucilius who first introduced the satirical style applied such a remark to himself and if Cicero thought proper to borrow it and that more especially in his treatise De Republica how much more reason have I to do so who have such a judge to defend myself against And by this very dedication I have deprived myself of the benefit of chal lenge IO for it is a very different thing whether a person has a judge given him by lot or whether he voluntarily selects one and we always make more preparation for an invited guest than for one that comes in unexpectedly When the candidates for office during the heat of the canvass deposited the fine in the hands of Cato that determined opposer of bribery rejoicing as he did in his being rejected from what he considered to be foolish honours they professed to do this out of respect to his integrity the greatest glory which a man could attain It was on this occasion that M Cicero uttered the noble ejaculation How happy are you Marcus Porcius of whom no one dares to ask what is dishonourable When L Scipio Asiati cus appealed to the tribunes among whom was Gracchus he expressed full confidence that he should obtain an acquittal even from a judge who was his enemy Thus it appears that every one 7 Non eras in hoc albo see note inValpy p 177 A passage in Quintilian lib xii cap 4 p 688 may serve to illustrate this use of the term album quorum alii se ad album ac rubricas transtule runt 8 Cicero refers to this remark of Lucilius s in two of his other works although with a variation in the expression and in the individuals specified De Orat lib ii sec 6 and De Fin lib i sec 3 9 Qui primus condidit styli nasum 1Â  Sed haec ego mihi nunc patrocinia ademi nuncupatioue O DEDICATION has the power of making whomever he may select an absolute judge in his own cause and hence it is termed an appeal 11 I am well aware that placed as you are in the very highest station and gifted with the most splendid eloquence and the most accomplished mind even those who come to pay their respects to you do it with a kind of veneration on this account I ought to be careful that what is dedicated to you should be worthy of you But the country people and indeed some whole nations offer milk to the Gods 12 and those who cannot procure frankincense substi tute in its place salted cakes for the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are worshipped by every one to the best of his ability But my temerity will appear the greater by the consideration that these little volumes which I dedicate to you are of such inferior importance For they do not allow of the display of genius nor indeed is mine one of the highest order they admit of no excursions nor orations nor discussions nor of any wonder ful adventures nor any variety of transactions nor from the barrenness of the matter of any thing particularly pleasant in the narration or agreeable to the reader The nature of things and life as it actually exists are described in them and often the lowest department of it so that in very many cases I am obliged to use rude and foreign or even barbarous terms and these often require to be formally introduced by a kind of preface And besides this my road is not a beaten track nor one which the mind is much disposed to travel over There is no one among us who has ever attempted it nor is there any one individual among the Greeks who has treated of all the topics Most of us seek for nothing but amusement in our studies while others are fond of subjects that are of excessive subtilty and completely involved in obscurity My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks include in the Encyclopedia 3 which however are either â jot generally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious eonceits And there are other matters which many writers have Provocatio calling forth See the authors referred to in the note in Valpy p 180 to which the ollowing passages may be added from Tibullus â Et placidum soleo spargere lacte Palem Lib i El 1 36 Lacte madens illic suberat Pan ilicis umbra ii 5 27 and an additional one from the Fasti of Ovid â Lac dabat ilia Deo v 121 Orbem doctrince sic Graci vocant note in Valpy p 130 DEDICATION 2 given so much in detail that we quite loathe them It is indeed no easy task to give novelty to what is old and authority to what is new brightness to what is become tarnished and light to what is obscure to render what is slighted acceptable and what is doubtful worthy of our confidence to give to all a natural manner and to each its peculiar nature It is sufficiently honour able and glorious to have been willing even to make the attempt although it should prove unavailing And indeed I am of opinion that the studies of those are more especially worthy of our regard who after having overcome all difficulties prefer the useful office of assisting others to the mere gratification of giving pleasure and this is what I have already done in some of my former works I confess it surprises me that T Livius so celebrated an author as he is in one of the books of his history of the city from its origin should begin with this remark  I have now obtained a sufficient reputation so that I might put an end to my work did not my restless mind require to be supported by employment Certainly he ought to have composed this work not for his own glory but for that of the Roman name and of the people who were the conquerors of all other nations It would have been more meritorious to have persevered in his labours from his love of the work than from the gratification which it afforded himself and to have accomplished it not for his own sake but for that of the Roman people I have included in thirty six u books 20 000 topics all worthy of attention for as Domitius Piso says we ought to make not merely books but valuable collections gained by the perusal of about 2 000 volumes few only of which are in the hands of the studious on account of the obscurity of the subjects procured by the careful examination of 100 select authors and to these I have made considerable additions of things which were either not known to my predecessors or which have been lately discovered Nor can I doubt but that there still remain many things which I  have omitted For I am a mere mortal and one that has many oc cupations I have been therefore obliged to compose this work at interrupted intervals indeed during the night so that you will find I have not been idle even during this period The day I de vote to you exactly portioning out my sleep to the necessity of my 14 Quem primum historic PlinianiE librum vocamus nunc ipse non numerat note in Valpy p 181 10 DEDICATION health and contenting myself with this reward that while we are musing on these subjects according to the remark of Varro we are adding to the length of our lives for life properly exists in being awake In consideration of these circumstances and these difficulties I dare promise nothing but you have done me the most essential service in permitting me to inscribe my work to you Nor does this merely give a sanction to it but it determines its value for things are often conceived to be of great value solely because they are consecrated in temples I have given a full account of all your familyâ your father yourself and your brother in a history of our own times begin ning where Aufidius Bassus concludes You will ask Where it is It has been long completed and its accuracy confirmed 1 other wise I had determined to commit the charge of it to my heirs lest I should have been suspected during my life time of having been unduly influenced by ambition By this means I confer an obligation on those who occupy the same ground with myself and also on posterity who I am aware will contend with me as I have done with my predecessors You may judge of my disposition from my having inserted in my book the names of the authors that I have consulted For I conceive it to be courteous and to indicate an ingenuous modesty to acknowledge the source whence we have derived assistance and not act as most of those have done whom I have examined For I must inform you that in consulting various authors I have dis covered that some of the most grave and of the latest writers have transcribed word for word from former works without making any acknowledgment Not avowedly rivalling them in the manner of Virgil or with the candour of Cicero who in his treatise De Republica professes to be the companion of Plato and in his Essay on consolation for his Daughter calls himself the follower of Crantor and of Panaecius in his Offices 16 volumes which you well know ought not merely to be always in our hands but to be learned by heart For it is indeed the mark of a perverted mind 1s  Jam pridem peracta sancitur 16 The following is probably the passage in the Offices to which Pliny refers â Panaetius igitur qui sine controversia de officiis accuratissirrie disputavit quemque nos correctione quadam adhibita potissimum secuti sumus Lib iii sec 2 DEDICATION 11 and an unhappy disposition to prefer being caught in a theft to returning what we have borrowed especially when we have realized a capital after paying ample interest for it 17 The Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles One work they called Kvptov which means the Honeycomb another Kijpaj A xaXfeaj or Cornu copiae so that you might expect to get even a draught of pigeon s milk from it 18 Then they have their Flowers their Muses Magazines Manuals Gardens Pictures and Sketches all of them titles for which a man might be tempted even to forfeit his bail But when you enter upon the works oh ye Gods and Goddesses how full of emptiness Our duller countrymen have simply their Antiquities or their Examples or their Arts I think one of the most humorous has his Lamp Studies 20 a term employed by Bibaculus a name which he richly deserved 1 Varro indeed is not much behind him when he calls some of his satires A Trick and a Half and Turning the Tables Diodorus was the first among the Greeks who laid aside this trifling manner and named his history The Library Apion the grammarian indeedâ he whom Tiberius Caesar called the trumpet of the world but who should rather seem to be the drum of common report â sup posed that every one to whom he inscribed any work would thence acquire immortality I do not regret not having given my work a more fanciful title That I may not however appear so completely to inveigh against the Greeks I should wish to be considered under the same point of view with those inventors of the arts of painting and sculpture of whom you will find an account in these volumes  Cum prasertim sors fiat ex usura 18  Lac gallinaceum Proverbium de re singulari et admodum rara see note in Valpy p 184 19 The titles in the original are given in Greek I have inserted in the text the words whicli the most nearly resemble them and which

that we are never satis fied with admiring them are inscribed with a temporary title 1 such as Apelles or Polycletus was doing this implying that the art was in its infancy and still imperfect and that the artist might benefit by the criticisms that were made on his work and alter any part that required it if he had not been prevented by death It is also a great mark of their modesty that they inscribed all their works as if they were the last which they had executed and as still in hand at the time of their death I think there are but three works of art which are inscribed positively with the words such a one executed this of these I shall give an account in the proper place In these cases it appears that the artist felt the most perfect satisfaction with his work and hence these pieces were the most eagerly sought after I indeed freely admit that much may be added to my works not only to this but to all which I have published By this admission I hope to escape from the carping critics 6 and I have the more reason to say this because I hear that there are certain Stoics and Dialecticians and also Epicureans from the Gramma rians I expected as much who are big with something against the little work I published on Grammar and that they have been carrying these abortions for ten years togetherâ a longer preg nancy this than the elephant s But I well know that even a woman once wrote against Theophrastus a man so eminent in eloquence that he obtained the title of the Divine and that thence originated the proverb of choosing a tree to hang oneself 27 I cannot refrain from quoting the words of Cato the censor which are so pertinent to this point It appears from them that even Cato who wrote commentaries on military discipline and who had learned the military art under Africanus or rather under Hannibal for he could not endure Africanus who when he was his general had borne away the triumph from him that Cato I say was open to the attacks of such as caught at reputation for themselves by detracting from the merits of others What then s Pendenti titulo see note in Valpy p 187 56 Homeromastigse a7 Suspendio jam quserere mortem oportere homines

who will do all they can to depreciate it and especially such as are themselves void of all merit but I let their harangues glide by me Nor was the remark of Plancus a bad one when Asinius Pollio was said to be preparing an oration against him which was to be published either by himself or his children after the death of Plancus in order that he might not be able to answer it It is only ghosts that fight with the dead This remark gave such a blow to the oration that in the opinion of the learned generally nothing was ever thought more scandalous Feeling myself therefore secure against these

diligently search after in various ways within the earth In some cases we dig for the purpose of obtain ing riches searching at the expense of our lives for gold silver electrum 1 and copper In some cases for the purposes of luxury we search for gems and for pigments to adorn our walls and our fingers while in others we rashly search for iron which for the purposes of war and slaughter is more acceptable even than gold We trace out all the veins of the earth and live upon it hollowed out as it is and then wonder that it should occa sionally yawn and tremble as if all this could be dug out of our sacred parent without her expressing her anger We descend into her very bowels and we search for treasures even in the lower 1 Electrum is described in sec 23 as gold mixed with a certain propor tion of silver The word Electrum is likewise used to signify amber as in book iii sec 30  By Ms is here probably meant copper it is more fully described in the next book We learn from the analysis of Klaproth that the term Ms when applied to works of artâ as cutting instruments statues vases c signified bronze or a mixture of copper and tin in which the proportion of tin varied from a little more than 2 to 14 per cent according as the object was to procure a flexible or a hard substance Nicholson s Journal xxvi 90 et seq and Aikiu s Diet Copper i 348 Watson has rendered it pro bable that brass the mixture of copper and zinc was called by the ancients Orichalcum Manchester Trans ii 47 et seq Agricola speaks of Ms as synonimous with Cuprum De Vet  Nov Met lib i p 391 He also remarks Ms autem cadmia tingitur et abit in aureum colorem appella turque a Grsecis optixaXicov De Nat Foss lib viii p 337 16 INTRODUCTION regions as if the part which we cultivate was not sufficiently boun tiful and fertile But all this time we take very little pains in searching for remedies for how few persons there are who dig into the earth for the purpose of procuring medicines She has indeed with her accustomed kindness and liberality given us on the surface whatever is necessary for this purpose It is what she has concealed from us what is sunk below the surface and is of slow growth that urges us downwards and drives us to the lower regions When the mind ranges abroad we are led to inquire what will be the end of this rage for exhausting the earth and how far avarice will finally penetrate How innocent how happy how truly delightful would life be if we were anxious to obtain nothing but what is to be procured above ground and only pos sessed what lies ready to our hands 2 OF GOLD Gold is dug up from the earth and near it is found chryso colla 3 which from its position may seem more valuable than it actually is It was not enough for us to have discovered one plague for our lives but that we must likewise set a price upon the dross of gold 4 While avarice was searching for silver it was thought a great advantage to have discovered minium 5 and to find out a use for this red earth What a spirit of prodigality In how many ways have we increased the value of things We employ the art of painting for this purpose and we have ren dered even gold and silver more costly by chasing it Man has learned how to rival nature Art has been promoted even by the incitements to vice our drinking vessels are so ornamented as to administer to our lusts 6 These things were however after some time thrown aside and despised gold and silver became too common From this same earth we also procure murr hine 7 and crystalline vessels and these are valued the more on 3 ChrysocoUa is more fully described in sec 26 4 Auri sanies 5 Minium is described in sec 36 6 It would appear that the author here refers both to the art of chasing i e forming figures in relief on the metal and also to the custom of giving particular forms to the vessels This is evident from Juvenal Sat ii 1 95 1 Murrhina are described in book xxxvii sec 8 they were probably onyxes or opals perhaps the term was not confined to these substances GOLD RINGS 17 account of their very brittleness For it was regarded as a proof of opulence and as quite the glory of luxury to possess what is liable at any time to be totally destroyed Nor was even this thought sufficient we drink out of a cluster of gems and we cover our cups with emeralds 8 we are anxious to get possession of India in order to indulge our passion for drinking and the gold is become only a secondary consideration 3 WHAT IS THE CHIEF RECOMMENDATION OF GOLD Oh that the sacred thirst of gold as some very famous authors have termed it could be entirely banished from the earth It has always been loaded with reproaches by the best men and was discovered for the destruction of life How much happier a period was it when articles were bartered for each other as was the case in the time of the Trojan war if we are to credit Homer For in this way as I suppose was the traffic carried on by which they procured their subsistence He mentions that some exchanged ox hides and others iron or the booty which they had taken in battle yet it appears that he himself esteemed gold very highly as he informs us that Glaucus exchanged his arms which were made of gold and were considered worth one hundred oxen for Diomed s which were worth only nine Pro ceeding upon the same system of barter it appears that even at Rome in former times the fines were levied in cattle 9 4 OF THE ORIGIN OF GOLD RINGS The man who first put gold upon his fingers committed the greatest crime we are not however informed who first did this For what is said with respect to Prometheus I regard as fabulous The ancients indeed generally represent him with an iron ring but signified any translucent mineral that exhibited a variety of colours See Montfaucon s Antiq vol iii part 1 book 4 chap 9 Salmasius ridicules the idea of their being onyxes and conceives that the vessels were made of porcelain Exer Plin p 144 â The Smaragdus is described in book xxxvii sec 13 probably the Beryl of the moderns Â We may suppose that this was the reason why the figure of an ox or other animal was stamped on the earliest Roman coins see Montfaucon vol iii part 1 book 4 ch 9 pi 27 fig 17 18 19 also Adam s Roman Antiquities p 491 c 18 SOLD RINGS yet this was probably intended to signify rather a chain than an ornament And as for the ring of Midas by the turning of which the wearer was rendered invisible who does not admit that this is still more fabulous Gold obtained its very high estimation from being worn on the hand and always on the sinister hand 1 not however by the Romans who used a ring of iron as an indication of their warlike spirit I cannot exactly say what was the fact with respect to the ltoman kings There is nothing of the kind on the statue of Romulus in the capitol nor on any other except those of Numa and Servius Tullius not even on that of L Brutus I wonder much that this should be the case with respect to the Tarquins who came from Greece from which country the use of these rings was derived although now indeed they use iron rings at Lace daemon It appears however that Tarquinius Priscus was the first who presented his son with a golden bulla 2 upon his killing an enemy in battle while he still wore the praetexta 3 whence this custom of wearing the bulla was continued so that the chil dren of those who had the rank of knight were allowed to have that badge of distinction while the others wore a leathern belt It therefore appears the more remarkable that the statue of Tarquin should be without a ring I find that there has been much uncertainty respecting the name of this article the Greeks derive it from the finger ActxrvXioi our ancestors styled it Unguium while latterly both the Greeks and ourselves have called it Symbolum 5 It is certain that for a 1 Sinistra â the play upon this word which the Author intended to convey cannot be fully transferred into tha English language a On the subject of Bullae see Montfaucon vol iii part 1 book 2 ch 10 pi 12 fig 7 18 and pi 13 fig 5 also Adam p 414 3 The toga praetexta was worn by the young men of Rome until they were 17 years of age Adam ubi supra 4 Lorum belt signifying nodus or signum de loro according to Juvenal v 16S s Badge signet these were probably like what we now call seal rings We have a copious set of references in Adam p 428 9 it does not how ever I think appear certain that in all these cases for example in Plautus Bacch 2 3 29 the symbolum was attached to aring See also Montfaucon vol iii part 2 book 1 ch 11 12 pi 13 He describes Annuli signatorii as one species of rings The ancient gems were some of them cut in relief and others engraven en creux the former were used for the purpose of personal ornament or for being deposited in cabinets while the latter were set in rings Besides the seals attached to finger rings there were large seals for GOLD RINGS 19 long period even a Roman senator did not wear a gold ring If rings were given publicly to those only who were sent as ambassa dors to foreign nations it was done I suppose because it indi cated to the foreigners that they were of the highest rank And it was not customary for any person to wear them except those to whom they were publicly presented on this account and it was in this manner that they commonly rode in triumph Even when the Etrurian crown which was of gold was carried over the head of the general still the ring on his finger was made of iron so that he who was borne in triumph was upon a par with the slave that car ried the crown In this manner Caius Marius triumphed over Jugurtha and it is said that it was not until his third consulship that he wore a golden ring And those who in consequence of having served the office of ambassador had received gold rings only used them in public in their own houses they still wore iron rings It is in pursuance of the same custom that even at this time an iron ring is sent as a present to a bride and that without any gem attached to it I do not find that rings were in use in the time of the Trojan war 6 Homer certainly never mentions them when he speaks of letters that were written on tablets and garments and gold and silver vessels being laid up in chests he always describes them as secured by knots not marked by rings And when he describes the heroes casting lots 7 in reply to the challenge he does not mention that they did it by means of their rings When also he enumerates the articles that were manufactured by Vulcan he mentions clasps and other female ornaments as ear rings but says nothing of rings for the fingers And whoever it was that first adopted marking wine vessels and to which rings were attached but in this case the rings appear to have served merely as the handles 6 It is supposed that the  signet of Judah to which allusion is made in Gen xxxviii 18 was a ring in this case it was employed to identify his person equivalent to a sign manual In the apologue of the Prodigal Son the father commands his servants to put a ring on the son s ringer as an ornamental badge of distinction The Egyptians used rings in very early times Fharoah put his ring on Joseph s finger Gen xli 42 this proba bly was a seal ring Moses directed that onyx stones should be engraved like  the engraving of a signet Exod xxviii 11 Seal rings appear to have been commonly used by the Greeks in Solon s time 7 II vii 176 et seq It is said that each of the candidates marked his K ipog and threw it into the helmet of Agamemnon In Matt xxviii 35 the soldiers are represented as  BaXXovvrce icXijpov c 2 20 GOLD RINGS the custom seems to have done it secretly putting the ring on the left hand as it were concealing it for if it had been clearly regarded as an honour it would have been more conspicuous on the right hand It may indeed be said that they were worn on the left hand in order that the right might be left more at liberty for the use of offensive weapons yet we may remark that the free use of the left hand with which the shield is held is as necessary as the right We learn also from Homer that men wore orna ments of gold in their hair it does not appear whether this custom originated with the women 5 OF THE QUANTITY OF GOLD AMONG THE ANCIENTS For a long time the quantity of gold in Rome was but very small It is certain that when peace was purchased from the Gauls after they had captured the city no more than 1 000 lbs weight of gold could be raised I am indeed not ignorant of the fact that M Crassus in his and Pompey s second consulship em bezzled 2 000 lbs weight of gold which he took from the throne of Jupiter Capitolinus where it had been deposited by Camillus 8 and from this circumstance many persons have supposed that 2 000 lbs weight had been collected by him at the time But the additional quantity was the booty of the Gauls part of which they had taken from the temples of the captive city What happened to Torquatus proves that the Gauls made use of gold when they went to battle We may then conclude that the ransom offered to the Gauls and what belonged to the temples made up the sum in question and no more And this indeed appears to have been the meaning of the oracle when it said that Jupiter Capitolinus had rendered back double the sum that had been entrusted to him I may also mention by the way since I am to resume the subject of rings that the keeper of this treasure being seized broke the stone of his ring in his mouth and immediately expired so that all farther discovery was rendered impossible It appears there fore that the quantity of gold in Rome was no more than 2 000 lbs weight in the year of the city 364 and when according to the census the number of the free born citizens 9 was 152 573 â See Livy v SO where we are informed that the treasure was first de posited in the cella and was afterwards removed to the sella of Jupiter see note in Valpy s edit p 919 Pliny employs the term solium Â Capita libera the number in the text refers only to the free bom GOXD RINGS 21 After an interval of 307 years when the temple of the Capitol and all the other temples were destroyed by fire C Marius the younger took to Praeneste 13 000 lbs weight the same sum was brought back to Rome by Sylla at his triumph together with 6 000 lbs weight of silver The day before he had conveyed to Rome 15 000 lbs weight of gold together with 115 000 lbs weight of silver being the produce of all his other victories 6 OF THE EIGHTS ATTACHED TO GOLD EINGS It was not until the time of Cn Flavius the son of Annius that rings became more generally used For he having published the calendar which the people had been perpetually requesting a few of the chief men to do 1 obtained so great a degree of favour with the lower classes that although he was no more than the son of a freedman and had himself been the secretary of Appius Caecus by whom he was encouraged to undertake the business being guided by his sagacity and to publish the result he was created curule jEdile together with L Anicius of Praeneste who a few years before had been in arms against Rome passing by Pcetilius and Domitius whose fathers had been consuls And in addition to this Flavius was also created a tribune of the people At this the senate were so indignant that we are told in the old annals that they cast off their rings Many persons suppose but erroneously that the knights did the same thing for what we are told is that they also threw off their badges from which they receive the appellation of knights 2 It is however adult males and would therefore form only a small part of the whole popu lation 1 This was so much wished for by the people because it contained an ac count of the days on which the courts were open and business of all kinds was transacted as well as of the holidays and festivals These seem to have been previously regulated by the Pontifices and it may be presumed not unfrequently in an arbitrary manner so as to serve the purposes of the Patricians Â phalera posita This we may presume was some trapping be longing to the horses or at least something significant of their possessing horses It appears indeed that the rank of knight entitled the individual to wear a gold ring but that besides this they possessed something speci fically distinctive of their order Livy in his account of this transaction says Plerique nobilium annulos aureos et phaleras deponerent lib ix cap 46 thus denoting the phalerse as something different from rings 22 COLD RINGS stated in certain annals that it was the noblility alone who threw off their rings and not the whole senate This transaction took place in the consulship of P Sempronius and P Sulpitius Fla vius vowed that he would erect a temple to Concord if he could reconcile the privileged orders to the people And because the public money could not be decreed for this purpose he employed the fines which were levied on usurers and with these he built a small brazen temple in the Graecostasis 3 which was then above the court house and it was engraven on a bronze tablet that this temple was consecrated 204 years after the Capitol It was therefore 449 years after the foundation of the city that this event occurred and that we have the first trace of the use of rings In the second Punic war we have another notice of their very general use for unless this had been the case the three bushels could not have been sent to Carthage by Hannibal The quar rel between Caepio and Drusus began in consequence of the pub lic sale of a ring whence sprung the social war and the ruin of the commonwealth Gold rings were not however worn at that time by all the senators for it is in the memory of our grand fathers that many even of those who had filled the office of praetor wore iron rings during all their lives as was the case with Calpurnius and Manilius which latter according to the account of Fenestella was the lieutenant general of C Marius in the Jugurthine war and the same thing is said by many concerning L Fusidius he to whom Scaurus dedicated the account of his own life It was an established custom in the family of the Quintii that not even the women should wear gold and the greater part both of nations and individuals even of those who live under our empire have no rings at all Neither the Orientals nor the Egyptians employ seals being satisfied with merely sign ing their names The French translator employs the term  collier and Durand in the trans lation or rather paraphrase of this part of Pliny which forms the com mencement of his Histoire Naturelle de l Or et de 1 Argent calls it un ornement de cou but I am not aware of any foundation for this ap plication of the word 3 This we are informed was a public hotel where formerly the Greek Ambassadors were received and which was afterwards appropriated to the reception of ambassadors generally See Varro de Ling Lat p 43 4 This remark among many others proves that the principal use of the rings was as seals or signets GOLD RINGS 23 Luxury in this as in every other case produced various changes by adding gems of exquisite brilliancy and by loading the fingers with quite a large fortune as I shall mention in the book on gems afterwards by chasing various figures on the rings so that they were sometimes valued for the material and at other times for the workmanship There were indeed some gems which it would have been thought absolute sacrilege to use as seals and in order to shew that they were not intended to be employed in this way they were set plain There are also some persons who will not have gold at the part which touches the finger consider ing gold of less value than many of the stones that are in use There are on the contrary others who do not admit of the use of any gems but seal with the gold itself a custom first adopted in the time of the emperor Claudius Cassar In these days there are slaves who have the iron ring surrounded with gold while others have the ring entirely of gold The name given to these rings shows that this licence originated in Samothrace It was at first the custom to wear rings upon one finger only that next to the little finger as we see it in the statues of Numa and Servius Tullius They were then put on the finger next to the thumb even in the statues of the gods and afterwards it was thought proper to give them also to the little finger The Gauls and the Britons are said to have used the middle finger At present this finger alone is exempted while all the rest are loaded even each of the smaller joints having little rings put on them There are some persons who heap three rings on the little finger alone while there are others who put only one upon it thus marking this as the marking finger 5 The seal itself however being carefully preserved was brought out as if from a sacred place like some thing very rare and not to be debased by common use and the circumstance of having a single ring only on the little finger was made an ostentatious mark of the possession of a store of other valuable articles Some persons now make a boast of the weight of their rings by others it is considered a kind of labour to carry more rings than one Others again from their anxiety for their gems think it safer to have them set in some sub stance lighter than gold as less likely to be injured by a fall Others inclose poison under the gems as was the case with that first of Grecian orators Demosthenes and thus employ their 5 Quo signantem signant 24 THE JUDGES rings as instruments of death And indeed the most criminal frauds that are committed in our days are effected by rings What a happy life did our ancestors lead and what a state of innocence was theirs in which nothing was ever sealed But we are now obliged to seal even our meat and drink to prevent its being stolen 6 This we gain by the legion of slaves and the crowd of foreigners we have about us so that in consequence of the number of our servants we are obliged to have a person to tell us their names Our ancestors had only one servant each who took the name of his master and was called Marcius s boy or Lucius s boy c and they ate the same food with their master so there was no occasion to have any thing locked up But now we procure dainties as if for the very purpose of being pilfered and at the same time persons who may pilfer them and it is not enough to have our keys sealed for the rings themselves are taken from the fingers of the owners when they are asleep or lying on their death beds I do not know at what period it was that the most important transactions of life began to be carried on by means of this instrument We have an example of the importance that was attached to it by foreigners in the case of Polycrates the tyrant of Samos whose favourite ring being thrown into the sea was recovered from a fish that they caught now he was put to death about the 230th year of our city But the use of rings must have become more generally known at the same time with usury in proof of this we may cite the custom of the common people who whenever they make a bargain draw the ring from the finger as being the most expeditious mode of making the contract so that we may positively affirm that money was first in use among us and afterwards rings But I shall speak of money presently 7 OF THE OKDERS OF JUDGES Rings when once they became remarkable served to distinguish the equestrian order from the people at large in the same way that the tunic distinguished the senate from those who wore rings 0 This refers to the custom of putting seals upon the store rooms cellars wine vaults c they may be considered as equivalent to the locks of modern times 7  DecurisE see Adam p 259 THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER 25 This distinction however took place at a late period For we find that the heralds praecones 8 commonly used this particular kind of wide purple tunic as was the case with the father of Lu cilius Elius Stilo who on this account was named Prasconicus The rings therefore formed a third order which was intermediate between the people and the partricians the name which was for merly bestowed in consequence of the possession of a military horse being now given as an indication of wealth But this change did not take place until the time of the late Emperor Au gustus 9 who when he arranged the seats of the Judges found that the greater part of them wore iron rings and these were not called knights but judges The name of knight was still attached to those who composed the troops of cavalry At first there were only four orders of judges and there was scarcely a thousand in each order the inhabitants of the provinces not being yet admitted into the office and it still remains a practice that none of the newly made citizens should be admitted among them The orders themselves were distinguished by different names as the Tribunes of the Treasury the Select and the Judges pro perly so called Besides these there were the Nine Hundred chosen from all the orders for the purpose of guarding the boxes that contained the suffrages of the general assemblies and this last order was also divided in consequence of the pride of indivi duals in assuming particular names one person styling himself a member of the Nine Hundred another one of the Select and another one of the Tribunes 8 OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER  At length in the 9th year of the Emperor Tiberius the whole of the equestrian order was reduced to an equality of rank it was decided who were entitled to wear rings in the consulship of C Asinius Publio and C Antistius Vetus in the year of the city 575 We may well wonder at the very slight cause which pro duced this change C Sulpitius Galba wishing to acquire some youthful fame in the eyes of the prince formed a plan for inflic ing penalties on the keepers of taverns and complained in the senate that the persons who were liable to this punishment defended  For an account of the office of the Praeco see Adam p 177 8 Â Divus Augustus 26 THE EftUESTRIAX ORDER themselves by the privilege of their rings On this account it was decreed that no one should enjoy that right who was not himself free born and whose father and paternal grandfather had not possessed a property which was rated at 400 sestertia 1 and who according to the Julian law were entitled to sit on one of the four teen first benches at the theatre But afterwards that badge be gan to be wished for by every one indiscriminately and on account of the disturbances that hence ensued it was that the Emperor Caius formed a fifth order of judges And so much emulation was excited from this cause that the benches which could not be filled in the time of the late Emperor Augustus cannot now contain all the members and that freedmen jump directly from the state of slavery to the wearing of these ornaments a thing that was never done before since the wearing of the iron rings was understood to be the privilege of the knights and judges The use of rings became so promiscuous that in the censorship of Claudius Caesar Flavius Proculus one of the knights indited 400 persons on this very account So that while the order of knighthood was kept distinct from the free born citizens it was thrown open to the slaves The Gracchi first formed a distinct order under the title of judges from their factious desire of acquiring popularity for the purpose of bringing contempt upon the senate This popular spirit being subdued after various revolutions the authority which was connected with the name at length devolved upon the farm ers of the revenue 1 and these for some time were a kind of third estate Cicero finally established the title of the equestrian order in his consulship during the affair of Cataline giving out that he proceeded from it and endeavoured to increase its power by his individual popularity From this period it clearly became the third body in the republic and the equestrian order began to be added to the senate and the Roman people On this account it is even now written after the people as being the one which was added the last in point of time 1 A sestertium is equal to 1000 sestertii the sestertium denotes a sum the sestertius a coin the English word sesterce is applied to the coin its value was nearly two pence of our money or one penny three farthings and a sestertium 81 Is 6 jrf The sum mentioned in the text would be 3 229 3s 4 d See Wurm de Pond Num c Rom et Grsec p 24 2 Adam p 27 remarks on the different estimation in which the  Publi cani were held in the city and in the provinces GOLD CROWNS 27 9 HOW FREQUENTLY THE APPELLATION OF THE KNIGHTS WAS CHANGED The appellation of the knights has been frequently changed even with respect to those who have been admitted into the order Under Romulus and the kings they were called Celeres then Flexumines and afterwards Trossuli because without any as sistance from the infantry they took a town of that name in Tuscany which was nine miles on this side of the Volcinii this name remained until after the time of C Gracchus Junius in deed who on account of his friendship with Gracchus was called Gracchanus has left these words in writing  as for what belongs to the equestrian order they were formerly named Trossuli and are now called Equites knights because they are not acquainted with the meaning of the name and many of them are ashamed to be called Trussuli 3 10 OF MILITARY DONATIONS IN BOTH GOLD AND SILVER There are some other distinctions in the use of gold which must not be omitted Allies and foreigners were presented with gold chains while citizens had only silver ones and besides bracelets were given to citizens which was not done to foreigners 11 WHEN THE FIRST GOLD CROWN WAS PRESENTED Crowns of gold were likewise given to the citizens a circum stance which is more remarkable I have not been able to learn who it was that first received one of them We are however told by L Piso that it was first presented by A Posthumius the dictator upon the capture of the camp of the Latins at the Lake Regillus he gave out of the plunder the crown in question to an individual who had particularly signalized himself on the occa sion The consul L Lentulus likewise gave one of 5 lbs weight to Serg Corn Merenda on taking the town of the Samnites Piso surnamed the Thrifty presented his son with a crown out of his own property and he left it to him by an especial bequest See the note in Valpy p 4324 28 GOLD ORNAMENTS 12 OF THE OTHER USES OF GOLD BY WOMEN Gold was never used in the sacred rites except for gilding the horns of the victims that were offered in sacrifice and that only for the larger ones But among the soldiery the luxury of em ploying gold increased so much that we have letters of Brutus written during the campaign of Pharsalia in which he complains grievously that the tribunes wore gold clasps for their cloaks But by Jove what would you have said Brutus had you seen the gold which the women wear on their feet And I consider that individual guilty of a great crime who first brought gold into repute by having it made into rings This also led to the custom of men wearing ornaments of gold about their arms which as it was introduced by the Dardans were called Dardanian as for the same reason bracelets are named one species Celticae and another Celtibericae We may indeed allow women to wear gold on their arms and on every one of their fingers on their necks in their ears and their curls Let them have chains crossed over their waists and have ponderous jewels set in gold hanging from their necks so that they may be conscious of wearing them even in their sleep but should we therefore permit them to wear it on their feet as if for the express purpose of creating a third order among females which might correspond to that of knights among men and which would be intermediate between women of rank and those of the lowest class We should leave ornaments of this kind for our pages and employ them to set off the beauty of our children The men indeed now begin to wear on their fingers the figure of Harpocrates 5 or of some of the Egyptian deities There was another unusual restriction when Claudius was Emperor 4 Viriole and viree said to be bracelets containing green stones 5 Harpocrates is characterized as the god of silence and represented with his finger on his lip according to the description of Ovid Quique premit vocem digitoque silentia suadet Met ix 691 We have a full account of him by Montfaucon vol ii part 2 c 12 3 accompanied by a number of engravings pi 40 1 It is observed that many of the figures have a re lation to the emblems of the sun and a treatise was written by Cuper the principal object of which is to prove that the figure of Harpocrates is to be considered as non silentium tantum digito suadens verum solis ima ginem referens See also the remark of Winckleman Cat des Pierres gravees du Baron Stosch p 20 It does not appear why Harpocrates was selected as an ornament for rings perhaps he was mentioned by Pliny as the first name that occurred o him GOLD COIN 29 that those alone to whom his freedmen had given access to his apartments were permitted to have the likeness of the Emperor engraven on their gold rings a regulation which was the cause of many accusations But the auspicious elevation of Vespasian put a stop to all these evils by making the Emperor accessible to every one Enough however has now been said respecting gold rings and the uses to which they have been applied 13 OF GOLD MONEY WHEN GOLD AND SILVER WERE FIRST COINED WHAT WAS THE CUSTOM WITH RESPECT TO COPPER BEFORE THEY WERE COINED AND WHAT WAS THE GREATEST aUANTITY OF MONEY AT THE FIRST CENSUS HOW FREQUENTLY AND AT WHAT PERIODS AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN FOR COINING MONEY The next crime was committed by the person who first coined gold into money but who it was that did this is not known The Romans certainly did not use even silver in the form of coin pre vious to their victory over king Pyrrhus The As was in the first instance valued at a pound weight of copper and hence its present appellation of a pound libella and of two pounds dupondius for two Ases Hence also fines were reckoned at a certain weight of copper and from the same origin the terms expensa im pensa and dependere are derived Hence also the pay of the soldiers is called a stipend implying that it was ascertained by weight and for the same reason stewards and paymasters are termed dispensatores and libripendes 6 and it is upon the same principle that the balance is introduced in all contracts for conveying property Servius the king was the first person who coined copper Timaeus informs us that before this time they used it at Rome uncoined It had the figure of an ox pecus stamped upon it and hence it was denominated pecunia The largest income 7 in that reign was 110 000 Ases and hence this was fixed upon as the standard for the first class of citizens Silver was coined in the year of the city 485 in the consulship of L Agulnius and C Fabius which was five years before the first Punic war A denarius8 was valued at ten pounds weights of e All these words are derived from  pendo to weigh We have not unfrequent allusions to the practice of weighing sums of money in the Old Testament as in Jerem xxxii 7  Census income as ascertained by the census â A denarius was a silver coin of the value of 7 d See Varro De Ling Lat p 47 8 30 GOLD COIN copper a quinarius at five and a sesterce at two and a half The standard pound of copper was diminished in the first Punic war when the republic was not able to bear its expenses it was then ordered that the As should consist of one sixth of a pound only By this measure there was a gain of five parts out of six and the debt was consequently expunged The device on this coin was a double Janus on the one side and a prow of a ship on the other there was a ship on the triens and the quadrans  the quadrans had been previously called teruncius from its consisting of three ounces At a later period when Hannibal was pressing upon M Minucius in the dictatorship of Q Fabius Maximus the value of the As was reduced to one ounce it was also ordered that the denarius should pass for sixteen Ases a quinarius for eight and a sesterce for four by this means the republic made a profit of fifty per cent In paying the soldiers however the denarius was always considered equivalent to ten Ases The device on the silver coins was a chariot with two and with four horses they were hence called bigati and quadrigati At length by the Papirian law the As was reduced to half an ounce When Liv Drusus was tribune of the people one eighth part of copper was mixed with the silver 9 The coin which is now called victoriatus was struck in obedience to the Clodian law It was previously brought from Illyricum as an article of commerce it obtained its name in consequence of its having the figure of victory on it Gold was coined sixty two years later than silver a scripulum  of gold was valued at 20 sesterces so that according to the ratio which at that time subsisted between the sesterces and the pound a pound of gold would contain 900 sesterces Afterwards it was thought proper to make 40 denarii to the pound of gold 2 and by degrees their weight was still farther t Dr Thomson found that the denarius coined in the time of the republic was composed of pure silver but that a denarius of the emperor Domitian contained 19 2 per cent of copper Nich Journ xiv 405 6 1 The scripulum was the l 288th part of the as or libra corresponding exactly with the modern scruple see Wurm p 9 Â It would appear that the Romans proceeded upon very arbitrary prin ciples in their mode of estimating the value of their current coins with re spect to the comparative value of the metals as well as of the same metals at different periods 900 sesterces are equal to 7l 10s while 40 denarii are equal only to 1 5s 10d see Adam p 492 et seq Herodotus informs us that in his time the value of gold was thirteen times that of silver iii 95 In this country the value of gold is a little more than fifteen times that of silver See Wurm sec 25 for the comparative value of gold and silver among the Romans GOLD COIN 31 diminished by the emperors they were the smallest in the time of Nero when there were 45 to the pound 14 AN ACCOUNT OF THE EAGER DESIRE FOR GOLD Money was the origin of avarice after usury had been dis covered and the mode of becoming rich without labour By de grees not merely avarice but the thirst of gold itself was inflamed to such a degree that Septimuleius when he had cut off the head of his friend C Gracchus carried it to Opimius and claimed his reward of its weight in gold after having poured lead into the mouth thus in addition to his crime of parricide being guilty of defrauding the republic But not to speak of individuals the Roman name generally became so infamous in this respect that king Mithridates poured gold into the mouth of the general Aquilius when he took him prisoner These are the fruits of the lust of gain It is disgusting to observe the number of new terms derived from the Greek language which are applied to the different kinds of silver vessels some of them covered with gold on the outside and gilt within and to see for what whimsical purposes they are used both those that are gilt and those that are of solid gold and especially when we know that Spartacus forbid any one in his camp to have either gold or silver in his possession So much more good sense is there in our run away slaves Messala the orator informs us that Anthony the triumvir employed gold for the most mean uses and what was still more disgusting that the same was done by Cleopatra It was considered an instance of very great luxury among foreigners that king Philip when he slept had always a golden cup under his pillow and Agno the Teian the praefect of Alexander the Great used golden clasps for his slippers But among ourselves in spite of what seems the order of nature Anthony employed gold for the most degrading of purposes an act which might be protested against even by Spartacus 15 WHO POSSESSED THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER I wonder indeed that the Romans when they exacted tribute from those whom they had conquered always demanded silver and not gold Thus when Carthage was conquered after the defeat of Hannibal the people were sentenced to pay 12 000 lbs of silver 32 SILVER PAGEANTS annually for fifty years but no gold yet we cannot suppose there was any scarcity of it in the world Midas and Croesus had before this time been in possession of immense quantities And Cyrus when he conquered Asia found 34 000 lbs weight of it besides golden vessels and various articles of wrought gold among other things a plane tree and a vine made of gold 3 From this victory he obtained 500 000 talents of silver and also the vase of Semiramis which was said to weigh fifteen talents We are in formed by Varro that the Egyptian talent is equal to 80 lbs It was before this time that Salauces reigned in Colchos and also Esubopes who is said to have got possession of a tract of virgin soil in the country of the Suani a country which had long been famous for its golden fleeces from which he is reported to have dug up a very great quantity both of silver and gold We are told that the arched roof of his palace was made of gold and that the beams columns and pilasters 4 were made of silver this was the case after he had conquered Sesostris the King of Egypt who was so haughty that he is said every year to have selected by lot certain kings out of those whom he had subdued and that he was in the habit of yoking them to his chariot and in this manner rode in triumph 16 WHEN THE FIRST PAGEANT OF SILVER WAS BROUGHT ON THE STAGE AND WHEN ON THE ARENA Even we ourselves have done things which will be scarcely credited by posterity Caesar he who was afterwards dictator during his aedileship when he exhibited funeral games in honour of his father was the first who had all the apparatus of the amphitheatre made of silver those who were condemned to the combat using then for the first time silver spears a practice 3 This probably refers to the golden plane tree and vine which Pythius of Lydia is said to have presented to Darius See Herodotus book vii sec 27 also sec 47 of this book  Parastaticse It may be doubted whether the ancients had any thing which exactly corresponds to our pilaster the word occurs in Vitruvius ix 9 in columna aut parastatice the term parastate which is found in some of the MS would appear to refer to another part of the building Parastatae is met with v 1 and is supposed by Rode to be synonymous with pilastre see lexicon in loco Newton retains the Latin term in his translation p 74 SILVER PAGEANTS 33 which is now imitated even by the small towns C Antonius exhibited games with a scene of silver s L Murana and the Emperor Caius brought into the Circus a pageant in which there were 124 000 lbs weight of silver Claudius his successor when he triumphed over Britain among the crowns which he exhibited on that occasion had one of 7 000 lbs weight which was pre sented to him by the people of the Hither Spain and another of 900 lbs by Gallia Comata as appears by the inscription His successor Nero in order to shew his wealth to Tiridates king of Armenia in one day covered the whole of Pompey s theatre with gold But what was this in comparison with his golden house which as it were surrounded the whole city 17 AT WHAT PERIOD THERE WAS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE TREASURY OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE In the consulship of Sex Julius and L Aurelius seven years before the third Punic war there was in the Roman treasury 16 810 lbs 6 weight of gold 22 070 of silver and of coined money 6 285 400 lbs In the consulship of Sex Julius and L Marcius that is at the commencement of the Social war there wasl 620 820 lbs weight of gold C Cassar at his entrance into the city in his Civil war took out of the treasury 25 000 ingots of gold 35 000 ingots of silver and of coined money 430 000 sesterces nor was there any period in which the republic was more wealthy iEmilius Paulus after he had conquered King Perseus out of the Mace donian booty which he had obtained brought into the treasury 2 000 300 sesterces and from this time the Romans ceased to pay taxes 5  Scena argentea the scena in the Roman theatre appears not to have been simply a painting as in modern times but at least in many cases a kind of model of the place or object intended to be represented The term is frequently employed by Vitruvius in his description of the Roman theatres v 6 7 8 In one passage it would appear to be used for the stage or for that part of it where the actors stood quod omnes artifices in scena or according to some MSS scenam dant operam cap vi Newton translates it  for all the performers act on the scene or stage p 105 6 In all the large sums that are mentioned there is so much variation in the MSS and so much apparent irregularity in the mode of notation that I confess myself unable to attain any certainty respecting them I have in almost all cases followed the estimates of Harduin D 34 VALUE OF GOLD 18 WHEN THE CEILINGS 7 WEEF FIRST GILT 8 The ceilings which now even in private houses are covered with gold were first gilt in the Capitol after the destruction of Carthage during the censorship of L Mummius The practice was afterwards adopted with respect to the ceilings and the walls of houses so that these latter were ornamented with gold like ves sels there were however various opinions entertained at the time respecting Catulus the person who first gilt the brazen tiles of the Capitol 19 FROM WHAT CAUSES OUR ESTIMATION OF GOLD IS PRINCIPALLY DERIVED I have given an account of the first discovery of gold as well as of the other metals in the 7th book I do not suppose that this metal became so much esteemed in consequence of its colour for that of silver is more brilliant and more like the light of day and therefore more suitable for military ensigns since its splendour would cause it to be seen at a greater distance They are obvi Laquearia or Lacunaria The first of these words is used in the title of the section the second in the text itself hence it appears that they were employed indiscriminately see also the note in Valpy p 4612 They mean the spaces left between the beams in the ceilings technically called coffers as well as in other parts of buildings Vitruvius iv 8 vi 6 vii 2 Baldus in his Lexicon Vitruvianum under the word Lacunar re marks Lacunaria contignationes sunt Newton Trans of Vitruvius note in p 73 describes the Lacunaria to be coffers or pannels usually formed in the soffites of the corona or architrave as well as in the ceilings c It appears however to have been used to signify the ceiling gene rally as by Cicero   fulgentem gladium e lacunari â demitti jussit Tus Quest v 21 and by Horace Non ebur neque aureum mea renidet in domo lacunar Od ii 18 1 2 by Juvenal doctus spectare lacunar i 56 and by Persius Et magis aureis pendens laquearibus ensis iii 40 It may therefore not improbably be used in this general sense by our author Rhode supposes that it was employed in this sense by Vitruvius in  the passage in vii 2 see lexicon in loco 8 We learn from various passages in the Old Testament that certain parts of Solomon s Temple were covered with gold see 1 Kings vi 21 2 1 Chron xxix 4 2 Chron iii 7 8 9 Â Lib 7 Â 57 p 1424 Auri metalla et conflaturam Cadmus Phoenix ad Pangseum montem invenit c VALUE OF GOLD ously mistaken who suppose that the colour of gold pleases us be cause it is like that of the fixed stars for we do not find this to be the case with respect to gems or other similar articles Nor do we prefer it to other metals in consequence of its weight or the ease with which it is worked because in both these points it yields to lead but because it is the only substance which is not destroyed by fire remaining uninjured even in conflagrations and in funeral piles Indeed the oftener it is exposed to fire the more it is improved and in order to try the purity of gold we observe whether after being exposed to the fire it becomes red and glows like the fire itself this process is called the test 1 and the great proof of the goodness of gold is the difficulty with which it is con sumed It is very remarkable that while it is not affected by the most violent charcoal fire it is very readily fused by chaff  and that in order to purify it it is necessary to heat it with lead A better reason for its high price is that it is so little liable to be worn by use while with silver copper and lead lines may be drawn and the hands are soiled with the matter which is rubbed off them Nor is any substance capable of being beat out into finer leaves or divided into smaller parts so that an ounce of it is capable of being extended out into 750 leaves or more each of them four fingers wide in both directions The thickest of these are called Praenestine still retaining this name from their having been used to gild the statue of Fortune which is at Praeneste The leaves which are the next to these in thickness are called Quaestorian In Spain the very small masses of gold are called Stigiles this metal more frequently than all the others being found either in a mass or in small fibres And while the other metals require to be reduced by fire this is found in a perfect form and possesses 1 Obrussa there is much uncertainty concerning both the orthography and derivation of this word It is used metaphorically by Cicero et adhibenda tanquam obrussa ratio  Brutus sec 74 p 496 and by Seneca Sic verus ille animus et in alienum non venturus arbitrium probatur hsec ejus obrussa est Epist xii sub init p 407 Aericola informs us that gold which had been purified by fusion was called  obryzum De Nat Foss lib viii p 331 J Diodorus Siculus in giving an account of the mode in which the

GILDING from the first the complete metallic state 3 This is found native while the others which I shall presently describe are as it were compelled to become metals It is more especially free from the liability to rust or corrode or to any change which may either injure its purity or diminish its weight It is proof both against salt and vinegar bodies which act the most powerfully on various substances and what is a still more remarkable property it may be spun or woven like wool without any wool being mixed with it We are informed by Verrius that Tarquinius Priscus rode in tri umph in a tunic of gold and we have seen Agrippina the wife of the Emperor Claudius when he exhibited the spectacle of a naval combat sitting by him covered with a robe made entirely of woven gold without any other material In what are called the Attalic stuffs the gold is woven with some other substance This art was the invention of one of the kings of Asia 20 THE METHOD OF GILDING Marble and those substances which cannot be made red hot 4 are gilt by first smearing them with the white of egg on wood a kind of glue is applied which is called Leucophoron what this substance is and in what manner it acts I shall explain in the proper place 5 It used to be prescribed by law in gilding copper to employ either native quicksilver or that which is reduced from the ore but respecting these as I shall mention when I give an account of their nature frauds have been devised The copper is in the first place very much hammered and is plunged while hot into a mixture of salt vinegar and alum After it has been scowered with sand they judge by its brightness whether it has been sufficiently acted on when if necessary it is again subjected to the furnace and afterwards has thin leaves of gold attached to it by means of a mixture of pumice alum and quicksilver Alum has the same effect as lead in purifying gold 6 3 It was probably this native gold which Aristotle calls  xpva0v awvpov as not requiring the aid of fire for its reduction De Mirab Aus cap 45 4 Candefieri literally made white we may consider the term as im plying a high temperature generally 5 Lib xxxv sec 17 B For an ample account of the process of gilding see the art Gilding in Aikins Diet which will materially illustrate the account in the text FINDING OF GOLD 37 21 OF THE FINDING OF GOLD Gold is found in our part of the world not to mention that from India which is dug up by ants or that among the Scythians by griffins 7 We procure it in three ways first in the sand from the beds of rivers 8 as is the case with the Tagus in Spain the Po in Italy the Hebrus in Thrace the Pactolus in Asia Minor and the Ganges in India Nor is there any gold more pure than this its passage down the river and the friction completely polishes it Another source is the earth dug out of open pits 1 and lastly the breaking down1 of the mountains I shall give an account of each of these modes In searching for gold they first remove the Se gullum 3 for so the substance is called which is regarded as an in dication of its presence A channel is formed in which the sand is washed and the quality of the sand is determined by ascertain ing the nature of the sediment Sometimes by extraordinary good fortune a vein is found near the surface as was lately the case in Dalmatia during the time of Nero which yielded at the rate of 50 lbs weight per day If the earth contains gold a kind of gum called Talutatium is found just below the sod The dry 7 A farther detail of the circumstances here alluded to may be found in book xi sec 36 and book vii sec 2 Pliny probably took his account from Herodotus book iii sec 102 and sec 166 Agricola has attempted to explain the origin of these stories De Vet et Nov Met lib i p 393 also De Nat Foss lib viii p 330 We have much curious information respecting gold mines and the mode of working them in this author espe cially in the 8th book of his treatise De Nat Foss and in the 2d book of his treatise De Vet et Nov Metallis 8 Ramentum 9 We learn from Aristotle that gold was found in the soil of Pceonia and Pieria and in the river Ozus in Bactria De Mirab Aus cap 45 8 Diodorus Siculus informs us that it was abundant in the rivers of Gaul lib iii sec 27  1 Puteorum scrobes r 2  Fragmenta 3 We are informed in the French translation that Segullo is an old Spanish word which is still in use among the Castillians t x note in p 584 5 4 In most of the technical mining terms that occur in this chapter there are considerable variations in the MSS in the present case we have in some copies alutationem in others alutatium The French trans lator lenders the word  toute usuelle t x note in p 588 38 WORKING OF GOLD MINES and barren mountains of Spain which produce nothing else are forced to be fruitful in this good thing The ore which is dug out of the open pits is called Canalicium by some and by others Ca naliense 5 it is imbedded in marble 6 but it does not sparkle as is the case in the Oriental sapphire7 and the Thebaic stone 8 and in many other gems it rather appears to surround the particles of the marble The channels in which these veins are found pass in all directions along the sides of the trenches whence their name is derived the earth is propped up by wooden pillars What is dug up is pounded washed roasted ground to powder and beaten in mortars The part that comes out of the furnace is called sil ver while the impure dross which is thrown out of the stove from whatever metal it is derived is called scoria The scoria of gold is pounded and is again subjected to the furnace The smelting pots are made of Tasconium 1 this is a white earth considerably resembling clay no other substance will resist the blast the heat of the furnace and the burning fuel The third method of procuring gold almost surpasses the labours of the giants Shafts2 are driven of considerable length and the mountains are excavated by the light of lamps The labourers are relieved at regular intervals but for many months they never see the light of day Shafts of this kind are called Arrugiae 1 It 5 Channelled from canalis 6  Marmoris glareae the word marmor must here be applied to quartz or some other primitive rock which is the ordinary matrix of gold In describing the sapphire he says aurum punctis collucet coeruliis lib xxxvii sec 39 Â The Thebaic stone is said to be  interstinctus aureis guttis lib xxxvi sec 13 9 As the term scoria is here used it will include both the extraneous substances that are separated from the metal by smelting and any part of the metal that becomes oxidized during the process  1 The French translator informs us that Tascos is an old Castilian word signifying impurity t x note in p 587 8  Cuniculi We hay e a very interesting account by Diodorus Siculus of the gold mines on the confines of Egypt Ethiopia and Arabia Kb iii sec 12 4 the descriptions of Diodorus and of Pliny mutually illustrate each other a We are told by Harduin see note in Valpy p 4354 that the word arrugiw occurs in the Aulularia of Plautus but on referring to the comedy it appears to be found only in the supposita added by the editor see p 173 The French translator informs us that arrugia is still applied in Spain to a deep mine t x p 588 WORKING OF GOLD MINES 39 sometimes happens that the clefts suddenly slip down and over whelm the workmen it may indeed be considered as a less dan gerous employment to dive for pearls in the depths of the ocean so much more hurtful to us have we made the land than the water To prevent these accidents there are a number of arches left in the mountains Masses of very hard stone4 are occasionally met with in both kinds of mines these they break down with fire and vinegar But more frequently in the shafts where the smoke and vapour would produce suffocation they cleave the rock in large masses of 150 lbs each and these they convey on their shoulders and pass them on in regular order from one to another according as they are stationed all this is done in the dark those alone who stand the last in the line seeing the light If this hard rock is of very considerable length the trench is carried by the side of it and goes round it The labour however is thought to be less in cutting through flint rock than some other substances there is an earth composed of a kind of clay mixed with gravel it is called white earth and it is almost impossible to quarry it they attack it with iron wedges and mallets of the same material Nothing it is thought can be harder than this substance unless indeed the insatiable thirst of gold be esteemed the hardest of all things When they have completed their workings they then break down the supports beginning at the last A man who is constantly stationed on the top of the hill for this purpose watches the first sign of the ground being about to give way he imme diately calls out to the men to leave the mine and goes himself away as speedily as possible The mountain breaks down and falls asunder with a crash which is inconceivable and is accompa nied by a prodigious rush of air They survey the ruins of nature as if they had conquered her But they have not yet procured the gold when the ore is dug up they do not know its nature The hope only of obtaining what they so earnestly desire is cause enough for them to undertake all this labour and expense Another operation still remains to be performed which is equally laborious and even more expensive this consists in conveying water along the ridges of the hills perhaps for a hundred miles in order to wash these ruins of the mountains These streams arc 4 Silices this term is not to be understood as restricted to flint accord ing to the modern use of the term but to be applied to any rock which was very hard and difficult to work 40 WOUKING OF GOLD MINES called Corrugi 5 as I suppose from the word corrivatio i e drawing the river into one channel This is indeed a most laborious un dertaking It is necessary that the level should be so adjusted as to produce a sufficient current for the stream and for this purpose the water is brought from the highest point that is practicable If it has to pass across a valley it is necessary to build a canal over it In some places the passage is obstructed by rocks which they cut through and a space is thus formed through which wooden troughs are carried The man who cuts through the rock is suspended by ropes so that those who see him at a distance might suppose him to be some species not indeed of wild beast but of bird While they are hanging in this manner they take the level of the ground and mark out the line in which the water course is to be carried for there is no space left on which they can rest their feet They remove all the rubbish with their hands and carry it away in baskets This kind of earth they call Urium 6 they therefore avoid the urium and as far as is practicable con duct the water course through the hard rock or solid stone When they have brought the water to the brow of the hill they dig large ponds 200 feet in length and breadth and ten in depth in these they generally leave five sluices three feet square when the pond is filled they open the gates and the torrent rushes down with so much violence as to drive before it all the masses of stone that stand in its way And there is another laborious process to be gone through in the lower ground Trenches are dug through which the water may flow they are called Agangae 7 and furze is laid at intervals above their sides This is a shrub somewhat like rosemary which from its roughness serves to detain the gold The sides of these trenches are enclosed with planks and where the ground is uneven they are raised upon arches so that the stream is made to flow from the land to the sea These works have contributed to advance the prosperity of Spain 8 The ore which is procured 5 The French translator informs us that corrugo is derived from an old Castilian word which signifies a furrow t x p 590  The French translator states that urium is derived from the Celtic word Our water because this kind of earth absorbs water t x note in p 592 7 Or Agandas derived from the Castilian words aqua and andar signify ing water courses see French translation t x note in p 592 â His de causis jam promovit Hispania This is explained by the editor of the Regent s edition Propius mari admovit puteos suos fossas OEPIMENT 41 in the mode that was first mentioned with such immense labour is washed in this water lest it should fill up the pits The gold which is procured from the Arrugige is not smelted being found in the metallic state Lumps of it are met with in this situation and also in the trenches of more than ten pounds each the Spaniards call them Palacae others call them Palacurnae when very small they are called Balucae 9 The furze after being dried is burnt and the ashes are washed a sod being laid under it on which the gold may settle Some writers have asserted that in this way 20 000 lbs weight are procured every year from Asturia Gallaecia and Lusitania Asturia however produces the greatest proportion of it and it is said that in no part of the world have the mines been equally productive for so long a period I have already mentioned that in consequence of an ancient prohibition of the senate mines have never been sunk in Italy otherwise no country would have been richer in metals A prohibitory law is likewise extant respecting the gold mine of the Ictimuli in the country of the Vercellenses which orders that those who farm this mine should be allowed to employ uo more than 5 000 men 22 ORPIMENT   Gold is also obtained from Orpiment a substance which is got in Syria for the use of painters it lies near the surface of the et canales The French translation is as follows Les sedimens de ces eaux ont deja recule sensiblement les limites du continent de l Espagne 9 For some remarks on these terms see the note in Valpy p 4357 8 Strabo has the following observation Ev Et roig iptiyfiaoi  fwepag KaOapaiuiq StoptvaQ Csterum inter auri ramenta aiunt inventas aliquando selibres glebas quas ipsi palas iroXac nominant exigua purgationc indigentes lib iii p 216 1 Auripigmentum This appears to be orpiment the sulphuret of arsenic the word occurs in only one other passage of Pliny lib xxxv sec 12 where he is enumerating the  colores austeri qui nascuntur It is not mentioned in the section which treats on arsenic our author perhaps not being aware of its connexion with the substance see lib xxxiv sec 56 The word auripigmentum is not I believe to be found in the text of Dioscorides although Virgilius and his commentators generally have trans lated the Greek word apatviKov by the Latin word auripigmentum while it appears that the substance which is described by Dioscorides under the title of apaivnov is not the white oxide but the sulphuret of arsenic see lib v cap 75 p 671 5 Celsus lib v cup 5 sec 1 speaks of auripig 42 ELECTRUM ground and is of the colour of gold but it is brittle like Lapis Specularis 1 The emperor Caius who was most greedy of gold was anxious to make trial of it and ordered a great quantity of it to be smelted And he certainly procured gold of excellent quality but in so small a proportion that he incurred a heavy loss from the undertaking to which he was impelled by his avarice although fourteen pounds weight of the Orpiment had been ac tually converted into gold The process has never been attempted by any one since 23 OF ELECTEUM In all gold there is a portion of silver the quantity differs in some cases amounting to one ninth in others to one eighth of the whole There is an ore found in Gaul called Albucrarense which contains only l 36th part so much does it excel the others in value When one fifth of the whole is silver it is called Electrum 3 this kind of alloy is found in the ore called Canaliense 4 Electrum is also made artificially by adding gold to silver but if the pro portion of silver be more than one fifth the compound will not bear the hammer Homer gives his testimony to the value which was formerly set upon Electrum when he informs us that the palace of Menelaus was resplendent with gold silver electrum and ivory 5 Lindos a town of the island of Rhodes has a temple mentum as quod apatviKov a Graecis nominatur Nearly the same words are employed by Vitruvius lib vii cap 7 and by Agricola De Nat Foss lib iii p 225 but in this and other passages these authors appear to refer to the sulphuret of arsenic In his Dialogue De Re Met p 456 he distinctly mentions white arsenic and designates auripigmentum as yellow arsenic  This is the Foliated Gypsum or Selinhe of the modern mineralogists SeeKirwin sMin 123 4 Jameson i 567  0 Brochant i 606 9 Aikins Diet i 546 7 It is described by Agricola De Re Met p 456 7 Pliny treats of it farther in lib xxxvi sec 45 J Agricola says that the name of electrum was given to an alloy ubi quinta argenti portio inest in quatuor auri portionibus De Nat Foss lib viii p 343 The term has been retained by the modern chemists and applied to the argentiferous ore of gold the proportion of its ingredients is however very different from that stated by Pliny and Agricola Klaproth found it to consist of 64 parts gold to 36 silver 4 See p 38 s Odyssey lib iv v 73 Sophocles speaks of aapittav ijXticrpoi in connexion with the other precious metals Antigone 1037 8 GOLDEN STATUES 43 of Minerva in which Helen consecrated a goblet made of this kind of metal the story says that it was the size of one of her breasts It is the nature of Electrum to be more brilliant than silver by lamp light The native Electrum has also the property of de tecting poison if a cup of this metal contains poison a number of coloured circles like the rainbow make their appearance and there is at the same time a hissing noise so that we are made sensible of the presence of poison in two ways 24 THE FIEST GOLDEN STATUES The first golden statue that was made without any cavity in the inside and this was before any bronze statues were formed of the kind which they call Holosphyraton5 is said to have been placed in the temple of Anaitis I have mentioned above in what part of the world this name is used a deity considered peculiarly sacred by those nations The statue was broken in pieces during the expedition of Anthony against the Parthians A speech is re ported to have been made concerning it by one of the veterans of Bononia at an entertainment which he gave to the late emperor Augustus When he was asked whether it was true that he who violated this divinity expired after having lost his sight and the use of his limbs he replied that Augustus was then supping off her leg for that he was the individual in question and that it was from this plunder that he derived his fortune Gorgias the Leontine was the first person who had his own statue made of solid gold he placed it in the temple of Delphi about the 70th Olympiad So great was the emolument derived from teaching rhetoric 25 THE EIGHT MEDICINES MADE OF GOLD Gold is in many ways useful as a medicine It is applied to wounds and also to children to protect them from any noxious charms to which they may have been exposed It has however itself a noxious influence when laid upon any thing as upon chickens or young cattle The remedy in this case is to wash the 6 OXooQvparog solidus malleo confectus probably in opposition to those that were cast in a mould 7 The author here probably refers to the following passage in book v sec 20  Fluit Euphrates Derxenem primum mox Anaiticam c 44 CHRYSOCOLLA gold with water and then to sprinkle the water upon the things that we wish to purify If gold be roasted with twice its weight of salt three of misy 8 and again with two of salt and one of a stone which they call Schiston the noxious part of it will pass into the substances that are calcined along with it in the earthen ves sels while the metal remains pure and entire The ashes that are left in the earthen pot when made into a paste with water are useful for removing eruptions from the face it must be washed off with bean meal 9 It also relieves fistulae and what arc called haemorrhoids When mixed with pounded pumice it cures putrid and foetid ulcers boiled with honey and melanthium 1 and rubbed on the navel it opens the body gently M Varro as serts that warts are removed by gold 26 OF CHRYSOCOLLA 2 Chrysocolla is a liquid substance found in the pits that have been described above which flows through the veins of gold and hardens by the cold of winter until it acquires the solidity of 8 Miseos Misy is described by our author in book xxxiv Â 31 also by Dioscorides lib v cap 71 it is frequently mentioned by Agricola De Nat Foss lib iii p 219  alibi It appears to have been an impure vitriol 9 Lomentum said to be meal made from the lotos 1 Melanthion is described at large in book xx sec 71 as  Gith ex Grsecis alii Melanthium c and is referred to in various other passages It has been supposed to be coriander but the following passage from Columella x 244 5 seems to prove that this is not the case famosaque tunc coriandra Nascuntur gracilique melantia grata cumino Hermolaus the commentator on Dioscorides refers to it under the appel lation of Gith quasi Nigellam lib i sec 47 Celsus enumerates Git among the medicines quae calefaciunt lib ii cap 33 and in lib iv cap 20 classes it with castoreum and anethum It is mentioned by Scrib Largus sec 69 0  131 141 from the substances with which it is asso ciated it may be concluded that it was some heating or stimulating seed perhaps a species of pepper  Chrysocolla has been commonly translated Borax but as it appears incorrectly Our author speaks of the same substance in lib xxxv sec 12  18 as a species of pigment See also the present book sec 57 and Salmasius Exerc Plin p 811 Aristotle says that the best Chrysocolla is found near gold De Mirab Aus cap SO Theophrastus describes it as of a sandy nature Op p 396 7 and classes it with aptnviKOv aavSapaKa CHRYSOCOLLA 45 pumice The best kind is found in the copper mines s and the next to it in those of silver it is also found in lead mines but this is not so good as that from gold It may be formed artifi cially in all these situations but this kind is inferior to what is produced naturally To form it artificially water is let into the mines during the winter indeed until the month of June this is then evaporated during June and July Hence it appears evi dent that chrysocolla is nothing more than a mouldering vein The artificial chrysocolla differs much from the native in its hard ness in this state it is styled Lutea but it receives its colour from the plant of the same name 5 for it resembles flax or wool in the circumstance of readily receiving various dyes In pre paring it it is first beaten in a mortar and then passed through a fine sieve it is afterwards ground and is again passed through a still finer sieve what will not pass through is pounded and ground a second time The powder is always digested in pots and macerated with vinegar until it is completely softened it is once more pounded and is afterwards lixiviated in certain vessels called Conchs and is finally dried It is then dyed by means of fiiXrog taxpa  Kvavog as what is found in gold silver and copper mines De Lapid sec 47  90 Dioscorides describes it in lib v cap 50 Vitru vius states that it is found in copper mines vii 9 Celsus enumerates it among the substances  quae rodant but without any description lib v cap 6 Agricola enumerates Chrysocolla among the  succi concreti which are mixed with metals classing it with aerugo ferrugo and cceru leum De Nat Foss lib i p 185 It is more fully described in lib iii p 221 and is said to be found in metallic veins potissimum serariae in the Dialogue De Re Met p 452 it is called a species of green earth Upon the whole there appears sufficient reason to suppose that the Chrysocolla of the ancients was essentially an oxide or carbonate of iron mixed with a certain proportion of oxide or carbonate of copper it may be supposed to have been generally yellow but to have had occasionally a blue or green tinge according to the nature of its constituents We have a long disser tation by M Guettard in the notes to the French translation t x p 600  seq he calls it verd de montagne and considers it to be the same sub stance which is now procured from the copper mines of Hungary 3 iErariis metallis the word metallum was employed by the an cients sometimes to designate a metal sometimes the ore of a metal and sometimes as in this case the mine from which the ore is extracted 4 Vena putris 5 Supposed to be Weld the Reseda Luteola of Linnseus The yellow colour of the plant combining with the blue of the chrysocolla would pro duce the green which was so much valued 46 CHRYSOCOLLA alum schist 6 and the plant mentioned above It must be dyed before it can dye r It is of importance that it should be bibulous and easy to work If it has not quickly taken the the proper colour they add schytanum and turbiston 8 names which they gave to two substances which cause it to imbibe the colour 27 ITS USE IN PAINTING When it is dyed in this manner the painters call it Orobitis 9 and there are two kinds of it â the yellow which is made into a powder and the liquid which is formed by dissolving the grains in a fluid Both these kinds are made in Cyprus The most approved comes from Armenia the next best from Macedonia but it is the most plentiful in Spain That is the most valued which produces a colour as nearly as possible similar to the bright green of young corn The arena of the circus was covered with chrysocolla at the games which were exhibited by the Emperor Nero when he proposed himself to drive his chariot in a dress of the same colour The workmen who are not well acquainted with the substance divide it into three species the rough kind which is valued at seven denarii the pound the middle kind at five and the powder which is also called the vegetable spe cies at three Painters before they use the pulverized chry socolla lay under it a ground work of Atramentum2 and Paraeto 6 Alumen schistum this is described lib xxxv sec 52  Pingiturque antequam pingat â It appears impossible to ascertain the orthography or the derivation of these words nor can we form any conjecture what substances they were intended to designate â From its being formed into masses or small grains like the seeds of the orobus or vetch Quae servatur in lomentum this phrase may perhaps mean that the substance in question was mixed with some kind of powder for the purpose of making what we call an opake or body colour The term lomentum is supposed to be immediately derived from tnopai lavo it occurs again in sec 57 â Atramentum is generally translated ink and it appears that the an cients applied the term to the fluid which was used for writing Their writing ink was not however like that of the moderns composed of the gallate of iron but more like what we term Indian ink consisting of a carbonaceous substance suspended in a viscid fluid But we learn from our author that besides its more general acceptation the word atramentum was also applied to a certain pigment and to something which was used CHRYSOCOLLA nium 3 These substances combine readily with the Chrysocolla and at the same time give a smoothness to its colour The Pa rastonium which is of a fatty and very smooth consistence is sprinkled over the Atramentum lest the whiteness of the Parae tonium should injure the lustre of the chrysocolla The species called Lutea is supposed to be named from the plant which is itself sometimes rubbed with Cceruleum 4 and used instead of the chrysocolla but the green thus produced is a very bad and a most deceitful colour 28 THE SIX MEDICINES MADE FROM CHRYSOCOLLA Chrysocolla is used in medicine to cleanse wounds mixed up with oil and wax being itself a dry substance it causes them to dry and contract It is also given in sore throats and in asthma combined with honey It acts as an emetic it is used in eye salves to remove scars or specks from the cornea also in green plaisters for the purpose of relieving pains or healing scars The kind of Chrysocolla which is not called Orobitis the physicians name Acesis 5 29 OF THE CHRYSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS OR SANTERNA Chrysocolla is also used by the goldsmiths for soldering their gold it is from this property that the name Chrysocolla6 is applied to all the species For this purpose it is digested with verdigris and the urine of children together with natron It is for the purpose of a varnish see lib xxxv sec 12  36 Vitruvius gives an account of the mode of making writing ink  atramentum librarium by mixing the soet of resin with gum he informs us that atramentum was also used as a pigment for walls vii 10 s Parsetonium is enumerated among the pigments as one of the colores austeri in lib xxxv sec 12 and in sec 18 is described as spumam  maris solidatam cum limo We may suppose it to have been a mecha nical mixture of various earthy and saline bodies which possessed an absorbent quality It is mentioned by Vitruvius vii 7 among the earthy pigments It was probably procured from Paretonium in Marmorica 4 Coeruleum is described in sec 57 5 Ab aKtofiai equivalent to Cure all 6 XpvooKoWa Auri glutinum 7 Nitrum the word used in the text signified among the ancients the native subcarbonate of soda not the nitrate of potash as among modern chemists Pliny describes it in lib xxxi sec 46 4tt SOLDERING to be pounded with a copper pestle and mortar it is then called Santerna 8 It is the gold which contains an alloy of silver that is soldered in this way They judge of its nature by observing whether it becomes bright when the Santerna is applied to it if it is alloyed with copper it seems to shrink it looks dull and is not easily soldered In order to solder this kind of metal a por tion of gold with one seventh part of silver is added to the com pound mentioned above and rubbed with it 30 THE WONDERS OF NATURE IN SOLDERING AND COMPLETING METALLIC SUBSTANCES It may be proper to notice in this place the other kinds of solder that we may become fully acquainted with the wonders of nature The solder for gold has been already described Clay 9 is the solder for iron cadmia1 for masses of copper and alum for copper plates resin for lead and for marble black lead is soldered by white lead and pieces of white lead are united together by oil Stannum 2 is soldered by copper filings and silver by stannum  The pro cess is described by Dioscorides as a method of preparing ver digris so as to produce a solder for gold  Eotiv Si tic KoXKtotriv â lib v cap 47 Est prseter hanc etiam serugo alia quae ab inducentibus aurum operibus suis in mortario pistilloque ex Cyprio sere et pueri urina fit qua aurum inducunt The process is again mentioned by Pliny lib xxxiv sec 28 as a method of preparing a kind of verdigris that was used for soldering gold Agricola in describing the factitious chrysocolla chiefly follows Pliny and Dioscorides De Nat Foss lib iii p 222 9 Argilla this term frequently occurs in Pliny and appears to be equi valent to the term clay signifying the various species of plastic earths and marls essentially composed of alumine and silex and generally containing oxide of iron 1 Cadmia is described more fully in the next book sec 2 et alibi it ap pears to have been an ore of zinc probably calamine see also Diosco rides v 42 a Plumbum album and  plumbum nigrum are described in the next book sec 47 By plumbum nigrum the author appears to mean metallic lead There are various circumstances mentioned with respect to plum bum album which would lead to the opinion that he applied this term to tin He frequently uses the word Stannum but never speaks of the two as synonimous of which an instance occurs in the very next sentence see also lib xxxiv sec 47 48 Agricola distinctly applies the term plum bum candidum to tin and informs us that it was called by the Greeks Kairirirfpos DeNat Foss lib viii p 339 see also the dialogue De Re Met silver 49 Copper and iron are fused the best by pine wood in Egypt papyrus is used while gold is fused by chaff 3 Lime and the Thracian stone4 are made hot by water and quenched by oil Fire generally is best extinguished by vinegar birdlime and egg Earth is very slightly combustible charcoal that has been extin guished and is again inflamed burns with greater force 31 OF SILVER We must now proceed to silver the metal which next to gold has been the greatest cause of madness It is never procured ex cept from mines and it is found in situations where there was no indication of its presence there being no sparkling fragments to be seen as is the case with gold The earth is in some cases of a red colour in others of an ash grey It cannot be refined ex cept by black lead or the ore of lead that which is generally found near the vein of silver is called Galena 5 By the action of fire a portion of the ore falls to the bottom in the form of lead while the pure silver floats upon the surface like oil on water It is found in almost all the provinces but the finest comes from Spain It occurs in barren land generally in mountains and where there is one vein another is found at no great distance This indeed is the case with all other bodies of this class whence the Greeks seem to have derived the term metal 6 It is remark able that the mines which were opened in Spain by Hannibal still p 450 while stannum is described as a mixture of plumbum nigrum and silver ibid lib i p 187 He points out three species of lead album or candidum nigrum and cinereum quod bisemutum nominant nostri ibid p 186 and 339 We have an example of the application of the word Kaaairipos to tin by Herodotus lib iii sec 115 3 See note 3 p 35 4 The Thracian stone is described by Dioscorides as possessing this pro perty and is also said to contain bitumen and sulphur v 100 The same circumstance is referred to by Aristotle in his treatise De Mirab Aus cap 41 et 125 Theophrastus does not mention the Thracian stone by name but he speaks of a combustible stone from Bena a town of Thrace Op p 393 and De Lap sec 23 See the remarks of Salmasius Exer Plin p 179 5 The author informs us lib xxxiv that by galena he designates  vena argenti phumbique communis This term is now applied to the compound of lead and sulphur 6 Mtra akkaiv or aWa V 50 QUICKSILVER remain and retain the names given them by their discoverers 7 One of these now called Bebulo yielded Hannibal 300 weight daily it runs into the mountain for 1500 paces and through this space the Aquitani draw off the water night and day measuring their time by the burning of their lamps and discharge a stream as large as a river When a vein of silver is found at the surface it is called Crudaria Â The antients continued to dig down until they came to a stratum of Alumen 9 beyond this they made no farther search But a vein of white copper 1 having been lately found below the alumen the miners are induced to go still lower The vapour which arises from silver mines is injurious to all ani mals and especially to dogs Both gold and silver are the more beautiful the softer they are It is generally thought to be re markable that silver should leave a black streak behind it 32 OF QUICKSILVER There is in these veins a stone which discharges a substance that always remains fluid called Quicksilver but which is death to every thing It corrodes and destroys the vessels in which it is Jcept oozing through them with its baneful poison All things except gold float in it that substance alone is attracted to it On this account it is very useful in refining gold separating it from all the impurities by repeatedly shaking it in earthen vessels which contain pieces of leather The quicksilver is then separated from the gold by pressing the prepared skins through which it exudes like perspiration leaving the pure gold behind For the same reason in gilding bronzes 3 if quicksilver be rubbed over them the gold leaves will adhere firmly to the bronze But by the light  Aristotle speaks of the great quantity of silver brought from Spain by the Phoenicians De Mirab Aus cap 127 We have likewise an account of the silver mines of Spain in Diodorus Siculus lib v sec 35 6 s The French translator informs us that cruda ria are two Castilian words signifying veine crue t x note in p 616 9 Alumen is treated of in lib xxxv sec 52 also by Dioscorides lib v cap 77 The word appears to have been applied both to the aluminous ores and to the salt obtained from them although it was probably in an impure state 1 Probably arsenicated copper â Here is probably intended to be a kind of pun between the words  ar gentum vivum and  venenum â  Mia ANTIMONY 51 colour we discover whether the leaves have been applied single or are very thin in order to prevent this they fraudulently mix it with the white of egg and afterwards with hydrargyrum of this I shall give an account in its proper place 4 Quicksilver has not been procured in considerable quantity by any other means than by the ore mentioned above 33 OF STIMI STIBIUM ALABASTRUM LARBAS0M OK PLATYOPHTHALMUM In the same silver ores there is also found a mineral which we may properly call a white and shining but not a transparent foam it is named by some Stimmi by others Stibium Alabastrum or Larbason There are two species of it male and female The female is most approved the male is coarse and rough and less heavy less shining and more sandy The female on the con trary is brilliant friable and breaks into long fissures rather than into rounded masses 34 THE MEDICINES FROM IT It possesses an astringent and refrigerant virtue but its prin cipal use is as an application for the eyes on this account it is generally called platyophthalmum 6 since it dilates the eyes of females when it enters into their eye salves i A powder composed of antimony and frankincense mixed with gum dries up the humours and heals the ulcers of the eyes it also stops the flow ing of blood from the brain It is still more efficacious in recent wounds and when mixed with flour in old wounds made by the  Sec 41 The author makes a distinction between argentum vivum and hydrargyrum the first being native quicksilver the latter quicksilver reduced from its ore 5 See Dioscorides lib iii cap S3 8 XlXarvoipOaXiiov amplos oculos faciens 7  Calliblephari these were not properly medical preparations but sub stances which were supposed to increase the beauty of the eyes as it would appear by tinging the lids and lashes We learn from Shaw Travels p 229 that the women of Barbary tinge their eye lids with a black substance which he calls  the powder of lead ore See also Russell s Aleppo note 22 v i p 336 where we learn that the women use for this purpose a black powder which is called Kohol and is said to be a kind of lead ore brought from Persia There are some remarks on this custom in Hacmer s Obser vations vol ii p 405 obs IS chap 10 It is also noticed as being now practised in Turkey by Lady M W Montague Works vol ii p 12 e2 52 SILVER bite of dogs It is very useful in burns mixed with fat litharge 8 white lead and wax It is roasted in furnaces surrounded with balls of ox dung it is then quenched in woman s milk and ground in mortars with rain water It is then poured while turbid into a copper vessel and purified with natron The dross consists principally of lead and every thing which subsides in the mortar is thrown away The vessel into which the turbid fluid had been poured is left for the space of a night covered with a linen cloth on the following day all the fluid part is poured off and removed by a sponge That which subsides from the fluid is named the flower it is dried in the sun covered by a linen cloth care being taken that it should not be rendered hard It is then again rubbed in the mortar and is divided into pastils It is above all things necessary not to roast it too much lest it be converted into lead some persons do not use dung but fat in this process others again after it has been pounded put it into sacks made of three folds of linen and plunge them into water they throw away the dregs and pouring off what passes through the linen they collect the substance which subsides from the water this they make up into plaisters and applications for the eyes 35 OF THE SCORIA OF SILVER MEDICINES FROM IT The Scoria of silver is called by the Greeks helcysma 1 it has an astringent and refrigerant virtue It is put into plaisters like Molybdena a substance which I shall speak of in the account  Spuma argenti This substance is described by Dioscorides lib v cap 54 under the name of AtQapyvpog i e the calx of silver Agricola was acquainted with its real nature as produced from the lead which is mixed with the silver when a mixture of the two metals is exposed to a high temperature De Nat Foss lib ix p 354 9  Cerussa The nature and manufacture of this substance are described in book xxxiv sec 54 it appears to have been similar to our ceruse the carbonate of lead of the modern chemists This process is described more at length by Dioscorides lib v cap 57 1 Supposed to be derived from cXkuu traho perhaps signifying what is drawn from off the melted metal For the meaning of the word scoria see sec 21 a Lib xxxiv sec 53 the author employs this term as synonimous with Galena see also Dioscorides lib v cap 54 The word appears to have been generally employed by the ancients to designate a sulphuret or oxide of lead The modern chemists have applied the term moh bdena to a distinct metal Agricola says what the Latins call plumbago the Greek call noXvfi Saiva lib x p 335 it appears to be an oxide of lead SILVBR 53 of lead more especially for the purpose of cicatrizing wounds it is used for tenesmus and dysentery infused with the oil of myrtle in glisters It also enters into the composition of the medi cines called cerates 5 which are applied to fungous ulcers that have been produced either by friction or by open sores of the head There is also produced from the same metal the substance which is called the foam of silver  there are three species of it the best which is called Chrysitis the second which is called Argyritis and the third Molybditis J all these colours are gene rally found in the same mass 6 The most valuable is the Athe nian the next the Spanish Chrysitis is made from the entire ore itself Argyritis from metallic silver while Molybditis is pre pared by fusing lead as is done at Puteoli whence it derives its name 7 All the kinds are formed by fusing the material and suf fering it to flow from an upper vessel into one placed below from which it is taken up by iron rods 8 and moved about in the flame itself in order that the substance may be rendered light It is as the name imports the foam of the metal while effervescing and it differs from dross in the same way that froth does from dregs The first is what the substance throws off while it is purifying 3 Liparse From Anrog Adeps Celsus describes them as being  lenia emplastra and containing wax and lead lib v cap 19 20 25 4 See note in last page 5 XpvaiTig auri colorem exhibens Apyupiric argenti colorem exhibens Mo v 3SiTis plumbeus These are compounds of lead and oxygen varying in the proportion of the constituents and in the last substance also com bined with a portion of metallic lead We must suppose that the silver which was employed in the production of these oxides was alloyed with a quantity of lead 6  In iisdem tubulis in the notes we hare the following explanation given of those words see Valpy p 471 Fusores hodie panes vocant seu massas offasque tubulos antiqui Vide formam tubulorum expressam in icone apud Agricolam de Re Metall lib x p 384 Upon referring to this figure ed Basil 1561 the tubuli appear to be small hollow cylinders closed at one end which were taken up on iron rods called veruculi mentioned below the tubulus was then dipped into the metal as it flowed from the furnace and a portion which adhered was thus exposed to the air and oxidized Probabiy Puteolanum  one of the purple colours was called Puteolanum from its being procured near Puteoli lib xxxv sec 26 8 Veruculi 54 SILVEH itself the second is the refuse after it is purified Some persons reckon two kinds of foam only which they call lithus and peu mene 9 the third kind molybdena will be mentioned when I treat of lead To render this foam fit for use it is broken into pieces the size of a walnut 1 and is again roasted the flame being urged by bellows in order to separate the charcoal and the ashes it is then washed and at the same time quenched in vinegar or in wine 1 If it be the species called argyritis in order to give it the proper whiteness we are directed to break it into pieces the size of a bean and then to boil it in water in an earthen vessel together with a quantity of new wheat or barley tied up in linen until it is purified it is then pounded in a mortar for six days being washed three times each day with cold water and lastly with hot water adding to each pound of the foam an obolus of rock salt 3 During the last day they digest it in a leaden vessel Some persons boil it with white beans and barley water and dry it in the sun others with white wool and beans and continue the process until the wool is no longer blackened by it Then they add the rock salt the water being changed from time to time and they dry it for forty days in the warmest summer weather They also boil it in a pig s stomach4 with water afterwards rub it with natron and then pound it in mortars with salt as directed above Others again there are who do not boil it but rub it with salt and wash it with water It is used for eye salves and it is employed by females in the form of ointment to remove pimples and spots of the skin and to wash the hair Its virtues are to dry to soften to cool to temper to purge to fill up ulcers and to remove tumours When made into plaisters with rue myrtle and vine gar it relieves erysipelas and when mixed with myrtle and wax it removes chilblains 9 The MSS differ in the spelling of the words they are probably derived from AiOoc and Uvtvpa and refer to the mechanical texture of the substance 1 This reading I conceive to be sanctioned by the passage from Diosco rides quoted below 1 This operation is described by Dioscorides lib v cap 56 p 662 Kavaue airoriBtao Coquendi argenti spuma hoc modo est in frustra juglandis nucis magnitudine earn dividito in carbonibus ponito follibusque usque dum ignita condeat ventilato Auferto deinde inhse rentes illi sordes omnes purgatamque reponito 3 Sal fossile 4  In ventre suillo this may perhaps refer not to the actual stomach of an animal but to some vessel of the form of a stomach CINNABAR 55 36 OF MINIUM  S HOW SACRED IT WAS CONSIDERED AMONG THE ANCIENTS Minium is also found in veins of silver ore a substance which both in our own times is in high estimation as a pigment and was formerly considered by the Romans not only as most highly va luable but even as sacred Verrius enumerates certain writers of unquestionable veracity who inform us that on festivals the face of the statue of Jupiter was smeared with minium as were all the bodies of those who rode in triumph and this was the case with Camillus In consequence of this superstition it is that at this day minium is added to the unguents which are employed in the triumphal entertainments and that the first duty of the censors is to have the minium ap plied to the statue of Jupiter I cannot but wonder what was the origin of this custom We learn indeed that at this day the same substance is in request among the Ethiopians and that all their nobility and the statues of their gods are coloured with it It therefore behoves us to make all possible inquiry respecting it 37 OF ITS DISCOVERY AND ORIGIN Theophrastus informs us that ninety years before Praxibulus was chief magistrate of Athens which answers to the 394th year of our city minium was discovered by Callias the Athenian while he was endeavouring to procure gold by calcining the red sand which is found in the silver ores this is said to have been its ori gin It had been previously found in Spain but in a hard and gritty state also among the Colchians in a certain inaccessible rock from which it was detached by darts This however was a bastard kind the best was obtained above Ephesus in the Cil bianian country The sand has a scarlet colour it is rubbed down the powder is washed and the part which subsides is washed a second time The difference between the modes in which it is prepared is that some persons procure the minium by one wash ing only while others use more water and obtain the best kind by a subsequent washing 5 By the term minium Pliny designated the sulphuret of mercury cin nabar or native vermillion not the red oxide of lead according to the modern use of the word Agricola employs it in the same way with Pliny De Nat Foss lib x and De Re Met p 68  0 56 CINNABAR 38 OF CINNABAH 6 I am not surprised at the high estimation in which this colour has been held Even in the time of the Trojans Rubrica1 was much valued according to the testimony of Homer who praises the ships that were painted with it 8 although on most occasions he is very sparing of his remarks on paintings and pigments Minium is called by the Greeks Milton and by some persons Cinnabar Hence arises the mistake respecting the substance which is called Cinnabar by the Indians for they give this name to the blood of the dragon when it is crushed by the weight of the elephant dying on it in the way which I have described above 9 the blood of the two animals being mixed together There is no other pigment which gives the proper blood colour in painting Cinnabar is of great use both as an antidote and a medicine but by Jove the physicians instead of the proper Cinnabar actually use this which is made from Minium and which is itself a poison as I shall show hereafter 0 Dioscorides gives an account of cinnabar in lib v cap 63 p 668 he was not aware of its relation to minium Agricola was acquainted with this relation and with the true nature of cinnabar as a compound of mer cury and sulphur De Re Met p 460 1 he calls it Miniumfactitium De Nat Foss lib ix p 358 9 The ancients appear to have had no cor rect idea of the relation of these substances to each other  For a farther account of Rubrica see lib xxxv sec 14 It is described by Dioscorides under the name of piXrov v 65 6 where we have an ac count of both the native and the artificial species the latter is said to be produced by calcining ochre The same statement is made by Agricola De Re Met p 461 he gives a full description of Rubrica in the treatise De Nat Foss lib ii p 204 it appears to be a kind of red ochre Vitru vius classes Rubrica with Si as species of ochres vii 7 In the line supposed to be referred to in this place II ii 637 Homer simply mentions the fact that the ships of Ulysses were fuXroTrapijoi without any expression of praise or admiration There is however reason to suppose that by itiXrov the ancients meant a species of red ochre The ophrastus classes it with w pa as substances of an earthy nature De Lap sec 71 Op p 396 7 9 Lib viii sec 12 This tale is repeated by Solinus as is ordinarily the case with all the improbable stories that are referred to by Pliny Speaking of the contest of the dragon and the elephant Solinus says Itaque cum ebiberunt dracones sanguinem dum ruunt belluae dracones obruuntur Sic utrinque fusus cum terram imbuit fitque pigmentum quiquid soli tinxerit quod cinnabari vocant cap 26 See also Salmasius in Exerc Plin p 140 CINNABAR 57 39 MODE OF USING CINNABAR AND MINIUM IN PICTURES The ancients painted those pictures with cinnabar which are now called monochromata1 They painted them also with the minium of Ephesus but this custom was abandoned in conse quence of the great care which it required in its preparation Be sides these substances were both of them thought too corrosive on this account they substituted for them Rubrica and Sinopis  of which I shall speak in the proper place Cinnabar is adul terated with goat s blood and with the triturated fruit of the service tree The price of it when pure is fifty sesterces the pound 40 SPECIES OF MINIUM MEDICINES FEOM IT We are informed by Juba that minium is also procured in Carmania and by Timagines that it is also found in Ethiopia But it is not brought to us from either of these places nor indeed scarcely from any place except Spain The most celebrated kind comes from the district of the Sisapo in Bretica this mine of minium is a source of considerable revenue to the Romans and is guarded with very great care The substance is not allowed to be purified or roasted on the spot but is brought to Rome sealed up to the amount of 10 000 lbs weight annually it is then washed at Rome The price of it is fixed by an express statute not to exceed seventy sesterces the pound but it is adulterated in various ways by which the company defraud the public For there ia another kind of minium that is found in all silver and in many lead ores which is formed by calcining the stone that is mixed with the veins not that out of which quicksilver exudes for this is converted into quicksilver by being calcined but from other minerals which are found along with it Those minerals which are barren in lead are recognized by their peculiar colour not becoming red unless by calcination after which they are 1 Painted in one colour only they are treated of in lib xxxv sec 5  alibi  For a farther account of Sinopis see lib xxxv sec 13 it appears to have been a species of brown or yellow ochre See Theophrastus De Lapid sec 2t also Agricola De Re Met p 462 58 CINNABAR ground to powder 3 This is the second rate kind of minium which indeed is known to very few and which is much less valu able than the native species And this is the substance which is employed by our public companies to adulterate genuine minium In this way they make Syricum by a process which I shall describe it in its proper place It is evident by reckoning the cost of the article that in painting with minium the ground is often laid with syricum Another dishonest custom which painters practise is to wash the brushes when they are loaded with paint this settles to the bottom of the water and is pilfered by the work men Pure minium ought to have the rich colour of crimson When the inferior kind is laid upon walls in consequence of their moisture the colour becomes very much less brilliant yet this is supposed to be a species of metallic rust In the Sisaponensian minium mines the ore is calcined without silver like gold It is tested by heated gold the factitious kind is rendered black while the colour of the genuine kind is not affected I find that it is also adulterated by lime If there be no gold at hand a plate of heated iron may be substituted for the gold Exposure to the light either of the sun or of the moon is injurious to the colour the remedy is to cover the wall when it is become dry with a mixture of Punic wax and oil which is to be laid on while hot with hair brushes It is to be heated again by burning gall nuts 5 until the surface melts it is then smoothed down with tapers 6 and afterwards rubbed with clean linen cloths as marbles are cleaned and polished 7 The workmen who prepare minium in the manufactories bind bladders loosely over the face to prevent them from taking the poison 3 Theophrastus speaks of a native and an artificial minium the latter would appear to be merely a pulverized red earth Op p 399 De Lapid sec 103 4 Lib xxxv sec 24 The only account we have of it is that it is formed by a mixture of  Sinopis and  Sandyx which appear to be species of ochres 5 Admotis gallse carbonibus the galls would act in no other way than as a convenient mode of applying heat 6 Candelis subigitur it seems difficult to determine what was the com position of the candeta and what was the object of this part of the process This process is described by Vitruvius the painted surface is covered with a mixture of wax and oil this is melted by burning coals and rubbed with a roll of linen cloth the application of the candela is omitted lib vii cap 9 Newton s Trans p 169 QUICKSILVER 59 ous vapour into the lungs while at the same time they are able to see through them Minium is employed in books for writing the more conspicuous letters this is also done in inscriptions or monuments whether of gold or of marble 41 OF HYDRARGYRUM There has been invented from the inferior kind of minium 8 an artificial quicksilver to be used instead of the native kind It is made in two ways either by triturating minium with vinegar in a copper mortar or by placing it in an iron shell or earthern dish covered with a head over which a quantity of clay has been spread 9 A fire is then kindled under the dish and kept up by bellows the moisture which exudes from the head is wiped off and will be found to resemble silver in colour and water in fluidity It is easily divided into globules which run together into a liquid which slips through the fingers 1 And because it is certain that this is poisonous I conceive that all the accounts which we possess of the use of minium as a medicine are not to be trusted except perhaps its application to the head or the abdomen for the purpose of stopping haemorrhages provided it does not penetrate into the bowels or touch the wound I for my part think it ought not to be used on any other occasion s Ex secondario Our author must have been misinformed on this point as the substance which he describes as the inferior minium is not an oxide of mercury The editors and translators presuming as it would ap pear that Pliny was a complete chemist and mineralogist have taken much pains to amend or explain this passage see note in the French trans t x p 636 7 and in Valpy p 4380 9 We have the same process described by Dioscorides lib v cap 64 XSpapyvpog St OKtvaStrai vipapyvpog ytvtrai Fit ex minio quod falso cinnabaris dicitur argentum vivum Confectionis autem modus hie est In fictilem patinam ferream habentem concham minium conjicitur Calice dien luto circumlito fictilis cooperitur patina ilia  accensisque sub eas carbonibus qute calici fuligo inhiesit derasa refri gerataque argentum vivum est 1 The process for obtaining quicksilver from its oxide is detailed by Vitruvius he also states at some length the properties of the quicksilver so procured among other particulars he remarks that four sextarii weighed 100 lb vii 8 This estimate is not very far from the truth if we sup pose the sextarius to have been equal to 1J pint the above mentioned quantity of mercury will weigh about 589 000 grs equal to a little more than 103 lbs See Wurm sec 66 p 116  0 60 TOUCHSTONES 42 OF GILDING SILVER Silver is now almost the only metal which is gilt by means of quicksilver although it ought to be also employed in the gilding of copper But the same kind of cunning which is so very in genious in every department of life has discovered some cheaper material as I have mentioned above 43 OF TOUCHSTONES FOR GOLD In speaking of gold and silver it is necessary to take notice of what is styled the touchstone formerly found only in the river Tmolus according to the account of Theophrastus but now found in many situations some call it the Heraclian stone others the Lydian 3 They are of moderate size not exceeding four inches in length and two in breadth The side which has been exposed to the sun is thought to be better than that which has lain upon the earth Those who are practised in the use of these stones when they have rasped off a fragment of ore from the vein for the pur pose of experiment can immediately say how much gold or sil ver or copper it contains being able from their wonderful skill to ascertain the quantity with great minuteness 44 SPECIES OF SILVER AND TESTS There are two different kinds of silver A small portion of the metal in question being placed on heated iron bars if it remains white it is considered pure the next best kind becomes red when it becomes black it is very bad But fraud is often prac tised in this experiment The bars are kept in the urine of men and hence when the specimen is heated its colour is affected and â Sec 32 Â The Basanitc of Kirwan i 307 the Lydian stone of Jameson L 107 the Pierre de Lydie of Brochant i 286 the Lapis Lydius of Aikin ii 3 and Thomson iii 302 It is mentioned by Theophrastus Opera p 397 8 De Lap sec 78 Salmasius in reference to the subject accuses Pliny of having fallen into a gross error in confounding the Heraclean with the Lydian stone Exer Plin p 776 it appears however that in this in stance this learned critic has committed an oversight for Theophrastus expressly informs us that the touchstone was called indifferently by either of these names Op p 392 De Lap sec 10 MIRRORS 61 it acquires a false whiteness There is another method of testing polished silver by observing when it is breathed upon whether the moisture quickly evaporates 45 OF MIRRORS It was generally supposed that the finest kind of silver only could be spread out into leaves or made into mirrors but this art is also injured by fraud The property of reflecting the image of objects is very wonderful evidently depending on the air rever berating and again entering the eye It is owing to the same power in the mirrors that when their thickness is much worn away by polishing and the surface in some degree depressed the size of the image is immensely dilated So different is the effect ac cording as the mirror throws back the image or receives it into its substance Drinking vessels are likewise so formed by having as it were a number of mirrors carved within them that a single individual looking into them sees a multitude of persons There are some mirrors so contrived as to distort the objects as the con secrated mirrors in the temple at Smyrna it depends on the form which is given them The most important point is whether they are concave like a cup or like a Thracian shield whether the middle is depressed or elevated placed transversely or obliquely directed upwards or straight forwards the figure of the surface that reflects the the objects bending as it were the forms  that proceed from them For the image is nothing more than the brightness of the matter which receives the forms regularly ar ranged And that I may state in this place all that is known re specting mirrors the best that our ancestors had were made at Brundisium of a mixture of stannum5 and copper The silver 4  Umbrae Umbras vocant simulacra rerum ipsa a nostris corporibus missa et profusa in corpvis lseve et splendidum et densum Epicuri haec sententia est de ratione speculorum Note in Valpy p 4383 It may be remarked however that the word umbra is never used in this sense by Lucretius he employs the term simulacrum see his fourth book 1 34 97 126 et alibi The Epicurean doctrine of the simulacra Quae quasi membranae summo de corpore rerum Direptte volitant ultro citroque per auras is very amply explained by Creech in his notes See also Enfield s Philo sophy i 468 9 5 For stannum see remarks in note 3 p 48 r 62 EGYPTIAN SILVER mirrors are however now preferred These were first made by Praxiteles about the time of Pompey the Great Of late years it has been thought that they give a truer image of the object when gold is applied to the back of the mirror 46 OF EGYPTIAN SILVER The Egyptians also colour their silver that they may behold their god Anubis on their vessels they do not engrave but paint their silver This practice was afterwards applied to triumphal statues and it is remarkable that their cost is increased by what diminishes their splendour It is done in this manner They mix with the silver one third part of the thinnest Cyprian copper which is called Coronarium with a quantity of sulphur equal to the silver These are fused together in an earthern pot lined all round with clay the process is continued until the covering of the pot opens of itself 6 Silver is also blackened by being coated with coagulated egg but this may be afterwards rubbed off by vinegar and chalk Anthony the triumvir mixed iron with the denarii the coin is now debased by copper Sometimes the coin is made short of its proper weight this ought to be such that eighty four denarii are made out of one pound of metal The plan of fixing a legal standard for the coin which was formed by Marius Gratidianus was so popular among the people that statues of him were placed in every street It is however remarkable that this very plan should have become the means of practising fraud for we find that a specimen of a base denarius is highly valued and that there are persons who will give several genuine denarii for a counterfeit one 47 OF IMMODERATE SUMS OF MONEY WHAT INDIVIDUALS WERE THE MOST WEALTHY There were no fortunes among the ancients larger than 100 000 sesterces but in our times this sum is so much multi plied that we hear of ten times 100 000 7 or even more This 6 The effect of this process would be to form a sulphuret of silver 7 The sums mentioned in the text are 807 5 Wd and 10 350 re spectively PRIVATE WEALTH 63 has been brought about by usury and by coining and hence is derived the term aes alienum 8 debt Then certain persons assumed the surname of Dives but let it be known that he who first took this name had compounded with his creditors A member of the family M Crassus said that he did not consider any one wealthy who could not pay the yearly expense of a legion His estates were worth 2 000 000 sesterces 9 next to Sylla he was consi dered the most wealthy of the Romans But this was not enough for him he thirsted for the gold of the Parthians and let it never be forgotten that he obtained what he so earnestly wished for it is proper that we observe the consequence of this insatiable desire of wealth We have however in later times known many even among the freedmen who have been richer There were three at one time when Claudius was emperor Pallas Callistus and Narcissus But to omit these as still in possession of their wealth in the consulship of C Asinius Galbus and C Martius Censorinus C Caecilius Claudius Isodorus declared by his will dated 6th kal of February that notwithstanding he had lost much in the civil wars he had still left 4 116 slaves 3 600 yoke of oxen 357 000 head of cattle of other kinds and in money 600 000 sesterces 1 He directed that 11 000 sesterces should be spent on his funeral These men no doubt heaped together un bounded wealth yet what a small part was this of what Ptolemy possessed Who as Varro informs us when Pompey was engaged in the Jewish war supported by his own funds 8 000 horsemen and entertained 1 000 guests each of them being furnished with gold cups and these being changed at each course of the enter tainment And what a small proportion would this bear to the wealth of Pythius the Bithynian not to speak of kings who presented Darius with the golden plane tree and the noble vine and feasted all the army of Xerxes amounting to 788 000 men promising also that he would provide five months pay and provi sions for them on condition that one of his five sons might be spared to him to comfort his old age 1 Yet even he would not appear rich when compared with king Croesus But good God what madness it is to be anxious to acquire what either falls to the 8 Alienated copper thus as it were estimating their property by copper 9 If we estimate a sestertium or 1000 sestertii at 61 Is 5 d Crassus s property mentioned in the text will be 1 614 583 6s Sd See Adam p 497 1 Estimated at 484 375 1 See Herodotus lib vii sec 27 64 SILVER VESSELS lot of slaves or which even kings themselves have not been able to attain 48 WHEN THE ROMANS FIRST GAVE LARGESSES The Roman people began to give largesses in the consulship of Sp Postumius and Q Martius Money was then so plentiful that a sum was given to L Scipio with which he instituted public games With respect to the copper sextans which was collected for the funeral of Agrippa Menenius I do not regard it as a largess but as done in honour of him and what was rendered necessary by his poverty 49 OF LUXURY IN SILVER VESSELS The wonderful fickleness of the human mind is perpetually varying the forms of our silver vessels never long together approv ing of any one kind now adopting the Firmian pattern now the Clodian nowtheGratian for we give the names of the silversmiths to our sideboards Next we search after chased vessels 4 with de signs engraven on them We likewise place our dishes upon stands s and we cut away their sides in order that they may hold the pro visions and they are considered the more valuable the more they aTe filed away Calvus the orator complained that our cooking utensils were made of silver but we have ornamented even our chariots with chased silver and in our own times Poppasa the wife of the Emperor Nero had the shoes of her favourite mules made of gold 50 EXAMPLES OF ANCIENT FRUGALITY IN THE USE OF SILVER The second Africanus left his heir only 32 lbs weight of silver The same individual when he triumphed over the Carthaginians transmitted to the treasury 4 380 lbs weight of silver This was the total amount of silver possessed by Carthage that rival of the whole earth but in these days how many services for the table have exceeded this sum After the destruction of Numantium 3 Martial gives us a curious list of the different kinds of silver vessels that were the most esteemed when he wrote Epig iv 38   Anaglypta avayXvirra coelata 5  Repositoria supports pour les plats French trans t x p 619 SILVER VESSELS Go the same Africanus at his triumph distributed to his soldiers seven denarii a piece Men worthy indeed of such a general to be satisfied with this His brother Allobrogicus was the first who had as much as 1 000 lbs weight and Livius Drusus when he was tribune of the people 10 000 lbs At this day it appears incredible that an individual after having had the honour of a triumph should have been reproved in his old age by the censors because he possessed 5 lbs weight of silver And likewise that Catus JSlius when the ambassadors of the iEtolians came to him and found him dining off earthen ware would not receive the silver vessels that were presented to him and never to the last day of his life possessed any silver utensils except two cups which L Pau Ius his father in law gave him on account of his valour when he conquered King Perseus It was a saying of the Carthaginian ambassadors that no people are kinder to each other than the Romans for they used the same service of plate at all the dif ferent houses And we know for a certainty that Pompeius Pau linus the son of a Roman knight of Aries and a person of a very honourable family 6 was banished to a barbarous country because he had in his army 12 lbs weight of silver 51 WHEN SILVER WAS FIRST ADDED TO COUCHES The couches 7 of the women have been for some time past en tirely covered with silver and this is the case sometimes with the couches which are used at meals 8 Cavilius Pollio is said to have been the first who introduced this custom not entirely covering them after the Delian mode but according to the Carthaginian He also employed gold for the same purpose and it was not long after this time that silver couches were used like those from Delos But all this was expiated by the civil war of Sylla 6  Paternaque gente pellitum whose family were privileged to wear a particular dress This expression has been supposed to be illustrated by a line in Claudian Crinigeri sedere patres pellita Getarum Curia De Bell Get 481 2 Â Lecti s  Triclinia This word is applied sometimes to the couches used at meals so named because they held three persons each and sometimes to the room in which the meals were taken In Vitruvius vi 5 and 8 it re it refers to the room in vi 6 it refers to the couches Newton Trans note p 137 remarks  the triclinium or triclinia as in the eighth chapter fol lowing was the dining room the word is sometimes used for the dining table and surrounding couches on which they lay to eat F SILVER VESSELS 52 WHEN DISHES WEKE MADE OF AN IMMODERATE SIZE WHEN TYMPANA WERE FIRST MADE It was a little before this time that dishes were made each con taining 100 lbs weight of silver of which it appears there were more than five hundred in Rome and it seems that many persons were proscribed on this very account by the knavery of people who longed for them What a scandal does it bring upon our annals to ascribe the civil war to such vices But in our times we are still bolder In the reign of Claudius one of his servants Drusillus surnamed Rotundus who was his treasurer in the province of Northern Spain had a dish of 500 lbs weight so that it was necessary to have a manufactory erected for the express purpose of making it and there were eight others belonging to the same set amounting in the whole to 850 lbs weight We may ask how many of his fellow servants would it require to carry these dishes and how many guests would they entertain Corn Nepos informs us that before the victory of Sylla there were only two sil ver supper couches in all Rome Fenestrella who died in the last year of the Emperor Tiberius says that it was within his memory that silver was first employed to ornament the stands 9 and also that tortoise shell1 came into use A little before his time they were made of common wood round and solid and not much larger than tables when he was a boy they were made square and more compact and began to be covered with maple or citron wood after a while silver was put on the corners and lines of them and also along the joints When he was a young man what had formerly been called platters and trenchers began to be called plates and dishes 1 53 IMMODERATE QUANTITIES OF SILVER And men were not only mad after the silver itself but almost still more so after the manner of working it and this indeed was 9  Repositoria 1  Testudinea In lib ix sec 13 the author observes Testudinum putamina secare in laminas lectosque et repositoria his vestire â Tympana and magides staterae and lances are the terms employed by the author We have no corresponding terms in our language and it is perhaps impossible to discover to what forms of dishes they were applied by the Romans We meet indeed with one of the names in Varro Ma gidam aut Langulam alteram a magnitudine alteram ab latitudine finx erunt De Ling Lat t i p 34 SILVER STATUES 67 the case informer times so to form some apology for our own age C Gracchus possessed Delphian vessels which cost 5 000 sesterces the pound and Lucius Cassius had two cups engraven by the artist Mentor which cost 100 000 sesterces but he confessed that he was ashamed ever to use them It is also well known that he had vessels which cost 600 000 sesterces the pound It was the conquest of Asia which introduced luxury into Italy for we are told that Lucius Scipio brought over at his triumph 1 450 lbs weight of chased silver besides 1 500 lbs weight of gold vessels this was in the 565th year since the foundation of the city This same Asia when it was presented to us as a gift inflicted still greater injury upon our morals and the inheritance of which we came into possession at the death of king Attalus was still of less use than that victory For then all sense of shame was entirely destroyed by the eagerness for purchasing the articles at the sale of the royal effects this was in the 662d year of the city so that in the space of fifty seven years the people had learned not only to admire but even to covet foreign wealth And this feeling re ceived a prodigious impulse by the conquest of Achaia during which interval i e in the 608th year of the city that nothing might be wanting there was a great influx of statues and pictures Luxury was also much increased by the reduction of Carthage so that it seemed as if the fates conspired to give us both the means and the will to pursue all kinds of vice But in deed some of our ancestors had endeavoured to gain credit by this kind of conduct C Marius after the victory over the Cimbri is said to have drunk out of a great tankard in order that he might be like father Bacchus and this is the man who was ori ginally a ploughman at Arpinum and was afterwards taken out of the ranks and made a general 54 OF SILVER STATUES It is an erroneous opinion that silver was first used for statues in the time of the late Emperor Augustus by way of paying court to him For we find that in the triumph of Pompey the Great there was a silver statue of Pharnaces sent to Rome the first of that name who reigned in Pontus and of Mithridates the son of Eupator there were likewise chariots both of gold and of silver In some cases silver has come after gold as in the ankle rings worn by the women of the lower orders which they preferred being f3 SILVER STATUES of silver from their having been so commonly made of gold And in our own time we have the example of Arellius Fuse us he who was degraded from the equestrian order in consequence of his being followed by a number of young men who had his rings made of silver But to what purpose do I collect facts of this de scription when the hilts of the soldiers1 swords are carved in sil ver ivory being quite despised and when their sheaths and belts absolutely rattle with silver chains and plates Even the young pages wear a ring of silver 3 and the women cannot wash their feet except in silver vessels and the same material is used both to hold our food and for the most degrading purposes Could Fa bricius see these things the baths of the women paved with silver so that there is not even a spot left to set the foot on the women also bathing along with the men could Fabricius I say who forbad even the bravest generals to possess more than a plate and a salt cellar of silver see what ought to be kept as a reward for valour converted to such purposes But alas for our manners we are now ashamed of Fabricius 55 DISTINGUISHED WORKS AND WORKMEN IN SILVER 4 It is remarkable that no one has distinguished himself in the engraving of gold while so many have in silver Mentor 4 whom I mentioned above was the most celebrated There were four pair of vases entirely executed by him but none of them are said now to exist in consequence of the Temple of Ephesus and the Ca pitol having been burned down Varro says that he had a bronze statue made by this artist Those who stand next to him are Acragus Boethus and Mys There are works of all these now at Rhodes the Minerva of Boethus at Lindus a statue by Acra gus in the temple of father Bacchus and in the city of Rhodes the female Bacchante and the Centaur carved on goblets in the same temple are the Silenus and the Cupids of Mys The hunt executed on a goblet by Acragus is very celebrated The next after them in reputation are Calamis and Antipater and also Stra tonicus whose figure of a satyr oppressed by sleep is more pro perly said to be laid upon the jar than carved on it After these s  Ad transitum virilitatis custodiantur argento See Celsus lib vii cap 25 sec 3 4 Mentor and Praxitiles are among the artists mentioned by Martial in the epigram referred to above p 64 SIT 69 comes Tauriscus of Cyzicum Ariston and Eunicus of Mytilene and Hecataeus are also much admired and about the age of Pompey the Great we have Praxitiles Posidonius the Ephesian and Ledus Stratiates who executed battles and men in armour and Zopyrus who engraved the magistrates of the Areopagus and the judgment of Orestes on two goblets which were valued at 12 000 sesterces Then there is Pytheus two ounces of whose work sold for 10 000 sesterces the subject was Ulysses and Diomed carrying off the Palladium intended to be attached to a jar 5 The same artist likewise made little figures which he calls Magiriscia 6 and which were carved on small cups and so deli cately wrought that it was impossible to take models of them with out injuring them Teucer also who made figures on medallions 7 gained considerable credit But this art was so suddenly lost that these works are now valued solely for their antiquity the figures having been so rubbed down that they are scarcely visible Silver is affected by mineral waters and even by the saline vapours that arise from them as is observed to be the case in the middle of Spain 56 OF SIL  8 WHO FIItST FAINTED WITH SIL AND IN WHAT MANNER Certain pigments are also found connected with the gold and silver ores viz Sil and Cceruleum Sil is properly a kind of mud the best kind is said to come from Attica it costs two denarii the pound The next in value is the gritty kind which is half the price of the first the third is the dense kind which some call Syricum as coming from the isle of Syros This kind had been previously brought from Achaia and is used for the shades of pictures its price is two sesterces the pound The bright kind which comes from Gaul is sold at two ases less than the former This kind and that from Attica are used for giving the lights to Â  In

pictures but for painting of pannels the gritty species alone is used because the grit which is in it resists the acrid nature of the lime It is dug out of the hills about twenty miles from the city It is afterwards calcined and is so adulterated that it is sold for the pressed kind But that it is counterfeit and has been calcined is evident from its acrid nature for we find that it falls into pow der Polygnotus and Micon were the first painters who used Sil they however used the Attic kind only In the following age this kind was used to produce the lights the Syrican and the Lydian being for the shades The Lydian was procured at Sardis but is no longer used 57 OF CCBBULEUM 1 Coeruleum is a kind of sand Formerly there were three kinds of it the Egyptian which is the most esteemed the Scythian which is easily mixed up and when it is triturated produces four shades of colour some lighter and others darker but the Cyprian is preferred to this Besides these there is that from Puteoli and from Spain which is prepared there artificially from sand They are all coloured by being boiled with a certain plant the juice of which they imbibe the process is the same with that which is employed for making chrysocolla From Coeruleum is produced 9  Abacus j this term seems to be applied by Vitmvius to various parts of architecture in lib iii cap 3 and in iv 1 and 7 it is supposed to desig nate the flat stone that is placed over the capital of a column while in vii 3 and 4 it means a pannel or entablature see the lexicon to Rhode s Vitruvius and the note in Newton s trans p 160 and 162 he remarks that the general signification of the term is a flat tabulated surface 1 Dioscorides describes  nvavog translated by Virgilius Coeruleum as being found in the copper mines of Cyprus and formed in caverns on the sea shore lib v cap 60 See also Vitruvius vii 9 and 11 Rhode in his Lexicon and Newton p 172 note suppose it to be smalt or the oxide of cobalt but there is reason to suppose that the ancients were not acquainted with this substance Theophrastus speaks of Kvavog as a substance of a sandy nature and mentions both the native and the artificial species Op p 399 It was probably a carbonate of copper the azure or mountain blue of the moderns see Kirwan s Min i 129 1 Jameson s Min ii 218 6 Brochant Min ii 190 6 and Aikins Diet i 321 Theophras tus also applies the word Kvavog to a kind of gem Op p 395 perhaps Lapis Lazuli The word kvovoq appears likewise to have been occasionally employed to signify a species of metal Homer speaks of ni ag Kvavog as en tering into the composition of the breast plate of Agamemnon II xi lin 24 CffiRULEUM 71 what we call Lomentum 1 it is made by washing or triturating the Coeruleum and is somewhat lighter coloured its price is ten denarii the pound Cceruleum is eight It is used for painting on chalk 3 but it will not bear quicklime Another kind has been lately introduced which from the name of the maker is called Vestorianum it is formed from the lighter part of the Egyptian and costs eleven denarii the pound It is applied to the same use as that from Puteoli and likewise for windows it is called Cyanon We have lately begun to bring a species from India which is eight denarii the pound its principal use in painting is to mark the lines which separate the shadows from the lighter parts There is a very inferior kind which is called ground Lomentum worth five ases only To try the purity of Cceruleum we throw it on burning coals and observe whether it inflames a counterfeit kind is made from a decoction of dried violets adding the expressed juice to Eretrian chalk 58 MEDICINES FROM CffiRULEUM Its medical virtue is to cleanse ulcers it is also an ingredient in plaisters and caustics Sil is triturated with great difficulty its effect is to produce a slight irritation and astringency by means of which it fills up ulcers but in order that it may produce these effects it is necessary for it to be calcined in earthen vessels I am aware that the prices which I have mentioned differ in different places and that they vary almost every year according to the state of commerce and the circumstances of the merchants or in consequence of the price being raised by the artifices of any great monopolizer I well recollect how when Nero was Emperor Demetrius was accused by all the druggists4 of Capua before the consuls It was however necessary that I should state what are the ordinary prices at Rome in order to establish a general rule respecting them and Aristotle expressly designates it  to ptraWov in
