Glory of Belisarius â His domestic Shnme and Misfortunes When Justinian ascended the throne about fifty chap years after the fall of the Western empire the king doms of the Goths and Vandals had obtained a solid Justinian and as it might seem a legal establishment both in invade Europe and Africa The titles which Roman victory A r a 533 had inscribed were erazed with equal justice by the sword of the Barbarians and their successful rapine derived a more venerable sanction from time from treaties and from the oaths of fidelity already re peated by a second or third generation of obedient subjects Experience and Christianity had refuted the superstitious hope that Rome was founded by the gods to reign for ever over the nations of the VOL IV b 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap earth But the proud claim of perpetual and inde _ feasible dominion which her soldiers could no longer maintain was firmly asserted by her statesmen and lawyers whose opinions have been sometimes revived and propagated in the modern schools of jurispru dence After Rome herself had been stripped of the Imperial purple the princes of Constantinople as sumed the sole and sacred sceptre of the monarchy demanded as their rightful inheritance the provinces which had been subdued by the consuls or possessed by the Caesars and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of the West from the usurpation of heretics and barbarians The execution of this splendid design was in some degree reserved for Justinian During the five first years of his reign he reluctantly waged a costly and unprofitable war against the Persians till his pride submitted to his ambition and he purchased at the price of four hun dred and forty thousand pounds sterling the benefit of a precarious truce which in the language of both nations was dignified with the appellation of the endless peace The safety of the East enabled the emperor to employ his forces against the Vandals and the internal state of Africa afforded an honour able motive and promised a powerful support to the Roman arms  state of the According to the testament of the founder the HuLric African kingdom had lineally descended to Hilderic 53o 523 tne eldest of the Vandal princes A mild disposition inclined the son of a tyrant the grandson of a con queror to prefer the counsels of clemency and peace and his accession was marked by the salutary edict  The complete series of the Vandal war is related by Procopius in a regular and elegant narrative 1 i c 9â 25 1 ii c  1â 13 and happy would be my lot could I always tread in the footsteps of such a guide From the entire and diligent perusal of the Greek text I have a right to pronounce that the Latin and French versions of Grotius and Cousin may not be implicitly trusted yet the president Cousin has been often praised and Hugo Grotius was the first scholar of a learned age OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE which restored two hundred bishops to their churches chap Â 1CXXTV and allowed the free profession of the Athanasian creed But the Catholics accepted with cold and transient gratitude a favour so inadequate to their pretensions and the virtues of Hilderic offended the prejudices of his countrymen The Arian clergy presumed to insinuate that he had renounced the faith and the soldiers more loudly complained that he had degenerated from the courage of his ancestors His ambassadors were suspected of a secret and dis graceful negotiation in the Byzantine court and his general the Achilles as he was named of the Vandals lost a battle against the naked and disorderly Moors The public discontent was exasperated by Gelimer Geiimer whose age descent and military fame gave him an ls34 5 apparent title to the succession he assumed with the consent of the nation the reins of government and his unfortunate sovereign sunk without a struggle from the throne to a dungeon where he was strictly guarded with a faithful counsellor and his unpopular nephew the Achilles of the Vandals But the in dulgence which Hilderic had shown to his Catholic subjects had powerfully recommended him to the favour of Justinian who for the benefit of his own sect could acknowledge the use and justice of re ligious toleration their alliance while the nephew of Justin remained in a private station was cemented by the mutual exchange of gifts and letters  and the emperor Justinian asserted the cause of royalty and friendship In two successive embassies he admo nished the usurper to repent of his treason or to abstain at least from any further violence which might provoke the displeasure of God and of the Romans to reverence the laws of kindred and suc cession and to suffer an infirm old man peaceably to end his days either on the throne of Carthage or in the palace of Constantinople The passions or even b2 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap the prudence of Gelimer compelled him to reject _ these requests which were urged in the haughty tone of menace and command and he justified his ambition in a language rarely spoken in the By zantine court by alleging the right of a free people to remove or punish their chief magistrate who had failed in the execution of the kingly office After this fruitless expostulation the captive monarch was more rigorously treated his nephew was deprived of his eyes and the cruel Vandal confident in his strength and distance derided the vain threats and slow preparations of the emperor of the East Jus tinian resolved to deliver or revenge his friend Ge limer to maintain his usurpation and the war was preceded according to the practice of civilized nations by the most solemn protestations that each party was sincerely desirous of peace SebAfricÂ n e report of an African war was grateful only to war the vain and idle populace of Constantinople whose poverty exempted them from tribute and whose cowardice was seldom exposed to military service But the wiser citizens who judged of the future by the past revolved in their memory the immense loss both of men and money which the empire had sus tained in the expedition of Basiliscus The troops which after five laborious campaigns had been re called from the Persian frontier dreaded the sea the climate and the arms of an unknown enemy The ministers of the finances computed as far as they might compute the demands of an African war  the taxes which must be found and levied to supply those insatiate demands and the danger lest their own lives or at least their lucrative employments should be made responsible for the deficiency of the supply Inspired by such selfish motives for we may not suspect him of any zeal for the public good John of Cappadocia ventured to oppose in full council the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 inclinations of his master He confessed that a chap victory of such importance could not be too dearly purchased but he represented in a grave discourse the certain difficulties and the uncertain event You undertake said the prafect  to besiege Carthage by land the distance is not less than one hundred and forty days journey on the sea a whole year must elapse before you can receive any intelligence from your fleet If Africa should be reduced it cannot be preserved without the additional conquest of Sicily and Italy Success will impose the obli gation of new labours a single misfortune will attract the Barbarians into the heart of your ex hausted empire Justinian felt the weight of this salutary advice he was confounded by the unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant and the design of the war would perhaps have been relinquished but he derived more rational hope from the revolt which the adherents of Hilderic or Athanasius had already excited on the borders of the Vandal mon archy Pudentius an African subject had privately signified his loyal intentions and a small military aid restored the province of Tripoli to the obedience of the Romans The government of Sardinia had been intrusted to Godas a valiant Barbarian he sus pended the payment of tribute disclaimed his alle giance to the usurper and gave audience to the emissaries of Justinian who found him master of that fruitful island at the head of his guards and proudly invested with the ensigns of royalty The forces of the Vandals were diminished by discord and suspicion the Roman armies were animated by the spirit of Belisarius one of those heroic names which are familiar to every age and to every nation The Africanus of new Rome was born and per character haps educated among the Thracian peasants without Sf b 15 3 Â us 6 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap any of those advantages which had formed the vir tues of the elder and the younger Scipio a noble origin liberal studies and the emulation of a free state The silence of a loquacious secretary may be admitted to prove that the youth of Belisarius could not afford any subject of praise he served most assuredly with valour and reputation among the private guards of Justinian and when his patron became emperor the domestic was promoted to military command After a bold inroad into Persarmenia in which his glory was shared by a colleague and his progress was checked by an enemy Belisarius repaired to the important station of Dara where he first accepted the service of Pro copius the faithful companion and diligent histo idsservices rian of his exploits  The Mirranes of Persia ad sian war vanced with forty thousand of her best troops to 532 529 raze the fortifications of Dara and signified the day and the hour on which the citizens should pre pare a bath for his refreshment after the toils of victory He encountered an adversary equal to himself by the new title of General of the East his superior in the science of war but much inferior in the number and quality of his troops which amounted only to twenty five thousand Romans and strangers relaxed in their discipline and humbled by recent disasters As the level plain of Dara re fused all shelter to stratagem and ambush Belisa rius protected his front with a deep trench which was prolonged at first in perpendicular and af terwards in parallel lines to cover the wings of cavalry advantageously posted to command the flanks and rear of the enemy When the Roman centre was shaken their well timed and rapid charge de cided the conflict the standard of Persia fell the  The two first Persian campaigns of Belisarius are fairly and copiously re lated by his secretary Persic 1 i c 12â 18 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 1 immortals fled the infantry threw away their buck chap lers and eight thousand of the vanquished were left on the field of battle In the next campaign Syria was invaded on the side of the desert and Beli sarius with twenty thousand men hastened from Dara to the relief of the province During the whole summer the designs of the enemy were baffled by his skilful dispositions he pressed their retreat occupied each night their camp of the pre ceding day and would have secured a bloodless vic tory if he could have resisted the impatience of his own troops Their valiant promise was faintly sup ported in the hour of battle the right wing was ex posed by the treacherous or cowardly desertion of the Christian Arabs the Huns a veteran band of eight hundred warriors were oppressed by superior num bers the flight of the Isaurians was intercepted  but the Roman infantry stood firm on the left for Beli sarius himself dismounting from his horse showed them that intrepid despair was their only safety They turned their backs to the Euphrates and their faces to the enemy innumerable arrows glanced without effect from the compact and shelving order of their bucklers an impenetrable line of pikes was opposed to the repeated assaults of the Persian ca valry and after a resistance of many hours the re maining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the night The Persian commander re tired with disorder and disgrace to answer a strict account pf the lives of so many soldiers which he had consumed in a barren victory But the fame of Belisarius was not sullied by a defeat in which alone he had saved his army from the consequences of their own rashness the approach of peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern frontier and his conduct in the sedition of Constantinople amply dis charged his obligations to the emperor When the b 4 THE DECLINE

Justinian had de clared his preference of superior merit their envy was rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the choice of Belisarius The temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a suspicion that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of his wife the fair and subtile Antonina who alternately enjoyed the confidence and incurred the hatred of the empress Theodora The birth of Antonina was ignoble she descended from a family of charioteers and her chastity has been stained with the foulest reproach Yet she reigned with long and absolute power over the mind of her illustrious husband and if Antonina disdained the merit of conjugal fidelity she expressed a manly friendship to Belisarius whom she accompanied with undaunted resolution in all the hardships and dangers of a military life  Prepara The preparations for the African war were not AeAMcan unworthy of the last contest between Rome and Car ar thage The pride and flower of the army consisted of the guards of Belisarius who according to the pernicious indulgence of the times devoted them selves by a particular oath of fidelity to the service of their patron Their strength and stature for which they had been curiously selected the goodness of their horses and armour and the assiduous practice of all the exercises of war enabled them to act what ever their courage might prompt and their

prevailing use and reputation of the cavalry and the Scythian bow was the weapon on which the armies of Rome were now reduced to place their principal dependence From a laudable desire to assert the dignity of his theme Procopius defends the soldiers of his own time against the morose critics who confined that respectable name to the heavy armed warriors of antiquity and maliciously observed that the word archer is introduced by Homer as a term of contempt Such contempt might perhaps be due to the naked youths who appeared on foot in the fields of Troy and lurking behind a tomb stone or the

thirty the largest at five hundred tons and the fair average will supply an allowance liberal but not profuse of about one hundred thousand tons for the reception of thirty five thousand soldiers and sailors of five thousand horses of arms engines and military stores and of a sufficient stock of water and provisions for a voyage perhaps of three months The proud galleys which in former ages swept the Mediterranean with so many hundred oars had long since disappeared and the fleet of Justinian was escorted only by ninety two light brigantines covered from the mis sile weapons of the enemy and rowed by two thou sand of the brave and robust youth of Constantinople Twenty two generals are named most of whom were afterwards distinguished in the wars of Africa and Italy but the supreme command both by land and sea was delegated to Belisarius alone with a bound less power of acting according to his discretion as if the emperor himself were present The separation of the naval and military professions is at once the effect and the cause of the modern improvements in the science of navigation and maritime war Departure Jn the seventh year of the reign of Justinian and of the fleet    11

first halt was made at Perinthus or Heraclea where OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE H Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian chap horses a military gift of his sovereign From thence  the fleet pursued their course through the midst of the Propontis but as they struggled to pass the straits of the Hellespont an unfavourable wind detained them four days at Abydus where the ge neral exhibited a memorable lesson of firmness and severity Two of the Huns who in a drunken quarrel had slain one of their fellow soldiers were instantly shown to the army suspended on a lofty gibbet The national indignity was resented by their countrymen who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire and asserted the free privilege of Scythia where a small fine was allowed to expiate the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger Their complaints were specious their clamours were loud and the Romans were not averse to the example of disorder and impunity But the rising sedition was appeased by the authority and eloquence of the general and he represented to the assembled troops the obligation of justice the importance of discipline the rewards of piety and virtue and the unpardonable guilt of murder which in his apprehension was aggravated rather than excused by the vice of intoxication In the navigation from the Hellespont to Peloponnesus which the Greeks after the siege of Troy had per formed in four days the fleet of Belisarius was guided in their course by his master galley con spicuous in the day by the redness of the sails and in the night by the torches blazing from the mast head It was the duty of the pilots as they steered between the islands and turned the capes of Malea and Taenarium to preserve the just order and regular intervals of such a multitude of ships as the wind was fair and moderate their labours were not un successful and the troops were safely disembarked at Methonc on the Messenian coast to repose them 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap selves for a while after the fatigues of the sea In XXXIV i    this place they experienced how avarice invested with authority may sport with the lives of thousands which are bravely exposed for the public service According to military practice the bread or biscuit of the Romans was twice prepared in the oven and a diminution of one fourth was cheerfully allowed for the loss of weight To gain this miserable profit and to save the expense of wood the praefect John of Cappadocia had given orders that the flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the baths of Constantinople and when the sacks were opened a soft and mouldy paste was distributed to the army Such unwholesome food assisted by the heat of the climate and season soon produced an epidemical disease which swept away five hundred soldiers Their health was restored by the diligence of Belisarius who provided fresh bread at Methone and boldly expressed his just and humane indig nation the emperor heard his complaint the ge neral was praised  but the minister was not punished From the port of Methone the pilots steered along the western coast of Peloponnesus as far as the isle of Zacynthus or Zant before they undertook the voyage in their eyes a most arduous voyage of one hundred leagues over the Ionian sea As the fleet was surprised by a calm sixteen days were consumed in the slow navigation and even the general would have suffered the intolerable hardship of thirst if the ingenuity of Antonina had not preserved the water in glass bottles which she buried deep in the sand in a part of the ship impervious to the rays of the sun At length the harbour of Caucana on the southern side of Sicily afforded a secure and hos pitable shelter The Gothic officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter and grandson of Theodoric obeyed their imprudent orders to re OF THE 110MAN EMPIRE 13 ceive the troops of Justinian like friends and allies chap provisions were liberally supplied the cavalry was XXXIV remounted and Procopius soon returned from Syra cuse with correct information of the state and designs of the Vandals His intelligence determined Beli sarius to hasten his operations and his wise impatience was seconded by the winds The fleet lost sight of Sicily passed before the isle of Malta discovered the capes of Africa ran along the coast with a strong gale from the north east and finally cast anchor at the promontory of Caput Vada about five days journey to the south of Carthage If Gelimer had been informed of the approach of Belisarius 1 1 1 Till C lan S 0I1 the enemy he must have delayed the conquest or the coast Sardinia for the immediate defence of his person Â sq and kingdom A detachment of five thousand sol tcmber diers and one hundred and twenty galleys would have joined the remaining forces of the Vandals and the descendant of Genseric might have surprised and oppressed a fleet of deep laden transports in capable of action and of light brigantines that seemed only qualified for flight Belisarius had se cretly trembled when he overheard his soldiers in the passage emboldening each other to confess their apprehensions if they were once on shore they hoped to maintain the honour of their arms but if they should be attacked at sea they did not blush to acknowledge that they wanted courage to contend at the same time with the winds the waves and the Barbarians The knowledge of their sentiments de cided Belisarius to seize the first opportunity of landing them on the coast of Africa and he pru dently rejected in a council of war the proposal of sailing with the fleet and army into the port of Carthage Three months after their departure from Constantinople the men and horses the arms and military stores were safely disembarked and five 14 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap soldiers were left as a guard on board each of the YYYTV ships which were disposed in the form of a semi circle The remainder of the troops occupied a camp on the sea shore which they fortified according to ancient discipline with a ditch and rampart and the discovery of a source of fresh water while it allayed the thirst excited the superstitious con fidence of the Romans The next morning some of the neighbouring gardens were pillaged and Belisarius after chastising the offenders embraced the slight occasion but the decisive moment of in culcating the maxims of justice moderation and genuine policy When I first accepted the com mission of subduing Africa I depended much less said the general on the numbers or even the bravery of my troops than upon the friendly dis position of the natives and their immortal hatred to the Vandals You alone can deprive me of this hope if you continue to extort by rapine what might be purchased for a little money such acts of violence will reconcile these implacable enemies and unite them in a just and holy league against the invaders of their country These exhortations were enforced by a rigid discipline of which the sol diers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary effects The inhabitants instead of deserting their houses or hiding their corn supplied the Romans with a fair and liberal market the civil officers of the province continued to exercise their functions in the name of Justinian and the clergy assiduously laboured to promote the cause of a Catholic emperor The small town of Sullecte one day s journey from the camp had the honour of being foremost to open her gates and to resume her ancient allegiance the larger cities of Leptis and Adrumetum imitated the example of loyalty as soon as Belisarius appeared and he advanced without opposition as far as Grasse OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 15 a palace of the Vandal kings at the distance of fifty chap miles from Carthage The weary Romans indulged XXXIV themselves in the refreshment of shady groves cool fountains and delicious fruits and the preference which Procopius allows to these gardens over any that he had seen either in the East or West may be ascribed either to the taste or the fatigue of the historian In three generations prosperity and a warm climate had dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals who insensibly became the most luxurious of mankind In their villas and gardens which might deserve the Persian name of paradise they enjoyed a cool and elegant repose and after the daily use of the bath the Barbarians were seated at a table profusely spread with the delicacies of the land and sea Their silken robes loosely flowing after the fashion of the Medes were embroidered with gold love and hunting were the labours of their life and their vacant hours were amused by pantomimes chariot races and the music and dances of the theatre In a march often or twelve days the vigilance of Defeats the Belisarius was constantly awake and active against afi stbattTe his unseen enemies by whom in every place and at every hour he might be suddenly attacked An officer of confidence and merit John the Armenian led the vanguard of three hundred horse six hun dred Massagetae covered at a certain distance the left flank and the whole fleet steering along the coast seldom lost sight of the army which moved each day about twelve miles and lodged in the evening in strong camps or in friendly towns The near approach of the Romans to Carthage filled the mind of Gelimer with anxiety and terror He pru dently wished to protract the war till his brother with his veteran troops should return from the conquest of Sardinia and he now lamented the 16 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap rash policy of his ancestors who by destroying the XXXIV fortifications of Africa had left him only the dan gerous resource of risking a battle in the neigh bourhood of his capital The Vandal conquerors from their original number of fifty thousand were multiplied without including their women and chil dren to one hundred and sixty thousand fighting men and such forces animated with valour and union might have crushed at their first landing the feeble and exhausted bands of the Roman ge neral But the friends of the captive king were more inclined to accept the invitations than to resist the progress of Belisarius and many a proud Bar barian disguised his aversion to war under the more specious name of his hatred to the usurper Yet the authority and promises of Gelimer collected a for midable army and his plans were concerted with some degree of military skill An order was de spatched to his brother Ammatas to collect all the forces of Carthage and to encounter the van of the Roman army at the distance of ten miles from the city his nephew Gibamund with two thousand horse was destined to attack their left when the monarch himself who silently followed should charge their rear in a situation which excluded them from the aid or even the view of their fleet But the rashness of Ammatas was fatal to himself and his country He anticipated the hour of attack out stripped his tardy followers and was pierced with a mortal wound after he had slain with his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists His Vandals fled to Carthage the highway almost ten miles was strewed with dead bodies and it seemed incredible that such multitudes could be slaughtered by the swords of three hundred Romans The nephew of Gelimer was defeated after a slight combat by the six hundred Massagetae they did not equal the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 17 third part of his numbers but each Scythian was chap fired by the example of his chief who gloriously exer cised the privilege of his family by riding foremost and alone to shoot the first arrow against the enemy In the meanwhile Gelimer himself ignorant of the event and misguided by the windings of the hills inadvertently passed the Roman army and reached the scene of action where Ammatas had fallen He wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage charged with irresistible fury the advancing squadrons and might have pursued and perhaps decided the victory if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in the discharge of a vain though pious duty to the dead While his spirit was broken by this mourn ful office he heard the trumpet of Belisarius who leaving Antonina and his infantry in the camp pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder of the cavalry to rally his flying troops and to restore the fortune of the day Much room could not be found in this disorderly battle for the talents of a general but the king fled before the hero and the Vandals accustomed only to a Moorish enemy were incapable of withstanding the arms and discipline of the Romans Gelimer retired with hasty steps to wards the desert of Numidia but he had soon the consolation of learning that his private orders for the execution of Hilderic and his captive friends had been faithfully obeyed The tyrant s revenge was useful only to his enemies The death of a lawful prince excited the compassion of his people his life might have perplexed the victorious Romans and the beutenant of Justinian by a crime of which he was innocent was relieved from the painful alter native of forfeiting his honour or relinquishing his conquests As soon as the tumult had subsided the several

which the tenth mile stone from Carthage had applied the Latin appellation of decimus From a wise suspicion of the stratagems and resources of the Vandals he marched the next day in order of battle halted in the evening before the gates of Carthage and allowed a night pf repose that he might not in darkness and disorder expose the city to the licence of the soldiers or the soldiers themselves to the secret ambush of the city But as the fears of Belisarius were the result of calm and in trepid reason he was soon satisfied that he might confide without danger in the peaceful and friendly aspect of the capital Carthage blazed with innu merable torches the signals of the public joy the chain was removed that guarded the entrance of the port the gates were thrown open and the people with acclamations of gratitude hailed and invited their Roman deliverers The defeat of the Vandals and the freedom of Africa were announced to the city on the eve of St Cyprian when the churches were already adorned and illuminated for the festival of the martyr The Arians conscious that their reign had expired resigned the temple to the Ca tholics who rescued their saint from profane hands performed the holy rites and loudly proclaimed the creed of Athanasius and Justinian One awful hour reversed the fortunes of the contending parties The suppliant Vandals who had so lately indulged the vices of conquerors sought an humble refuge in the sanctuary of the church while the merchants of the East were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the palace by their affrighted keeper who implored the protection of his captives and showed them through an aperture in the wall the sails of the Roman fleet After their separation from the army the naval commanders had proceeded with slow OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 19 caution along the coast till they reached the Her chap msean promontory and obtained the first intelligence XX1V of the victory of Belisarius Faithful to his in structions they would have cast anchor about twenty miles from Carthage if the more skilful seamen had not represented the perils of the shore and the signs of an impending tempest Still ignorant of the revo lution they declined however the rash attempt of forcing the chain of the port and the adjacent harbour and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by the rapine of a private officer who disobeyed and deserted his leaders But the Imperial fleet advancing with a fair wind steered through the narrow entrance of the Goletta and occupied in the deep and capacious lake of Tunis a secure station about five miles from the capital  No sooner was Belisarius informed of their arrival than he de spatched orders that the greatest part of the mariners should be immediately landed to join the triumph and to swell the apparent numbers of the Romans Before he allowed them to enter the gates of Car thage he exhorted them in a discourse worthy of himself and the occasion not to disgrace the glory of their arms and to remember that the Vandals had been the tyrants but that they were the de liverers of the Africans who must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects of their common sovereign The

passions of a victorious army The voice of menace and complaint was silent the trade of Carthage was not inter rupted while Africa changed her master and her government the shops continued open and busy and the soldiers after sufficient guards had been posted modestly departed to the houses which were allotted for their reception Belisarius fixed his re sidence in the palace seated himself on the throne of Genseric accepted and distributed the Barbaric spoil granted their lives to the suppliant Vandals and laboured to repair the damage which the suburb of Mandracium had sustained in the preceding night At supper he entertained his principal officers with the form and magnificence of a royal banquet The victor was respectfully served by the captive officers of the household and in the moments of festivity when the impartial spectators applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius his envious flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture which might alarm the suspicions of a jealous monarch One day was given to these pompous scenes which may not be despised as useless if they attracted the popular veneration but the active mind of Beli sarius which in the pride of victory could suppose a defeat had already resolved that the Roman empire in Africa should not depend on the chance of arms or the favour of the people The fortifications of Carthage had alone been exempted from the general proscription but in the reign of ninety five years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless and indolent Vandals A wiser conqueror restored with incredible despatch the walls and ditches of the city His liberality encouraged the workmen the sol diers the mariners and the citizens vied with each OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 21 other in the salutary labour and

Sardinia served only to aggravate his distress he reflected with the deepest anguish that he had wasted in that useless enterprise five thousand of his bravest troops and he read with grief and shame the victorious letters of his brother Zano who expressed a sanguine con fidence that the king after the example of their an cestors had already chastised the rashness of the Roman invader Alas my brother replied Ge limer Heaven has declared against our unhappy nation While you have subdued Sardinia we have lost Africa No sooner did Belisarius appear with a handful of soldiers than courage and pros perity deserted the cause of the Vandals Your nephew Gibamund your brother Ammatas have been betrayed to death by the cowardice of their followers Our horses our ships Carthage itself and all

AND FALL chap the field of Bulla and the hope of your valour _ Abandon Sardinia fly to our relief restore our empire or perish by our side On the receipt of this epistle Zano imparted his grief to the principal Vandals but the intelligence was prudently con cealed from the natives of the island The troops embarked in one hundred and twenty galleys at the port of Cagliari cast anchor the third day on the confines of Mauritania and hastily pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of Bulla Mournful was the interview the two bro thers embraced they wept in silence no questions were asked of the Sardinian victory no inquiries were made of the African misfortunes they saw before their eyes the whole extent of their cala mities and the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy proof that either death or captivity had been their lot The languid spirit of the Vandals was at length awakened and united by the entreaties of their king the example of Zano and the instant danger which threatened their mon archy and religion The military strength of the nation advanced to battle and such was the rapid increase that before their army reached Tricameron about twenty miles from Carthage they might boast perhaps with some exaggeration that they surpassed in a tenfold proportion the diminutive powers of the Romans But these powers were under the command of Belisarius and as he was conscious of their su perior merit he permitted the Barbarians to surprise him at an unseasonable hour The Romans were instantly under arms a rivulet covered their front the cavalry formed the first line which Belisarius supported in the centre at the head of five hundred guards the infantry at some distance was posted in the second line and the vigilance of the general watched the separate station and ambiguous faith of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 23 the Massagetae who secretly reserved their aid for chap the conquerors The historian has inserted and the reader may easily supply the speeches of the com manders who by arguments the most apposite to their situation inculcated the importance of victory and the contempt of life Zano with the troops which had followed him to the conquest of Sardinia was placed in the centre and the throne of Genseric might have stood if the multitude of Vandals had imitated their intrepid resolution Casting away their lances and missile weapons they drew their swords and expected the charge  the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet they were thrice repulsed and the conflict was firmly maintained till Zano fell and the standard of Belisarius was displayed Ge limer retreated to his camp the Huns joined the pursuit and the victors despoiled the bodies of the slain Yet no more than fifty Romans and eight hundred Vandals were found on the field of battle so inconsiderable was the carnage of a day which extinguished a nation and transferred the empire of Africa In the evening Belisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp and the pusillanimous flight of Gelhner exposed the vanity of his recent declarations that to the vanquished death was a relief life a burthen and infamy the only object of terror His departure was secret but as soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had deserted them they hastily dispersed anxious only for their personal safety and careless of every object that is dear or valuable to mankind The Romans entered the camp without resistance and the wildest scenes of disorder were veiled in the darkness and confusion of the night Every Barbarian who met their swords was inhumanly massacred their widows and daugh ters as rich heirs or beautiful concubines were em braced by the licentious soldiers and avarice itself c4 24 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap was almost satiated with the treasures of gold and XXXIV 1 silver the accumulated fruits of conquest or economy in a long period of prosperity and peace In this frantic search the troops even of Belisarius forgot their caution and respect Intoxicated with lust and rapine they explored in small parties or alone the adjacent fields the woods the rocks and the caverns that might possibly conceal any desirable prize laden with booty they deserted their ranks and wandered without a guide on the high road to Carthage  and if the flying enemies had dared to return very few of the conquerors would have escaped Deeply sen sible of the disgrace and danger Belisarius passed an apprehensive night on the field of victory at the dawn of day he planted his standard on a hill re called his guards and veterans and gradually re stored the modesty and obedience of the camp It was equally the concern of the Roman general to subdue the hostile and to save the prostrate Bar barian and the suppliant Vandals who could be found only in churches were protected by his au thority disarmed and separately confined that they might neither disturb the public peace nor become the victims of popular revenge After despatching a light detachment to tread the footsteps of Gelimer he advanced with his whole army about ten days march as far as Hippo Regius which no longer possessed the relics of St Augustin The season and the certain intelligence that the Vandal had fled to the inaccessible country of the Moors determined Belisarius to relinquish the vain pursuit and to fix his winter quarters at Carthage From thence he despatched his principal lieutenant to inform the emperor that in the space of three months he had achieved the conquest of Africa Conquest of Belisarius spoke the language of

absent but the comparative smallness of their number which in ancient councils had been twice or even thrice multiplied most clearly indicates the decay both of the church and state While Jus tinian approved himself the defender of the faith he entertained an ambitious hope that his victorious lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of the Moors and Vandals and Belisarius was instructed to establish five dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli Leptis Cirta Caesarea and Sardinia and to compute the military force of palatines or borderers that might be sufficient for the defence of Africa The kingdom of the Vandals was not unworthy of the presence of a praetorian prefect and four consulars three pre sidents were appointed to administer the seven pro vinces under his civil jurisdiction The number of their subordinate officers clerks messengers or as sistants was minutely expressed  three hundred and ninety six for the prefect himself fifty for each of his vicegerents and the rigid definition of their fees and salaries was more effectual to confirm the right than to prevent the abuse These magistrates might be oppressive but they were not idle and the subtle questions of justice and revenue were infinitely pro pagated under the new government which professed to revive the freedom and equity of the Roman re public The conqueror was solicitous to exact a prompt and plentiful supply from his African sub jects and he allowed them to claim even in the third degree and from the collateral line the houses and lands of which their families had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals After the departure of Belisarius who acted by a high and special com mission no ordinary

of Africa was imperfect till her Distress and former sovereign was delivered either alive or dead Gdimw into the hands of the Romans Doubtful of the 4â event Gelimer had given secret orders that a part of his treasure should be transported to Spain where he hoped to find a secure refuge at the court of the king of the Visigoths But these intentions were disappointed by accident treachery and the inde fatigable pursuit of his enemies who intercepted his flight from the sea shore and chased the unfortunate monarch with some faithful followers to the inac cessible mountain of Papua in the inland country of Numidia He was immediately besieged by Pharas an officer whose truth and sobriety were the more applauded as such qualities could seldom be found among the Heruli the most corrupt of the Barbarian tribes To his vigilance Belisarius had intrusted this important charge and after a bold attempt to scale the mountain in which he lost a hundred and ten soldiers Pharas expected during a winter siege the operation of distress and famine on the mind of the Vandal king From the softest habits of plea sure from the unbounded command of industry and wealth he was reduced to share the poverty of the Moors supportable only to themselves by their ig norance of a happier condition In their rude hovels of mud and hurdles which confined the smoke and excluded the light they

chap unknown and their oaten or barley cakes imper _ fectly baked in the ashes were devoured almost in a crude state by the hungry savages The health of Gelimer must have sunk under these strange and unwonted hardships from whatsoever cause they had been endured but his actual misery was embittered by the recollection of past greatness the daily inso lence of his protectors and the just apprehension that the light and venal Moors might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality The knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly epistle of Pharas Like yourself said the chief of the Heruli I am an illiterate Barbarian but I speak the language of plain sense and an honest heart Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy Why will you ruin yourself your family and

It was long since the king of Africa had tasted bread a defluxion had fallen on his eyes the effect of fatigue or incessant weeping and he wished to solace the melancholy hours by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own mis fortunes The humanity of Pharas was moved he sent the three extraordinary gifts but even his hu manity prompted him to redouble the vigilance of his guard that he might sooner compel his prisoner to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans but salutary to himself The obstinacy of Gelimer at length yielded to reason and necessity the solemn assurances of safety and honourable treatment were ratified in the emperor s name by the ambassador of Belisarius and the king of the Vandals descended from the mountain The first public interview was in one of the suburbs of Carthage and when the royal captive accosted his conqueror he burst into a fit of laughter The crowd might naturally believe that extreme grief had deprived Gelimer of his senses but in this mournful state unseasonable mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers that the vain and transitory scenes of human greatness are unworthy of a serious thought 30 THE DECLINE AND FAIX chap

province or of returning to the capital was indeed submitted to the discretion of Belisarius but he wisely con cluded from intercepted letters and the knowledge of his sovereign s temper that he must either resign his head erect his standard or confound his enemies by his presence and submission Innocence and courage decided his choice his guards captives and treasures were diligently embarked and so prosperous was the navigation that his arrival at Constantinople preceded any certain account of his departure from the port of Carthage Such unsus pecting loyalty removed the apprehensions of Jus

Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by four horses or elephants the modest conqueror marched on foot at the head of his brave companions his prudence might decline an honour too conspicuous for a subject and his magnanimity might justly disdain what had been so often sullied by the vilest of tyrants The glorious procession entered the gate of the hippodrome was saluted by the acclamations of the senate and people and halted before the throne where Justinian and Theodora were seated to receive the homage of the captive monarch and the victorious hero They both performed the customary adoration and falling prostrate on the ground respectfully touched the footstool of a prince who had not unsheathed his sword and of a prostitute who had danced on the theatre some gentle violence was used to bend the stubborn spirit of the grandson of Genseric and however trained to servitude the genius of Belisarius must have secretly rebelled He was immediately His sole declared consul for the

received from the em peror an ample estate in the province of Galatia where the abdicated monarch retired with his family and friends to a life of peace of affluence and per haps of content The daughters of Hilderic were entertained with the respectful tenderness due to their age and misfortune and Justinian and Theo dora accepted the honour of educating and enriching the female descendants of the great Theodosius The bravest of the Vandal youth were distributed into five squadrons of cavalry which adopted the name of their benefactor and supported in the Per sian wars the glory of their ancestors But these rare exceptions the reward of birth or valour are insufficient to explain the fate of a nation whose numbers before a short and bloodless war amounted to more than six hundred thousand persons After the exile of their king and nobles the servile crowd might purchase their safety by abjuring their cha racter religion and language and their degenerate posterity would be

Belisarius In the first invasion some detachments with two officers of merit were surprised and in tercepted but Solomon speedily assembled his troops marched from Carthage into the heart of the

national council was immediately held and the new monarch reconciled the impatient spirit of the Barbarians to a measure of disgrace which the misconduct of his predecessor rendered wise and

adjacent country as far as Narni Perusia and Spoleto but they trembled the senate the clergy and the unwarlike people as soon as they understood that he had re solved and would speedily be reduced to sustain a siege against the powers of the Gothic monarchy The designs of Vitiges were executed during the winter season with diligence and effect From their rustic habitations from their distant garrisons the Goths assembled at Ravenna for the defence of their country and such were their numbers that after an army had been detached for the relief of Dalmatia one hundred and fifty thousand fighting men marched under the royal standard According to the degrees of rank or merit the Gothic king distributed arms and horses rich gifts and liberal promises he moved along the Flaminian way declined the useless sieges of Perusia and Spoleto respected the impregnable rock of Narni and arrived within two miles of Rome at the foot of the Milvian bridge The narrow pass age was fortified with a tower and Belisarius had computed the value of the twenty days which must be lost in the construction of another bridge But the consternation of the soldiers of the tower who either fled or deserted disappointed his hopes and betrayed his person into the most imminent danger At the head of one thousand horse the Roman general sallied from the Flaminian gate to mark the ground of an advantageous

slain His countenance was indeed disfigured by sweat dust and blood his voice was hoarse his strength was almost exhausted but his unconquerable spirit still remained he imparted that spirit to his de

circumference of Rome within a line of twelve miles and three hundred and forty five paces and that circumference except in the Vatican has invariably been the same from the triumph of Aurelian to the peaceful but obscure reign of the modern popes But in the day of her greatness the space within her walls was crowded with habita tions and inhabitants and the populous suburbs that stretched along the public roads were darted like so many rays from one common centre Adversity swept away these extraneous ornaments and left naked and desolate a considerable part even of the seven hills Yet Rome in its present state could send into the field above thirty thousand males of a military age and notwithstanding the want of discipline and exercise the far greater part inured to the hardships of poverty might be capable of bearing arms for the defence of their country and religion The prudence of Belisarius did not neglect this important resource His soldiers were relieved by the zeal and

largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of four battering rams their heads were armed with iron they were suspended by ropes and each of them was worked by the labour of fifty men The lofty wooden turrets moved on wheels or rollers and formed a spacious platform of the level of the rampart On the morning of the nineteenth day a general attack was made from the Praenestine gate to the Vatican seven Gothic columns with their military engines advanced to the assault and the Romans who lined the ramparts listened with doubt and anxiety to the cheerful assurances of their commander As soon as the enemy approached the ditch Belisarius himself drew the first arrow and such was his strength and dexterity that he transfixed the foremost of the Bar barian leaders A shout of applause and victory was re echoed along the wall He drew a second arrow and the stroke was followed with the same success and the same acclamation The Roman general then gave the word that the archers should aim at the teams of oxen they were instantly covered with mortal wounds the towers which they drew re mained useless and immoveable and a single moment disconcerted the laborious projects of the king of the Goths After this disappointment Vitiges still con tinued or feigned to continue the assault of the Sa larian gate that he might divert the attention of his adversary while his principal forces more strenuously attacked the Pramestine gate and the sepulchre of OF THE KOMAN EMPIRE 59 Hadrian at the distance of three miles from each chap other Near the former the double walls of the Vi 1 varium were low or broken the fortifications of the latter were feebly guarded the vigour of the Goths was excited by the hope of victory and spoil and if a single post had given way the Romans and Rome itself were irrecoverably lost This perilous day was the most glorious in the life of Belisarius Amidst tumult and dismay the whole plan of the attack and defence was distinctly present to his mind he ob served the changes of each instant weighed every possible advantage transported his person to the scenes of danger and communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders The contest was fiercely main tained from the morning to the evening the Goths were repulsed on all sides and each Roman might boast that he had vanquished thirty Barbarians if the strange disproportion of numbers were not counter balanced by the merit of one man Thirty thou sand Goths according to the confession of their own chiefs perished in this bloody action and the mul titude of the wounded was equal to that of the slain When they advanced to the assault their close dis order suffered not a javelin to fall without effect and as they retired the populace of the city joined the pursuit and slaughtered with impunity the backs of their flying enemies Belisarius instantly sallied His sallies from the gates and while the soldiers chanted his name and victory the hostile engines of war were re duced to ashes Such was the loss and consternation of the Goths that from this day the siege of Rome degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade and they were incessantly harassed by the Roman general who in frequent skirmishes destroyed above five thousand of their bravest troops Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the bow their archers served on foot and this divided force was incapable r 60 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap of contending with their adversaries whose lances XXXIV and arrows at a distance or at hand were alike for midable The consummate skill of Belisarius em braced the favourable opportunities and as he chose the ground and the moment as he pressed the charge or sounded the retreat the squadrons which he de tached were seldom unsuccessful These partial ad vantages diffused an impatient ardour among the soldiers and people who began to feel the hardships of a siege and to disregard the dangers of a general engagement Each plebeian conceived himself to be a hero and the infantry who since the decay of dis cipline were rejected from the line of battle aspired to the ancient honours of the Roman legion Beli sarius praised the spirit of his troops condemned their presumption yielded to their clamours and prepared the remedies of a defeat the possibility of which he alone had courage to suspect In the quarter of the Vatican the Romans prevailed and if the irreparable moments had not been wasted in the pillage of the camp they might have occupied the Milvian bridge and charged in the rear of the Gothic host On the other side of the Tyber Beli sarius advanced from the Pincian and Salarian gates But his army four thousand soldiers perhaps was lost in a spacious plain they were encompassed and oppressed by fresh multitudes who continually re lieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians The valiant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to con quer they died the retreat a hasty retreat was covered by the prudence of the general and the victors started back with affright from the formidable aspect of an armed rampart The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied by a defeat and the vain confidence of the Goths was not less serviceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the Roman troops OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Gl From the moment that Belisarius had determined chap to sustain a siege his assiduous care provided Rome XXXIv against the danger of famine more dreadful than the Distress of Gothic arms An extraordinary supply of corn was  e aty imported from Sicily the harvests of Campania and Tuscany were forcibly swept for the use of the city and the rights of private property were infringed by the strong plea of the public safety It might easily be foreseen that the enemy would intercept the aque ducts and the cessation of the water mills was the first inconvenience which was speedily removed by mooring large vessels and fixing mill stones in the current of the river The stream was soon em barrassed by the trunks of trees and polluted with dead bodies yet so effectual were the precautions of the Roman general that the waters of the Tyber still continued to give motion to the mills and drink to the inhabitants the more distant quarters were sup plied from domestic wells and a besieged city might support without impatience the privation of her public baths A large portion of Rome from the Praenestine gate to the church of St Paul was never invested by the Goths their excursions were re strained by the activity of the Moorish troops the navigation of the Tyber and the Latin Appian and Ostian ways were left free and unmolested for the introduction of corn and cattle or the retreat of the inhabitants who sought a refuge in Campania or Sicily Anxious to relieve himself from an useless and devouring multitude Belisarius issued his pe remptory orders for the instant departure of the wo men the children and slaves required his soldiers to dismiss their male and female attendants and re gulated

supplies as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward of valour and the purchase of wealth the forage of the horses and the bread of the soldiers never failed but in the last months of the siege the people were exposed to the miseries of scarcity unwholesome food and con tagious disorders Belisarius saw and pitied their sufferings but he had foreseen and he watched the decay of their loyalty and the progress of their dis content Adversity had awakened the Romans from the dreams of grandeur and freedom and taught them the humiliating lesson that it was of small mo ment to their real happiness whether the name of their master was derived from the Gothic or the Latin language The lieutenant of Justinian listened to their just complaints but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight or capitulation repressed their clamorous impatience for battle amused them with the prospect of sure and speedy relief and secured himself and the city from the effects of their

yours to reflect whether my death in this situation will contribute to the glory and prosperity of your reign Perhaps that reign would have been equally prosperous if the peaceful master of the East had abstained from the conquest of Africa and Italy but as Justinian was ambitious of fame he made some efforts they were feeble and languid to support and rescue his victorious general A reinforcement of sixteen hundred Sclavonians and Huns was led by Martin and Valerian and as they had reposed during the winter season in the harbours of Greece the strength of the men and horses was not impaired by the fatigues of a sea voyage and they distinguished their valour in the first sally against the besiegers About the time of the summer solstice Euthalius landed at Terracina with large syms of money for the payment of the troops he cautiously proceeded along the Appian way and this convoy entered Rome through the gate Capena while Belisarius on the other side diverted the attention

apprehensive of disturbing by any rash hostili ties the negotiation to which Belisarius had craftily listened They credulously believed that they saw no more than the vanguard of a fleet and army which already covered the Ionian sea and the plains of Campania and the illusion was supported by the haughty language of the Roman general when he gave audience to the ambassadors of Vitiges After a specious discourse to vindicate the justice of his cause they declared that for the sake of peace they were disposed to renounce the possession of Sicily The emperor is not less generous replied his lieutenant with a disdainful smile  in return for a gift which you no longer possess he presents you with an ancient province of the empire he resigns to the Goths the sovereignty of the British island Belisarius rejected with equal firmness and contempt the offer of a tribute but he allowed the Gothic am bassadors to seek their fate from the mouth of Jus tinian himself and consented with

Arian tyrant At the same time John the Sanguinary the nephew of Vitalian was detached with two thousand chosen horse first to Alba on the Fucine lake and afterwards to the frontiers of Pi cenum on the

which he was most solicitous to preserve and detached his nephew Uraias with an adequate force for the chas tisement of rebellious Milan At the head of his principal army he besieged Rimini only thirty three miles distant from the Gothic capital A feeble rampart and a shallow ditch were maintained by the skill and valour of John the Sanguinary who shared the danger and fatigue of the meanest

Narses the eunuch was suddenly exalted to the head of an army and the spirit of a hero who afterwards equalled the merit and glory of Belisarius served only to perplex the operations of the Gothic war To his prudent counsels the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the leaders of the discontented faction who exhorted Narses to assume an independent and separate com mand The epistle of Justinian had indeed enjoined his obedience to the general but the dangerous ex ception as far as may be advantageous to the pub _ lie service reserved some freedom of judgment to the discreet favourite who had so lately departed from the sacred and familiar conversation of his sove reign In the exercise of this doubtful right the eunuch perpetually dissented from the opinions of Belisarius and after yielding with reluctance to the siege of Urbino he deserted his colleague in the night and marched away to the conquest of the iEmelian province The fierce and formidable bands of the Heruli were attached to the person of Narses ten thousand Romans and confederates were per suaded to march under his banners every malecon tent embraced the fair opportunity of revenging his private or imaginary wrongs and the remaining troops of Belisarius were divided and dispersed from the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the Hadriatic OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 71 His skill and perseverance overcame every obstacle chap

All dissensions e lsanus were healed and all opposition was subdued by the temperate authority of the Roman general to whom his enemies could not refuse their esteem and Beli sarius inculcated the salutary lesson that the forces of the state should compose one body and be ani mated by one soul But in the interval of discord the Goths were permitted to breathe an important season was lost Milan was destroyed and the northern provinces of Italy were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks When Justinian first meditated the conquest of invasion of Italy he sent ambassadors to the kings of the Franks Franks and adjured them by the common ties of alliance and 539 5 8 religion to join in the holy enterprise against the Arians The Goths as their wants were more urgent employed a more effectual mode of persuasion and vainly strove by the gift of lands and money to pur chase the friendship or at least the neutrality of a light and perfidious nation But the arms of Belisarius and the revolt of the Italians had no sooner shaken the1 Gothic monarchy than Theodebert of Austrasia the most powerful and warlike of the Merovingian kings was persuaded to succour their distress by an indirect and seasonable aid Without expecting the consent of their sovereign ten thousand Burgundians his recent subjects descended from the Alps and joined the troops which Vitiges had sent to chastise the revolt

its inhabitants and Belisarius sympathized alone in the fate of his deserted and devoted friends En couraged by this successful inroad Theodebert him self in the ensuing spring invaded the plains of Italy with an army of one hundred thousand Barbarians The king and some chosen followers were mounted on horseback and armed with lances the infantry without bows or spears were satisfied with a shield a sword and a double edged battle axe which in their hands became a deadly and unerring weapon Italy trembled at the march of the Franks and both the Gothic prince and the Roman general alike ig norant of their designs solicited with hope and ter ror the friendship of these dangerous allies Till he had secured the passage of the Po on the bridge of Pavia the grandson of Clovis dissembled his inten tions which he at length declared by assaulting al most at the same instant the hostile camps of the Romans and Goths Instead of uniting their arms they fled with equal precipitation and the fertile though desolate provinces of Liguria and iEmilia were abandoned to a licentious host of Barbarians whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of settlement or conquest Among the cities which they ruined Genoa not yet constructed of marble is particularly enumerated and the deaths of thou sands according to the regular practice of war appear to have excited less horror than sacrifices of women and children which were performed with impunity in the camp If it were not a melancholy truth that the first and most cruel sufferings must be the lot of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 73 the innocent and helpless history might exult in the chap misery of the conquerors who in the midst of riches XXXIV were left destitute of bread or wine reduced to drink the waters of the Po and to feed on the flesh of dis tempered cattle The dysentery swept away ofce third of their army and the clamours of his sub jects who were impatient to pass the Alps disposed Theodebert to listen with respect to the mild ex hortations of Belisarius The memory of this inglo rious and destructive warfare was perpetuated on the medals of Gaul and Justinian without unsheathing his sword assumed the title of conqueror of the Franks The Merovingian prince was offended by the vanity of the emperor he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the Goths and his insidious offer of a federal union was fortified by the promise or menace of descending from the Alps at the head of five hundred thousand men His plans of conquest were boundless and perhaps chimerical The king of Austrasia threatened to chastise Justinian and to march to the gates of Constantinople he was over thrown and slain by a wild bull as he hunted in the Belgic or German forests As soon as Belisarius was delivered from his foreign Belisarius and domestic enemies he seriously applied his forces RwfnL to the final reduction of Italy In the siege of Osimo the general was nearly transpierced with an arrow if the mortal stroke had not been intercepted by one of his guards who lost in that pious office the use of his hand The Goths of Osimo four thousand war riors with those of Faesulae and the Cottian Alps were among the last who maintained their independ ence and their gallant resistance which almost tired the patience deserved the esteem of the conqueror His prudence refused to subscribe the safe conduct which they asked to

their estates or inlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian wars The mul titudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges far surpassed the number of the Roman troops but neither prayers nor defiance nor the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects could tempt the Gothic king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna These fortifications were indeed impregnable to the assaults of art or violence and when Belisarius invested the capital he was soon convinced that famine only could tame the stubborn spirit of the Barbarians The sea the land and the channels of the Po were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman general and his mo rality extended the rights of war to the practice of poisoning the waters and secretly firing the granaries of a besieged city While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna he was surprised by the arrival of two am bassadors from Constantinople with a treaty of peace which Justinian had imprudently signed without deigning to consult the author of his victory By this disgraceful and precarious agreement Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided and the provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the successor of Theodoric The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their salutary commission the captive Vitiges accepted with transport the unexpected offer of a crown honour was less prevalent among the Goths than the want and appetite of food and the Roman chiefs who murmured at the continuance of the war professed implicit submission to the com mands of the emperor If Belisarius had possessed only the courage of a soldier the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and envious counsels but in this decisive moment he resolved with the magnanimity of a statesman to sustain alone the danger and merit of generous disobedience Each OF THE EOMAN EMPIRE 75 of his officers gave a written opinion that the siege chap of Ravenna was impracticable and hopeless the ge xxx neral then rejected the treaty of partition and de clared his own resolution of leading Vitiges in chains to the feet of Justinian The Goths retired with doubt and dismay this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature which they could trust and filled their minds with a just apprehension that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their deplorable state They compared the fame and fortune of Belisarius with the weakness of their ill fated king and the comparison suggested an extra ordinary project to which Vitiges with apparent resignation was compelled to acquiesce Partition would ruin the strength exile would disgrace the honour of the nation but they offered their arms their treasures and the fortifications of Ravenna if Belisarius would disclaim the authority of a master accept the choice of the Goths and assume as he had deserved the kingdom of Italy If the false lustre of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject his prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the Barbarians and his rational ambition would prefer the safe and honourable sta tion of a Roman general Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he entertained a pro posal of treason might be susceptible of a malignant interpretation But the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own rectitude he entered into a dark and crooked path as it might lead to the vo luntary submission of the Goths and his dexterous policy persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes without engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he secretly abhorred The

which had not been subdued or even visited by the Romans and the independent Goths who remained in arms at Pavia and Verona were am bitious only to become the subjects of Belisarius But his inflexible

Belisarius understood the suspicion ac cepted the excuse embarked at Ravenna his spoils and trophies and proved by his ready obedience that such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less unjust than it might have been indiscreet The emperor received with honourable courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort and as the king of the Goths conformed to the Athanasian faith he obtained with a rich inheritance of lands in Asia the rank of senator and patrician Every spectator admired without peril the strength and stature of the young Barbarians they adored the majesty of

admitted to gaze on the magnificent spectacle but it was enviously secluded from the public view and the conqueror of Italy renounced without a murmur perhaps without a sigh the well earned honours of a second triumph His glory was indeed exalted above all external pomp and the faint and hollow praises of the court were supplied even in a servile age by the respect and admiration of his country Whenever he appeared in the streets and public places of Constantinople Belisarius attracted and satisfied the eyes of the people His lofty stature and majestic countenance fulfilled their expectations of a hero â the meanest of his fellow citizens were emboldened by his gentle and gracious demeanour and the martial train which attended his footsteps left his person more accessible than

of liberality and justice he acquired the love of the soldiers without alienating the affections of the people The sick and wounded were relieved with medicines and money and still more efficaciously by the heal ing visits and smiles of their commander The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly repaired and each deed of valour was rewarded by the rich and honourable gifts of a bracelet or a collar which were rendered more precious by the judgment of Belisarius He was endeared to the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they enjoyed under the shadow of his standard Instead of being injured the country was enriched by the march of the Roman armies and such was the rigid discipline of their camp that not an apple was gathered from the tree not a path could be traced in the fields of corn Belisarius was chaste and sober In the licence of a military life none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with wine the most beautiful captives of Gothic or Vandal race were offered to his embraces but he turned aside from their charms and the husband of Antonina was never suspected of violating the laws of conjugal fidelity The spectator and historian of his exploits has

precious effects from the knowledge of Justinian And the pious husband consented to disbelieve the evidence of his own senses From this pleasing and perhaps voluntary delusion Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse by the officious information of Macedonia and that female attend ant after requiring an oath for her security produced two chamberlains who like herself had often beheld the adulteries of Antonina A hasty flight into Asia saved Theodosius from the justice of an injured hus band who had signified to one of his guards the order of his death but the tears of Antonina and her artful

but the disgrace of Belisa rius was alleviated by the dignity of his own cha racter and the influence of his wife who might wish to humble but could not desire to ruin the partner of her fortunes Even

While the lieutenant of Jus tinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals the emperor timid though ambitious ba lanced the forces of the Barbarians fomented their divisions by flattery and

your wishes are satisfied Belisarius is in the midst of Italy But if you desire to conquer far other preparations are requisite without a military force the title of general is an empty name It would

that you can procure the indispensable aid of a powerful body of the cavalry of the Huns An officer in whom Belisarius confided was sent from Ravenna to hasten and conduct the succours but the message

Gothic extraction who filled with a garrison of three thousand soldiers the spacious circle of her venerable walls From the distress of the people he extracted a profitable trade and secretly rejoiced in the continuance of the siege It was for his use that the granaries had been replenished the charity of Pope Vigilius had purchased and embarked an ample supply of Sicilian corn but the vessels which escaped the Barbarians were seized by a rapacious governor who imparted a scanty sustenance to the soldiers and sold the remainder to the wealthy Ro mans The medimnus or fifth part of the quarter of wheat was exchanged for seven pieces of gold fifty pieces were given for an ox a rare and accidental prize the progress of famine enhanced this ex orbitant value and the mercenaries were

despair to one of the bridges of the Tyber and covering his face threw himself headlong into the stream in the pre sence of his family and the Roman people To the rich and pusillanimous Bessas sold the permission of departure but the greatest part of the fugitives ex pired on the public highways or were intercepted by the flying parties of Barbarians In the meanwhile the artful governor soothed the discontent and re vived the hopes of the Romans by the vague re ports of the fleets and armies which were hastening to their relief from the extremities of the East They derived more rational

the form of a bridge on which he erected two lofty towers manned by the bravest of his Goths and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines of offence The approach of the bridge and towers was covered by a strong and massy chain of iron and the chain at either end on the opposite sides of the Tyber was defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of 156 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap archers But the enterprise of forcing these bai riers XXXVI and relieving the capital displays a shining example of the boldness and conduct of Belisarius His ca valry advanced from the port along the public road to awe the motions and distract the attention of the enemy His infantry and provisions were distributed in two hundred large boats and each boat was shielded by a high rampart of thick planks pierced with many small holes for the discharge of missile weapons In the front two large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating castle which commanded the towers of the bridge and contained a magazine of fire sulphur and bitumen The whole fleet which the general led in person was laboriously moved against the current of the river The chain yielded to their weight and the enemies who guarded the banks were either slain or scattered As soon as they touched the principal barrier the fire ship was instantly grappled to the bridge one of the towers with two hundred Goths was consumed by the flames the assailants shouted victory and Rome was saved if the wisdom of Belisarius had not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers He had previously sent orders to Bessas to second his opera tions by a timely sally from the town and he had fixed his lieutenant Isaac by a peremptory command to the station of the port But avarice rendered Bessas immoveable while the youthful ardour of Isaac delivered him into the hands of a superior enemy The exaggerated rumour of his defeat was hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius he paused betrayed in that single moment of his life some emo tions of surprise and perplexity and reluctantly sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina his treasures and the only harbour which he possessed on the Tuscan coast The vexation of his mind

horses Decius Basilius c accom panied the governor their brethren among whom Olybrius Orestes and Maximus are named by the historian took refuge in the church of St Peter but the assertion that only

for the be nefit of the conqueror In this revolution the sons and daughters of Roman consuls tasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved wandered in tattered garments through the streets of

Gothic sovereign Against the city which had so long delayed the course of his victories he appeared inexorable one third of the walls in different parts were demolished by his command fire and engines prepared to consume or subvert the most stately works of antiquity and the world was astonished by the fatal decree that Rome should be changed into a pasture for cattle The firm and temperate remonstrance of Belisarius suspended the execution he warned the Barbarian not to sully his fame by the destruction of those monuments which were the glory of the dead and the delight of the living and Totila was persuaded by the advice of an enemy to preserve Rome as the ornament of his kingdom or the fairest pledge of peace and recon ciliation When he had signified to the ambassadors of Belisarius his intention of sparing the city he stationed an army at the distance of one hundred and twenty furlongs to observe the motions of the Roman general With the remainder of his forces he

they lost the flower of their troops the royal standard had almost fallen into the hands of the enemy and the fame of Totila sunk as it had risen with the fortune of his arms What ever skill and

In this ignoble warfare the hero invincible against the power of the Bar barians was basely vanquished by the delay the dis obedience and the cowardice of his own officers He reposed in his winter

mankind A feeble di minutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior His youth had been employed in the management of the loom and distaff in the cares of the household and the service of female luxury but while his hands were busy he secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous and discerning mind A stranger to the schools and the camp he studied in the palace to dissemble to

Twelve years after his return the eunuch was chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the first of the Roman generals Instead of being dazzled by vanity or emulation he seriously declared that unless he were armed with an adequate force he would never con sent to risk his own glory and that of his sovereign Justinian granted to the favourite what he might have denied

Narses was awakened he summoned the offender to his presence and without listening to his excuses gave the signal to the minister of death If the cruel master had not infringed the laws of his nation this arbitrary execution was not less unjust than it appears to have been imprudent The Heruli felt the indignity they halted but the Roman ge neral without soothing their rage or expecting their

resounded with the noise of drinking and dancing the spoils of victory were wasted in sensual pleasures and nothing says Agathias remained unless to ex change their shields and helmets for the soft

they were assaulted on the flanks by two ambuscades which rose from the woods their fore most warriors fell by the hand of the aged hero and his guards and the swiftness of their evolutions was

dismissed him to mingle with the train of slaves Yet so deep was the impression of his glory on the minds of men that Justinian in the seventy seventh year of his age was encouraged to advance near

the neighbourhood of Pelusium between the Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile From thence tracing as it were a double path it spread to the East over Syria Persia and the Indies and penetrated to the West along the coast of Africa and over the continent of Europe In the spring of the second year Constantinople during three or four months was visited by the pestilence and Procopius who observed its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a physician has emu lated the skill and diligence of Thucydides in the description of the plague of Athens The infection was sometimes announced by the visions of a dis tempered fancy and the victim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible spectre But the greater number in their beds in the streets in their usual occupation were surprised by a slight fever so slight indeed that neither the pulse nor the colour of the patient gave any signs of the approaching danger The same the next or

deprived of the use of their speech without being secure from a return of the disorder The physicians of Constantinople were zealous and skil ful but their art was baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the disease the same remedies were productive of contrary effects and the event capriciously disappointed their prognostics of death or recovery The order of funerals and the right of sepulchres were confounded those who were left without friends or servants lay unburied in the streets or in their desolate houses and a magistrate was authorized to collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies to transport them by land or water and to inter them in deep pits beyond the pre cincts of the city Their own danger and the pro spect of public distress awakened some remorse in the minds of the most vicious of mankind the con fidence of health again revived their passions and habits but philosophy must disdain the observation of Procopius that the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or providence He forgot or perhaps he secretly recollected that the plague had touched the person of Justinian himself but the abstemious diet of the emperor

been denied by a people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors Yet the fellow citizens of Procopius were satisfied by some short and partial experience that the infection could not be gained by the closest conversation and this persuasion might support the assiduity of friends or physicians in the care of the sick whom inhuman prudence would have condemned to solitude and despair But the fatal security like the predestina tion of the Turks must have aided the progress of the contagion and those salutary precautions to which Europe is indebted for her safety were unknown to the government of Justinian No restraints were imposed on the free and frequent intercourse of the Roman provinces from Persia to France the na tions were mingled and infected by wars and emi grations and the pestilential odour which lurks for years in a bale of cotton was imported by the abuse of trade into the most distant regions The mode of its propagation is explained by the remark of Pro copius himself that it always spread from the sea coast to the inland country the most sequestered islands and mountains were successively visited the places which had escaped the fury of its first passage were alone exposed to the contagion of the ensuing year The winds might diffuse that subtle venom but unless the atmosphere be previously disposed for its reception the plague would soon expire in the

are ascribed to the untu tored wisdom of Romulus The law of nations and of religious worship which Numa introduced was derived from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria The civil law is attributed to the experience of Servius he balanced the rights and fortunes of the seven classes of citizens and guarded by fifty new regulations the observance of contracts and the punishment of crimes The state which he had inclined towards a democracy was changed by the last Tarquin into lawless despotism and when the kingly office was abolished the patricians engrossed the benefits of freedom The royal laws became odious or obsolete the mysterious deposit was si lently preserved by the priests and nobles and at the end of sixty years the citizens of Rome still complained that they were ruled by the arbitrary sentence of the magistrates Yet the positive in stitutions of the kings had blended themselves with the public and private manners of the city some fragments of that

since they were capable of studying and embracing the institutions of their more enlightened neighbours A wise Ephesian was driven by envy from his native country before he could reach the shores of Latium he had observed the various forms of human nature and civil society he imparted his knowledge to the legislators of Rome and a statue was erected in the forum to the perpetual memory of

Dionysius are willing to believe that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the wise and splendid administration of Pericles and the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve tables If such an embassy had indeed been received from the Barbarians of Hesperia the Roman name would have been familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander and the faintest evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the curiosity of suc ceeding times But the Athenian monuments are silent nor will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of a democracy In the com parison of the tables of Solon with those of the De cemvirs some casual resemblance may be found some rules which nature and reason have revealed to every

although these venerable monuments were considered as the rule of right and the fountain of justice they were overwhelmed by the weight and variety of new laws which at the end of five centuries became a grievance more intolerable than the vices of the city Three thousand brass plates the acts of the senate and people were deposited in the Capitol and some of the acts as the Julian law

Servius But the tri bunes soon established a more specious and popular maxim that every citizen has an equal right to enact the laws which he is bound to obey Instead of the centuries they convened the tribes and the patri cians after an impotent struggle submitted to the decrees of an assembly in which their votes were confounded with those of the meanest plebeians Yet as long as the tribes

successive praetors sub tleties and fictions were invented to defeat the plainest meaning of the Decemvirs and where the end was salutary the means were frequently absurd The secret or probable wish

Tertullian the gloomy and intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and constitutions During four centuries from Ha drian to Justinian the public and private juris

chap of almost one thousand years from the twelve tables XXXVIL to the reign of Justinian may be divided into three periods almost equal in duration and distinguished from each other by the mode of instruction and the character of the civilians Pride and ignorance contributed during the first period to confine within The fast narrow limits the science of the Roman law On the ATufc public days of market or assembly the masters of the 303â 648 art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the needful advice to the meanest of their fellow citizens from whose votes on a future occasion they might solicit a grateful return As their years and honours increased they seated themselves at home on a chair or throne to expect with patient gravity the visits of their clients who at the dawn of day from the town and country began to thunder at their door The duties of social life and the incidents of judicial proceeding were the ordinary subject of these con sultations and the verbal or written opinion of the jurisconsults was framed according to the rules of prudence and law The youths of their own order and family were permitted to listen their children enjoyed the benefit of more private lessons and the Mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary knowledge of the civil law The second period the Second learned and splendid age of jurisprudence may be aTu c extended from

of their productions have been minutely preserved and the example of Labeo may suggest some idea of their diligence and fecundity That eminent lawyer of the Augustan age divided the year between the city and country between business and composition and four hundred books are enumerated as the fruit of his retirement Of the collections of his rival Capito the two hundred and fifty ninth book is expressly quoted and few teachers could deliver their opinions in less than a Third pe century of volumes In the third period between aTu c tne reigns of Alexander and Justinian the oracles of 888â 1230 jurisprudence were almost mute The measure of curiosity had been filled the throne was occupied by tyrants and Barbarians the active spirits were diverted by religious disputes and the professors of Rome Constantinople and Berytus were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened predecessors From the slow advances and rapid de cay of these legal studies it may be inferred that they require a state of peace and refinement From the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the inter OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 215 mediate space it is evident that such studies may be chap pursued aud such works may be performed with a common share of judgment experience and industry The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more sensibly felt as each revolving age had been found incapable of producing a similar or a second but the most eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in merit and reputation The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted T pW to the wants of the first Komans was polished and improved in the seventh century of the city by the alliance of Grecian philosophy The Scaevolas had been taught by use and experience but Servius Sul picius was the first civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory For the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied as an infallible rule the logic of Aristotle and the stoics reduced particular cases to general principles and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of order and elo quence Cicero his contemporary and friend de clined the reputation of a professed lawyer but the jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his in comparable genius which converts into gold every object that it touches After the example of Plato he composed a republic and for the use of his re public a treatise of laws in which he labours to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and jus tice of the Roman constitution The whole universe according to his sublime hypothesis forms one im mense commonwealth gods and men who partici pate of the same essence are members of the same community reason prescribes the law of nature and nations

and Zeno he represents as the only teachers who arm and instruct a citizen for the duties of social life Of these the armour of the stoics  was found to be of the firmest temper and it was chiefly worn both for use and ornament in the schools of jurisprudence From the portico the Roman civilians learned to live to reason and to die but they imbibed in some degree the prejudices of the sect the love of paradox the pertinacious habits of dispute and a minute attachment to words and verbal distinctions The superiority of form to matter was introduced to ascertain the right to property and the equality of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius that he who touches the ear touches the whole body and that he who steals from a heap of corn or a hogshead of wine is guilty of the entire theft Authority Arms eloquence and the study of the civil law promoted a citizen to the honours of the Roman state and the three professions were sometimes more con spicuous by their union in the same character In the composition of the edict a learned praetor gave a sanction and preference to his private sentiments the opinion of a censor or a consul was entertained with respect and a

judges might disregard the authority of the Scaevolas them selves which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of an ingenious pleader Augustus and Tiberius were the first to adopt as a useful engine the science of the civilians and their servile labours accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of despotism Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to the sages of sena torian or equestrian rank who had been previously approved by the judgment of the prince and this monopoly prevailed till Hadrian restored the free dom of the profession to every citizen conscious of his abilities and knowledge The discretion of the prae tor was now governed by the lessons of his teachers the judges were enjoined to obey the comment as well as the text of the law and the use of codicils was a memorable innovation which Augustus ratified by the advice of the civilians The most absolute mandate could only require that Sects the judges should agree wjth the civilians if the civilians agreed among themselves But positive in stitutions are often the result of custom and preju dice laws and language are ambiguous and arbitrary where reason is incapable of pronouncing the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals the vanity of masters the blind attachment of their disciples and

Their legal studies were influenced by the various colours of their temper and principles Labeo was attached to the form of the old republic his rival embraced the more profitable substance of the rising monarchy But the disposition of a courtier is tame and submissive and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the sentiments or at least from the words of his predecessors while the bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or innovations The freedom of Labeo was enslaved however by the rigour of his own conclusions and he decided according to the letter of the law the same questions which his indulgent competitor resolved with a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings of mankind If a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of money Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale and he consulted nature for the age of puberty without con fining his definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years This opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons of the two founders the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Hadrian and the two sects derived their ap pellations from Sabinus and Proculus their most cele brated teachers The names of Cassiatis and Pega sians were likewise applied to the same parties but by a strange reverse the popular cause was in the hands of Pegasus a timid slave of Domitian while the favourite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius who gloried in his descent from the patriot

Antonines disclaimed the authority of a master and adopted from every system the most probable doc trines But their writings would have been less voluminous had their choice been more unanimous The conscience of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant testimonies and every sentence that his passion or interest might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some ve nerable name An indulgent edict of the younger Theodosius excused him from the labour of com paring and weighing their arguments Five civilians Caius Papinian Paul Ulpian and Modestinus were

of their illiterate discretion The subjects of the Greek provinces were ignorant of the language that disposed of their lives and properties and the barbarous dialect of the Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of Berytus and Constantinople As an Illyrian soldier that idiom was familiar to the infancy of Justinian r 220 THE DECLINE AND FALL his youth had been instructed by the lessons of juris prudence and his Imperial choice selected the most learned civilians of the East to labour with their sove reign in the work of reformation  The theory of professors was assisted by

native of Side in Pamphylia and his genius like that of Bacon embraced as his own all the business and knowledge of the age Tribonian composed both in prose and verse on a strange diver sity of

profession and if laws were every day enacted modified or repealed for the base consideration of his private emolument In the sedition of Constantinople his removal was granted to the clamours perhaps to the just indignation of the people but the quaestor was speedily restored and till the hour of his death he possessed above twenty years the favour and confidence of the em peror His passive and

Whatever flat April 7 tery might suggest the emperor of the East was afraid to establish his private judgment as the stand ard of equity in the possession of legislative power he borrowed the aid of time and opinion and his laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and legislators of past times Instead of a statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an artist the works of Justinian represent a tesselated pavement of an tique and costly but too often of incoherent frag ments In the first year of his reign he directed the faithful Tribonian and nine learned associates to revise

rapid composition of the digest or pandects in three years will deserve praise or censure accord ing to the merit of the execution From the library of Tribonian they chose forty the most eminent civilians of former times two thousand treatises were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books and it has been carefully recorded that three millions of lines or sentences were reduced in this

their commentaries on the twelve tables the per petual edict the laws of the people and the decrees of the senate succeeded to the authority of the text and the text was abandoned as an useless though

method choice and fidelity the humble though in dects dispensable virtues of a compiler Among the various combinations of ideas it is difficult to assign any reasonable preference but as the order of Justinian is different in his three works it is possible that all may be wrong and it is certain that two cannot be right In the selection of ancient laws he seems to have viewed his predecessors without jealousy and with equal regard the series could not ascend above the reign of Hadrian and the distinction of Paganism and Christianity introduced by Theodosius had been abolished by the consent of mankind But the ju risprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed within a period of a hundred years from the perpetual edict to the death of Severus Alexander the civilians who lived under the first Caesars are seldom permitted to speak and only three names can be attributed to the age of the republic The favourite of Justinian it has been fiercely urged was fearful of encountering the

Roman law and the writings of the old republicans how ever curious or excellent were no longer suited to the hew system of manners religion and government Perhaps if the preceptors and friends of

their predecessors their philosophic spirit had mitigated the rigour of antiquity simplified the forms of proceeding and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects The choice of the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of Tribonian but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity As the legislator of the empire Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines or condemn as seditious the free principles which were maintained by the last of the Roman lawyers But the existence of past facts is placed

resign the parchment to missals homilies and the golden legend If such was the fate of the most beautiful compositions of genius what stability could be expected for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science The books of jurisprudence were interesting to few and entertaining to none their value was connected with present use and they sunk for ever as soon as that use was superseded by the innovations of fashion superior merit or public authority In the age of peace and learning between Cicero and the last of the Antonines many losses had been already sustained and some luminaries of

indulgence communicated some rays of their glory to the persons of their wives and children But in the eye of the law all Roman citizens were equal and all subjects of the empire were citizens of Rome That inestimable character was degraded to an obsolete and empty name The voice of a Roman could no longer enact his laws or create the annual ministers of his power his consti tutional rights might have checked the arbitrary will of a master and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was admitted with equal favour to the civil and military command which the citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the conquests of his fathers The first Caesars had scrupulously guarded the distinction of ingenuous and servile birth which was decided by the condition of the mother and the candour of the laws was satisfied if her freedom could be ascertained during a single moment between the conception and the delivery The slaves who were liberated by a generous master immediately entered into the middle class of libertines or freedmen but they could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and gratitude what ever were the fruits of their industry their patron and his family inherited the third part or even the whole of their fortune if they died without children and without a testament Justinian respected the rights of patrons but his indulgence removed the badge of disgrace from the two inferior orders of freedmen whoever ceased to be a slave obtained without reserve or delay the station of a citizen and at length the dignity of an ingenuous birth which

absolute dominion over the life and happiness of his bondsman The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish Fathers and and educate their infant progeny The law of reasonc inculcates to the

Such conscientious injustice without any mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small republic but the various periods of three of ten or of twenty years determined by Justinian are more suitable to the latitude of a great empire It is only in the term of prescription that the distinction of real and personal fortune has been remarked by the civilians and their

DECLINE AND FALL chap children might distribute their respective shares ac  cording to the degrees of their merit or his affection his arbitrary displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance and the mortifying pre ference of a stranger But the experience of un natural parents recommended some limitations of their testamentary powers A son or by the laws of Justinian even a daughter could no longer be disinherited by their silence they were compelled to name the criminal and to specify the offence and the justice of the emperor enumerated the sole causes that could justify such a violation of the first prin ciples of nature and society Unless a legitimate portion a fourth part had been reserved for the children they were entitled to institute an action or complaint of inofficious testament to suppose that their father s understanding was impaired by sickness or age and respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence to the deliberate wisdom of the magistrate Legacies Jn the Roman jurisprudence an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the legacies The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity or to any of the twelve fractions of the substance of the testator represented his civil and religious character asserted his rights fulfilled his obligations and dis charged the gifts of friendship or liberality which his last will had bequeathed under the name of legacies But as the imprudence or prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance and leave only risk and labour to his successor he was empowered to retain the Falcidian portion to deduct before the payment of the legacies a clear fourth for his own emolument A reasonable time was allowed to ex amine the proportion between the debts and the estate to decide whether he should accept or refuse the testament and if he used the benefit of an in ventory the demands of the creditors could not exceed OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 251 the valuation of the

some legal disqualification In the contemplation of these events he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs to replace each other according to the order of the testament and the incapacity of a madman or an infant to bequeath his property might be supplied by a similar substitution But the power of the testator expired with the acceptance of the testament each Roman of mature age and discretion acquired the absolute dominion of his in heritance and the simplicity of the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate entails which confine the happiness and freedom of unborn generations Conquest and the formalities of law established the Codicils use of codicils If a Roman was surprised by deathan trusts in a remote province of the empire he addressed a short epistle to his legitimate or testamentary heir  who fulfilled his honour or neglected with impunity this last request which the judges before the age of Augustus were not authorised to enforce A codicil might be expressed in any mode or in any language but the subscription of five witnesses must declare that it was the genuine composition of the author His intention however laudable was sometimes ille gal and the invention of Jidei commissa or trusts arose from the struggle between natural justice and positive jurisprudence A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or benefactor of a child less Roman but none except a fellow citizen could act as his heir The Voconian law which abolished female succession restrained the legacy or inherit ance of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand

qualified citizen was named in the testa ment with a prayer or injunction that he would re store the inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended Various was the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation they had sworn to observe the laws of their country but honour prompted them to violate their oath and if they preferred their interest under the mask of patriotism they forfeited the esteem of every virtuous mind The declaration of Augustus relieved their doubts gave a legal sanction to confidential testaments and codicils and gently unravelled the forms and re straints of the republican jurisprudence But as the new practice of trusts degenerated into some abuse the trustee was enabled by the Trebellian and Pega sian decrees to reserve one fourth of the estate or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and actions of the succession The interpretation of testaments was strict and literal but the language of trusts and codicils was delivered from the minute and technical accuracy of the civilians  in Op HI The general duties of mankind are imposed by their public and private relations but their spe cific obligations to each

promise to pay me one hun dred pieces of gold was the solemn interrogation of Seius I do promiseâ was the reply of Sempro nius The friends of Sempronius who answered for his ability and inclination might be separately sued at the option of Seius and the benefit of partition or order of reciprocal actions insensibly deviated from the strict theory of stipulation The most cautious and deliberate consent was justly required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous pro mise and the citizen who might have obtained a legal security incurred the suspicion of fraud and paid the forfeit of his neglect But the ingenuity of the civilians successfully laboured to convert simple engagements into the form of solemn stipula tions The praetors as the guardians of social faith admitted every rational evidence of a voluntary and deliberate act which in their tribunal produced an equitable obligation and for which they gave an ac tion and a remedy 2 The obligations of the second class as

intrusted with the property of another has bound himself to the sacred duty of restitution In the case of a friendly loan the merit of generosity is on the side of the lender only in a deposit on the side of the receiver but in a pledge and the rest of the selfish commerce of ordinary life the benefit is compensated by an equivalent and the obligation to restore is variously modified by the nature of the transaction The Latin language very happily ex presses the fundamental difference between the com modatum and the mutuum which our poverty is re duced to confound under the vague and common appellation of a loan In the former the borrower was obliged to restore the same individual thing with which he had been accommodated for the temporary supply of his wants in the latter it was destined for his use and consumption and he discharged this mutual engagement by substituting the same specific value according to a just estimation of number of weight and of measure In the contract of sale the absolute dominion is transferred to the purchaser and he repays the benefit with an adequate sum of gold or silver the price or universal standard of all earthly possessions The obligation of another con tract that of location is of a more complicated kind Lands or houses labour or talents may be hired for a definite term at the expiration of the time the thing itself must be restored

his interest and if he accepts the benefit he is obliged to sustain the expense of the transaction In this boundless subject the historian will observe the location of land and money the rent of the one and the interest of the other as they materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and commerce The landlord was often obliged to advance the stock and instruments of husbandry and to content himself with a partition of the fruits If the feeble tenant was oppressed by accident contagion or hostile vio lence he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws five years were the

interposed to allow time for prejudice and resentment to subside the whole proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen or the opposition of a tribune and such po pular trials were commonly less

defence of an illustrious client the orators of Rome and Athens addressed their argu ments to the policy and benevolence as well as to the justice of their sovereign 2 The task of convening the citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult as the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied and the ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the people to the or dinary magistrates or to extraordinary inquisitors In the first ages these questions were rare and oc casional In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they were made perpetual four praetors were annually empowered to sit in judgment on the state offences of treason extortion peculation and bribery and Sylla added new praetors and new questions for those crimes which more

judges who with some truth and more prejudice have been compared to Select the English juries To discharge this important judges though burdensome office an annual list of ancient and respectable

single questions and the various rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans who represented the ju dicial authority of the state In each particular cause a sufficient number was drawn from the urn their integrity was guarded by an oath the mode of ballot secured their independence the suspicion of parti ality was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and defendant and the judges of Milo by the retrenchment of fifteen on each side were reduced to fifty one voices or tablets of acquittal of condemna tion or of favourable doubt 3 In his civil

the in crease of legal proceedings the tribunal of the cen tumvirs in which he presided acquired more weight and reputation But whether he acted alone or with the advice of his council the most

From the palace gate the spacious courts and long porticoes were lined with the lofty crests and gilt bucklers of the guards who presented their spears and axes with more confidence than they would

the hierarchy When the veil of the sanctuary was withdrawn the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the East on his throne beneath a canopy or dome which was supported by four columns and crowned with a winged figure of victory In the first emotions of surprise they submitted to the servile adoration of the Byzantine court but as soon as they rose from the ground Targetius the chief of the embassy expressed the freedom and pride of a Bar barian He extolled by the tongue of his interpreter the greatness of the chagan by whose clemency the kingdoms of the South were permitted to exist whose

our ancestors Whatever may be his merit a prince is incapable of sitting at table with his father till he has received his arms from a foreign and royal hand Alboin bowed with reverence to the institutions of his country selected forty companions and boldly visited the court of Turisund king of the Gepidae who embraced and entertained according to the laws of hospitality the murderer of his son At the banquet whilst Alboin occupied the seat of the youth whom he had slain a tender remembrance arose in the mind of Turisund How dear is that place râ how hateful is that per son were the words that escaped with a sigh from the indignant father His grief exasperated the national resentment of the Gepidae and Cuni mund his surviving son was provoked by wine or fraternal affection to the desire of vengeance The Lombards said the rude Barbarian  resemble in figure and in smell the mares of our Sarmatian plains And this insult was a coarse allusion to the white bands which enveloped their legs Add another resemblance replied an audacious Lom bard you have felt how strongly they kick Visit  the plain of Asfeld and seek for the bones of thy T 3 278 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap brother they are mingled with those of the vilest XXXVIIL  animals The Gepida a nation of warriors started from their seats and the fearless Alboin with his forty companions laid their hands on their swords The tumult was appeased by the venerable inter position of Turisund He saved his own honour and the life of his guest and after the solemn rites of investiture dismissed the stranger in the bloody arms of his son the gift of a weeping parent Alboin returned in triumph and the Lombards who cele brated his matchless intrepidity were compelled to praise the virtues of an enemy In this extraordinary visit he had probably seen the daughter of Cunimund who soon after ascended the throne of the Gepidae Her name was Rosamond an appellation expressive of female beauty and which our own history or ro mance has consecrated to amorous tales The king of the Lombards the father of Alboin no longer lived was contracted to the grand daughter of Clo vis but the restraints of faith and policy soon yielded to the hope of possessing the fair Rosamond and of insulting her family and nation The arts of per suasion were tried without success and the impatient lover by force and stratagem obtained the object of his desires War was the consequence which he fore saw and solicited but the Lombards could not long withstand the furious assaults of the Gepidae who were sustained by a Roman

the for midable aid of the chagan and the arguments that he employed are expressive of the art and policy of the Barbarians In the attack of the Gepidae he had been prompted by the just desire of extirpating a people whom their alliance with the Roman empire had rendered the common enemies of the nations and the personal adversaries of the chagan If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should unite in this glorious quarrel the victory was secure and the reward inestimable the Danube the Hebrus Italy and Constantinople would be exposed with out a barrier to their invincible arms But if they hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the Romans the same spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars to the extremity of the earth These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness and disdain he detained the Lombard ambassadors in his camp protracted the negotiation and by turns alleged his want of inclination or his want of ability to undertake this important enter prise At length he signified the ultimate price of his alliance that the Lombards should immediately present him with the tithe of their cattle that the spoils and captives should be equally divided but that the lands of the Gepidae should become the sole patrimony of the Avars Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the passions of Alboin and as the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude and perfidy of the Gepidae Justin abandoned that incorrigible people to their fate and remained the tranquil spectator of this unequal conflict The de spair of Cunimund was active and dangerous He was informed that the Avars had entered his con fines but on the strong assurance that after the defeat of the Lombards these foreign invaders would t4  r S80 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap easily be repelled he rushed forwards to encounter xxxviii g imp acable enemy of his name and family But the courage of the Gepidae could secure them no more than an honourable death The bravest of the nation fell in the field of battle the king of the Lombards contemplated with delight the head of Cunimund and his skull was fashioned into a cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror or perhaps to comply with the savage custom of his country After this vic tory no farther obstacle could impede the progress of the confederates and they faithfully executed the terms of their agreement t The fair countries of Walachia Moldavia Transylvania and the parts of Hungary beyond the Danube were occupied with out resistance by a new colony of Scythians and the Dacian empire of the chagans subsisted with splendour above two hundred and thirty years The nation of the Gepidae was dissolved but in the dis tribution of the captives the slaves of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the Lombards whose generosity adopted a valiant foe and whose freedom was incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny One moiety of the spoil introduced into the camp of Alboin more

to their memory the report of their success perhaps the view of their spoils had kindled in the rising generation the flame of emulation and enterprise Their hopes were encouraged by the spirit and elo quence of Alboin and it is affirmed that he spoke to their senses by producing at the royal feast the fairest and most exquisite fruits that grew spon taneously in the garden of the world No sooner had he erected his standard than the native strength of the Lombards was multiplied by the adventurous youth of Germany and Scythia The robust pea santry of Noricum and Pannonia had resumed the manners of Barbarians and the names of the Ge pidae Bulgarians Sarmatians and Bavarians may be distinctly traced in the provinces of Italy Of the Saxons the old allies of the Lombards twenty thou sand warriors with their wives and children accepted the invitation of Alboin Their bravery contributed to his success but the accession or the absence of their numbers was not sensibly felt in the magnitude of his host Every mode of religion was freely prac tised by its respective votaries The king of the Lombards had been educated in the Arian heresy but the Catholics in their public worship were al lowed to pray for his conversion while the more stubborn Barbarians sacrificed a she goat or perhaps a captive to the gods of their fathers The Lom bards and their confederates were united by their THE DECLINE AND FALL chap common attachment to a chief who excelled in all xxxviii Â jie virtues and vices of a savage hero and the vigilance of Alboin provided an ample magazine of offensive and defensive arms for the use of the ex pedition The portable wealth of the Lombards attended the march their lands they cheerfully re linquished to the Avars on the solemn promise which was made and accepted without a smile that if they failed in the conquest of Italy these voluntary exiles should be reinstated in their former possessions Mddeath They might have failed if Narses had been the of Narses antagonist of the Lombards and the veteran war riors the associates of his Gothic victory would have encountered with reluctance an enemy whom they dreaded and esteemed But the weakness of the By zantine court was subservient to the Barbarian cause and it was for the ruin of Italy that the emperor once listened to the complaints of his subjects The virtues of Narses were stained with avarice and in his pro vincial reign of fifteen years he accumulated a trea sure of gold and silver which surpassed the modesty of a private fortune His government was oppressive or unpopular and the general discontent was ex pressed with freedom by the deputies of Rome Be fore the throne of Justin they boldly declared that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable than the despotism of a

victorious general By the me diation of the pope who undertook a special pilgrim age to Naples their repentance was accepted and Narses assuming a milder aspect and a more dutiful language consented to fix his residence in the Capitol His death though in the extreme period of old age was unseasonable and premature since his genius alone could have repaired the last and fatal error of his life The reality or the suspicion of a conspiracy disarmed and disunited the Italians The soldiers resented the disgrace and bewailed the loss of their general They were ignorant of their new exarch and

supply the hopes of relief and the power of escape but from the Trentine hills to the gates of Ravenna and Rome the inland re gions of Italy became without a battle or a siege the lasting patrimony of

with a just increase of reputation and after a short exercise of the monastic virtues he was dragged from the cloister to the papal throne by the unani mous voice of the clergy the senate and the people He alone resisted or seemed to resist his own eleva tion and his humble petition that Maurice would be pleased to reject the choice of the Romans could only serve to exalt his character in the eyes of the emperor and the public When the fatal mandate was proclaimed Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of Rome and modestly concealed

chap sense and superstition were happily suited to his sta XXXVIir tion and to the temper of the times In his rivals the patriarch of Constantinople he condemned the antichristian title of universal bishop which the suc cessor of St Peter was too haughty to concede and too feeble to assume and the ecclesiastical juris Hisspi diction of Gregory was confined to the triple cha ritUid office racter of bishop of Rome primate of Italy and apostle of the West He frequently ascended the pulpit and kindled by his rude though pathetic eloquence the congenial passions of his audience the language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and applied and the minds of the people depressed by their present calamities were directed to the hopes and fears of the invisible world His precepts and example de fined the model of the Roman liturgy the dis tribution of the parishes the calendar of festivals the order of processions the service of the priests and deacons the variety and change of sacerdotal

the rough voices of the Barbarians attempted to imitate the melody of the Roman school Experience had shown him the efficacy of these solemn and pompous rites to soothe the distress to confirm the faith to mitigate the fierceness and to dispel the dark enthusiasm of the vulgar and he readily forgave their tendency to promote the reign of priesthood and superstition The bishops of Italy and the

Under his reign the Arians of Italy and Spain were reconciled to the catholic church and the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of Caesar than on that of Gregory the First Instead of six legions forty monks were embarked for that distant island and the pontiff lamented the austere duties which forbade him to partake the perils of then spiritual warfare In less than two years he could announce to the archbishop of Alexandria that they had baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand of his Anglo Saxons and that the Roman missionaries like those of the primitive church were armed only with spiritual powers The celestial honours have been liberally bestowed by the authority of the popes but Gregory is the last of their own order whom they have presumed to inscribe in the

liberally applied to their wants the inexhaustible resources of abstinence and order The voluminous account of his receipts and disbursements was kept above three hundred years in the Lateran as the model of Christian economy On the four great festivals he divided their quarterly allowance to the clergy to his domestics to the monasteries the churches the places of burial the alms houses and the hospitals of Rome and the rest of the diocese On the first day of every month he distributed to the poor according to the season their stated portion of corn wine cheese vegetables oil fish fresh provisions clothes and money and his treasurers were continually summoned to satisfy in his name the extraordinary demands of indigence and merit The instant distress of the sick and helpless of strangers and pilgrims was relieved by the bounty of each day and of every hour nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast till he had sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving of his compassion The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and matrons of Rome to accept without a blush the benevolence of the church three thousand virgins received their food and

declarations it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate the Lom bards by their domestic factions without leaving a king a duke or a count to save that unfortunate nation from the vengeance of their foes As a Christian bishop he preferred the salutary offices of peace his mediation appeased the tumult of arms but he was too conscious of the ails of the Greeks and the passions of the

The Christians of the East were scandalized by the wor ship of fire and the impious doctrine of the two principles the Magi were not less intolerant than the bishops and the martyrdom of some native

yielded to the base advice of the counsellors who urged as a fundamental law that the life of the em peror should never be exposed in the field Perhaps he was awakened by the last insolent demand of

general The despatches were transmitted to Sarbar himself and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death he dexterously inserted the names of four hundred officers assembled a military council and asked the cadarigan whether he was prepared to execute the commands of their tyrant The Per sians unanimously declared that Chosroes had for feited the sceptre a separate treaty was concluded with the government of Constantinople and if some considerations of honour or policy restrained Sarbar from joining the standard of Heraclius the emperor was assured that he might prosecute without inter

rather than exercised their strength While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem an ob scure town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens and they cut in pieces some

from the desert and in the last eight years of his reign He raclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from the Persians The history of the important reign of Heraclius is here interrupted by Mr Gibbon in order to introduce a chapter consisting of no less than one hundred and sixteen pages in which he describes many sects and various opinions respect ing the tenets of the Christian religion The chapter begins with the Incarnation of our Saviour and ends with an account of the proceedings of the Jesuits in Abyssinia in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries It is not

affirm that none of my readers will be of opinion that the expulsion of the Jesuits from Abyssinia which happened in the year 1632 can possibly be considered as a part of the History of the Decline and Fall of tbe Roman Empire This chapter is indeed a perfect illustration of the truth of the observation of Sir David Dalrymple which was noticed in the life of Mr Gibbon I mean that those parts of his work which contain the most violent attacks on the Chris tian religion are so far from forming a part of the History that they are in fact very inconvenient interruptions of the narrative As a proof of the truth of the foregoing assertion I shall observe that in the preceding chapter Heraclius appears as one of the most interesting characters in the History His expedition against Persia is by far the most brilliant that was achieved by the Romans against that country from the defeat and death of Crassus to the time of Heraclius Every person must of course be desirous of being acquainted with the remaining circumstances of the reign of this emperor True it is that the close of it was as calamitous as the pre ceding part had been glorious But still it must be the wish of every reader to be acquainted with it and it will not be with out some trouble that he can obtain the necessary information from Mr Gibbon A few words are indeed said in the be ginning of the next volume respecting the second marriage and death of Heraclius but the important events which took place in Syria and Egypt during the later part of his reign must be sought for at the end of the ninth volume The reader in the mean time must have perused a sketch of a OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 379 series of the Greek emperors from the seventh to the thirteenth CHAP century he must have read a long chapter respecting the XXXIX worship of images and the establishment and decline of the empire of Charlemagne and have studied the history of Arabia and Mahomet At length after perusing a whole volume of the original work the reader may discover in the History of the Saracens an account of the important events which occurred in the latter part of the reign of Heraclius and which contributed so very materially to the decline of the Eastern branch of the Roman empire  There is another observation which it is necessary that I should make at this period of our work Mr Gibbon in the first eight volumes of his History has selected the transactions of four centuries detailing them in the usual manner in the order of time in which they oc curred but at this point he alters his plan and during a long period from the year 628 in the reign of Heraclius to the taking of Constantinople by the Latins in 1203 he aban dons the order of time and divides his subject into ten branches He gives in the first a sketch of the private lives and characters of the Greek emperors during a period of near six hundred years The history of sixty monarchs is here comprised in one chapter and the reader who a little while before was employed during a whole volume with the single reign of Justinian can hardly persuade himself that in one evening he has traversed the history of six centuries He is brought in the first chapter of the ninth volume to the year 1203 In the next chapter he is suddenly carried back to the eighth century and is engaged with the Popes the worship of images the Franks and the emperor Char lemagne He then returns to the sixth and seventh cen turieSi to the birth and history of Mahomet and of the ca liphs Bulgarians Russians Normans and Turks are suc cessively described in succeeding chapters and in the hi story of each of those nations many circumstances occur in which the Greek empire is deeply interested but they are related so irregularly in respect to the time of their occur rence that the reader must look back to a former volume if he wishes to discover the names of the emperors who reigned at Constantinople when the capital was besieged by the Saracens or when Epirus was invaded by the Nor mans While we are thus led from the Tigris and Alp 380 THE DECLINE AND FALL CHAP arslan to the Loire and Charles Martel we lose sight of XXXIX the immediate subjects of the history It frequently hap  pens page after page and sometimes chapter after chapter succeed each other in which the Greek empire is either en tirely unnoticed or mentioned only in a secondary or very inferior degree of importance I am far from denying that some advantages arise from the method which Mr Gibbon has adopted He has pointed out several which are entitled to consideration but whatever opinion may be formed as to the comparative merit of the two systems in the larger works of our author I think there can be no doubt as to the preference which will be given to an uninterrupted narrative in a history which is so much contracted The remainder of this publication will therefore be conducted on the same plan as the former part of it The history of the Eastern branch of the Roman empire will be continued without interruption and under the reign of each prince the reader will find the relation of all the events of importance which took place during that period But although the order in which the historical events are related is here made to correspond with the time of their occurrence the language of the history continues with a few exceptions to be that of the original author The reader will still in the far greater part peruse the pages of Mr Gibbon but he will read them according to the order of time in which the events occurred instead of the

Mr Gibbon and he enters so largely into the nature and tenets of the Mahometan religion that almost a whole volume of the history is occupied with this subject The intelligent reader who notices the in defatigable zeal with which our author endeavours to point out the superiority of the Moslems above the Christians will be at no loss to discover the reason of his exerting the full powers of his pen on a subject of so peculiar a nature The history of the Christian church docs not form a part of the present pub lication and as the religious systems of the different nations which surrounded the empire are equally excluded I shall not follow the historian in those parts of his work in which he enlarges on the doctrine of the Koran With respect to the life and character of Mahomet I am persuaded that no abridgment would be satisfactory His history should be fully and completely detailed if it were at all introduced and the writer who entered on the task should possess the talents and the principles Which directed the pen of the author of the celebrated Bampton Lectures I therefore request my readers in this instance as in the rest of the present publication to remember that it is the history of the Decline and Fall of the Ro man Empire that is now laid before them With the wars of the successors of Mahomet we are indeed deeply interested and I hope that I have not neglected any of those parts of the great work of our au thor in which the Greek empire is engaged not but it is with the progress of the arms and not with the religious tenets of the Moslems that our history is prin cipally concerned Instead therefore of withdrawing the attention of the reader from the Roman world so completely and for so long a period as Mr Gibbon has done I shall continue the narrative without interruption inserting in their proper place and proper order of time the events by which the empire was gra dually shaken and at length finally destroyed 382 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap princes

visit to the prince of Medina who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain and a secure retreat in the province of Syria But the friendship of Hera clius and Mahomet was of short continuance  the new religion having inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Saracens The prophet of Arabia expired in the 632d year of the Christian era His successor Abubeker in the first year of his reign sent an army under the command of Caled to invade Persia The battle of Cadesia and a series of successful sieges in a short time rendered him master of that kingdom Yesdegerd the last of the Sassanian kings was slain when he attempted with the assistance of his Eastern allies to recover the pos session of his lost dominions The river Oxus then separated the territories of the Saracens and the Turks but the former soon traversed that boundary and the Mahometan banners were in a short time displayed on the banks of the Indus and on the shores of the Caspian sea Syria  was also invaded by

disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed The sentence was executed with blind obedience the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed among the four thousand baths of the city and

a grievous tax was imposed on Constantinople to supply the preparations of a fleet and army All are guilty and all must perish was the mandate of Justinian and the bloody execution was intrusted to his favourite Stephen who was recommended by the epithet of the Savage Yet even the savage Stephen imperfectly accomplished the intentions of his sovereign the slowness of his attack allowed the greater part of the inhabitants to withdraw into the country and the minister of vengeance contented himself with reducing the youth of both sexes to a state of servitude with roasting alive seven of

wants and even the luxury of the inhabitants But the calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah and as the former was miserably assuaged so the latter was dreadfully

the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians By these precautions the secret was confined above four hundred years to the Romans of the East and at the end of the eleventh

The Fatimites who were descended from the daughter of the Prophet displayed the green standard and ruled in Africa The Ommiades with the white colours after a long war were driven from the East by the Abbasides but found an asylum in Spain where they continued to reign during two hun dred and fifty years In the tenth century the chair of Mahomet was disputed by three caliphs or com manders of the

the ecclesiastical story of the Iconoclasts Yet in spite of the clamours of superstition a favour able prejudice for the character of Leo the Isaurian may be reasonably drawn from the obscurity of his birth and the duration of his reign 1 In an age of manly spirit the prospect of an imperial reward would have kindled every energy of the mind and produced a crowd of competitors as deserving as they were desirous to reign Even in the corruption and debility of the modern Greeks the elevation of a OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 415 XL plebeian from the last to the first rank of society sup chap poses some qualifications above the level of the mul  titude He would probably be ignorant and dis dainful of speculative science and in the pursuit of fortune he might absolve himself from the obliga tions of benevolence and justice but to his character we may ascribe the useful virtues of prudence and fortitude the knowledge of mankind and the im portant art of gaining their confidence and directing their passions It is agreed that Leo was a native of Isauria and that Conon was his primitive name The writers whose awkward satire is praise describe him as an itinerant pedlar who drove an ass with some paltry merchandize to the country fairs and foolishly relate that he met on the road some Jewish fortune tellers who promised him the Roman empire on condition that he would abolish the worship of idols A more probable account relates the migra tion of his father from Asia Minor to Thrace where he exercised the lucrative trade of a grazier and he must have acquired considerable wealth since the first introduction of his son was procured by a supply of five hundred sheep to the Imperial camp His first service was in the guards of Justinian where he soon attracted the notice and by degrees the jealousy of the tyrant His valour and dexterity were conspi cuous in the Colchian war from Anastasius he re ceived the command of the Anatolian legions and by the suffrage of the soldiers he was raised to the em pire with the general applause of the Roman world 2 In this dangerous elevation Leo the Third sup ported himself against the envy of his equals the dis content of a powerful faction and the assaults of his foreign and domestic enemies The Catholics who accuse his religious innovations are obliged to con fess that they were undertaken with temper and conducted with firmness Their silence respects the 416 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap wisdom of his administration and the purity of his manners The emperor was ignorant of sacred and profane literature but his education and his reason had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images the worship of which was established before the end of the sixth century But in the reforma tion of religion Leo proceeded with moderate and cautious steps He assembled a council of senators and bishops and with their consent enacted that all the images should be removed from the sanctuary and the altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible to the sight but inac cessible to the superstition of the people By a se cond edict the churches of Constantinople and the provinces were cleared of idolatry The Iconoclasts as they are termed were supported by the zeal of six emperors but the East and West were involved in a conflict of one hundred and twenty years Va rious disturbances which were excited in the East in defence of the images were checked by the troops of the emperor but in the West the attempt of Leo and his son to remove them from the churches was followed by a general insurrection of the people to which they were excited and encouraged by the pope Gregory the Second A bloody contest ensued Rome was repeatedly assaulted by the troops of the exarchs but was defended by the courage of the Romans The Greeks were overthrown and massa cred At Ravenna the contest was still more violent but the votaries of images were superior in number and the exarch was slain in a popular sedition To punish this flagitious deed and restore his dominion in Italy the emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic Gulf The Greeks landed in the neigh bourhood of Ravenna and an obstinate and bloody engagement ensued but at length after a hard fought day the defenders of Ravenna were victorious OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 417 and the forces of the invaders were destroyed An chap Exarch was still permitted to reside at Ravenna but he was rather a captive than a ruler and although the government of Rome and Italy continued to be exercised in the name of the successors of Constan tine their authority from this period was rather no minal than real Leo made no farther attempts to re establish his power in Italy He expired peace ably in the palace of Constantinople after a reign of twenty four years and the purple which he had ac quired was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the third generation Constantine the Fifth surnamed Copronymus the Constan son and successor of Leo during a long reign of j f thirty four years attacked with less temperate zeal A D 741 the images or idols of the church A synod was held at Blacharnae a suburb of Constantinople which was composed of three hundred and thirty eight bishops who after serious deliberation subscribed an unani mous decree that image worship is a corruption of Christianity and a renewal of Paganism and that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased The East after many disturbances obeyed with reluctance and the images were removed but they were fondly cherished and vigorously defended by the independent zeal of the Italians A new enemy now invaded Romagna Liutprand king of the Lombards declared himself the champion of the images and the Catholics of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance and admitted him into Ravenna The city was soon afterwards recovered by the forces of the Venetians but Astolphus the successor of Liutprand declared himself the equal enemy of the emperor

In the East the long reign of Constantine the Fifth was distracted with seditions and conspiracies of which the persecution of images was the motive or pretence These seditions were suppressed by

Countrymen and Christians cried Nicephorus for himself and his mute brethren behold the sons of your emperor if you can still recognise our features in this miserable state A life an imperfect life is

mountain and the river Singarius Five years after this expedition Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder brother the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race illustrious in the West as the ally of Charlemagne and familiar to the most childish readers as the perpetual hero of the Arabian tales His title to the name of Al Rashid the Just is sullied by the extirpation of the generous perhaps the innocent Barmecides yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops  and who dared in a passage of the Koran to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of God and posterity His court was adorned with luxury and science but in a reign of three and twenty years Harun repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt nine times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca eight times he invaded the territories of the Romans  and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of submission But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was deposed and banished her successor Nicephorus resolved to ob literate this badge of servitude and disgrace The epistle of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the game of chess which had already spread from Persia to Greece The queen he OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 427 XL spoke of Irene considered you as a rook and herself chap as a pawn That pusillanimous female submitted __ to pay a tribute the double of which she ought to have exacted from the Barbarians Restore there fore the fruits of your injustice or abide the de termination of the sword At these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the throne The caliph smiled at the menace and drawing his scimitar samsamah a weapon of historic or fabulous renown he cut asunder the feeble arms of the Greeks without turning the edge or en dangering the temper of his blade He then dictated an epistle of tremendous brevity In the name of the most merciful God Harun Al Rashid to Nicephoms the Roman dog I have read thy letter O thou son of an unbelieving mother Thou shalt not hear thou shalt behold my reply It was written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia and the warlike celerity of the Arabs could only be checked by the arts of deceit and the show of repentance The triumphant caliph retired after the fatigues of the campaign to his fa vourite palace of Racca on the Euphrates but the distance of five hundred miles and the inclemency of the season encouraged his adversary to violate the peace Nicephorus was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of the faithful who repassed in the depth of winter the snows of mount Taurus his stratagems of policy and war were ex husted and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds from a field of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission and the caliph was resolved on victory One hundred and thirty five thousand regular soldiers received pay and were inscribed in the military roll and above three hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched under the 428 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap black standard of the Abassides They swept the sur XL face of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra and invested the Pontic Heraclea once a nourishing state now a paltry town at that time capable of sustaining in her antique walls a month s siege against the forces of the East The ruin was complete the spoil was ample but if Harun had been conversant with Grecian story he would have regretted the statue of Hercules whose attributes the club the bow the quiver and the lion s hide were sculptured in massy gold The progress of desolation by sea and land from the Euxine to the isle of Cyprus compelled the emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty defiance In the new treaty the ruins of Heraclea were left for ever as a lesson and a trophy and the coin of the tribute was marked with the superscription of Harun and his three sons Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove the dis honour of the Roman name After the death of their father the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord and the conqueror the liberal Alina mon was sufficiently engaged in the restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign science Nicepho Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more a d 802 criminal than Nicephorus but none perhaps have October 31 more deeply incurred the universal abhorrence of their people His character was stained with the three odious crimes of hypocrisy ingratitude and avarice his want of virtue was not redeemed by any superior talents nor his want of talents by any pleasing qualifications Unskilful and unfortunate in war Nicephorus was vanquished by the Saracens and slain by the Bulgarians and the advantage of his death overbalanced in the public opinion the destruction

Stauracius the son and heir of Nicephorus escaped stauracius from the battle in which his father was killed but he escaped with an incurable wound Six months of an expiring life were sufficient to refute his in decent though popular declaration that he would in all things avoid the example of his father On the near prospect of his decease Michael the great master of the palace and the husband of his sister Procopia was named by every person of the palace and city except by his envious brother Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his hand he conspired against the life of his successor and cherished the idea of changing to a democracy the Roman empire But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the people and to remove the scruples of the candidate Michael the First

ignorant both of laws and letters he introduced into his civil government the rigour and even the cruelty of mili tary discipline but if his severity was sometimes dangerous to the innocent it was always formidable to the guilty His religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of Chameleon but the Catholics have acknowledged by the voice of a saint and confessor that the life of the Iconoclast was useful to the re public The zeal of his companion Michael was re paid with riches honours and military command and his subordinate talents were beneficially em ployed in the public service Yet the Phrygian was dissatisfied at receiving as a favour a scanty portion of the Imperial prize which he had bestowed on his equal and his discontent which sometimes evapo rated in a hasty discourse at length assumed a more threatening and hostile aspect against a prince whom he represented as a cruel tyrant That tyrant how ever repeatedly detected warned and dismissed the old companion of his arms till fear and resentment pre vailed over gratitude and Michael after a scrutiny into his actions and designs was convicted of treason and sentenced to be burnt alive in the furnace of the

alarmed at these signs of security and intelligence but though he retired with silent steps his entrance and departure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a corner of the prison Under the

Without a weapon and with out a friend he grasped a weighty cross and stood at bay against the hunters of his life but as he asked for mercy This is the hour not of mercy but of vengeance was the

Caspian He formed the siege of Constantinople but the capital was defended with spiritual and carnal weapons a Bulgarian king as saulted the camp of the Orientals and Thomas had the misfortune or the weakness to fall alive into the power of the conqueror The hands and feet of the rebel were amputated he was placed on an ass and amidst the insults of the people was led through the streets which he

conquest and dominion was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads Theophiius The emperor Theophilus the son and successor of Oct 3 9 Michael the Stammerer was one of the most active and high spirited princes who reigned at Constan tinople during the middle age In offensive or de fensive war he marched in person five times against the Saracens formidable in his attacks esteemed by the enemy in his losses and defeats In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into Syria and be sieged the obscure town of Sozopetra the casual OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 437 birthplace of the caliph Motassem whose father chap Harun was attended in peace or war by the most favourite of his wives and concubines The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen and he could only intercede in favour of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection These solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a part Sozopetra was levelled with the ground the Syrian prisoners were marked or mu tilated with ignominious cruelty and a thousand female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory Among those a matron of the house of Abbas invoked in an agony of despair the name of Motassem and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honour of her kinsman to avenge his indignity and to answer her appeal Under the reign of the two elder brothers the inheritance of the youngest had been confined to Anatolia Armenia Georgia and Circassia this frontier station had exercised his military talents and among his

or fail with the least re proach In the revenge of his injury the caliph prepared to retaliate a similar affront The father of Theophilus was a native of Amorium in Phrygia the original seat of the Imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monuments and what ever might be the indifference of the people Con stantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of the sovereign and his court The name of Amorium was inscribed on the shields of the Sara cens and their three armies were again united under the walls of the devoted city It had been proposed by the wisest counsellors to evacuate Amo rium to remove the inhabitants and to abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment of the Bar barians The emperor embraced the more generous resolution of defending in a siege and battle the country of his ancestors When the armies drew near the front of the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted with spears and javelins but the event of the action was not glo rious on either side to the national troops The Arabs were broken but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians who had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire The Greeks were repulsed and vanquished but it was by the arrows of the Turkish cavalry and had not their bowstrings been damped and relaxed by the evening rain very few of the Christians could have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle They breathed at Dorylaeum at the distance of three days and Theophilus reviewing his trembling squa drons forgave the common flight both of the prince and people After this discovery of his weakness he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium the inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 439 prayers and promises and detained the Roman am chap bassadors to be the witnesses of his great revenge XL They had nearly been the witnesses of his shame The vigorous assaults of fifty five days were encoun tered by a faithful governor a veteran garrison and a desperate people and the Saracens must have raised the siege if a domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a bull The vow of Motassem was accomplished with un relenting rigour tired rather than satiated with de struction he returned to his new palace of Samara in the neighbourhood of Bagdad while the unfor tunate Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid of his Western rival the emperor of the Franks Yet in the siege of Amorium above seventy thousand Moslems had perished their loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty thousand Christians and the sufferings of an equal number of captives who were treated as the most atrocious criminals Mu

character of Theophilus is a rare example in which religious zeal has allowed and perhaps magni fied the virtues of a heretic and a persecutor His valour was often felt by the enemies and his justice by the subjects of the monarchy but the valour of Theophilus was rash and fruitless and his justice arbitrary and cruel He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens but his five expeditions were concluded by a signal overthrow Amorium the native city of his ancestors was levelled with the ground and from his military toils he derived only the surname of the Unfortunate The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the institution of laws and the choice of magistrates and while he seems with out action his civil government revolves round his centre with the silence and order of the planetary system But the justice of Theophilus was fashioned on the model of the Oriental despots who in per sonal and irregular acts of authority consult the rea son or passion of the moment without measuring the sentence by the law or the penalty by the offence A poor woman threw herself at the emperor s feet to complain of a powerful neighbour the brother of the empress who had raised his palace wall to such an inconvenient height that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air On the proof of the fact instead of granting like an ordinary judge suf ficient or ample damages to the plaintiff the sove reign adjudged to her use and benefit the palace and the ground Nor was Theophilus content with this extravagant satisfaction his zeal converted a civil trespass into a criminal act and the unfortunate patrician was stripped and scourged in the public place of Constantinople For some venial offences some defect of equity or vigilance the principal mi nisters a prefect a quaestor a captain of the guards were banished or mutilated or scalded with boiling OF THE ROMAN EMPIKE 441 pitch or burnt alive in the hippodrome and as chap these dreadful examples might be the effects of error XL or caprice they must have alienated from his service the best and wisest of the citizens But the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of power or as he thought of virtue and the people safe in their obscurity applauded the danger and debase ment of their superiors This extraordinary rigour was justified in some measure by its salutary conse quences since after a scrutiny of seventeen days not a complaint or abuse could be found in the court or city and it might be alleged that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of iron and that the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge Yet in the crime or the suspicion of trea son that judge is of all others the most credulous and partial Theophilus might inflict a tardy venge ance on the assassins of Leo and the saviours of his father but he enjoyed the fruits of their crime and his jealous tyranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his life A Persian of the race of the Sassanides died in poverty and exile at Constantinople leaving an only son the issue of a plebeian marriage At the age of twelve years the royal birth of Theophobus was revealed and

in the flower of his age was compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire But his jealousy was ex asperated by envy and disease he feared the dan gerous virtues which might either support or oppress their infancy and weakness and the dying emperor demanded the head of the Persian prince With savage delight he recognised the familiar features of his brother Thou art no longer Theophobus he said and sinking on his couch he added with a faltering voice Soon too soon I shall be no more Theophilus The Russians who have borrowed from the Greeks the greatest part of their civil and ecclesiastical policy preserved till the last century a singular institution in the marriage of the Czar They collected not the virgins of every rank and of every province a vain and romantic idea but the daughters of the principal nobles who awaited in the palace the choice of their sovereign It is affirmed that a similar me thod was adopted in the nuptials of Theophilus With a golden apple in his hand he slowly walked between two lines of contending beauties his eye was detained by the charms of Icasia and in the awkwardness of a first declaration the prince could only observe that in this world women had been the cause of much evil And surely sir she pertly replied they have likewise been the occasion of much good This affectation of unseasonable wit displeased the Imperial lover he turned aside in disgust Icasia concealed her mortification in a con vent and the modest silence of Theodora was re warded with the golden apple She deserved the love but did not escape the severity of her lord From the palace garden he beheld a vessel deeply laden and steering into the port on the discovery that the precious cargo of Syrian luxury was the  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 443 property of his

standard was overthrown by a detachment of the Barbarians they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors but the attempt was treasonable and the succour remote and precarious Their distress appeared to re ceive some aggravation from the death of their spi ritual and temporal chief but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of an election and the unanimous choice of Leo the Fourth was the safety of the church and city This pontiff was born a Roman the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in his breast and amidst the ruins of his country he stood erect like one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads above the fragments of the Roman forum The first days of his reign were consecrated to all the solemn offices of religion which served to restore the hopes of the  multitude The public defence had been long neg lected not from the presumption of peace but from the distress and poverty of the times As far as the scantiness of his means and the shortness of his lei sure would allow the ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo fifteen towers in the most accessible stations were built or renewed two of these commanded on either side the Tyber and an iron chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of an hostile navy The Romans were assured of a short respite by the welcome news that the siege OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 445 of Gayeta had been raised and that a part of the chap enemy with their sacrilegious plunder had perished in the waves But the storm which had been delayed soon burst victory and upon them

Sardinia cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber sixteen miles from the city and their discipline and numbers appeared to threaten not a transient inroad but a seri ous design of conquest and

appeared in the port of Ostia under the command of Caesarius the son of the Neapolitan duke a noble and valiant youth who had already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens With his prin cipal companions Caesarius was invited to the Lateran palace and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire their errand and to accept with joy and surprise their providential succour The city bands in arms attended their father to Ostia where he reviewed and blessed his generous deliverers They kissed his feet received the communion with martial devotion and listened to the prayer of Leo that the same God who had supported St Peter and St Paul on the waves of the sea would strengthen the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his holy name After a similar prayer and with equal resolution the Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys which preserved their advantageous station along the coast The victory inclined to the side of the allies  when it was less gloriously decided in their favour by a sudden tempest which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest mariners The 446 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbour while XL the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore Those who escaped from shipwreck and hunger neither found nor deserved mercy at the hands of their

vert The pontiff at the head of the citizens and allies paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles and among the spoils of this naval victory thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended round the altar of St Peter The reign of Leo the Fourth was employed in the defence and orna ment of the Roman state The churches were renewed and embellished near four thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of St Peter and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of gold the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds em bossed with the portraits of the pope and emperor and encircled with a string of pearls Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria

authority could supply The pious labour of four years was animated in every sea son and at every hour by the presence of the inde fatigable pontiff The love of fame a generous but worldly passion may be detected in the name of the Leonine city which he bestowed on the Vatican yet the pride of the dedication was tempered with Chris tian penance and humility Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus we have not hitherto found in the imitation of their vices the character of a Roman prince who consi dered pleasure as the object of life and virtue as the enemy of pleasure Whatever might have been the maternal care of Theodora in the education of Michael the Third her unfortunate son was a king before he was a man If the ambitious mother laboured to check the progress of reason she could not cool the ebullition of passion and her selfish policy was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong  youth At the age of eighteen he rejected her au thority without feeling his own incapacity to govern the empire and himself With Theodora all gravity and wisdom retired from the court their place was supplied by the alternate dominion of vice and folly and it was impossible without forfeiting the public esteem to acquire or preserve the favour of the em peror The millions of gold and silver which had been accumulated for the service of the state were lavished on the vilest of men who flattered his pas sions and shared his pleasures and in a reign of 448 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap thirteen years the richest of sovereigns was compelled xu to strip the palace and churches of their precious fur niture Like Nero he delighted in the amusements of the theatre and sighed to be surpassed in the ac complishments in which he should have blushed to excel Yet the studies of Nero in music and poetry betrayed some symptoms of a liberal taste the more ignoble arts of the son of Theophilus were confined to the chariot race of the Hippodrome The four factions which had agitated the peace still amused the idleness of the capital for himself the emperor assumed the blue livery  the three rival colours were distributed to his favourites  and in the vile though eager contention he forgot the dignity of his person and the safety of his dominions He silenced the messenger of an invasion who presumed to divert his attention in the most critical moment of the race and by his command the importunate beacons were extinguished that too frequently spread the alarm from Tarsus to Constantinople The most skilful charioteers obtained the first place in his confidence and esteem their merit was profusely rewarded  the emperor feasted in their houses and presented their children at the baptismal font and while he ap plauded his own popularity he affected to blame the cold and stately reserve of his predecessors In his midnight revels when his passions were inflamed by wine he was provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands and if any feelings of humanity were left he was reduced with the return of sense to ap prove the salutary disobedience of his servants But the most extraordinary feature in the character of Michael is the profane mockery of the religion of his country A buffoon of the court was invested with the robes of the patriarch the twelve metropolitans among whom the emperor was ranked assumed their ecclesiastical garments they used or abused the sa OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 449 cred vessels of the altar in their bacchanalian feasts chap Nor were these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city On the day of a solemn festi val the emperor with his bishops or buffoons rode on asses through the streets encountered the true pa triarch at the head of his clergy and by their licen tious shouts and obscene gestures disordered the gra vity of the Christian procession The devotion of Michael appeared only in some offence to reason or piety he received his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin and an Impe rial tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constantine the Iconoclast By this extra vagant conduct the son of Theophilus became as contemptible as he was odious  every citizen was im patient for the deliverance of his country and even the favourites of the moment were apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had be stowed In the thirtieth year of his age and in the hour of intoxication and sleep Michael the third was murdered in his chamber by the founder of a new dynasty whom the emperor had raised to an equality of rank and power The genealogy of Basil the Macedonian if it be Basil i not the spurious offspring of pride and flattery ex â žjan a hibits a genuine picture of the revolution of the most s j 7 illustrious families The Arsacides the rivals of Rome possessed the sceptre of the East near four hundred years  a younger branch of these Parthian kings continued to reign in Armenia and their royal descendants survived the partition and servitude of that ancient monarchy Two of these Artabanus and Chlienes escaped or retired to the court of Leo the first his bounty seated them in a safe and hos pitable exile in the province of Macedonia Adrian

of the Persian and Arabian powers  who recalled them to their native country But their splendour was insensibly clouded by time and poverty and the father of Basil was reduced to a small farm which he had cultivated with his own hands yet he scorned to disgrace the blood of the Arsacides by a plebeian alliance his wife a widow of Adrianople was pleased to count among her ancestors the great Constantine and their royal infant was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or country with the Macedonian Alexander No sooner was he born than the cradle of Basil his family and his city were swept away by an inundation of the Bul garians he was educated a slave in a foreign land and in this severe discipline he acquired the hardi ness of body and flexibility of mind which pro moted his future elevation In the age of youth or manhood he shared the deliverance of the Roman captives who generously broke their fetters marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine de feated two armies of Barbarians embarked in the ships which had been stationed for their reception and returned to Constantinople from whence they were distributed to their respective homes But the freedom of Basil was naked and destitute his farm was ruined by the calamities of war after his father s death his manual labour or service could no longer support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more conspicuous theatre in which every virtue and every vice may lead to the paths of greatness The first night of his arrival at Constantinople without friends or money the weary pilgrim slept on the steps of the church of St Diomede he was fed by the casual hospitality of a monk and was intro duced to the service of a cousin and namesake of the emperor Theophilus who though himself a dimi OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 451 nutive person was always followed by a train of chap tall and handsome domestics Basil attended his pa XL tron to the government of Peloponnesus eclipsed by his personal merit the birth and dignity of Theo philus and formed an useful connexion with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras Danielis presented him with thirty slaves and the produce of her bounty was expended in the support of his bro thers and the purchase of some large estates in Ma cedonia His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the service of Theophilus and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of the court A famous wrestler in the train of the Bulgarian ambas sadors had defied at the royal banquet the boldest and most robust of the Greeks The strength of Basil was praised he accepted the challenge and the Barbarian champion was overthrown at the first onset A beautiful but vicious horse was con demned to be hamstrung it was subdued by the dexterity and courage of the servant of Theophilus and his conqueror was promoted to an honourable rank in the Imperial stables But it was impossible to obtain the confidence of Michael without comply ing with his vices and his new favourite the great chamberlain of the palace was raised and supported by a disgraceful marriage with a royal concubine and the dishonour of his sister who succeeded to her place The public administration had been aban doned to the Caesar Bardas the brother and enemy of Theodora but the arts of female influence per suaded Michael to hate and to fear his uncle he was drawn from Constantinople under the pretext of a Cretan expedition and stabbed in the tent of audi ence by the sword of the chamberlain and in the presence of the emperor About a month after this execution Basil was invested with the title of Au gustus and the government of the empire He sup g g 2 452 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap ported this unequal association till his influence was XL fortified by popular esteem His life was endangered by the caprice of the emperor and his dignity was profaned by a second colleague who had rowed in the galleys Yet the murder of his benefactor must be condemned as an act of ingratitude and treason and the churches which he dedicated to the name of St Michael were a poor and puerile expiation of his guilt The different ages of Basil the first may be com pared with those of Augustus The situation of the Greek did not allow him in his earliest youth to lead an army against his country or to proscribe the noblest of her sons but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave he dissembled his ambition and even his virtues and grasped with the bloody hand of an assassin the empire which he ruled with the wisdom and tenderness of a parent A private citi zen may feel his interest repugnant to his duty but it must be from a deficiency of sense or courage that an absolute monarch can separate his happiness from his glory or his glory from the public welfare The life or panegyric of Basil has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of his descend ants but even their stability on the throne may be justly ascribed to the superior merit of their ancestor In this character his grandson Constantine has at tempted to delineate a perfect image of royalty but that feeble prince unless he had copied a real model could not easily have soared so high above the level of his own conduct or conceptions But the most solid praise of Basil is drawn from the comparison of a ruined and flourishing monarchy that which he wrested from the dissolute Michael and that which he bequeathed to the Macedonian dynasty The evils which had been sanctified by time and example were corrected by his master hand and he revived OV THE HOMAN EMPIRE 453 XL if not the national spirit at least the order and nia chap jesty of the Roman empire His application was in defatigable his temper cool his understanding vi gorous and decisive and in his practice he observed that rare and salutary moderation which pursues each virtue at an equal distance between the opposite vices His military service had been confined to the palace nor was the emperor endowed with the spirit or ta lents of a warrior Yet under his reign the Roman arms were again formidable to the Barbarians As soon as he had formed a new army by discipline and exercise he appeared in person on the banks of the Euphrates curbed the pride of the Saracens and suppressed the dangerous though just revolt of the Manichaaans His indignation against a rebel who had long eluded his pursuit provoked him to wish and to pray that by the grace of God he might drive three arrows into the head of Chrysochir That odious head which had been obtained by treason ra ther than by valour was suspended from a tree and thrice exposed to the dexterity of the Imperial archerâ a base revenge against the dead more worthy of the times than of the character of Basil but his prin cipal merit was in the civil administration of the finances and of the laws To replenish an exhausted treasury it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill placed gifts of his predecessor his prudence abated one moiety of the restitution and a sum of twelve hundred thousand pounds was instantly procured to answer the most pressing demands and to allow some space for the mature operations of economy Among the various schemes for the improvement of the re venue a new mode was suggested of capitation or tribute which would have too much depended on the arbitrary discretion of the assessors A sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly produced by the minister but on the more careful scrutiny of r G G 3 454 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap Basil himself only two could be found who might XL be safely intrusted with such dangerous powers and they justified his esteem by declining his confidence But the serious and successful diligence of the em peror established by degrees an equitable balance of property and payment of receipt and expenditure a peculiar fund was appropriated to each service and a public method secured the interest of the prince and the property of the people After reforming the luxury he assigned two patrimonial estates to supply the decent plenty of the Imperial table the con tributions of the subject were reserved for his de fence and the residue was employed in the embel lishment of the capital and provinces A taste for building however costly may deserve some praise and much excuse from thence industry is fed art is encouraged and some object is attained of public emolument or pleasure the use of a road an aque duct or a hospital is obvious and solid and the hundred churches that arose by the command of Basil were consecrated to the devotion of the age In the character of a judge he was assiduous and impartial desirous to save but not afraid to strike the op pressors of the people were severely chastised but his personal foes whom it might be unsafe to pardon were condemned after the loss of their eyes to a life of solitude and repentance The change of language and manners demanded a revision of the obsolete jurisprudence of Justinian the voluminous body of his institutes pandects code and novels was di gested under forty titles in the Greek idiom and the Basilics which were improved and completed by his son and grandson must be

be necessary to take a short view of the OF THE UOAIAN EMPIRE 455 state of that country in the ninth century The three chap great nations of the world the Greeks the Saracens XL and the Franks encountered each other on the thea tre of Italy The southern provinces which now compose the kingdom of Naples were subject for the most part to the Lombard dukes and the princes of Beneventum these last were so powerful in war that they checked for a moment the genius of Charle magne and so liberal in peace that they main tained in their capital an academy of thirty two phi losophers and grammarians The division of this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento Salerno and Capua and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance During a calamitous period of two hundred years Italy was exposed to a repetition of wounds which the invaders were not capable of healing by the union and tranquillity of a perfect conquest Their frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo and were entertained with too much indul gence by the Christians of Naples the more formida ble fleets were prepared on the African coast and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect In the revolution of human events a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine forks the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second time with the blood of the Africans and the sovereign of Rome again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Taren tum A colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari which commands the entrance of the Adriatic gulf and their impartial depredations provoked the resent ment and conciliated the union of the two emperors An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the Macedonian the first of his race and Lewis the great grandson of Charlemagne and each party sup  g g 4 456 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap

defence Conquest of four years the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis who commanded in person the operations of the siege This important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East and West but their recent amity was soon embittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and pride The Greeks assumed as their own the merits of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph extolled

Greek emperors Basil and his son Leo secured the advantage of the reduction of Bari The Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge their supremacy and an ideal line from Mount Garganus to the bay of Salerno leaves the far greater part of the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire Beyond that line the dukes or republics of Amalfi and Naples who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance re joiced in the neighbourhood of their lawful sove reign and Amalfi was enriched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of Asia But the Lombard princes of Benevento Salerno and Capua were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world and too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute The city of Bari rose to dignity and wealth as the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy the title of patri cian and afterwards the singular name of Catapan was assigned to the supreme governor and the po licy both of the church and state was modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy their efforts were feeble and adverse and the Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of Germany which descended from the Alps under the Imperial standard of the Othos The first and greatest of those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the

prevalent than su perstition or resentment and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally The successors of Basil amused themselves with the belief that the conquest of Lom bardy had been achieved and was still preserved by the justice of their laws the virtues of their ministers and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and oppression A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into the palace of Constan tinople and the illusions of flattery were dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman adven turers The glorious reign of the emperor Basil was ter minated by an accident in the chase A furious stag entangled his horns in the belt of the monarch and raised him from his horse he was rescued by an attendant who cut the belt and slew the animal but the fall or the fever exhausted the strength of the aged emperor and he expired in the palace amidst the tears of his family and people Of the four sons of Basil Constantine died before his father Stephen the youngest was content with the honours of a patriarch and saint both Leo and Alexander were alike invested with the purple but the powers of government were solely exercised by the elder brother Leo vi the The name of Leo the sixth has been dignified by JuoTSwr ne e of philosopher and the union of the prince March i an l f g sage of the

strove to preserve must be imputed to the softness and indo lence of his character Did he subdue his prejudices and those of his subjects His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition and the errors of the people were consecrated by his laws If we still in quire the reason of his sage appellation it can only be replied that the son of Basil was less ignorant than the greater part of his

modern days The Dromones or light galleys of the Byzantine empire were content with two tier of oars each tier was composed of five and twenty benches  and two rowers were seated on each bench who plyed their oars on either side of the vessel To these we must add the captain or centurion who in time of action stood erect with his armour bearer on the poop two steersmen at the helm and two

of this salutary weight their armour was laid aside in light chariots which followed the march till on the approach of an enemy they re sumed with haste and reluctance the unusual encum brance Their offensive weapons consisted of swords battle axes and spears but the Macedonian pike was shortened a fourth of its length and reduced to the more convenient measure of twelve cubits or feet The

the appearance of the line but of whom only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords of the Barbarians The order of battle must have varied according to the ground the object and the adversary but their ordinary disposition in two lines and a reserve presented a succession of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as the judgment of the Greeks In case of a repulse the first line fell back into the intervals of the second and the reserve breaking into two divisions wheeled round the flanks to improve the victory or cover the retreat Whatever authority could enact was accom plished at least in theory by the camps and marches the exercises and evolutions the edicts and books of the Byzantine monarch Whatever art could pro duce from the forge the loom or the laboratory was abundantly supplied by the riches of the prince and the industry of his numerous workmen But neither authority nor art could frame the most important machine the soldier himself and if the ceremonies of Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the emperor his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a defeat and procrastinating the war

Mussulman people of Syria and Cilicia of Africa and Spain was awakened by the trumpet which proclaimed a holy war against the infidels The rich were ambitious of death or victory in the cause of God the poor were allured by the hopes of plunder and the old the infirm and the women assumed their share of meritorious service by sending their substitutes with arms and horses into the field These offensive and defensive arms were similar in strength and temper to those of the Romans whom they far excelled in the manage ment of the horse and the bow the massy silver of their belts their bridles

engagements by sea and land they sustained with patient firmness the fury of the attack and sel dom advanced to the charge till they could discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes But if they were repulsed and broken they knew not how to rally or renew the combat and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious prejudice that God had declared himself on the side of their enemies The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced this fearful opinion nor were there wanting among the Mahometans and Christians some obscure prophecies which prognosticated their alternate defeats The unity of the Arabian empire was dissolved but the independent fragments were equal to populous and powerful kingdoms and in their naval and military armaments an emir of Aleppo or Tunis might com mand no despicable fund of skill and industry and treasure In their transactions of peace and war with the Saracens the princes of Constantinople too often felt that these Barbarians had nothing bar barous in their discipline and that if they were destitute of original genius they had been endowed with a quick spirit of curiosity and imitation The model was indeed more perfect than the copy their ships

and the lords of each castle were com pelled to assume the character of princes and war riors To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the safety of their family the protection of their lands and the revenge of their injuries and like the conquerors of a larger size they were too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive war The powers of the mind and body were hardened by the presence of danger and necessity of resolution the same spirit refused to desert a friend and to for give an enemy and instead of sleeping under the guardian care of the magistrate they proudly dis

freedom and of arms was felt with tactics conscious pride by the Franks themselves and is observed by the Greeks with some degree of amaze ment and terror The Franks says the emperor Constantine are bold and valiant to the verge of temerity and their dauntless spirit is supported by the contempt of danger and death In the field and in close onset they press to the front and rush headlong against the enemy without deigning to compute either his numbers or their own Their ranks are formed by the firm con OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 497 of consanguinity and friendship and chap their martial deeds are prompted by the desire of saving or revenging their dearest companions In their eyes a retreat is a shameful flight and flight is indelible infamy A nation endowed with such high and intrepid spirit must have been secure of victory if these advantages had not been counterbalanced by many weighty defects The decay of their naval power left the Greeks and Saracens in possession of the sea for every purpose of annoyance and supply In the age which pre ceded the institution of knighthood the Franks were rude and unskilful in the service of cavalry and in all perilous emergencies their warriors were so conscious of their ignorance that they chose to dismount from their horses and fight on foot Un practised in the use of pikes or of missile weapons they were encumbered by the length of their swords the weight of their armour the magnitude of their shields and if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks by their unwieldy intemperance Their in dependent spirit disdained the yoke of
