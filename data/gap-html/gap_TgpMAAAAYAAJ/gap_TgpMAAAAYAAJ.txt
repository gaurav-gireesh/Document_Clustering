Scripture History has been established by a combination of evidence altogether incontrovertible This is the more remarkable and satisfactory as the Bible con tains not only the most ancient records but exclusively makes known to us the origin of all things and the transactions of those ages which will in vain be sought for elsewhere or found involved only in fable That however some difficulties should occur in perusing such venerable documents may easily and reasonably be conceived but they are not such as affect their authenticity or even weaken their evidence It is not impracticable to solve or remove most of them and the ob scurity which remains after the fruitless efforts of sober criticism may fairly be imputed to the want of information of which the distance of place and time has deprived us A re markable consistency and harmony characterises the historical parts of the Bible â delivered down to us as they have been in separate books and written by various inspired penmen the slightest comparison will serve to force upon our minds the conviction that they are genuine as far at least as veracity may be inferred from an agreement of the various branches of a subject Â There are different modes of ascertaining the integrity of the canon of scripture learned men have with great success performed this taskâ evidence to confirm the claim of the in spired writers to the characters they assume has been adduced and admitted Testimony of an external nature has likewise been brought forward to corroborate the general contents of the Bible or its particular parts and facts Tradition furnishes us with some proof though prudence requires a careful investigation of its documents and a cautious admission of them but however they may be exaggerated or obscured they must have had some foundation which if it can be traced will deserve attention from its correspondence to the great original In some instances it is so very remarkable and striking that the boldest scepticism cannot well refuse and discard its aid B voL I No I iv EDITOR S PREFACE But a still more important and useful guide in exploring the path of scripture history is the light shed upon it by the study of Jewish and Oriental Antiquities The subject is copious but amply repays the attention it demands Of course in the former branch of it Jewish writers deserve our primary notice because it may reasonably be presumed that they are bet ter acquainted with the affairs of their own nation than other persons They are accustomed indeed to blend in their accounts the mention of circumstances which judicious readers will not receive but this does not detract from the value of the sound information which they communicate Our business in this case is to separate the dross from the pure metal and while we reject the one to value the other Among the most ancient authentic and interesting authors of this denomination Josephus may certainly be placed His works have always been highly esteemed and were considered by the early Christian writers as pecu liarly valuable what he has recorded is in general harmonious with the scripture history though in some instances he either enlarges upon or deviates from it I shall endeavour therefore to ascertain the weight of his testimony and to shew in what degree of esteem he ought to be held This cannot be done with more accuracy and certainty than in the words of the learned Dr Lardner Jewish Testimonies chap iii and iv When Jotapata in which Josephus was shut up was besieged and taken by Vespasian strict search was made for him for if that general was once taken Vespasian reckoned that the greatest part of the war would be over However he had hid himself in a deep cavern the opening of which was not easily discerned above ground Here he met with forty per sons of eminence who had concealed themselves and had with them provisions enough for several days On the third day the Roman soldiers seized a woman that had been with them She made a discovery of the place where they were whereupon Vespasian sent two tribunes inviting him to come up with assurances that his life should be preserved Josephus how ever refused Vespasian therefore sent a third tribune named Nicanor well known to Josephus with the like assurance Josephus after some hesitation was then willing to sur render himself But the men who were with him exclaimed against it and were for killing him and themselves rather than come alive into the hands of the Romans Hereupon he made a long speech to them shewing that it was not lawful for them to kill themselves and that it was rather a proof of pusillanimity than courage but all without effect He then pro posed an expedient which was that they should cast lots two by two who should die first He who had the second lot should kill the first and the next him and so on and the last should kill himself It happened that Josephus and another were preserved to the last lot When all the rest were killed he without much difficulty persuaded that other person to yield up himself to the Romans So they two escaped with their lives This has been judged to be a remarkable providence by which Josephus was preserved to write the history of which we are now able to make so good a use Though the Jewish people never had any great respect for the writings of Josephus yet they have been much esteemed and often quoted by Christian and other writers in early and latter times The works of Josephus notwithstanding many things in them liable to exception which may be observed by careful and impartial readers are very valuable In his larger work the Jewish Antiquities he confirms the truth of the history of the Old Testament and as in several of the last books of that work he has brought down the Jewish history from the ceasing of pro EDITOR S PREFACE v phecy among them to the Twelfth of Nero he has let us know the state of affairs in Judea during the time of the Evangelical history and he had before done the like in the first two books of the Jewish War What he has therein said of Herod and his sons of the Roman governors in Judea the Jewish sects and their principles the manners of the Jewish people and likewise concerning the Samaritans greatly confirms and illustrates the history of our Evan gelists Dr W Wotton says of Josephus  He is certainly an author very justly to be valued not withstanding all his faults His history of the Jewish war is a noble demonstration of the truth of the Christian religion by shewing in the most lively manner how the prophecies of our blessed Lord concerning the destruction of Jerusalem were literally fulfilled in their fullest extent Preface to Miscellaneous Discourses relating to the Traditions and Usages of the Scribes and Pharisees p 49 In reference to the account Josephus gives of the destruction of Jerusalem Archbishop Tillotson says  We have this matter related not by a Christian who might be suspected of partiality and a design to have paralleled the event with our Saviour s prediction but by a Jew both by nation and religion who seems designedly to have avoided as much as possibly he could the very mention of the Christian name and all particulars relating to our Saviour though no historian was ever more punctual in other things Vol ii p 563 Serm 186 Similar to this is the testimony of M Tillemont God has been pleased to chuse for our information in this history not an apostle nor any of the chief men of the church but an ob stinate Jew whom neither the view of the virtue and miracles of the Christians nor the knowledge of the law nor the ruin of his religion and country could induce to believe in and love the Messiah who was all the expectation of the nation God has permitted it so to be that the testimony which this historian gave to an event of which he did not comprehend the mystery might not be rejected either by Jews or Heathens and that none might be able to say that he had altered the truth of things to favour Jesus Christ and his disciples Ruine des Juifs Art I p 722 Dr Doddridge in his notes on Matt xxiv says Â Christian writers have always with great reason represented Josephus s History of the Jewish War as the best commentary upon this chapter And many have justly remarked it as a wonderful instance of the care of Providence for the Christian church that he an eye witness and in these things of so great credit should especially in so extraordinary a manner be preserved to transmit to us a collection of im portant facts which so exactly illustrate this noble prophecy in almost every particular cir cumstance Isidore of Pelusium who flourished about the year 412 in one of his epistles has these expressions if you have a mind to know what punishment the wicked Jews underwent who ill treated the Christ read the history of their destruction written by Josephus a Jew in deed but a lover of truth that you may see the wonderful story such as no time ever saw before since the beginning of the world nor ever shall see For that none might refuse to give credit to the history of their incredible and unparalleled sufferings truth found out not a stranger but a native and a man fond of their institutions to relate them in a doleful strain Eusebius often quotes Josephus and in his Ecclesiastical History has transcribed from him several articles at large Having rehearsed from the gospels divers of our Lord s pre yi EDITOR S PREFACE dictions of the evils then Coming upon Jerusalem and the Jewish people he adds  Who soever shall compare these words of our Saviour with the history of the whole war published by the above mentioned writer must admire our Lord s great wisdom and acknowledge that his foresight was divine In his Chronicle as we have it from Jerom in Latin Eusebius says In subduing Judea and overthrowing Jerusalem Titus slew six hundred thousand people but Josephus writes that eleven hundred thousand perished by famine and the sword and that another hundred thousand were publicly sold and carried captives and he says that the occasion of there being so great a multitude of people at Jerusalem was this that it was the time of the Pass over for which reason the Jews having come up from all parts to worship at the temple were shut up in the city as in a prison And indeed it was fit they should be slain at the same time in which they crucified our Saviour The following general character of Josephus from the pen of Dr Lardner concludes his observations on his works Josephus was a man of great eminence and distinction among his people but we do not observe in him a seriousness of spirit becoming a Christian nor that sublimity of virtue which is suited to the principles of the Christian religion Nor do we dis cern in him such qualities as should induce us to think he was one of those who were well disposed and were not far from the kingdom of God Matt xii 34 He was a priest by descent and early in the magistracy then a general and a courtier and in all shewing a worldly mind suited to such stations and employments insomuch that he appears to be one of those of whom and to whom the best judge of men and things said how can ye be lieve who receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from God only John v 24 The utility of the works of Josephus as a companion to the Sacred History must now be ob vious A careful perusal of them cannot fail to illustrate and corroborate many facts of the inspired volume On this principle they are strongly recommended to the attention of the religious public In the present edition the translation of Mr Whiston is retained as the most valuable which has yet appeared The notes also which he originally added to explain his author are here preserved But as room remained for farther explanation than he has given a considerable body of information is added in a selection of notes by the Editor which are distinguished from those of the translator by the letter B at the close of each It is hoped theretore on the whole that this edition of the Genuine works of Josephus will be an acceptable and useful work and contribute to the enlargement of knowledge on subjects which are connected with the dispensations of religion and the interest of the visible church of God upon earth SAMUEL BURDER London October 1 1811  THE AUTHOR S PREFACE THOSE who undertake to write histories do not I perceive take that trouble on one and the same account but for many and various reasons For some apply themselves to this part of learning to shew their great skill in composition and that they may therein acquire a reputation Others write histories in order to gratify those who happen to be concerned in them and on that account spare no pains but rather exceed their own abilities in the performance But there are others who of necessity are driven to write history be cause they were concerned in the facts and so cannot excuse themselves from committing them to writing for the advantage of posterity Nay there are not a few who are induced to draw their historical facts out of darkness into light and to produce them for the benefit of the public on account of the great importance of the facts themselves with which they had been concerned Now of these several reasons for writing history I must profess the two last were my own For since I was myself interested in that war which we Jews had with the Romans and knew myself its particular actions and conclusion I was forced to give the history of it because I saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings Now I have undertaken the present work as thinking it will appear to all the Greeksf worthy of their study for it will contain all our antiquities and the constitution of our government as interpreted out of the Hebrew J scriptures And indeed I did formerly intend when IÂ wrote of the war to explain who the Jews originally were what fortunes they had been subject to and by what legislator they had been instructed in piety and the exer cise of other virtue what wars they also had made in remote ages till they were unwillingly engaged in this last with the Romans But because this work would take up a great compass  This preface of Josephus s is excellent in its kind and highly worthy the repeated perusal of the reader before he set about the perusal of the work itself t That is all the Gentiles both Greeks and Romans X Josephus never followed the Septuagint nor any other Greek version in these his Antiquities or other works but only the Hebrew original and this so punctually through all his known writings as to make use of none of the sacred books but those that were written in Hebrew and belonging to the Jerusalem catalogue Â Josephus wrote his seven books of the Jewish War long before he wrote his Antiquities Those books of the War were published about A D 75 and these Antiquities A D 93 about eighteen years later See Fabriciui apud Havercamp page 58 59 voL I â No I C viii AUTHOR S PREFACE I formed it into a distinct treatise with a beginning of its own and its own conclusion But in process of time as usually happens to such as undertake great things I grew weary and went on slowly it being a large subject and a difficult thing to translate our history into a foreign and to us unaccustomed language However there were some persons who desired to know our history and exhorted me to go on with it and above all the rest Epaphroditus a man who is a lover of all kinds of learning but is principally delighted with the knowledge of history and this on account of his having been himself concerned in great affairs and many turns of fortune and having shewn a wonderful vigour of an excellent nature and an immoveably virtuous resolution in them all I yielded to this man s persuasions who always excites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable to join their endeavours with his I was also ashamed to permit any indolence of disposition to have a greater influence upon me than the delight of taking pains in such studies as were very useful I therefore stirred up myself and went on with my work more cheerfully Besides the foregoing motives I had others which I greatly reflected on and these were that our forefathers were willing to communicate such things to others and that some of the Greeks took con siderable pains to learn the affairs of our nation I found therefore that the second of the Ptolemies was a king who was extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning and the collection of books that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a translation of our law and of the constitution of our government therein contained into the Greek tongue Now Eleazar the high priest one not inferior to any other of that dignity among us did not envy the king the participation of that ad vantage which otherwise he would certainly have denied him but that he knew the custom of our nation was to hinder nothing of what we esteemed ourselves from being communi cated to others Accordingly I thought it became me both to imitate the generosity of our high priest and to suppose there might even now be many lovers of learning like the king For he did not obtain all our writings at that time but those who were sent to Alexandria as interpreters gave him only the books of the law While there were a vast number of other matters in our sacred books They indeed containt the history of five thousand years In which time happened many strange accidents many chances of war and great actions of the commanders and mutations of the form of our government Upon the whole a man that will peruse this history may principally learn from it that all events succeed well even to an incredible degree and the reward of felicity is proposed by God but then it is to those that follow his will and do not venture to break his excellent laws and that so far as men any way apostatize from the accurate observation of them J what was practicable before becomes impracticable and whatsoever they set about as a good thing is converted into an incurable calamity And now I exhort all those that peruse  Tins Epaphroditus was certainly alive in the third year of Trajan A D 100 Who he was we do not know Tor as to Epaphroditus the freed man of Nero Tacit Annal XV 55 Nero s and afterwards Domitian s secretary who was put to death by Domitian in the fourteenth or fifteenth year of his reign he could not be alive in the third of Trajan t That Josephus s chronology agreed neither with the Masorete Hebrew nor with the present Septuagint but almost always with that of the Samaritan Pentateuch and contained not less than 5000 years See Essays on the Old Testa ment page 195 203 which is here recommended by Fabricius to the consideration of the reader ap Havercamp page 59 J Josephus here plainly alludes to the famous Greek proverb Â sS wfÂ fov1 zsav cw opov vsi ov If God be with us every thing that is impossible becomes possible AUTHOR S PREFACE k these books to apply their minds to God and to examine the mind of our legislator whether he hath not understood his nature in a manner worthy of him and hath not ever ascribed to him such operations as become his power and hath not preserved his writings from those indecent fables which others have framed although by the great distance of time when he lived he might have securely forged such falsehoods For he lived  two thousand years ago At which vast distance of ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy as to fix even the generations of their gods much less the actions of their men or their own laws As I proceed therefore I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records in the order of time that belongs to them For I have already promised so to do throughout this undertaking and this without adding any thing to what is therein contained or taking away any thing therefrom But because almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of Moses our legislator I I cannot avoid the saying somewhat concerning him before hand though I shall do it briefly I mean because otherwise those that read my books may wonder how it comes to pass that my discourse which promises an account of laws and historical facts contains so much of philosophy The reader is therefore to know that Moses deemed it exceedingly necessary that he who would conduct his own life well and give laws to others in the first place should consider the divine nature and upon the contemplation of God s operations should thereby imitate the best of all patterns so far as it is possible for human nature to do and to en deavour to follow after it neither could the legislator himself have a right mind without such a contemplation nor would any thing he should write tend to the promotion of virtue in his readers I mean unless he be taught first of all that God is the father and lord of all things and sees all things and that thence he bestows a happy life upon those that follow him but plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable miseries Now when Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his countrymen he did not begin the establishment of his laws after the same manner that other legislators did I mean upon contracts and other rights between one man and another but by raising their minds up wards to regard God and his creation of the world and by persuading them that men are the most excellent of the creatures of God upon earth Now when once he had brought them to submit to religion he easily persuaded them to submit in all other things For as to other legislators they followed fables and by their discourses transferred the most reproach ful of human vices unto the gods and so afforded wicked men the most plausible excuses for their crimes But as for our legislator when he had once demonstrated that God was possessed of perfect virtue he supposed that men also ought to strive after the participation of it And on those who did not so think and so believe he inflicted the severest punishment I therefore exhort my readers to examine the whole of this undertaking in that view for thereby it will appear to them that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the majesty of God or to his love to mankind For all things have here a reference to the  Of Josephus s chronology both here and hereafter the reader is not to expect much account in these Notes However he is to observe that though the numbers at the beginning of every book are translations from the last editions of Josephus and so imperfect yet all those in the margin are my own numbers as they are more perfectly discovered and stated in the chronology and my chronological table published A D 1721 Josephus often corrected his own chronology and for want of Ptolemy s Canon and of the knowledge of the years of Jubilee which are sure guides to me in this matter was often mistaken  I choose rather to give the reader in the margin the true chronology than to perplex him with such an one as we know to be often very erroneous x AUTHOR S PREFACE nature of the universe while our legislator speaks some things wisely but enigmatically and others under a decent allegory but still explains such things as require a direct ex plication plainly and expressly However those who have a mind to know the reasons of every thing may find here a very curious philosophical theory which I now indeed shall wave the explication of but if God afford me time for it I will set about writing it after I have finished the present work I shall now betake myself to the history before me after I have first mentioned what Moses says of the creation of the world which I find described in the sacred books after the manner following â  As to this intended work of Josephus s concerning the reasons of many of the Jewish laws and what philoso phical or allegorical sense they would bear the loss of which work is by some of the learned not much regretted I am inclinable in part to Fabricius s opinion ap Havercamp page 63 64 that  We need not doubt but among some vain and frigid conjectures derived from Jewish imaginations Josephus would have taught us a great number of excellent and useful things  which perhaps nobody neither among the Jews nor among the Christians can now inform as of THE ANTIQUITIES OF sEnra Â B1 B BOOK I Containing an interval of 3833 Years from the Creation to the Death of Isaac CHAP I  OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WORLD AND THE DISPOSITION OF THE ELEMENTS IN the beginning God created the heaven and the earth f But when the earth did not come into sight but was covered with thick darkness and a wind moved upon its surface God commanded that there should be light and when that was made he consi dered the whole mass and separated the light and the darkness and the name he gave to one was night and the other he called day and he named the beginning of light and the time of rest the evening and the morning And this was indeed the first day But Moses said it was one day J the cause of which I am able to give even now but because I have promised to give such reasons for all things in a treatise by itself I shall put off its expo sition till that time After this on the second day he placed the heaven over the whole world and separated it from the other parts and he determined it should stand by itself He also placed a crystalline firmament round  Note that this and the other titles of chapters are wanting in the best MSS  t See Gen i 1 et sequel  One is put for the first not only here in the Hebrew and Numb xxix 1 Dan ix 1 but elsewhere in Josephus voL I No I it and put it together in a manner agreeable to the earth and fitted it for giving moisture and rain and for affording the advantage of dews On the third day he appointed the dry land to appear with the sea round about it and on the same day he made the plants and the seeds to spring out of the earth On the fourth day he adorned the heaven with the sun the moon and the stars and appointed them their motions and courses that the vicis situdes of the seasons might be clearly signi fied And on the fifth day he produced the living creatures both those that swim and those that fly the former in the sea the lat ter in the air He also sorted them as to so ciety and that their kinds might increase and multiply On the sixth day he created the four rooted beasts and made them male and female On the same day he also formed man Accordingly Moses says that in six days the world and all that is therein was made and that the seventh day was a rest and a release from the labour of such operations whence it is that we celebrate a rest from our labours on that day and call it the Sabbath which word denotes rest in the Hebrew tongue VIII 5 XVIII 4 and in the Greek Matt xxvin 1 John xx 19 1 1 Cor xvi 2 as Ainsworth observes on this text It is also in Philo and among the Egyptians and Chaldeans and even in Diodorus Siculus D 12 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Moreover Moses after the seventh day was over begins to talk philosophically and con cerning the formation of man says thus that God took dust from the ground f and formed man J a d inserted in him a spirit and a soul This man was called Adam which in the He brew tongue signified one that is red because he was formed out of red earth compounded together for of that kind is virgin and true earth God also presented the living crea tures when he had made them according to their kinds both male and female to Adam and gave them those names by which they are still called But when he saw that Adam had no female companion no society for there was no such created and that he wondered at the other animals which were male and fe male he laid him asleep and took away one of his ribs and out of it formed the woman Â whereupon Adam knew her when she was brought to him and acknowledged that she was made out of himself Now a woman is called in the Hebrew tongue Issa but the name of this woman was Eve which signifies the mother of all living Moses says farther that God planted a pa radise in the east flourishing with all sorts of trees and that among them was the tree of life and another of knowledge whereby was to be known what was good and evil and that when he had brought Adam and his wife into this garden he commanded them to take care of the plants Now the garden was wa tered by one river which ran round about the whole earth and was parted into Pur parts Phison which denotes a multitude l running into India makes its exit into the sea and is by the Greeks called Ganges Eu phrates also as well as Tigris goes down into the Red Sea ff Now the name Euphrates or Phrath denotes either a dispersion or a flower by Tigris or Diglath is signified what is swift with narrowness and Geon runs through Egypt and denotes what arises from the East which the Greeks call Nile God therefore commanded that Adam and his wife should eat of all the rest of the plants but to abstain from the tree of knowledge and foretold to them that if they toucjied it it would prove their destruction But while all  Since Josephns in his preface says that Moses wrote some things enigmatically some allegorically and the rest in plain words since in his account of the first chapter of Genesis and the three first verses of the second he gives us no hints of any mystery at all but when he comes to ver 4 c he says that Moses after the seventh day was over began to talk philosophically it is not improbable that he understood the rest of the second and the third chapters in some enigmatical allegorical or philosophical sense The change of the name of God just at this place from Elohim to Jehovah Elohim from God to Lord God in the Hebrew Samaritan and Septuagint also seems to favour some such change in the narration or construc tion t Gen ii 7 j Josephus supposed man to be compounded of Spirit soul and body with St Paul 1 Thess v 23 and the rest of the ancients He elsewhere says also that the blood of animals was forbidden to be eaten as having in it soul and spirit Â Gen ii 22 II The place wherein the country of Eden as mentioned by Moses seems most like to be situated is Chaldea not far from the banks of the Euphrates To this purpose when we find Rabshekah vaunting his master s actions have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fa thers luive destroyed as Gazan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden which were in Telassar As Te lassar in general signifies any garrison or fortification so here more particularly it denotes that strong fort which the children of Eden built in an island of the Euphrates towards the west of Babylon as a barrier against the in cursions of the Assyrians on that side And therefore in all probability the country of Eden lay on the west side or rather on both sides the Euphrates after its conjunction with the Tigris a little below the place where in process of time the famous city of Babylon came to be built Thus we have found out a country called Eden which for its pleasure and fruitfulness as all authors agree answers the character which Moses gives of it Herodotus who was an eye witness of it tells us that where Euphrates runs out into Tigris not far from the place where Ninus is seated that region is of all that ever he saw the most ex cellent  so fruitful in bringing forth corn that it yields two hundred fold and so plenteous in grass that the people are forced to drive their cattle from pasture lest they should surfeit themselves B  Whence this strange notion came which is not pe culiar to Josephus but Dr Hudson says is derived from elder authors as if four of the greatest rivers in the world running two of them at vast distances from he other two by some means or other watered Paradise is hare to say Only since Josephus has already appeared to allegorize this history and takes notice that these four names had a particular signification Phison for Ganges a multitude Phrath for Euphrates either a dispersion or a flower Diglath for Tigris what is swift with narrowness and Geon for Nile what arises from the east we perhaps mistake him when we suppose he literally means those four rivers especially as to Geon or Nile which arises from the east while he very well knew the literal Nile arises from the south though what farther allegorical sense he had in view is now I fear impossible to be determined tt By the Red Sea is not here meant the Arabian Gulf which alone we now call by that name but all that South Sea which included the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf as far as the East Indies as Reland and Hudson truly note from the old geographers an 4484 13 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the living creatures had one language Â at that time the serpent which then lived to gether with Adam and his wife shewed an en vious disposition at his supposal of their living happily and in obedience to the commands of God and imagining that when they dis obeyed they would fall into calamities he per suaded the woman out of a malicious inten tion to taste of the tree of knowledge tell ing them that in that tree was the knowledge of good and evil which knowledge when they should obtain they would lead a happy life nay a life not inferior to that of a god Â by which means he overcame the woman and Sersuaded her to despise the command of rod Now when she had tasted of that tree and was pleased with its fruit she persuaded Adam to make use of it also Upon this they perceived that they were become nakedJ to one another and being ashamed thus to ap pear abroad they invented somewhat to co ver them for the fruit sharpened their under standing and they covered themselves with fig leaves and tying these before them out of modesty they thought they were happier than they were before as they hadclis covered what they were in want of But when God came into the garden Adam who was wont before to come and converse with him being conscious of his wicked behaviour went out of the way This behaviour sur prised God and he asked what was the cause of his procedure and why he that be fore delighted in that conversation did now fly from and avoid it When he made no reply as conscious to himself that he had transgressed the command of God God said I had before determined about you both how you might lead a happy life without any affliction care or vexation of soul and that all things which might contribute to your en joyment and pleasure should grow up by my providence of their own accord without your labour and pains taking which state of labour would soon bring on old age and death would not be at any remote distance But now thou hast abused my good will and hast disobeyed my commands for thy silence is not the sign ot thy virtue but of thy evil conscience However Adam excused his sin and intreated God not to be angry with him and laid the blame of what was done upon his wife and said that he was deceived by her and thence became an offender while she again accused the serpent But God allotted him punish ment because he weakly submitted to the counsel of his wife and said the ground should not henceforth yield its fruits of its own accord but that when it should be harassed by their labour it would bring forth some of its fruits and refuse to bring forth others He also made Eve liable to the inconveniency of breeding and the sharp pains of bringing forth children  and this because she persuad ed Adam with the same arguments where with the serpent had persuaded her and had thereby brought him into a calamitous condi tion He also deprived the serpent of speech out of indignation at his malicious disposition towards Adam Besides this he inserted poi son under his tongue and made him an enemy to men and suggested to them that they should direct their strokes against his head that being the place wherein lay his mischiev  Hence it appears that Josephus thought several at least of the brute animals particularly the serpent could speak before the fall and I think few of the more perfect kinds of those animals want the organs of speech at this day Many inducements there are also to a notion that the present state they are in is not their original state and that their capacities have been once much greater than we now see them t Gen iii 5 J Those who take the word naked in a literal sense sup pose that upon the fall the air and other elements imme diately became intemperate and disorderly so that our first parents soon knew or felt that they were naked be cause the sun scorched them they became wet with the rain and the cold pierced them Others take the expres sion in a figurative sense to denote the commission of such sins as man in his senses may well be ashamed of To this purpose they have observed that when Moses re turned from the Mount and found that the people had made and consecrated a golden image the expression in scripture is the people were naked they were be come vile and reprobate sinners for so the word yufjwos signifies in the New Testament Rev xvi 15 for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies Exod xxxii 25 See Nicholas conference vol LB II Our first parents were conscious of the approach of God to them in the garden by the voice which they heard as usual from the divine presence The word voice may be rendered noise and since God s usual way of noti fying his presence afterwards was either by a still small voice or noise 1 Kings xix 12 or by a noise like that oj great waters Ezek i 24 or like the rustling of wind in the trees 2 Sam v 24 we may reasonably suppose that it was either a soft gentle noise like a breeze of wind among the trees of Paradise or a louder one like the mur muring of some large river which gave Adam notice of God s approach B Ik book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ous designs towards men and it being easiest to take vengeance of him that way and when he had deprived him of the use of his Jget he made him to go rolling along and dragging himself upon the ground and when God had appointed these penalties for them he re moved Adam and Eve out of

signifies a possession The younger was Abel which signifies sorrow They also hadjlaughters Now the two bre thren were pleased with different courses of life for Abel the brother was a lover of righteousness and believing that GocTwas present at all his actions he excelled in vir tue and his employment was that of a shep herd But Cain was not only very wicked in other respects but was wholly intent upon getting and he first contrived to plough the ground He slew his brother on the following occasion â they had resolved to sacrifice to God now Cain brought the fruits of the earth and of his husbandry but Abel brought milk and the first fruits of his flocks But GodJ was more delighted with the latter oblation when he was honoured with what grew natu rally of its own accord than he was with what was the invention of a covetous man and got ten by forcing the ground Cain therefore was very angry that Abel was preferred by God before him and he slew his brother and hid his dead body thinking to escape dis covery But God knowing what had been done came to Cain and asked him What was be come of his brother because he had not seen him many days whereas he used to observe them conversing together at other times But Cain was in doubt with himself and knew not what answer to give to God At first he said that he was himself at a loss about his bro ther s disappearing but when he was pro j voked by God who pressed him vehemently as resolving to know what the matter was he replied He was not his brother s guardian or keeper nor was he an observer of what he did But in return God convicted Cain as having been the murderer of his brother and said  I wonder at thee that thou knowest not what is become of a man whom thou thy self has destroyed God however did not inflict the punishment of death upon him on account of his offering sacrifice and thereby making supplication to him not to be extreme in his wrath to him but he made him ac cursed and threatened his posterity in the seventh generation He also cast him together with his wife out of that land and when he was afraid that in wandering about he should fall among wild beasts and by that means perish God told him not to entertain such a melancholy suspicion but to go over all the earth without fear of what mischief he might suffer from wild beasts and setting a mark upon him that he might be known he com manded him to depart Â When Cain had travelled over many coun tries he with his wife built a city named Nod which is a place so called and there  Gen iii 23 t Gen iv et sequel J St John s account of the reason why God accepted the sacrifice of Abel and rejected that of Cain as also why Cain slew Abel on account of his acceptance with God is much better than this of Josephus I mean be cause  Cain was of the evil one and slew his brother And wherefore slew he him Because his own works were evil and his brother s righteous 1 John iii 22 Josephus s reasons seems to be no better than a Phari saical notion or tradition  The punishment of Cain was doubtless a severe one but not more so than his aggravated guilt demanded Re ferring to it Moses represents him as saying My punish ment is greater than I can bear Gen iv 13 but as the Hebrew words signifies iniquity rather than punishment and the verb signifies to be forgiven as well as to bear it seems to agree better with the context to render the verse positively my iniquity is too great to be forgiven or by way of interrogation is my iniquity too great to be for given A learned annotator has observed that as there are seven abominations in the heart of him that loveth not his brother Prov xxvi 25 there were the like number of transgressions in Cain s conduct 1 He sacrificed with out faith 2 He was displeased that God respected him not 3 He hearkened not to God s admonition 4 He spake dissemblingly to his brother 5 He killed him in the field 6 He denied that he knew where he was 7 He neither hoped or asked for mercy from God but despaired and so fell into the condemnation of the devil Jiinsworth s Jlnnot B Â Of this punishment of Cain in the seventh generation and of the punishment of Lamech in the seventy

JEWS he settled his abode where he also had children However he did not accept of his punishment in order to amendment but to in crease his wickedness for he only aimed to procure every thing that was for his own bodily pleasure though it obliged him to be injurious to his neighbours He augmented his household substance with much wealth by ra pine and violence he excited his acquaint ance to procure pleasure and spoils by rob bery and became a great leader of men into wicked courses He also introduced a change in that way of simplicity wherein men lived before and was the author of measures and weights And whereas they lived innocently and generously while they knew nothing of such arts he changed the world into cunning and craftiness He first of all set boundaries about lands he built a city and fortified it with walls and he compelled his family to come together to it and called that city Enoch after the name of his eldest son Now Jared was the son of Enoch whose son was Malaliel whose son was Mathusela whose son was Lamech who had seventy seven children by two wives Silla and Ada Of those chil dren by Ada one was Jubal he erected tents and loved the life of a shepherd But Jubal who was born of the same mother with him exercised himself in music f and invented the psaltery and the harp Tubal one of his children by the other wife exceeded all men in strength and was very expert and famous in martial performances he procured what tended to the pleasures of the body by that method and first invented the art of making brass Lamech also was the father of a daugh ter whose name was Naamah And because he was so skilful in matters of divine revela tion that he knew he was to be punished for Cain s murder of his brother he made that known to his wives Nay even while Adam  Gen iv 17 t From this Jubal not improbably came Jobel the trumpet of Jobel or Jubilee that large and loud musical instrument used in proclaiming the liberty at the Year of Jubilee J The number of Adam s children as says the old tra dition was thirty three sons and twenty three daughters II What is here said of Seth and his posterity that they were very good and virtuous and at the same time very happy without any considerable misfortunes for seven ge nerations is exactly agreeable to the state of the world and the conduct of Providence in all the first ages Â Of Josephus s mistake here when h took Seth the TOL I â No 2 was alive the posterity of Cain became ex ceeding wicked every one successively dy ing one after another more wicked than the former They were intolerable in war and vehement in robberies and if any one were slow to murder people yet was he bold in his profligate behaviour in acting unjustly and doing injuries for gain Now Adam who was the first man and made out of the earth for our discourse must now be about him after Abel was slain and Cain fled away on account of his murder was solicitous for posterity and had a vehement desire for children he being two hundred and thirty years old after which time he livecL other seven hundred and then died He haer indeed J many other children but Seth in particular As for the rest it would be tedious to name them I will therefore only endea vour to give an account of those that pro ceeded from Seth Now this Seth when he was brought up and came to those years in which he could discern what was good be came a virtuous man and as he was himself of an excellent character so did he leave  children behind him who imitated his virtues All these proved to be of good dispositions they also inhabited the same country without dissensions and in happy condition without any misfortunes falling upon them till they died They also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies and their order And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known upon Adam s prediction that the world was to be  destroyed at one time by the force of fire f and at another time by the violence and quantity of water they made two pillars Â the one of brick the other of stone they in scribed their discoveries on them both that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed son of Adam for Seth or Sesostris King of Egypt the erector of these pillars in the land of Siriad see Essay ori the Old Testament Appendix page 159â 160 Although the main of this relation might be true and Adam might foretel a conflagration and a deluge which all antiquity wit nesses to be an ancient tradition and Seth s posterity might engrave their inventions in astronomy on two such pillars yet it is no way credible that they could survive the deluge which buried all such pillars and edifices far under ground in the sediment of its waters especially since the like pillars of the Egyptian Seth or Sesostris were extant after the flood in the land of Siriad and perhaps in the days of Josephua also E H 16 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS by the flood the pillar of stone might remain and exhibit those discoveries to mankind and also inform them that there was another pillar of brick erected by them Now this remains in the land of Siriad to this day CHAP III or the deluge noah s preservation is an ark and HIS SUBSEQUENT DEBARKATION AND DEATH THE posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the universe and to have an entire regard to virtue for seven ge nerations but in process of time they were perverted and forsook the practices of their forefathers and did neither pay those honours to God which were appointed them nor had they any concern to justice towards men But for what degree of zeal they had formerly evinced for virtue they now shewed by their actions a double degree of wickedness whereby they made God to be their enemy For many angels of Godf accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust and despisers oi all that was good on account of the confidence they had in their own strength for the tradition is that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians call giants But Noah was very uneasy at what they did and being dis pleased at their conduct persuaded them to change their dispositions and their actions for the better But seeing they did not yield to him but were slaves to their wicked plea sures he was afraid they would kill him to gether with his wife and children and those they had married so he departed out of that land Now God loved this man for his righteous ness yet he not only condemned those other men ibr their wickedness but determined to destroy the whole race of mankind and to make another race that should be pure from wickedness and cutting short their lives and making their years not so many as they for merly enjoyed but one hundred and twentyJ only he turned the dry land into sea And thus were all these men destroyed But Noah alone was saved for God suggested to him the following contrivance and way of escape â That he should make an ark of four stories high three hundred cubits long fifty cubits broad and thirty cubits high S Accordingly he entered into that ark with his wife and his sons and their wives and put into it not only provisions to support their wants there but also sent in with the rest all sorts of living creatures the male and his female for the preservation of their kinds and others of them by sevens Now this ark had firm walls and a roof and was braced with cross beams so that it could not be any way drowned or overturned by the violence of the water thus was Noah with his family preserved Now he was the tenth from Adam as being the son of Lamech whose father was Methusela he was the son of Enoch the son of Jared and Jared was the son of Ma laleel who with many of his sisters were the children of Cain the son of Enos now Enos was the son of Seth the son of Adam  This notion that the fallen angels were in some sense the fathers of the old giants was the constant opinion of antiquity t Gen vi 4 J Josephus here supposes that the life of these giants for of them only do I understand him was now reduced to one hundred and twenty years for as to the rest of mankind Josephus himself confesses their lives were much longer than one hundred and twenty years for many generations after the flood as we shall see presently and Ee says they were gradually shortened till the days of Mo ses and then fixed for some time at one hundred and twenty Nor indeed need we suppose that either Enoch or Jose phus meant to interpret these one hundred and twenty years for the life of men before the flood to be different from the one hundred and twenty years of God s patience perhaps while the Ark was preparing till the deluge which I take to be the meaning of God when he threatened this wicked world that if they so long continued impenitent their days should be no more than one hundred and twenty years  A cubit is about twenty one English inches Â The timber of which the Ark was framed Moses calls Gopher wood but what tree this Gopher was is not a little controverted Some will have it to be the cedar others the pine others the box and others particularly the Ma hometans the Indian plane tree But our learned Fuller in his miscellanies has observed that it was nothing else but that which the Greeks call Kwapitftfog or the cypress tree for taking away the termination cupar andgopher dif fer very little in the sound This observation the great Bochart has confirmed and shown very plainly that no country abounds so much with this wood as that part of Assyria which lies about Babylon To this we may add the observation of Theophrastus who speaking of trees that are least subject to decay makes the cypress the most dura ble for which Bitruvius gives this reason that the sap which is in every part of the wood has a peculiarly bitter taste and is so very offensive that no worm or other corro ding animal will touch it so that such things as are made of this wood will in a manner last for ever Universal Hist B  Gen vii 2 an 2992 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS This calamity happened in the six hun dreth year of Noah s government or age in the second month called by the Macedo nians Dius but by the Hebrews Marhesvan for so did they order their year in Egypt But Moses appointed that Nisan which is the same with Xanthicus should be the first month so that this month began the year as to all the solemnities they observed in honour of God although he preserved the original order of the months as to buying and selling and other ordinary affairs Now he says that this flood began on the seventeenth day of the before mentioned month and this was one thousand five hundred and fifty six years from Adam the first man and the time is written down in our sacred books thosef who then lived having noted down with great accuracy both the births and deaths of illus trious men For indeed Seth was born when Adam was in his two hundred and thirtieth year who lived nine hundred and thirty years Seth begat Enoch in his two hundred and fifth year who when he had lived nine hundred and twelve years delivered the government to Cain his son whom he had at his hundred and ninetieth year He lived nine hundred and five years Cain when he had lived nine hundred and ten years had his son Malaleel who was born in his hundred and seventieth year This Malaleel having lived eight hun dred and ninety five years died leaving his son Jared whom he begat when he was at his hundred and sixty fifth year He lived nine hundred and sixty two years and then his son Enoch succeeded him who was born when his father was one hundred and sixty two years old Now he when he lived three hundred and sixty five years departed and went to God Whence it is that they have not written down his death Now Mathusela the son of Enoch who was born to him when he was one hundred and sixty five years old had Lamech for his son when he was one hundred and eighty seven years of age to whom he delivered the government when he had retained it nine hundred and sixty nine years Now Lamech when he had governed seven hundred and seventy seven years ap pointed Noah his son to be ruler of the peo ple who was born to Lamech when he was one hundred and eighty two years old and retained the government nine hundred and fifty years These years collected together make up the sum before set down But let no one inquire into the deaths of these men for they extended their lives all along together with their children and grandchil dren but let him have regard to their births When God gave the signal and it began to rain the water poured down forty intire days till it became fifteen cubitsJ higher than the earth which was the reason why there were no greater number preserved since they had no place to fly to When the rain ceased the water did but just begin to abate after one hundred and fifty days that is on the seven teenth day of the seventh month After this the Ark rested on the top of a certain moun tain in Armenia which when Noah under stood he opened it and seeing a small piece of land about it he continued quiet and con ceived some hopes of deliverance But a few days afterward when the water was decreased to a greater degree he sent out a raven as desirous to learn whether any other part of the earth was left dry by the water and whe ther he might go out of the Ark with safety but the raven finding all the land still over flowed returned to Noah again But after seven days Ee sent out a dove to know the state of the ground which came back to him covered with mud and bringing an olive branch Hereby Noah learned that the earth was become clear of the flood So after he had stayed seven more days he sent the living creatures out of the Ark and both he and his family went out when he also sacrificed  Josephus here truly determines that the year at the flood began about the Autumnal Equinox As to what day of the month the flood began our Hebrew and Samaritan and perhaps Josephus s own copy more rightly placed it on the 17th day instead of the 27th as here for Josephus agrees with them as to the distance of one hundred and fifty days to the 17th day of the Beventh month as Gen vii ult with vin 3 t Josephus here takes notice that these ancient gene alogies were first set down by those that then lived and from them were transmitted down to posterity which I suppose to be the true account of that matter for there is no reason to imagine that men were not taught to read and write soon after they were taught to speak and perhaps all by the Messiah himself who under the father was the creator or governor of mankind and who frequently in those early days appeared to them X Gen vii 20 18 boor I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to God and feasted with his companions However the Armenians call this place A oâ a7 ov t the place of descent for the Ark being saved in that place its remains are shewed by the inhabitants of this day Now all the writers of profane history make f mention of this flood and of this ark among whom is Berosus the Chaldean for when he was describing the circumstances of the flood he goes on thus It is said there is still some part of the ship in Armenia at the mountain of the Cor jj dyeeans and that some people carry off pieces of the bitumen which they take away and use chiefly as amulets for the averting of mischiefs Hieronymus the Egyptian also who wrote the Phoenician Antiquities and Manaseas and many more make mention of the same Nay Nicolaus of Damascus in his ninety sixth Book hath a particular rela tion about them where he speaks thus There is a great mountain in Armenia over Minyas called Baris upon which it is reported that many who fled at the time of the deluge were saved and that one who was carried in an ark came on shore upon the top of it and that the remains of the timber were a great while preserved this might be the man about whom Moses the legislator of the Jews wrote But as for Noah he was afraid since God had determined to destroy mankind lest he should drown the earth every year So he offered burnt offerings and besought God that nature might hereafter go on in its former orderly course and that he would not bring on so great a judgment any more by which the whole race of creatures might be in dan ger of destruction but that having now punished the wicked he would of his good ness spare the remainder and such as he had hitherto judged fit to be delivered from so severe a calamity for that otherwise these last must be more miserable than the first and that they must be condemned to a worse con dition than the others unless they be suffered  Gen viii 20 t This place of descent is the proper interpretation of the Armenian name of this city It is called in Ptolemy Naxuana and by Moses Chorenensis the Armenian His torian Idsheuan but at the place itself Nichidsheuan which signifies the first place of descent and is a lasting monument of the preservation of Noah in the Ark upon the top of that Mountain at whose foot it was built as the to escape entirely that as if they be reserved for another deluge while they must be af flicted with the terror and the sight of the deluge and must also be destroyed by a second He also intreated God to accept of his sacrifice and to grant that the earth might never again undergo the like effects of his wrath that men might be permitted to go on cheerfully in cultivating the same to build cities and live happily in them and that they might not be deprived of any of those good things which they enjoyed before the flood but might attain to the old age which the ancient people had arrived at be fore When Noah had made these supplications God who loved the man for his righteousness granted his prayers and said that it was not he who brought the destruction on a pol luted world but that they underwent that vengeance on account of their own wicked ness and that he had not brought men into the world if he had himself determined to de stroy them it being an instance of greater wisdom not to have granted them life at all than after it was granted to procure their destruction But the injuries said he â they offered to my holiness and virtue forced mej to bring this punishment upon them but I will leave off for the time to come to require such punishments the effects of so great wrath for their future wicked actions and especially on account of thy prayers But if I shall at any time send tempests of rain in an extra ordinary manner be not affrighted at the copiousness of the showers for the water shall no more overspread the earth However I require you to abstain from shedding the blood of men and to keep yourselves pure from murder and to punish those who com mit any such thing I permit you to make use of all the other living creatures at your plea sure and as your appetites lead you for I have made you lords of them all both of those that walk on the land and those that swim in the waters and of those that fly in first city or town after the flood See Antiq xx 2 and Moses Chorenensis page 71â 72 Who also says page 19 that another town was related by tradition to have been called Seron or the place of dispersion on account of the first dispersion of Xisuthrus s or Noah s sons from thence Whether any remains of this Ark be still pre â served as the people of the country suppose I cannot cei tainly tell â â an 2928 19 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the regions of the air on high excepting the blood for therein is the life But I will give you a sign that I have laid aside my anger by my bow whereby is meant the rainbow for they determined that the rainbow was the bow of God And when God had said and promised thus he went away Now when Noah had lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood and all that time happily he died being nine hundred and fifty years old but let no one upon com paring the lives of the ancients with our lives and with the few years which we now live think that what we have said of them is false or make the shortness of our lives at present an argument that they did not attain to so long a duration of life for those ancients were beloved of God and lately made by God himself and because their food was then fitter for the prolongation of life might well live so great a number of years And besides God afforded them a longer time of life on account of their virtue and the good I use they made of it in astronomical and ge ometrical discoveries which would not have afforded them time for foretelling the pe riods of the stars unless they had lived six hundred years for the great year is com pleted in that interval Now I have for witnesses to what I have said all those that have written antiquities both among the Greeks and Barbarians for even Manetho who wrote the Egyptian His tory and Berosus who collected the Chal dean Monuments and Mochus and Hestiseus  and besides these Hieronymus the Egyptian and those that compose the Phoenician His tory agree to what I here say Hesiodf also and Hecataeus and Hellanicus and Aculsi laus and besides these Ephorus and Nico laus relate that the ancients lived a thou sand years But as to these matters let every one look upon them as they think fit CHAP IV OF THE TOWER OF BABYLON AND THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES HE sons of Noah were three Shem Japhet and Ham born one hundred  Gen far 13 t Since the Latin copies have here generally Isiodorus fcstead of Hesiodus Vossius and perhaps Hudson in vot I No 2 T years before the deluge These first of all descended from the mountains into the plains and fixed their habitation there and per suaded others who were greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account of the flood and so were very loth to come down from the higher places to venture to follow their ex ample Now the plain in which they first dwelt was called Shinar God also com manded them to send colonies abroad for the thorough peopling of the earth that they might not raise seditions among themselves but might cultivate a great part of the earth and enjoy its fruits after a plentiful manner but they were so ill instructed that they did not obey God for which reason they fell into calamities and were made sensible by expe rience of what sin they had been guilty of for when they flourished with a numerous youth God admonished them again to send out colo nies but they imagining that the prosperity they enjoyed was not derived from the favour of God but supposing that their own power was the proper cause of the plentiful con dition they were in did not obey him Nay they added to this disobedience to the divine will the suspicion that they were ordered to send out separate colonies that being divided asunder they might the more easily be op pressed Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God he was the grandson of Ham the son of Noah a bold man and of great strength of hand He per suaded them not to ascribe it to God as if it were through his means that they were happy but to believe that it was their own courage that procured that happiness He also gra dually changed the government into tyranny seeing no other method of turning men from the fear of God but to bring them into a con stant dependence on his own power He also said  He would be revenged on God if he should have a mind to drown the world again for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to be able to reach and that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their fore fathers Now the multitude were very ready to fol low the determination of Nimrod and to clined to think the writer here meant was Isidorus Chara cenus who produced instances of kings who reigned along time But since the Greek copies have constantly Hesiod ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS book I esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God and they built a tower neither sparing any pains nor being at any degree negligent about the work and by reason of the multi tude of hands employed in it it grew very high sooner than any one could expect but the thickness of it was so great and it was so strongly built that thereby its great height seemed upon view to be less than it really was It was built of burnt brick cemented together with mortar made of bitumen that it might not be liable to admit water When God saw them acting so madly h ttcl id not re solve to destroy them utterly since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the for mer sinners but he caused a tumult among them by producing in them divers languages and causing that through the multitude of those languages they should not be able to understand one another The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before for the Hebrew means by the word Babel con fusion The Sibylf also makes mention of the tower and of the confusion of the lan guage when she says thus â When all men were of one language some of them built an high tower as if they would thereby ascend up to heaven but the gods sent storms of wind and overthrew the tower and gave every one his peculiar language and for this reason it was that the city was called Baby lon But as to the plain of Shinah in the country of Babylonia Hestiaeus mentions it when he says  Such of the priests as were saved took the sacred vessels of Jupiter Enya lius and came to Shinar or Babylonia CHAP V OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE POSTERITY OF NOAH SENT OUT COLONIES AND INHABITED THE WHOLE EARTH FTER this they were dispersed abroad on account of the difference of their languages and went out by colonies every where and each colony took possession of that land unto which God led them so that the whole continent was filled with them both the inland and maritime countries There were some also who passed over the sea in ships and inhabited the islands and some of those nations still retain the denominations which were given them by their first foun ders but some have lost them and some have only admitted certain changes in them that they might be more intelligible to the in habitants and they were the Greeks who became the authors of such mutations for when in after ages they grew potent they claimed to themselves the glory of antiquity giving names to the nations that sounded well in Greek that they might be better under stood among themselves and setting agreea ble forms of government over them as if they were a people derived from themselves CHAP VI HOW EVERY NATION WAS DENOMINATED FROM THEIR FIRST INHABITANTS NOW they were the grand children of Noah in honour of whom names were imposed on the nations by those that first seized upon them Japhet the son of Noah had seven sons they inhabited so that be ginning at the mountains Taurus and Amanus they proceeded along Asia as far as the river Tanais and along Europe to Cadiz and settling themselves on the lands they chose which none had inhabited before they called the nations by their own names for Gomer founded those whom the Greeks called Gala tians but were then called Gomerites Ma gog founded those that from him were named Magogites but who are by the Greeks called Scythians Now as to Javan and Madai the sons of Japhet from Madai came the Ma deans which are called Medes by the Greeks and since Hesiod says that men s lives were once so long that at one hundred years of age they might be esteemed great infants I prefer that reading But what a catalogue of ancient authors are there that confirm the sacred His tory in one of its most difficult branches To which had Josephus read the Latin authors as he did the Greek he might have added Varro the most learned of the Romans who made this enquiry what the reason was that the an cients were supposed to have lived one thousand years  Gen xi 29 t See this testimony in the original and in English in my Edition of the Sibylline oracles page 11 93 94 but there it is in verse as here in prose the reason of which difference 1 by no means understand But what is here remarkable is that Moses Chorenensis the Armenian his torian confirms this history that God overthrew this tower by a terrible and divine storm and confounded the lan guage of the builders and this from the earliest records belonging to that nation â i ah 2578 21 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS but from Javan and Jonia all the Grecians are derived Thobel founded the Thobelites now called Iberes and the Mosocheni now called Cappadocians were founded by Mo soph There is also a mark of their ancient denomination still to be shewn for there is even now among them a city called Mazaca which may inform those who are able to un derstand that so was the nation once called Thiras also called those whom he ruled over Thirasians but the Greeks changed the name into Thracians and so many were the coun tries that had the children of Japhet for their inhabitants Of the three sons of Gomer Aschanax founded the Aschanaxians who are now called by the Greeks Rheginians Riphath founded the Ripheans now called Paphlago nians and Thrugramma the Thrugrammeans who as the Greeks resolved were named Phrygians Of the three sons of Javan also the son of Japhet Elisa gave name to the Eliseans who were his subjects they are now the iEolians Tharsus to the Tharsians for so was Cilicia of old called the sign of which is that the noblest city they have and a metropolis also is Tausus the letter Tau being by change put for Theta Cethimus possessed the island Cethima It is now called Cyprus and from that all islands and the greatest part of the sea coasts are named Cethim by the Hebrews and one city there is in Cyprus that has been able to preserve its denomination it is called Citius by those who use the language of the Greeks and has not by the use of that dialect escaped the name of Cethim and so many nations have the children and grand children of Japhet possessed Now when I have premised some what which perhaps the Greeks do not know I will return and explain what I have omitted for such names are pronounced here after the manner of the Greeks to please my readers for our own language does not so pronounce them but the names in all cases are of one and the same ending for the name we here pronounce Noeus is there Noah and in every case retains the same termination The children of Ham possessed the land from Syria and Amanus and the mountains of Libanus seizing upon all the maritime â One observation ought not here to be neglected with parts and keeping them as their own Some indeed of its names are utterly vanished others of them being changed and another sound given them are hardly to be discover ed yet there are a few which have kept their denominations entire for of the four sons of Ham time has not at all hurt the name of Chus for the Ethiopians over whom he reigned are even at this day both by them selves and by all men in Asia called Chu sites The memory also of the Mesraites is preserved in their name for all we who in habit the country of Judea call Egypt Mestre and the Egyptians Mestrians Phut also was the founder of Libya and called the inhabi tants Phutites from himself there is also a river in the country of the Moors which bears that name whence the greatest part of the Grecian historians mention that river and the adjoining country by the appellation of Phut but the name it has now is derived from one of the sons of Mestraim who was called Lybyos We will inform you presently what has been the occasion why it has been called Africa also Canaan the fourth son of Ham inhabited the country now called Judea and called it from his own name Canaan The children of these four were Sabas who founded the Sabeans Evilas who founded the Evileans now called Getuli Sabathes who founded the Sabathens called by the Greeks Astoborans Sabactas who settled the Sabactens and Ragmus who founded the Ragmeans This latter had two sons one of whom Judadas settled the Judadeans a na tion of the western Ethiopians and left them his name as did Sabas to the Sabeans But Nimrod the son of Chus stayed and tyran nized at Babylon as we have already ob served Now all the children of Mesraim being eight in number possessed the country from Gaza to Egypt though it retained the name of one only the Philistim for the Greeks caL part of that country Palestine As for the rest Ludieim Enemim andLabim who alone inhabited Libya and called the country from himself Nedim and Phethrosim and Ches loim and Cephthorim we know nothing of them besides their names for the Ethiopic war which we wiall describe hereafter regard to that Ethiopic war which Moses as General ol v 22 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS was the cause that those cities were over thrown The sons of Canaan were these Sidonius who built a city of the same name but called by the Greeks Sidon Amathus inhabited Amathine which is even now called Amathe by the inhabitants although the Macedonians named it Epiphania from one of his pos terity Arudeus possessed the island Aradeus Arucus possessed Arce which is in Libanus But of the seven others Ghetteus Jebuceus Amorreus Gergesseus Eudeus Sineus and Samareus we have nothing in the sacred books but their names for the Hebrews overthrew their cities and their calamities came upon them on the occasion following When after the deluge the earth was re settled in its former condition Noah set about its cultivation and planted it with vines and when the fruit was ripe and he had gathered the grapes in their season and the wine was ready for use he offered sacri fice and feasted and being inebriated he fell asleep and lay naked in an unseemly manner When his youngest son saw this he came laughing and shewed him to his brethren but they covered their father s nakedness and when Noah was made sen sible of what had been done he prayed for prosperity to his other sons but for Ham he did not curse him by reason of his nearness in blood but cursed his posterity and when the rest of them escaped that curse God inflicted it on the children of Canaan But of these matters we shall speak more hereafter Shem the third son of Noah had five sons t who inhabited the land that began at Eu phrates and reached to the Indian ocean For Elam left behind him the Elamites the ancestors of the Persians Ashur lived at the the Egyptians put an end to II 10 and about which modern writers seem very much unconcerned  viz that it was a war of that consequence as to occasion the removal or destruction of six or seven nations of the posterity of Mesraim with their cities which Josephus would not have said if he had not had ancient records to justify his asser tions though those records be now lost  Gen ix 21 t Gen x 21  That the Jews were called Hebrews from their pro genitor Heber our author Josephus here rightly affirms and not from Abram the Hebrew or passenger over Eu phrates as many of the modems suppose Shem is also called the Father of all the Children of Heber or of all the city Ninive and named his subjects Assyrians who became the most fortunate nation beyond others Arphaxad named the Arphaxadites who are now called Chaldeans Aram had the Aramites whom the Greeks call Syrians as Lud founded the Ludites who are now called Lydians Of the four sons of Aram Uz founded Trachonitis and Damascus this country lies between Palestine and Celesyria Ul founded Armenia and Gather the Bac trians and Mesa the Mesaneans it is now called Charax Spasina Sala was the son of Arphaxad and his son was Heber from whom they originally called the Jews He brews Heber begat Joctan and Phaleg He was called Phaleg because he was born at the dispersion of the nations to their se veral countries for Phaleg among the He brews signifies division Now Joctan one of the sons of Heber had these sons Elmo dad Saleph Asermoth Jera Adoram Aizel Decla Ebal Abimeal Sabeus Ophir Euilar and Jobab these inhabited from Cophen an Indian river and in part of Asia adjoining to it and this may suffice concerning the sons of Shem I will now treat of the Hebrews The son of Phaleg whose father was Heber was Ra gau whose son was Serug to whom was born Nahor his son was Terah who was the father of Abraham who accordingly was the tenthÂ from Noah who was born in the two hundred and ninety second year after the deluge for Terah begat Abram in his seven tieth year Nahor begat Haran when he was one hundred and twenty years old Nahor was born to Serug at his hundred and thirty second year Ragau had Serug at one hun dred and thirty at the same age also Phaleg had Ragau Heber begat Phaleg in his hun Hebrews in a history long before Abram passed over Euphrates Gen x 21 II If Phaleg were so called at his birth as Josephus here rightly asserts it is plain the short Hebrew or Masorete chronology was not the chronology of Josephus by which the confusion of languages and the dispersion of mankind fell no later than the 100th year after the deluge which is impossible to be supposed and is a great deal too soon for such confusion of languages and dispersion of mankind which by the best chronology did not happen till 300 years later or till 400 years after the flood Â Therefore the second Cainan is spurious See Ber  nard s note aN 2520 2S ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS dred and thirty fourth year he himself heing begotten by Sala when he was a hundred and thirty years old whom Arphaxad had for his son at the hundred and thirty fifth year of hie age Arphaxad was the son of Shem and born twelve years after the deluge Now Abram had two brethren Nahor and Ha ran of these Haran left a son Lot as also Sarai and Milcha his daughters and died among the Chaldeans in a city of the Chaldeans called Ur and his monument is shewn to this day These married their nieces Nahor married Milcha and Abram married Sarai Now Terah hating Chaldea on occount of his mourning for Haran they all removed to Haran of Mesopotamia where Terah died and was buried when he had lived to be two hundred and five years old for the life of man was already by degrees diminished and became shorter than before till the birthf of Moses after whom the term of human life was one hundred and twenty years God de termining it to the length that Moses hap pened to live Now Nahor had eight sons by Milcha Uz and Buz Kemuel Chesed Azau Pheldas Jadelph and Bethuel These were all the genuine sons of Nahor for Teba and Gaam and Tachas and Maaca were born of Reuma his concubine but Bethuel had a daughter Rebecca and a son Laban CHAP VII OF ABRAM S REMOVAL FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE CHAL DEANS TO THE LAND THEN CALLED CANAAN BUT NOW JUDEA ABRAM having no sons of his own adopted Lot his brother Haran s son and his wife Sarai s brother he left the land of Chaldea when he was seventy five years old and at the command of GodJ went into Canaan and therein he dwelt himself and left it to his posterity He was a person of great sagacity both for understanding all things and persuading his hearers and not mistaken in his opinions for which reason he began to have higher notions of virtue than others had and he determined to reform and change the opinion all men happened  An 1962  An 1612 voL I â No 2 then to have concerning God for he was the first who ventured to publish this notion that there was but one God the creator of the universe and that as to other gods if they contributed to the happiness of men that each of them afforded it according to his ap pointment and not by their own power This opinion was derived from the irregular phe nomena that were visible both at land and sea as well as those that happen to the sun and moon and all the heavenly bodies thus If said he these bodies had power of their own they would certainly take care of their own regular motions but since they do not preserve such regularity they make it plain that so far as they operate to our ad vantage they do it of their own abilities but as they are subservient to him that commands them to whom alone we ought justly to offer our honour and thanksgiving For which doctrines when the Chaldeans and other people of Mesopotamia raised a tumult against him he thought fit to leave that coun try and at the command and by the assist ance of God he came and lived in the land of Canaan And when he was there settled he built an altar and performed a sacrifice to God Berosus mentions our father Abram with out naming him when he says  In the tenth generation after the flood there was among the Chaldeans a man righteous and great and skilful in the celestial science But He cateus does more than barely mention him for he composed and left behind him a book concerning him And Nicolaus of Damascus in the fourth book of his history says Abram reigned at Damascus being a foreigner who came with an army out of the land above Babylon called the land of the Chaldeans But after a long time he removed from that country also with his people and went into the land then called the land of Canaan but now the land 6f Judea and this when his posterity were become a multitude as to which posterity of his we relate their history in another work Now the name of Abram is even still famous in the country of Damas cus and there is shewn a village named from him The Habitation of Abram SGen xii 1 mm  Gen xii 5 24 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP VIII OF ABRAM S DEPARTURE INTO EGYPT IN CONSEQUENCE OF A FAMINE AND OF HIS SUBSEQUENT RETURN NOW after this when a famine had in vaded the land of Canaan and Abram had discovered that the Egyptians were in a flourishing condition he was disposed to go down to them both to partake of the plenty they enjoyed and to learn what their priest asserted concerning the gods designing either to follow them if they had better no tions than he or to convert them into a bet ter way if his own notions proved the truest Now as he was to take Sarai with him and was afraid of the madness of the Egyptians with regard to women lest the king should kill him on occasion of his wife s great beauty he contrived this device He pretended to be her brother and directed her in a dissembling way to pretend the same for he said it would be for their benefit Now as soon as they came into Egypt it happened to Abram as he supposed For the fame of his wife s beauty was greatly talked of for which reason Pharaoh the king of Egypt would not be satisfied with what was reported of her but would needs see her himself But God put a stop to his unjust inclinations by send ing upon him a distemper and a sedition against his government And when he en quired of his priests how he might be freed from those calamities they told him that his miserable condition was derived from the wrath of God upon account of his inclination to abuse the stranger s wife He then out of fear asked Sarai who she was and who it was that she had brought along with her And when he had discovered the truth he excused himself to Abram that supposing the woman to be his sister and not his wife he set his affections on her as desiring an affinity with him by marrying her but not as incited by lust to abuse her He also made him a large present in money and gave him leave to enter into conversation with the most learned among the Egyptians From which conver sation his virtue and reputation became more conspicuous than they had been before For whereas the Egyptians were formerly  Gen xii 10 ft t Gen xiii 7 addicted to different customs and despised each others sacred and accustomed rites and were angry one with another on that account Abram conferred with each of them and con futing the reasonings they made use of for their respective practices he demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and void of truth Whereupon he was admired by them in those conferences as a very wise man and one of great sagacity when he discoursed on any subject he undertook and this not only in understanding it but in persuading other men also to assent to him He communicated to them arithmetic and delivered to them the science of astronomy For before Abram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with some parts of learning for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt and from thence to the Greeks also As soon as Abram returned into Canaan he parted the land between him and Lot upon account of the tumultous behaviour of their shepherds t concerning the pastures wherein they should feed their flocks However he gave Lot his option or leave to choose which lands he would take and he took himself what the other left which were the lower grounds at the foot of the mountains and he himself dwelt in Hebron which is a city seven years ancienter than Tanis of Egypt But Lot possessed the land of the plain and the river Jordan not far from the kingdom of Sodom which was then a fine city but is now destroyed by the will and wrath of God as will be shewn in its proper place hereafter CHAP IX OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SODOMITES BY THE ASSYRIAN WAR AT this time when the Assyrians had the dominion over Asia the people of Sodom were in a flourishing condition both as to riches and the number of their youth There were five kings that managed the affairs of this country Ballas Barsas Senabir and Sumobor with the king of Bela and each king led on his own troops And the Assyri ans made war upon them and dividing their army into four parts fought against them J Numbers xiii 22 an 1962 25 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now every part of the army had its own commander and when the battle was joined the Assyrians were conquerors and imposed a tribute upon the kings of the Sodomites who submitted to this slavery twelve years and so long they continued to pay their tri bute but on the thirteenth year they re belled and then the army of thje Assyrians came upon them under their commanders Amraphel Arioch Chedorlaomer and Ti dal f These kings had laid waste all Syria and overthrown the offspring of the giants And when they were come over against So dom they pitched their camp at the vale called the Slimepits for at that time there were many pits in that place but upon the destruction of the city of Sodom that vale be came the lake Asphaltites as it is called however concerning this lake we shall speak more presently Now when the Sodomites joined battle with the Assyrians and the fight was very obstinate many of them were killed and the rest were carried captive among which captives were Lot who had come to assist the Sodomites CHAP X OF ABRAm s SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ASSYRIANS AND HIS RESCUE OF THE SODOMITE PRISONERS WHEN Abram heard of their calamity he was at once afraid for Lot his kinsman and pitied the Sodomites his friends and neighbours and thinking it proper to afford them assistance he did not delay it but marched hastily and the fifth night fell upon the Assyrians near Dan for that is the name of the other spring of Jordan and be fore they could arm themselves he slew them as they were in their beds and others who were not yet gone to sleep but were so in toxicated they could not fight ran away Abram pursued after them till on the second day he drove them in a body unto Hoba J a place belonging to Damascus and thereby demonstrated that victory does not depend on multitude and the number of hands but that the alacrity and courage of soldiers over come the most numerous bodies of men while he got the victory over so great an army with no more than three hundred and eighteen of his servants and three of his friends But all those that fled returned home ingloriously So Abram when he had saved the captive Sodomites who had been taken by the Assyrians and Lot also his kinsman returned home in peace Now the king of Sodom met him at a cer tain place which they called the King s Dale where Melchisedec king of the city of Sa lem received him That name signifies the righteous king and such he was without dis pute insomuch that on his account he was made the priest of God However they afterwards called Salem Jerusalem Now this Melchisedec supplied Abram s army in a hospitable manner and gave them pro visions in abundance and as they were feast ing he began to praise him and to bless God for subduing his enemies under him But when Abram gave him the tenth part of his prey he accepted of the gift But the King of Sodom desired Abram to take the prey but intreated that he might have those men restored to him whom Abram had saved from the Assyrians because they belonged to him But Abram would not do so nor would make any other advantage of that prey than what his servants had eaten but still insisted that he should afford a part to his friends who had assisted him in the battle The first of them was called Eschol and the others Enner and Mambre God commended his virtue and said Thou shalt not however lose the rewards thou hast deserved to receive by such glo  We no where in profane history meet with the name of Chedorlaomer nor with any of those names of the kings who were confederate with him The reason hereof is that Ctesias X from whom the profane historians take the names of these kings did not use their original Assyrian names in his history but rather such as he found in the Persian records However since the date of this trans action falls four years before the death of Ninyas there are good grounds to infer that Ninyas who then lived in Persia was the Chedorlaomer of Moses at that time the bead of the Assyrian monarchy that Amraphel was his deputy at Babylon in Shinar and Arioch and Tidal his deputies over some other adjacent countries For it is remarkable that Ninyas was the first who appointed un der him such deputies nor is there any absurdity in Mo ses to call them kings since it is observable from what Isaiah hinted afterwards chap x 8

THE JEWS rious actions He answered And what advantage will it be to me to have such re wards when I have none to enjoy them after me for he was hitherto childless And God promised that he should have a son and that his posterity should be very nu merous insomuch that their number should be like the stars When he heard that he offered a sacrifice to God as he commanded him The manner of the sacrifice was this He took an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram in like manner of three years old and a turtle dove and a pigeon and as he was en joined he divided the three former f but the birds he did not divide After which before he built his altar where the birds of prey flew about as desirous of blood a divine voice came to him declaring that their neighbours would be grievous to his posterity when they should be in Egypt for four hundred years 4 during which time they should be afflicted but afterwards shall overcome their enemies should conquer the Canaanites in war and possess themselves of their land and of their cities Now Abram dwelt near the oak called Ogyges the place belongs to Canaan not far from the city of Hebron But being un easy at his wife s barrenness he intreated God to grant that he might have male issue and God required of him to be of good courage and said that he would add to all the rest of the benefits he had bestowed upon him ever since he led him out of Mesopota mia the gift of children Accordingly Sarai at God s command brought to his bed one of her handmaidens a woman of Egyptian de scent in order to obtain children by her and when this handmaid was pregnant she tri umphed and ventured to affront Sarai as if the dominion were to come to a son to be born of her But when Abram resigned her into the hands of Sarai to punish her she contrived to flee away as not able to bear the instances of Sarai s severity to her and she intreated God to have compassion on her Now a divine angel met her as she was going forward in the wilderness and bid her return to her master and mistress for if she would submit to that wise advice she should live better hereafter for that the reason of  It is worthy of remark that God required no other sacrifices under the law of Moses than what were taken from these five kinds of animals which he here required of Abram Nor did the Jews feed upon any other do mestic animals than the three here named as Reland ob serves on Antiq iv 4 t It was a customary thing to cut the victim which was to be offered as a sacrifice upon the occasion into two parts and so placing each half upon two different altars to cause those who contracted the covenant to pass be tween both This rite was practised both by believers and heathens at their solemn leagues at first doubtless with a view to the great sacrifice who was to purge our sins in his own blood and the offering of these sacrifices and passing between the parts of the divided victim was symbolically staking their hopes of purification and salva tion on their performance of the conditions on which it was offered This remarkable practice may be clearly traced in the Greek and Latin writers Homer has the fol lowing expression Opjpa ifica Â f ovÂ ff II ii 124 Hav ing cut faithful oaths Eustathius explains the passage by saying they were oaths relating to important matters and were made by the division of the victim See also Virgil JEn viii ver 640 The editor to the Fragments Sup plementary to Calmet No 129 is of opinion that what is yet practised of this ceremony may elucidate that passage in Isaiah xxviii 15 We have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves That is we have cut off a covenant sacrifice a purification offering with death and With the grave we have settled so that the scourge shall not injure us May not such a custom have been the origin of he following super stition related by Pitts If they the Algerine Corsairs at any time happen to be in a very great strait or distress as being chased or in a storm they will gather money light up candles in remembrance of some dead marrabot saint or other calling upon him with heavy sighs and groans If they find no succour from their before mentioned rites and superstitions but that the danger rather increases then they go to sacrificing a sheep or two or three upon occa sion as they think needful which is done after this man ner having cut off the head with a knife they immedi ately take out the entrails and throw them and the head overboard and then with all the speed they can without skinning they cut the body into two parts by the middle and throw one part over the right side of the ship and the other over the left into the sea as a kind of propitiation Thus those blind infidels apply themselves to imaginary intercessors instead of the living and true God Travels p 18 In the case here referred to the ship passes be tween the parts thus thrown on each side of it This be haviour of the Algerines may be taken as a pretty accurate counterpart to that of making a covenant with death and with imminent danger of destruction by appeasing the an gry gods Festivities always accompanied the ceremonies attending oaths Isaac and Abimelech feasted at making their covenant Gen xxvi 30 and xxxi 54 This prac tice was also usual among the heathen nations Oriental Customs Vol I 294 B J As to this affliction of Abraham s posterity for four hundred years see II 9 an 1955 27 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS her being in such a miserable case was that she had been ungrateful and arrogant towards her mistress He also told her that it she disobeyed God and went on still on her way she should perish but if she would return back she should become the mother of a son who should reign over that country These admonitions she obeyed and returned to her master and mistress and obtained forgive ness A little while afterwards she gave birth to Ismael which may be interpreted Heard of God because God heard his mother s prayer This son was born to Abram when he was eighty six years old f But when he was ninety nine God appeared to him and pro mised that he should have a son by Sarai and commanded that his name should be Isaac and shewed him that from this son should spring great nations and kings and that they should obtain the land of Canaan by war from Sidon to Egypt But he charged in order to keep his posterity unmixt with others that they should be circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin and that this should be done on the eighth day after they were born The reason of which circumcision I will ex plain in another place And Abram enquiring also concerning Ismael whether he should live or not God signified to him that he should live to be very old and should be the father of great nations Abram therefore gave thanks to God for these blessings and then he with his son Ismael and all his family were circumcised immediately the son being that day thirteen years of age and Abram ninety nine CHAP XL OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SODOMITE NATION ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SINS ABOUT this time the Sodomites grew proud on account of their riches and great wealth they became unjust towards men and impious towards God insomuch that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him they hated strangers and abused themselves with unnatural prac tices God was therefore much displeased  An 1966 t Gen xvi 16 voL I â No 3 at them and determined as a punishment for their pride to overthrow their city and lay waste their country till there should neither plant nor fruit grow out of it When God had thus resolved concerning the Sodomites Abraham as he sat by the oak of Mambre at the door of his tent saw three angels and thinking them to be strangers he rose up and saluted them and desired they would accept of an entertain ment and abide with him to which when they agreed he ordered cakes of meal to be made and when he had slain a calf he roasted it and brought it to them as they sat under the oak Now they made a shew of eating and besides they asked him about his wife Sarah where she was and when he said she was within they said they should come again hereafter and find her become a mother Upon which the woman laughed and said that it was impossible she should bear children since she was ninety years of age and her husband was an hundred Then they concealed themselves no longer but declared that they were angels of God and that one of them was sent to inform them about the child and two for the overthrow of Sodom When Abraham heard this he was grieved for the Sodomites and he rose up and be sought God for them and intreated him that he would not destroy the righteous with the wicked But when God had replied that there was no good man among the Sodomites for if there were but ten such men among them he would not punish any of them for their sins Abraham held his peace And the angels came to the city of the Sodomites and Lot intreated them to accept a lodging with him j for he was a very generous and hos pitable man and one that had learned to imitate the goodness of Abraham Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be oi beautiful countenances and this to an extra ordinary degree and that they took up their lodgings with Lot they resolved to possess those beautiful boys by force and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers but to have regard to their lodging in his house J Gen xxviii 2 II Gen xix 2 H 28 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed he would expose his daugh ters to their lust instead of these strangers neither thus were they made ashamed But God was much displeased at their im pudent behaviour so that he both smote those men with blindness and condemned the Sodomites to universal destruction but Lot upon God s informing him of the future de struction of the Sodomites went away taking with him his wife and two daughters who were still virgins for those that were be trothedt to them were above the thoughts of going and deemed Lot s words trifling God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city and set it on fire with its inhabitants and laid waste the country with the like burning as I formerly said when I wrote the Jewish war J but Lot s wife continually turning back to view the city as she went from it and being too inquisitive what would become of it although God had forbidden her so to do was changed into a pillar of salt for I have seen it and it remains at this day Now he and his daughters fled to a certain small place encompassed with the fire and settled in it It is to this day called Zoar for that is the word which the Hebrews use for a small thing There it was that he lived a miserable life on account of his having no company and his want of provisions But his daughters thinking that all man kind were destroyed approachedÂ to their lather though taking care not to be per ceived This they did that the human race might not utterly fail and they bare sons the son of the elder was called Moab which de notes one derived from his father the younger bare Ammon which name denotes one de rived from a kinsman The former was the father of the Moabites which is even still a great nation the latter was the father of the Ammonites and both of them are inhabitants of Celesyria And such was the departure of Lot from among the Sodomites CHAP XII OP ABIMELECH s CONDUCT TOWARDS ABRAHAM OF ISMAEL THE SON OF ABRAHAM AND THE ARABIANS HIS POS TERITY ABRAHAM now removed to Gerar of Palestine leading Sarah along with him under the name of his sister using the like dissimulation that he had used before for he was afraid of Abimelech the king of that country who actually fell in love with Sarah and was disposed to corrupt her but he was restrained from satisfying his desires by a dangerous distemper which befel him from God Now when his physicians des paired of curing him he fell asleep and was warned in a dream not to abuse the stranger s wife and when he recovered he told his friends that God had inflicted that disease upon him by way of punishment for his injury to the stranger and in order to preserve the chastity of his wife for that she did not ac company him as his sister but as his legitimate wife and that God had promised to be gra cious to him for the time to come if this per son were once secure of his wife s chastity When he had said this by the advice of his friends he sent for Abraham and told him not to be in the least concerned about his wife for that God took care of him and that it was by his providence he received his wife again without suffering any abuse and he appealed to God and to his wife s conscience and said he had not any inclination at first to

War IV 8 II This pillar of salt was we see here standing in the days of Josephus and he had seen it That it was stand ing then is also attested by Clement of Rome contempo rary with Josephus as also it was standing in the next oentury is attested by Irenaeus with the addition of an hy pothesis how it came to last so long with all its members intire Whether the account that some modern travellers give be true that it is still standing I do not know Its remote situation at the utmost southern point of the sea of Sodom in the wild and dangerous deserts of Arabia makes it exceeding difficult for inquisitive travellers to examine the place and for common reports of country people at a distance they are not very satisfactory Â I see no wicked intention of these daughters of Lot in a case which appeared to them as an unavoidable neces sity Incest is certainly a horrid crime but whether in such a case of necessity as they apprehended this to be according to Josephus it was any such crime I am not sa tisfied In the mean time their making their father in ebriated and their solicitous concealment of what they did from him shewed that they despaired of persuading him to an action which at the best could not but be very shock ing to so good a man an 1950 29 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS possess her if he had known she was a wife But since said he  she accompanied thee in the character of thy sister I was guilty of no offence He also intreated him to be at peace with him and to make God propitious to him and that if he thought fit to continue with him he should have what he wanted in abundance but that if he designed to go away he should be honourably conducted and have whatever supply he wanted when he came thither Upon his saying this Abra ham told him that his pretence of kindred to his wife was not a falsehood because she was his brother s daughter and that he did not think himself safe in his travels abroad without this sort of dissimulation and that he was not the cause of his distemper but was only solicitous for his own safety He said also that he was ready to stay with him where upon Abimelech assigned him land and money and they covenanted to live together without guile and took an oath at a certain well called Beersheba which may be in terpreted the well of the oath and so it is named by the people of the country unto this day Now in a little time Abrahamf had a son by Sarah as God had foretold to him whom he named Isaac which signifies laughter and indeed they so called him because Sarah laughed when God saidJ that she should bear a son she not expecting such a thing as being past the age of child bearing for she was ninety years old and Abraham a hundred so that his son was born to them both in the last year of each of those decimal numbers and they circumcised him upon the eighth  Gen xvi 31 t An 1937 J It is well worth observation that Josephus here calls that principal angel who appeared to Abraham and fore told the birth of Isaac directly God which as he had done it before in his coherence c 11 and does it after ward c 13 and v 8 is not very strange in a great reader and admirer of Philo who does it so often which lan guage of Josephus s here prepares us to believe those other expressions of his that Jesus was a wise man if it be lawful to call him a man XVIII 3 and of God the Word in his last homily concerning Hades may be both genuine nor is the other expression of divine angel used presently and before also of any other signifi cation II This circumcision is not after but on the eighth day as it is elsewhere expressed by Josephus The like con struction to which we meet with in the New Testament day and from that time the Jews continue the custom of circumcising their sons within that number of days but as for the Arabians they circumcise after the thirteenth year because Ismael the founder of their nation who was born to Abraham of the concubine was circumcised at that age concerning whom I will hereafter give a particular ac count As for Sarah she at first loved Ismael who was born of her handmaid Hagar with an affection not inferior to that of a mother for he was brought up in order to succeed in the government but when she herself had borne Isaac she was not willing that Ismael should be brought up with him as being too low for him and able to do him injuries when their father should be dead She therefore per suaded Abraham to send him and his mother to some distant country Now at first he did not agree to what Sarah was zealous for and thought it an instance of the greatest bar barity to send away a young child Â and a woman unprovided of necessaries but at length he agreed to it because God was pleased with what Sarah had determined so he delivered Ismael to his mother as not yet able to go by himself and commanded her to take a bottle of water and a loaf of bread and so to depart and to take necessity for her guide But as soon as her necessary pro visions failed she found herself in an evil case and when the water was almost spent she laid the young child who was ready to expire under a fir tree and went on farther so that he might die while she was absent but a divine angel came to her and told her Matthew xxvii 63 Luke ii 21 John xx 26 This is Reland s observation Â Josephus here calls Ismael u iov a young child or infant though he were above 13 years of age as Judas calls himself and his brethren vhg young men when he was 47 when he had two children and they were of much the same age as is a damsel of 12 years old called iraÂ 5iov

father CHAP XIII of isaac Abraham s legitimate son NOW Abraham greatly loved Isaac as being his only begotten and given to him at the borders of old age by the favour of God The child also endeared himself to his parents still more by the exercise of every virtue and adhering to his duty to his parents and being zealous in the worship of God Abraham placed also his own happi ness wholly in this prospect that when he should die he should leave his son in a safe and secure condition which accordingly he obtained by the will of God who being de sirous to make an experiment of Abraham s religious disposition towards himself ap peared to him and enumerated all the bless ings he had bestowed on him how he made him superior to his enemies and that his son Isaac who was the principal part of his present happiness was derived from him and he said that he required this son of his as a sacrifice and a holy oblation Accordingly he commanded him to carry him to the moun  Note that both here and Heb xi 17 Isaac is called Abraham s iMvoyevy only begotten son though he at the same time had another son Ismael The Septuagint ex press the true meaning by rendering the text by iyartrp h the beloved son t Gen xxii 2  Here is a plain error in the copies which say that king David afterwards built the temple on this mount tain Moriah f and to build an altar and offer him for a burnt offering upon it for that this would best manifest his religious disposition towards him if he preferred what was pleasing to God before the preservation of his own son Now Abraham thought that it was not right to disobey God in any thing but that he was obliged to serve him in every circum stance of life since all creatures that live enjoy their life by his providence and the kindness he bestows on them accordingly he concealed this command of God and his own intentions about the slaughter of his son from his wife as also from every one of his servants otherwise he would have been hin dered from his obedience to God and he took Isaac together with two of his servants and laying what things were necessary for a sacrifice upon an ass he went away to the mountain Now the two servants went along with him two days but on the third day as soon as he saw the mountain he left those servants that were with him till then in the plain and having his son alone with him he came to the mountain It was that mountain upon which king David afterwards builtJ the temple Now they had brought with them every thing necessary for a sacrifice except ing the animal that was to be offered Now Isaac was twenty five years old and as he was building the altar he asked his father what he was about to offer since there was no animal there for an oblation to which it was answered that God would provide him self an oblation he being able to make a plentiful provision for men out of what they have not and to deprive others of what they already have when they put too much trust therein that therefore if God pleased to be present and propitious at this sacrifice he would provide himself with an oblation As soon as the altar was prepared and Abraham had laid on the wood and all things were entirely ready he said to his son O son I poured out a vast number of prayers that Moriah while it was certainly no other than king Solo mon who built that temple as indeed Procopius cites it from Josephus only if we change ispov into 3u hv temple into altar we eed not correct the name for it was David and not Solomon who built the first altar there as we learn 2 Sam xnv 18 c 1 Cbxon rxi 22 c II An 1922 AN 31 1912 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS I might have thee for my son when thou wast come into the world there was nothing that could contribute to thy support for which I was not greatly solicitous nor any thing wherein I thought myself happier than to see thee grown up to man s estate and that I might leave thee at my death the successor to my dominion but since it was by God s will that I became thy father and is now his will that I relinquish thee bear this conse cration to God with a generous mind for I resign thee up to God who hath thought fit now to require this testimony of honour to himself on account of the favours he hath conferred on me in being to me a supporter and defender Accordingly thou my son wilt now die not in any common way of going out of the world but sent to God the father of all men before hand by thy own father in the nature of a sacrifice I suppose he thinks thee worthy to leave this world neither by disease by war nor any other severe way by which death usually comes upon men but so that he will receive thy soul with prayers and holy offices of religion and will place thee near to himself and thou wilt there be to me a succourer and supporter in my old age on which account I principally brought thee up and thou wilt thereby procure me God for my comforter instead of thyself Now Isaac was of such a generous dispo sition as became the son of such a father and was pleased with this discourse and said that he was not worthy to be born at first if he should reject the determination of God and of his father and should not resign himself up readily to both their pleasures since it would have been unjust if he had not obeyed even if his father alone had so re solved so he went immediately to the altar to be sacrificed and the deed had been  It seems both here and in God s parallel blessing to Jacob c 19 that Josephus had yet no notion of the hidden meaning of that most important and most eminent promise In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed he saith not of seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ Gal iii 16 Nor is it any wonder he being I think as yet not a Christian and had he been a Christian yet since he was till the latter part of his life no more than an Ebonite Christian who above all the apostles rejected and despised St Paul it would be no great wonder if he did not now follow his interpretation In the mean time we have in effect St Paul s exposition in the testament of Reuben in Authent Rec part I page 302 who charges his sons  To worship VOL Lâ No 3 done if God had not opposed it for he called loudly to Abraham by his name and forbade him to slay his son and said it was not out of a desire of human blood that he was com manded to slay his son nor was he willing that he should be taken away from him whom he had made his father but to try the temper of his mind whether he would be obedient to such a command since therefore he now was satisfied as to the surprising readiness he shewed in his piety he was delighted in having bestowed such blessings upon him and that he would not be wanting in all sort of concern about him and that his son should live to a very great age that he should live a happy life and bequeath a large prin cipality to his children who should be good and legitimate He foretold also that his family should increase into many nations and that those patriarchs should leave behind them an everlasting name that they should obtain the possession of the land of Canaan and be envied by all men When God had said this he produced to them a ram f which did not appear before for the sacrifice so Abraham and Isaac receiving each other un expectedly and having obtained the pro mises of such great blessings embraced one another and when they had sacrificed they returned to Sarah and lived happily together God affording them his assistance in all things they desired CHAP XIV OF THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF SARAH ABRAHAM S WIFE NOW SarahJ died a little while after ward having lived one hundred and twenty seven years They buried her in Hebron the Canaanites publicly allowing the seed of Judah who should die for them in visible and invisible wars and should be among them an eternal king Nor is that observation of a learned foreigner of my acquaintance to be despised who takes notice that as seeds in the plural must signify posterity so seed in the singular may signify either posterity or a single person and that in this promise of all nations being happy in the seed of Abraham or Isaac or Jacob c it is always used in the singular to which I shall add that it is some times as it were paraphrased by the son of Abraham the son of David c which is capable of no such ambiguity See Boyle s Lectures page 247â 272 t Gen xxii 13 I Gen

sons of Madian were Ephas Ophren Anoch Ebidas and Eldas Now Abraham contrived to settle all these sons and grand sons in colonies and they took possession of Troglodytis and the country of Arabia the

hand was under and the other upon the thigh is not certain pos sibly Abraham s servant might swear with one hand under his master s thigh and the other stretched out to Heaven As the posterity of the patriarchs are described as coming out of the thigh it has been supposed this ceremony had some relation to their believing the promise of God to bless all the nations of the earth by means of one that was to descend from Abraham B Harmer vol iv p 477 J Homer mentions the same custom of women s being employed in drawing water among the Phaecians and phran the country of Africa took its name because these men were auxiliaries to Her cules when he fought against Libya and Antseus and that Hercules married Aphra s daughter and of her begat a son Diodorus and that Sophon was his son from whom the barbarous people called Sophacians were denominated CHAP XVI of Isaac s marriage NOW when Abraham the father of Isaac had resolved to take Rebeka who was grand daughter to his brother Nahor for a wife to his son Isaac who was then about forty years old he sent the eldest of his servants to betroth her after he had obliged him to give him the strongest assurances of his fidelity after the following manner They put each other s hands under each other s thighs f and called upon God as the witness of what was to be done He also sent such presents to those that were there as were in esteem on account that they either rarely or never were seen in that country This ser vant got thither not under a considerable time for it requires much time to pass through Mesopotamia in which it is tedious travelling both in winter for the depth of the clay and in summer for want of water and besides this for the robberies there com mitted which are not to be avoided by tra vellers but by the utmost caution However the servant came to Haran and when he was in the suburbs he met a considerable number of maidens going to the water J he therefore LcEstrygonians Od vii 20 et x 105 Dr Shaw speaking of the occupation of the Moorish women in Bar bary says to finish the day at the time of the evening even at the time that the women go out to draw water they are still to fit themselves with a pitcher or goat skin and tying their sucking children behind them trudge it in this manner two or three miles to fetch water Travels p 421 The same custom prevailed in ancient Greece Homer represents Minerva meeting Ulysses as the sun was going down under the form of a Phaecian virgin carrying a pitcher of water that being the time when the maidens went out to draw water When near the

prayed to God that Rebeka might be found among them or her whom Abraham sent him as his servant to espouse to his son in case his will were that this marriage should be consummated and that she might be made known to him by this sign that while others denied him water to drink she might give it him With this intention he went to the well and desired the maidens to give him some water to drink but while the others refused on pretence that they wanted it all at home and could spare none for him one only of the company rebuked them for their peevish be haviour towards the stranger and said  What is there that you will ever communi cate to any body who have not so much as given the man some water She then offered him water in an obliging manner and he be gan to hope that this grand affair would suc ceed but desiring still to know the truth he commended her for her generosity and good nature that she did not scruple to afford a sufficiency of water to those who wanted it though it cost her some pains to draw it He then asked her who were her parents and wished them joy of such a daughter and mayest thou be espoused said he  to their satisfaction into the family of an agreeable husband and bring him legitimate children Nor did she disdain to satisfy his enquiries but told him her family They call me Re beka said she my father was Bethuel but he is dead and Laban is my brother See also Odyss lib x 105 A similar custom prevailed also in Armenia as may be seen in Xenophon s Anabasis b iv B  The weight of the ornaments put upon Rebeka ap pears extraordinary But CJiardin assures us that even heavier were worn by the women of the East when he was there He says that the women wear rings and Dracelets of as great weight as this and even heavier through all Asia They are rather manacles than brace lets There are some as large as the finger The women wear several of them one above the other in such a manner as sometimes to have the arm covered with them from the wrist to the elbow Poor people wear as many of glass or horn They hardly ever take them off They are their riches Mariner s Observations vol ii p 600 Among the several female ornaments which Abraham sent by his servant whom he employed to search out a wife for his son Isaac were jewels of silver and jewels of gold exclusive of raiment which probably was very rich and valuable for the age in which Abraham lived Rich and splendid apparel especially such as was adorned with gold was very general in the eastern nations from the earliest ages and as the fashions and customs of the and together with my mother takes care of all our family affairs and is my guardian When the servant heard this he was very glad at what had happened and at what was told him as perceiving that God had thus plainly directed his journey and producing his bracelets and some other ornaments which it was esteemed decent for virgins to wear he gave them to the damsel by way of acknowledgment and as a reward for her kindness in giving him water to drink say ing it was but just that she should have them because she was so much more obliging than any of the rest She desired also that he would come and lodge with them since the approach of the night gave him not time to proceed farther 1 hen producing his pre cious ornaments for women he said he de sired to trust them to none more safely than to such as she had shewed herself to be and that he believed he might guess at the hu manity of her mother and brother that they would not be displeased from the virtue he found in her for he would not be burthen some but would pay the hire for his enter tainment and spend his own money to which she replied that he guessed rightly as to the humanity of her parents but com plained that he should think them so par simonious as to take money for that he should have all his wants supplied freely but she said she would first inform her bro ther Laban and if he gave her leave she would conduct him in Orientals are not subject to much variation so we find that this propensity to golden ornaments prevails even in the present age among the females in the countries bor dering on Judea Thus Mungo Park in the account of his travels in Africa mentions the following singular cir cumstance respecting the ornamental part of the dress of an African lady It is evident from the account of the process by which negroes obtain gold in Manding that the country contains a considerable portion of this precious metal A great part is converted into ornaments for the women and when a lady of consequence is in full dress the gold about her person may be worth altogether from fifty to eighty pounds sterling We find also that the same disposition for rich orna mental apparel prevailed in the times of the Apostles for St Peter cautioned the females of quality in the first ages of Christianity when they adorned themselves not to have it consist in the outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing gold or of putting on apparel 1 Pet iii 3 See also Psalm xlv 9 13 Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir â Her clothing is of wrought gold B 34 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS As soon as this was done the servants of Laban brought the camels in and took care of them and the stranger was himself brought in to supper by Laban and after supper he said to him and to the mother of the damsel addressing himself to her Abraham is the son of Terah and a kinsman of yours for Nahor the grandfather of these children was the brother of Abraham by both father and mother upon which account he hath sent me to you being desirous to take this damsel for his son to wife He is his legitimate son and is brought up as his only heir He could indeed have had the most happy of all the women in that country for him but he would not have his own son marry any of them out of regard to his own relations I would not therefore have you despise his affection for it was by the good pleasure of God that other accidents fell out in my journey and that thereby I met with your daughter and your house for when I was come near your city I saw a great many maidens coming to a well and I prayed that I might meet with this damsel which has come to pass accordingly Do you therefore confirm that marriage whose espousals have been already made by a divine appearance and shew the respect you have for Abraham who has sent me with so much solicitude in giving your consent to the marriage of this damsel Upon this they understood it to be the will of God and greatly approved of the offer and sent their daughter as was de sired f Accordingly Isaac married her the inheritance being now come to him for the children of Keturah were gone to their own remote habitations CHAP XVII OF ABRAHAM S DEATH AND BURIAL A LITTLE while after this Abraham died J he was a man of incomparable virtue and honoured by God in a manner agreeable to his piety towards him The whole time of his life was one hundred and seventy five years and he was buried in Hebron with his wife Sarah by their sons Isaac and Ismael CHAP XVIII OF THE NATIVITY AND EDUCATION OF ESAU AND JACOB ISAAC S wife proved with child Â after the death of Abraham and when she was far advanced in her pregnancy Isaac was very anxious and inquired of God who an swered that Rebeka should bear twins and that two nations should take the names of those sons and that he who appeared the second should excel the elder Accordingly she in a little time as God foretold gave birth to twins the elder of whom from his head to his feet was very rough and hairy but the younger took hold of his heel as they were in the birth Now the father loved the elder who was called Esau a name agreeable to his roughness for the Hebrews call such an hairy roughness Esauff for Seir but Jacob the younger was best beloved by his mother When there was a famine in the land Isaac resolved to go into Egypt the land there being good but he went to Gerar as God commanded him Here Abimelech the king  Gen xxiv 59 t When Kebeka was sent away it appears that her nurse accompanied her Nurses were formerly held in very high esteem and considered as being entitled to constant and lasting regard The nurse in an Eastern family is always an important personage Modern travel lers inform us that in Syria she is considered as a sort of second parent whether she has been foster mother or otherwise She always accompanies the bride to her husband s house and ever remains there an honoured character Thus it was in ancient Greece Siege of Acre b ii p 35 Note Rebeka upon leaving her family received their bless ing Nuptial benedictions were used both by the Jews Greeks and Romans That of the Jews was in this form Blessed be thou O Lord who hast created man and woman and ordained marriage c This was re peated every day during the wedding week provided there were new guests The Grecian form of bene diction was aoaSri ru i The Latin was Quod faustum felixque sit The Jews constantly made use of the same form but the Greeks and Romans frequently varied theirs a benediction however in some form was always used See Selden de Jure N et G 1 5 c 19 B I An 1862 II Gen xxv 7 Â The birth of Jacob and Esau is here said to be after Abraham s death it should have been after Sarah s death The chronology here certainly shews the other to be a mistake The order of the narration in Genesis not always exactly according to the order of time seems to have led Josephus into it as Dr Bernard observes here  Gen xxv 23 Tt For Seir in Josephus the coherence requires that we read Esau or Seir  which signifies the same thing an 1897 35 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS received him kindly because Abraham had formerly lived with him and had been his friend but when he saw that God was with Isaac and took such great care with him he became envious and drove him away Per ceiving this change in Abimelech s temper Isaac retired to a place called the Valley not far from Gerar and as he was digging a well the shepherds fell upon him and began to fight in order to hinder the work and because he did not desire to contend the shepherds seemed to get the better of him So he still retired and dug another well and when certain other shepherds in the service of Abimelech began to offer him violence he left that also and still retired thus pur chasing security to himself by a rational and prudent conduct At length the king gave him permission to dig a well which he named Rehoboth denoting a large space But of the former wells one was called Escon which denotes strife the other Sitenna which name signifies enmity Isaac s affairs were now in a flourishing condition and his power increased from his great riches But Abimelech thinking Isaac throve in opposition to him while their living together made them suspicious of each other and Isaac s retiring shewed a secret enmity also the king was afraid that his former friendship would not secure him if Isaac should endeavour to revenge the injuries he had formerly received he therefore renewed his friendship with him in the presence of Philoc one of his generals and when he had obtained every thing he desired by rea son of Isaac s good nature who preferred the  While Josephus copies both Greek and Latin men tion this Philoc as one of Abimelech s generals that ac companied him when he renewed the old league with Isaac which had been made long before with Abraham our new edition calls him Phicol by the same name with the general at the league made with Abraham which old league is not so distinctly mentioned by Josephus but this conjectural reading is too uncertain to be depended on t Gen xxyi 31 I An 1817 II This supper of Savory meat as we call it Gen xxvii 4 to be caught by hunting was evidently intended for a festival on a sacrifice and upon the prayers that were frequent at sacrifices Isaac expected as was then usual in such eminent cases that a divine impulse would come upon him in order to the solemn blessing of his son there present and his foretelling his future behaviour and for tune Whence it must be that when Isaac had blessed voL I â No 3 earlier friendship Abimelech had shewed to himself and his father to alter his wrath against him he returned home f Now when Esau one of the sons of Isaac whom the father principally loved was come to the age of forty years he married Adah J the daughter of Helon and Aholibamah the daughter of Esebeon which Helon and Ese beon were great lords among the Canaanites thereby taking upon himself the authority and pretending to have dominion over his own marriages without so much as asking the advice of his father For had Isaac been the arbitrator he would not have given him leave to marry thus for he was not pleased with contracting any alliance with the people of that country but not wishing to act harshly by his son in commanding him to put away these wives he resolved to be silent But when he was old and could not see at all he called Esau to him and told him that besides his blindness and the disorder in his eyes his very old age hindered him from his worship of God by sacrifice he bade him therefore to go out a hunting and when he had caught as much venison as he could to prepare him a supper  that after this he might make supplication to God to be to him a supporter and an assister during the old time of his life saying that it was uncertain when he should die and that he was desirous by his prayers for him to procure before hand God to be merciful to him Accordingly Esau went out a hunting But RebekaÂ thinking it proper to have the sup plication made for obtaining the favour of Jacob and was afterwards made sensible of his mistake he did not attempt to alter it because he knew that this blessing came not from himself but from God  and that an alteration was out of his power A second afflatus then came upon him and enabled him to foretel Esau s future behaviour and fortune also Â Whether Jacob or his mother Rebeka were most blameable in this imposition upon Isaac in his old age 1 cannot determine However the blessings being de livered as a prediction of future events by a divine im pulse and according to what Rebeka knew to be the purpose of God when he answered her inquiry before the children were born Gen xxv 23 that one people should be stronger than the other and that the elder Esau should serve the younger Jacob Whether Isaac knew or remembered this oracle delivered in our copies only to Rebeka or whether if he knew or remembered it he did not endeavour to alter the divine determination out of his fondness for his elder son Esau to the damage 36 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS God to Jacob and that without the consent of Isaac bade him kill kids of the goats and prepare a supper Jacob obeyed his mother according to all her instructions and when the supper was ready he took a goat s Bkin and put it about his arm that by reason of its hairy roughness his father might believe him to be Esau for they being twins and in all things else alike differed only in this thing This was done out of his fear that before Isaac had made his supplications he should be caught in his evil practice and thereby provoke his father to curse him So he brought in the supper to his father Isaac perceiving by the peculiarity of his voice who he was called his son to him who gave him his hand which was covered with the goat s skin When Isaac felt that he said Thy voice is like the voice of Jacob yet because of the thickness of thy hair thou seemest to be Esau So suspecting no deceit he ate the supper and offered up his prayers and intercession to God and said O Lord of all ages and creator of all substance it was thou that didst propose to my father great plenty of good things and hast vouch safed to bestow on me what I have and hast promised to my posterity to be their kind supporter and to bestow on them still greater blessings Do thou therefore confirm these thy promises and do not overlook me because of my present weak condition on account of which I more earnestly pray to thee Be gracious to this my son preserve him and keep him from every thing that is evil Give him a happy life and the possession of as many good things as thy power is able to be stow Make him terrible to his enemies and honourable and beloved among his friends Thus did Isaac pray to God thinking his prayers had been made for Esau He had but just finished them however when Esau came in from hunting and when Isaac per ceived his mistake he was silent Esau earnestly requested that he might be made partaker of the blessing which his brother had received but his father refused because all his prayers had been spent upon Jacob So Esau lamented the mistake however his father being grieved at his weeping said that  He should excel in hunting in arms in strength of body and should obtain glory for ever on those accounts he and his pos terity after him but still should serve his brother Now the mother delivered Jacob when he was afraid that his brother would inflict some punishment upon him because of the mistake about the prayers of Isaac for she persuaded her husband to take a wife for Jacob out of Mesopotamia of her own kindred Esau having already married Basemmath the daughter of Ishmael without his father s con sent for Isaac not liking the Canaanites dis approved of Esau s former marriage which made him take Basemmath to wife in order to please him and indeed he had a great affection for her CHAP XIX OF JACOB S FLIGHT INTO MESOPOTAMIA NOW Jacob was sent by his mother into Mesopotamia in order to marry her brother Laban s daughter which marriage was permitted by Isaac on account of his obsequiousness to the desires of his wife and he accordingly journeyed through the land of Canaan and because he hated the people of that country he would not lodge with any of them but took up his lodging in the open air and laid his head on a heap of stones that he had gathered together t Hav of his younger son Jacob as Josephus supposes II 7 I certainly cannot say If so this might tempt Rebeka to contrive and Jacob to practise this imposition upon him However Josephus says here that it was Isaac and not Rebeka who inquired of God at first and re ceived the forementioned oracle  which if it be the true reading renders Isaac s procedure the more inexcusable Nor was it probable that any thing else so much encou raged Esau formerly to marry two Canaanitish wives without his parents consent as Isaac s unhappy fondness for him N B Upon this occasion it may be necessary to cau tion the reader against a common prejudice of the moderns as if the bare relation of what we should esteem the faults and blemishes of the patriarchs and other very good men in the scripture implied a justification of them The scripture affords us faithful accounts of the great men with whom it is concerned and relates their vices and follies as impartially as their good and wise actions yet it does not always characterize those actions but fre quently leaves them to the readers own judgment and censure to their imitation of

persons descending down the ladder that seemed more excellent than human and at last God himself stood above it and calling him by his name said  O Jacob it is not fit for thee who art the son of a good father and grandson to one who had obtained a great reputation for his eminent virtue to be dejected at thy present circum stances but to hope for better times For thou shalt have great abundance of all good things by my assistance For I brought Abra ham hither out of Mesopotamia when he was driven away by his kinsmen and I made thy father a happy man Nor will I bestow an inferior degree of

stone of a py ramidical form and the Saj imona Codom of the Siamese is of the same complexion The Ayeen Akbery mentions an octagonal pillar of black stone fifty cubits high Tavernier observed an idol of black stone in the Pagoda of Benares and that the statue of Chreeshna in his celebrated tem ple of Mathura is of black marble It is very remarkable that one of the principal ceremonies incumbent upon the priests of these stone deities according to Tavernier is to anoint them daily with odoriferous oils a circumstance which immediately brings to our remembrance the similar practice of Jacob who after the famous vision of the ce lestial ladder took the stone which he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it It is added that he called the name of that place Bethel that is the house of God This passage evinces of how great antiquity is the custom of considering stones in a sacred light as well as the anointing them with consecrated oil From this conduct of Jacob and this Hebrew appel lative the learned Bochart with great ingenuity and reason insists that the name and veneration of the sacred stones called Baetyti so celebrated in all pagan antiquity were derived These Baetyti were stones of a round form they were supposed to be animated by means of magical incantations with a portion of the Deity they were consulted on occasions of great and pressing emer gency as a kind of divine oracles and were suspended either round the neck or some other part of the body Thus the setting up of a stone by this holy person in grateful memory of the celestial vision probably became the occasion of the idolatry in succeeding ages to these shapeless masses of unhewn stone of which so many astonishing remains are scattered up and down the Asiatic and the European world Maurice s Indian Antiquities vol ii p 355 Jacob calls the pillar which he had set up God s house It appears strange to as to hear a stone pillar called God s house being accustomed to give names of this kind to such buildings only as are capable of containing their worship pers within them But this is not the case in every part of the world as we learn from Major Symes s narrative of his Embassy to the kingdom of Ava The temples of that people vast as many of them are are built without cavity of any sort and he only mentions some of the most ancient of those at Pagahm as constructed otherwise The fol lowing extract will sufficiently illustrate this matter The object in Pegu that moat attracts and most merits notice is the noble edifice of Slwemadoo or the golden supreme This is a pyramidical building composed of brick and mortar without excavation or aperture of any sort octagonal at the base and spiral at the top Each side of the base measures one hundred and sixty two feet The extreme height of the edifice from the level of the country is three hundred and sixty one feet and above the interior terrace three hundred and thirty one feet Along the whole extent of the northern face of the upper terrace there is a wooden shed for the con venience of devotees who come from a distant part of the country There are several low benches near the foot of the temple on which the person who comes to pray places his offering commonly consisting of boiled rice a plate of sweetmeats or cocoa nuts fried in oil when it is given the devotee cares

understood it was the case with all that was brought The temple of Shoedagan about two miles and a half north of Rangoon is a very grand building although not so high by twenty five or thirty feet as that of Shoemadoo at Pegu The terrace on which it stands is raised on a rocky eminence considerably higher than the circumjacent country and is ascended by above a hundred stone steps The name of this temple which signifies Golden Dagon naturally recalls to mind the passage in the scriptures where the house of Dagon is mentioned and the image of idolatry bows down before the Holy Ark Many of the

offer sacrifice upon them if he lived and re turned safe and if he came again in such a condition he would give the tithe of what he had gotten to God He also judged the place to be honourable and gave it the name of Bethel which if explained in the Greek tongue is the House of God He then proceeded on his journey to Meso potamia and at length came to Haran and meeting with Shepherds in the suburbs with boys grown up and maidens sitting round a certain well he stayed with them as wanting water to drink and beginning to discourse with them he asked them whether they knew such an one as Laban and whether he were still alive they all said they knew him for he was not so inconsiderable a per son as to be unknown to any of them and that his daughter fed her father s flock together with them and that indeed they wondered she was not yet come  for by her means said they  thou mightest learn more exactly whatever thou desirest to know about that family While they were speak ing the damsel came and the other shep herds that came with her Then they shewed her Jacob and told her that he was a stran ger who came to inquire about her father s affairs But she being pleased after the custom of children with Jacob s coming asked him who he was and whence he came and what it was he wanted that he came thither She also wished it might be in their power to supply his wants Jacob was quite overcome not so much by their kindred nor by that affection which might arise thence as by his love to the damsel and his surprise at her beauty which was such as few of the women of that age could vie with He then said There is a relation between thee and me elder than either of our births if thou be the daughter of Laban For Abraham was the son of Terah as well as Haran and Nahor Of the last of whom Nahor Bethuel thy grandfather was the son Isaac my father was the son of Abraham and of Sarah who was the daughter of Haran But there is a nearer and later  By this deprivation of the kingdom that was to be given Esau of God as the first born it appears that Jose phus thought a kingdom to be derived of God was due to him whom Isaac should bless as his first born which I take to be that kingdom which was expected under the cement of mutual kindred which we bear to one another For my mother Rebeka was sister to Laban thy father both by the same father and mother I therefore and thou are cousin germans and I am now come to salute thee and to renew that affinity which is proper between us At the mention of Re beka the damsel wept and that out of the kindness she had for her father and em braced Jacob she having learned an ac count of Rebeka from her father and knew that her parents loved to hear her named and when she had saluted him she said that he brought the most desirable and greatest pleasure to her father with all their family who was always mentioning his mother and always thinking of her and her alone and this said she will make thee equal in his eyes to any advantageous circumstance what soever Then she bid him follow her while she conducted him to her father not wishing to deprive Laban of such a pleasure by stay ing any longer away from him When she had said thus she brought him to Laban and being owned by his uncle he was secure himself as being among his friends to whom his unexpected arrival gave great pleasure But a little while afterward Laban told him that he could not express in words the joy he had at his coming but still he inquired why he left his aged mother and father when they wanted to be taken care of by him and that he would afford him all the assistance he wanted Then Jacob gave him an account of the whole occasion of his jour ney and told him that Isaac had twin sons himself and Esau and that his brother hav ing failed of his father s prayers which by his mother s wisdom were put up for him sought to kill him as deprived of the king dom which was to be given him of God and of the blessings for which their father prayed and that this was the occasion of his coming hither as his mother had commanded him For said he we are all brethren one to another but our mother esteems an alliance with your family more than she does one with the families of the country so I Messiah who therefore was to be born of his posterity whom Isaac should so bless Jacob therefore by ob taining this blessing of the first born became the genuine heir of that kingdom in opposition to Esau aN 1800 39 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS look upon yourself and God to be the sup porters of my travels and think myself safe in my present circumstances Laban now promised to treat him with great humanity both on account of his an cestors and particularly for the sake of his mother towards whom he said he would shew his kindness even though she were absent by taking care of him For he assured him he would make him the head shepherd of his flock and gave him authority sufficient for that purpose and when he should be inclined to return to his parents he would send him back with presents and this in as honourable a manner as their consanguinity should re quire Jacob heard these promises gladly and said he would willingly undergo any sort of pains while he tarried with him but de sired as the reward of those pains that he might be permitted to marry Rachel who was not only on other accounts esteemed by him but also because she was the means of his coming to him for he said he was forced by the love of the damsel to make this pro posal Laban was pleased with this agree ment and consented to give the damsel to him if he would stay with him some time for he was not willing to send his daughter to be among the Canaanites for he repented of the alliance he had made already by mar rying his sister there And when Jacob had given his consent to this he agreed to serve is father in law seven years that by giving a specimen of his virtue it might be better known what sort of a man he was When the stated time was expired Laban made the wedding feast but when it was night without Jacob s perceiving it he put his other daugh ter into bed to him who was both elder than Rachel and of no comely countenance Jacob slept with her that night but when it was day he knew what had been done to him and complained of this unfair proceeding Laban asked pardon for that necessity which forced him to do what he did for he said he did not give him Lea out of any ill design but as overcome by another greater necessity that notwithstanding this nothing should hinder him from marrying Rachel but that when he had served another seven years he would  Gen xxix 28 t Here we have the difference between slaves for life and servants such as we nOw hire for a time agreed upon voL I â No 4 give him her whom he loved Jacob sub mitted to this condition for his loye to the damsel did not permit him to do otherwise and when seven years more were expired he took Rachel to wife Now each of these had handmaids by their father s donation Zilpha was handmaid to Lea and Bilba to Rachel by no means slaves f but subject to their mistresses Now Lea was sorely troubled at her husband s love to her sister and she expected she should be better esteemed if she bare him children She therefore in treated God perpetually and when she had borne a son and her husband was on that account better reconciled to her she named her son Reubel because God had had mercy upon her in giving her a son for that is the signification of this name After some time she bare three more sons Simeon which name signifies that God had hearkened to her prayer Levi the confirmer of their friendship and Judah which denotes thanks giving But Rachel fearing lest the fruit fulness of her sister should estrange Jacob s affection from herself gave him her handmaid Bilba by whom Jacob had Dan one may interpret that name into the Greek tongue a divine judgment and after him Nephthalim as it were unconquerable in stratagems since Rachel tried to conquer the fruitfulness of her sister by this stratagem Accordingly Lea took the same method and used a counter stratagem to that of her sister s for she gave Jacob her own handmaid Zilpha by whom he had a son whose name was Gad which may be interpreted fortune and after him Asher which may be called a happy man because he added glory to Lea Now Reubel the eldest son of Lea brought apples of mandrakes to his mother When Rachel saw them she desired that she would give her the apples for she longed to eat them but when she refused and bid her be content that she had deprived her of the be nevolence she ought to have had from her husband Rachel in order to mitigate her sister s anger said she would yield her hus band to her that evening She accepted of the favour and Jacob slept with Lea who bare then these sons Issachar denoting one onboth sides and dismiss again after the time contracted for is over who are no slaves but free men and free women 40 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS born by hire and Zebulon one born as a pledge of benevolence towards her and a daughter Dina After some time Rachel had a son named Joseph which signified there should be another added to him Now Jacob fed the flocks of Laban all this time being twenty years after which he de sired permission to take his wives and go home but when his father in law would not give him leave he contrived to do it secretly He made trial therefore of the disposition of his wives what they thought of this jour ney When they appeared glad and ap proved of it Rachel took along with her the images of the gods which according to their laws they used to worship in their own coun try and ran away together with her sister Their children also and their handmaids and what possessions they had went along with them Jacob also drove away half the cattle without letting Laban know of it beforehand but the reason why Rachel took the images of the gods although Jacob had taught her to despise such worship was this that in case they were pursued and taken by her father she might have recourse to these images in order to obtain his pardon Laban after one day being acquainted with Jacob s and his daughters departure was much troubled and pursued after them leading a band of men with him and on the seventh day overtook them and found them resting on a certain hill but he did not then meddle with them for it was even tide God stood by him in a dream the same night and warned him to receive his son in law and his daughters in a peaceable manner and not to venture upon any thing rashly or in wrath to them but to make a league with Jacob as suring him that if he despised their small number and attacked them in an hostile man ner he would himself assist them Laban having been thus forewarned by God called Jacob to him the next day in order to treat with him and shewed him what dream he had in dependence whereon he came confidently to him and began to accuse him alledging that he had entertained him when he was poor and in want and had given him plenty of all things which he had For said he  I have joined my daughters to thee in marriage and supposed that thy   From about an 1801 to 1714 B C kindness to me would be greater than before but thou hast had no regard to either thy own mother s relation to me nor to the affinity more recently contracted between us nor to those wives whom thou hast married nor to those children of whom I am the grandfather thou hast treated me as an enemy by driving away my cattle and by persuading my daugh ters to run away from their father and by carrying home those sacred paternal images which were worshipped by my forefathers and which have been honoured with worship by myself In short thou hast done this whilst thou wert my kinsman and my sister s son and the husband of my daughters and wast hospitably treated by me and didst eat at my table When Laban had said this Jacob replied in his defence that he was not the only per son in whom God had implanted the love of his native country but that he had made it natural to all men and therefore it was but reasonable that after so long time he should go back to it But as to the prey said he  of whose driving away thou accusest me if any other person were the arbitrator thou wouldst be found in the wrong for in stead of those thanks I ought to have had from thee for both keeping thy cattle and increasing them how is it that thou art un justly angry because I have taken a small portion of them but then as to thy daugh ters it is not through any evil practices of mine that they follow me in my return home but from that just affection which wives na turally have for their husbands they follow therefore not so properly myself as their own children Thus far his apology was made in order to clear himself from the charge of injustice to which he added his own complaint and accusation of Laban say ing While I was thy sister s son and thou hadst given me thy daughters in marriage thou hast worn me out with thy harsh com mands and detained me twenty years under them that indeed which was required in order to my marrying thy daughters hard as it was I own to have been tolerable but as to those that were put upon me after those marriages they were worse and such indeed as an enemy would have avoided For cer tainly Laban had used Jacob very ill for when he saw that God was assisting to Jacob AM 1800 J 41 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in all that he desired he promised him that of the young cattle which should be born he should have sometimes what was of a white colour and sometimes what should be of a black colour but when those that came to Jacob s share proved numerous he did not keep his faith with him but said he would give them to him the next year because of his envying him the multitude of his posses sions He promised him as before because he thought such an increase was not to be ex Eected but when it appeared to be the fact e again deceived him But with regard to the sacred images Jacob bid them search for them and when Laban accepted of the offer Rachel being informed of it put those images in that camel s saddle on which she rode and sat upon it and by a well timed excuse evaded the ne cessity of rising up s0 Laban left off search ing any farther not supposing that his daugh ter would conceal his images He then made a league with Jacob that he would not bear him any malice on account of what had hap pened and Jacob made the like league and promised to love Laban s daughters and these leagues they confirmed with oaths upon certain mountains whereon they erected a pillar in the form of an altar whence that hill is called Gilead and from thence they call that land the Land of Gilead at this day Now when they had feasted t after making the league Laban returned home CHAP XX of Jacob s interview with his brother esau N OW as Jacob was proceeding on his journey to the land of Canaan angels appeared to him and suggested to him good hope of his future condition and that place he named the Camp of God and being de sirous of knowing his brother s intentions he sent messengers to give him an exact account of every thing being afraid on account of the enmity between them He charged those that were sent to say to Esau that  Jacob had thought it wrong to live together with him while he was incensed against him and so had gone out of the country but now thinking the time of his absence must have made up their differences was returning that he brought with him his wives and his chil dren with what possessions he had gotten and delivered himself with what was most dear to him into his hands and should think it his greatest happiness to partake together with his brother of what God had bestowed on him When this message was delivered Esau was very glad and met his brother with four hundred men but when Jacob heard that he was coming to meet him with such a number he was greatly afraid However he com mitted his hope of deliverance to God and considered how in his present circumstances he might preserve himself and those that were with him and overcome his enemies if they attacked him injuriously He there fore distributed his company into parts some he sent before the rest and the others he ordered to come close behind that if the first were overpowered when his brother at tacked them they might have those that fol lowed as the refuge to flee unto and when he had put his company in this order he sent some of them to his brother with presents of cattle and a great number of four footed beasts of many kinds such as would be very  Gen xxxi 35 t Gen xxxi 55 J This league appears to have been made with peculiar circumstances especially with the singular rite of making an heap of stones and eating upon it and setting up one stone for a pillar Gen xxxi 45 46 Niebuhr relating his audience with the rinam of Yemen says  I had gone from mylod ings indisposed and by standing so long found myself so faint that I was obliged to ask permission to quit the room I found near the door some of the principal officers of the court who were sitting in a scattered man ner in the shade upon stones by the side of the wall Among them was the Nakit the general or rather master of the horse Cheir Allah with whom I had some ac quaintance before He immediately resigned nis place to me and applied himself to draw together stones into an heap to build himself a new seat This management might be owing to various causes The extreme heat of the ground might render sitting there disagreeable The same inconvenience might arise also from its wetness It was certainly a very common practice and as t appears from the instance of Jacob a very ancient one Harmer t Observations Vol iii p 215 B II Jacob appears to have been very cautious in conduct ing both his family and his flocks in their journey He was particularly desirous of preserving them They would have been exposed to great danger by haste Prepared as the Arabs are for speedy flight a quick motion is very destructive to the young of their flocks Chardin says Their flocks feed down the places of their encampmen 42 book I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS acceptable to those that received them on account of their rarity Those who were sent proceeded at certain intervals of space asun der that by following thick one after another they might appear to be the more numerous that Esau might remit of his anger on ac count of these presents if he were still unap peased Instructions were also given to those that were sent to speak submissively to him When Jacob had made these appointments and night came on he began to move with his company and as they were gone over a certain river called Jabboc Jacob was left behind and meeting with an angel he wrestled with him the angel beginning the struggle but he prevailed over the angel who used a voice and spake to him in words exhorting him to be pleased with what had happened to him and not to suppose that his victory was a trifling one but that he had overcome a divine angel and to esteem the victory as a sign of great blessings that should come to him and that his offspring should never fail and that no man should be too hard for his power He also commanded him to be called Israel which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that struggled with the divine angel These promises were made at the prayer of Jacob for when he perceived him to be the angel of God he desired he would signify to him what should befal him hereafter and when the angel had said what is before related he disappeared Jacob was pleased with these things and named the Slace Phanuel which signifies the face of God iut when he felt pain by this struggling upon his broad sinews he abstained from eating that sinew himself afterward and for his sake it is still not eaten by us t When Jacob understood that his brother was approaching he ordered his wives to go before each by herself with the handmaids that they might see the actions of the men as they were fighting if Esau were so disposed He then went and bowed down to his brother Esau who had no evil design upon him but saluted him J and asked him about the company of the children and of the women and desired when he had understood all he wanted to know about them that he would go along with him to their father but Jacob pretending that the cattle were weary Esau returned to Seir for there was his place of habitation which he had named roughness from his own hairy roughness CHAP XXI OF THE VIOLATION OF DINa s CHA3TIT AFTER this interview Jacob came to the place till this day called Succoth or Tents whence he went to Shechem a city of the Canaanites Now as the Shechemites were keeping a festival Dina who was the only daughter of Jacob went into the city to see the women of that country but when Shechem the son of Hamor the king saw her he defiled her by violence and being greatly in love with her he desired his father to procure the damsel for him in marriage To this request Hamor acceded and came to Jacob desiring permission that his son Shechem might according to law marry Dina but Jacob not knowing how to deny the desire of one of such great dignity and yet not thinking it lawful to marry his daugh ter to a stranger intreated leave to have a previous consultation So the king went away in hopes that Jacob would approve of this marriage but Jacob informed his sons of the defilement of their sister and of the ad dress of Hamor and desired them to give him their advice what they should do Upon this the greatest part said nothing not knowing what advice to give but Simeon and Levi the brethren of the damsel by the same mother agreed between themselves upon the action following it being now the time of a festival when the Shechemites were em so quick by the great numbers which they have that they are obliged to remove them too often which is very de structive to their flocks on account of the young ones which have not strength enough to follow This cir cumstance shews the energy of Jacob s apology to Esau for not attending him Harmer s Observations i 126 B  Perhaps this may be the proper meaning of the word Israel by the present and the old Jerusalem analogy of the Hebrew tongue But it is certain that the Hellenists of the first century in Egypt and elsewhere interpreted Is ra el to be a man seeing God t Gen xxxii 32  When Jacob and Esau met they saluted each other Esau ran to meet Jacob embraced him fell on his neck and kissed him Gen xxxiii 4 Such persons as are intimately acquainted or of equal age and dignity mutually kiss the hand the head or the shoulder of each other Shaw s Trav p 237 B as 1781 3 43 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ployed in ease and feasting they fell upon the watch when they were asleep and en tering into the city slew all the males as also the king and his son with them but spared the women and when they had done this without their father s consent they brought away their sister Now while Jacob was astonished at this daring act and was severely blaming his sons for it God stood by him f and bid him be of good courage but to purify his tents and to offer those sacrifices which he had vowed to offer when he went first into Mesopotamia and saw his vision As he was therefore Eurifying his followers he found the gods of iaban for he did not before know they were stolen by Rachel and he hid them in the earth under an oak in Shechem and de parting thence he offered sacrifice at Bethel the place where he saw his vision when he went first into Mesopotamia When he was gone thence and was come over against Ephrata he there buried Ra chel who died in childbed she was the only one of Jacob s kindred that had not the honour of burial at Hebron and when he had mourned for her a great while he called the son that was born of her Benjamin be cause of the sorrow the mother had with him These are all the children of Jacob twelve males and one female of whom eight were legitimate viz six of Leah and two of Ra chel and four were of the handmaids two of each all whose names have been set down already CHAP XXII of Isaac s death and interment at hebron FROM thence Jacob went to Hebron a city situate among the Canaanites and the residence of Isaac and there they lived together for a little while for as to Rebeka Jacob did not find her alive Isaac also died not long after the coming of his son and was buried with his wife in Hebron where the family had a monument belonging to them from their forefathers Now Isaac was a man who was beloved of God and was vouchsafed great instances of providence by God after Abraham his father and lived to be exceed ing old for when he had lived virtuously one hundred and eighty five years he then died  Why Josephus has omitted the circumcision of these Shechemites as the occasion of their death and of Jacob s great grief as in the testament of Levi I cannot telh t Gen xxxv 1  Gen xxxv 19 II Since Benoni signifies the son of my sorrow and Benjamin the son of days or one born in the father s old age Gen xliv 20 I suspect Josephus s present copies to be here imperfect and suppose that in correspondence to other copies he wrote that Rachel called her son s name Benoni but his father called him Benjamin Gen xxxv 18 As for Benjamin as commonly explained the son of the right hand it makes no sense at all and seems to be a gross modern error only The Samaritan always writes this name truly Benjamin which probably is here of the same signification only with the Chaldee termination in instead of im

ESAU AND JACOB BY WHICH THE FORMER POSSESSED IDUMEA AND THE LATTER CANAAN AFTER the death of Isaac his sons divided their habitations respectively Nor did they retain what they had before but Esau departed from the city of Hebron and left it to his brother and dwelt in Seir and ruled over Idumea He called the country by that name from himself for he was named Adom on the following occasion He once returned from the toil of hunting very hungry when he was a child in age and met with his brother when he was get ting ready lentile pottage for his dinner it was of a very red colour on which account he the more earnestly longed for it and de sired some of it to eat But Jacob took ad vantage of his brother s hunger and forced him to give up his birth right and he being pinched with famine resigned it up to him under an oath Whence it came that on account of the redness of the pottage he was in way of jest by his contemporaries called Adom for the Hebrews call what is red Adom and this was the name given to this country But the Greeks gave it a more agreeable pronunciation and named it Idu mea He became the father of five sons of whom Jaus Jolomus and Coreus were by one wife whose name was Alibama but of the rest Aliphaz was born to him by Ada and Raguel by Basemath and these were the sons of Esau Aliphaz had five legitimate sons Theman Homer Sapphus Gotham and Ka naz for Amalek was not legitimate but by a concubine whose name was Thamna These dwelt in that part of Idumea which was called Gebelatis and that denominated from Amalek Amalekites for Idumea was a large country and preserved the name of the whole while in its several parts it kept the names of its peculiar inhabitants CHAP II OF JOSEPH THE YOUNGEST OF JACOB S SONS AND THE ENVY OF HIS BRETHREN IT happened that Jacob attained so great happiness as rarely any other person has arrived at he was richer than the rest of the inhabitants of that country and was at once envied and admired for such virtuous sons for they were deficient in nothing but were of great strength both for labouring with their hands and enduring of toil and shrewd also in understanding And God exercised such a providence over him and such a care of his happiness as to bring him the greatest blessings even out of what appeared to be the most sorrowful condition and to make him the cause of our forefathers departure out of Egypt him I say and his posterity The occasion was this when Jacob had this son Joseph born to him by Rachel his father loved him above the rest of his sons both because of the beauty of his body and the virtues of his mind for he excelled the rest aN 1780 45 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in prudence This affection of his father ex cited the envy and the hatred of his brethren as did also his dreams which he related to his father and to them which foretold his future happiness it being usual with man kind to envy their very nearest relation such prosperity Now the visions which Joseph saw in his sleep were these When they were in the middle of harvest and Joseph was sent with his brethren to gather the fruits of the earth he saw a vision in a dream greatly exceeding the customary appearances that come when we are asleep which when he got up he told his brethren that they might judge what it portended He said he saw the last night that his wheat sheaf stood still in the place where he set it but that their sheafs ran to bow down to it as servants bow down to their masters But as soon as they perceived the vision foretold that he should obtain power and great wealth and that his power should be in opposition to them they gave no interpretation of it to Joseph as if the dream were not understood by them But they prayed that no part of what they suspected to be its meaning might come to pass and their hatred against him was augmented on that account But God in opposition to their envy sent a second vision to Joseph which was more wonderful than the former for it seemed to him that the sun took with him the moon and the rest of the stars and came down to the earth and bowed down to him f He told this vision to his father and that as sus pecting nothing of ill will from his brethren when they were there also and desired him to interpret what it should signify Now Jacob was pleased with the dream for con sidering the prediction in his mind and shrewdly and wisely guessing at its meaning he rejoiced at the great things thereby sig nified because it declared the future hap piness of his son and that by the blessing of God the time should come when he should be honoured and thought worthy of worship by his parents and brethren as guessing that the moon and sun were like his mother and fatherâ the former as she that gave increase and nourishment to all things and the latter he that gave form and all other powers  Gen xxxvii 1 t Gen xxxvii 9 to them and that the stars were like his brethren since they were eleven in number as were the stars that receive their power from the sun and moon And thus did Jacob make a shrewd judg ment of this vision but these interpretations caused great grief to Joseph s brethren and they were affected to him hereupon as if he were a stranger that was to have those good things which were signified by the dreams and not as one that was a brother with whom it was probable they should be joint par takers and as they had been partners in the same parentage so should they be of the same happiness They also resolved to kill the lad and having fully ratified that in tention as soon as their collection of the fruits was over they went to Shechem which is a country good for feeding of cattle and for pasturage there they fed their flock without acquainting their father with their removal Jacob therefore had melancholy suspicions about them as being ignorant of his sons condition and receiving no mes senger from the flocks that could inform him of their true state he sent Joseph to learn the circumstances his brethren were in and to bring him word how they did CHAP III of Joseph s cruel treatment by his brethren his slavery and subsequent greatness in egypt NOW these brethren rejoiced as soon as they saw their brother coming to them not indeed as at the presence of a near re lation or even as one sent by their father but as at the presence of an enemy and one that by divine providence was delivered into their hands and they already resolved to kill him and not let slip the opportunity that lay before them But when Reubal the eldest brother saw them thus disposed and that they had agreed together to execute their purpose he tried to restrain them Â shewing them the heinous enterprise they were going about and the horrid nature of it that this action would appear wicked in the sight of God and impious before men even though they should kill one not related to them but more flagitious and detestable to appear to  Gen xxxvii 21 4G book II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS have slain their own brother by which act the father must be treated unjustly in the son s slaughter and the mother also be in perplexity while she laments that her son is taken away from her and this not in a natural way He therefore intreated them to have a regard to their own consciences and wisely to consider what mischief would befal them upon the death of so good a child and their youngest brother and they would also fear God who was already both a spectator and a witness of the designs they had against their brother that he would love them if they abstained from this act and yielded to re pentance and amendment But in case they proceeded to do the fact all sorts of punish ments would overtake them from God since they polluted his providence which was every where present and which did not over look what was done either in deserts or in cities For wherever a man is there ought he to suppose that God is also He told them farther that their consciences would be their enemies if they attempted to go through so wicked an enterprise which they never can avoid whether it be a good conscience or whether it be such a one as they will have within them when once they have killed their brother He also added that it was not a righteous thing to kill a brother though he had injured them that it was a good thing to forget the actions of such near friends even in things wherein they might seem to have offended but that they were going to kill Joseph who had been guilty of nothing that was ill towards them in whose case the in firmity of his tender years should rather procure him mercy and induce them to unite in the care of his preservation He likewise observed that the cause of killing him made the act itself much worse while they deter mined to take him off out of envy at his future prosperity an equal share of which they would naturally partake while he enjoyed it since they were to him not strangers but the nearest relations for they might reckon upon what God bestowed upon Joseph as their own and that it was fit for them to believe that the anger of God would for this cause be more severe upon them if they slew him who was judged by God to be worthy of that prosperity which was to be hoped for and while by murdering him they made it impos sible for God to bestow it upon him Reuben said these and many other things and likewise used intreaties to divert them from the murder of their brother but when he saw that his discourse had not mollified them at all and that they prepared to do the fact he advised them to alleviate the wicked ness they were going about in a manner of taking Joseph off for as he had exhorted them first when they were going to revenge themselves to be dissuaded from doing it so since the sentence for killing their brother had prevailed he said that they would not be so grossly guilty if they would be persuaded to follow his present advice which would in clude what they were so eager about but was not so very bad but in the distress they were in of a lighter nature He begged of them therefore not to kill their brother with their own hands but to cast him into the pit that was hard by and so to let him die by which they would gain so much that they would not defile their own hands with his blood To this the young men readily agreed so Reuben took the lad and tied him to a cord and let him down gently into the pit for it had no water in it and when he had done this he went his way to seek for such pasturage as was proper for feeding their flocks But Judas being one of Jacob s sons also seeing some Arabians of the posterity of Ishmael carrying spices and Syrian wares out of the land of Gilead to the Egyptians after Reuben was gone advised his brethren to draw Joseph out of the pit and sell him

to him he made no answer he was afraid that they had de stroyed him after he was gone he accord ingly complained to his brethren but was pacified when they had told him what they had done When Joseph s brethren had done thus to him they considered how they should escape ihe suspicions of their father Now they had taken away from Joseph the coat which he had on when he came to them at the time they let him down into the pit so they thought proper to tear that coat to pieces and to dip it into goat s blood and then to carry it and shew it to their father that he might believe he was destroyed by wild beasts and when they had so done they came to the old man but this not till what had happened to his son had already come to his knowledge Then they said that they had not seen Joseph nor knew what mishap had befallen him but that they had found his coat bloody and torn to pieces whence they had a suspicion that he had fallen among wild beasts and so perished if that were the coat he had on when he came from home Jacob had before some better hopes that his son was only made a captive but now he laid aside that notion and considered this coat as a sufficient proof of his death for he well remembered that this was the coat he had on when he sent him to his brethren He therefore lamented the lad as now dead  and as if he had been the father of no more than one without taking any comfort in the rest and so he was also affected with his misfortune before he met with Joseph s brethren when he also conjectured that Joseph was destroyed by wild beasts He sat down also clothed in sackcloth and in heavy affliction insomuch that he found no ease when his sons comforted him f neither was his sorrow assuaged by length of time CHAP IV or Joseph s signal continent NOW Potiphar an Egyptian who was chief cook to king I haraoh bought Joseph of the merchants J He had him in the greatest honour taught him the learning that became a free man and gave him leave to make use of a diet better than was allotted to slaves he also entrusted the care of his house to him Joseph however did not for get that virtue which he had before upon such a change of his condition but he de monstrated that wisdom was able to govern the uneasy passions of life in such as have it in reality and do not only put it on for a shew under a present state of prosperity His master s wife soon fell in love with him both on account of his beauty of body and his skilful management of affairs and sup posed that if she should make it known to him she should easily persuade him to come to her bed and that he would consider it as a piece of happy fortune that his mistress should intreat him as regarding that state of slavery he was in and not his moral cha racter which continued after his condition was changed So she made known her illicit inclinations however he rejected her in treaties not thinking it agreeable to religion to yield so far to her as to do what would tend to the injury of one who had purchased him and vouchsafed him so great honours He therefore exhorted her to govern that passion and laid before her the impossibility of obtaining her desires which he thought might be conquered if she had no hope of succeeding and he said that as to himself he would endure any thing whatever before be would be persuaded to it for although it was the duty of a slave as he was to do nothing contrary to his mistress he might well be excused in a case where the contra diction was to such sort of commands but  Jacob is represented by Moses not only as being clothed in sackcloth but as rending his clothes on this occasion Rending the clothes was an eastern way of ex pressing either grief for calamity or horror for sin Reuben was the first we read of who to denote his exceeding sor row rent his clothes and as Jacob we find does the like we may well suppose that it was an usual manner of expressing all grief and uneasiness of mind in those days and by putting on sackcloth which Jacob is voL I No 4 here the first precedent of doing but was afterwards commonly used upon all mournful occasions he seemed to signify that since he had lost his beloved son he looked upon himself as reduced to the meanest and lowest condition of life Bibliotheca Bibl and HaweWs History B t Gen xxxvii 35 t Gen xxxix 1 48 book n ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS this opposition of Joseph s when she did not expect it made her still more violent in her love to him and she resolved to accomplish her design by a second attempt When therefore there was a festival coming on in which it was the custom for women to come to the public solemnity she pretended to her husband that she was sick as contriving an opportunity for solitude and leisure that she might entreat Joseph again This opportunity being obtained she used more kind words to him than before and said that it had been good for him to have yielded to her first solicitation and to have given her no repulse both because of the reverence he ought to bear to her dignity who solicited him and because of the vehemency of her passion by which she was forced though she were his mistress to condescend beneath her dignity But that he might now by taking more prudent advice wipe off the imputation of his former folly for whether it were that he expected the repetition of her solicitations she had now made it and that with greater earnestness than before for that she had pre tended sickness on this very account and had preferred his conversation before the festival and its solemnity or whether he opposed her former discourses as not believing she could be in earnest she now gave him sufficient security by thus repeating her application that she meant not in the least by fraud to impose on him and assured him that if he complied with her affections he might expect the enjoyment of the advantages he already had and if he were submissive to her he should have still greater advantages but that he must look for revenge and hatred from her in case he rejected her desires and pre ferred the reputation of chastity before his mistress for that he would gain nothing by such procedure as she would then become his accuser and would falsely pretend to her husband that he attempted her chastity and that Potiphar would hearken to her words rather than to his let his be ever so agree able to the truth But though the woman said thus and even with tears in her eyes Joseph was not dis suaded from his chastity nor induced by fear to a compliance with her but he opposed alike her solicitations and her threatenings and was afraid to do an ill thing choosing rather to undergo the sharpest punishment than to enjoy his present advantages by doing what his own conscience knew would justly deserve that he should die for it He also reminded her that she was a married woman and that she ought to cohabit with her hus band only and desired her to suffer these considerations to have more weight with her than the short pleasure of lustful dalliance which would occasion trouble and repentance afterwards and yet would not amend what had been done amiss He also suggested the fear she would be in lest they should be caught and that the advantage of conceal ment was uncertain and that only while the wickedness was not known would there be any quiet for them But that she might have the enjoyment of her husband s company without any danger and he told her that in the company of her husband she might have great boldness from a good conscience both before God and before men nay that she would act more consistently as his mistress and make use of her authority over him bet ter while she persisted in her chastity than when they were both ashamed for what wick edness they had been guilty of and that it is much better to depend on a good life known to have been so than upon the hopes of the concealment of evil practices Joseph by saying this and more tried to restrain the violent passion of the woman and to reduce her affections within the rules of reason but she grew more ungovernable and earnest in the matter and since she despaired of persuading him she laid her hands upon him and had recourse to violence But as soon as Joseph had got away from her anger leaving his garment with her and leaped out of her chamber she was equally afraid lest he should discover her lewdness to her hus band and incensed at the affront he had offered her so she resolved to be before hand with him and to accuse him falsely to Poti phar and by that means to revenge herself for his pride and contempt thinking it a wise thing in itself and also becoming a woman thus to prevent his accusation Accordingly she sat sorrowfully and in confusion framing herself so hypocritically and angrily that the sorrow which was really occasioned by her disappointment might appear to be for an attempt upon her chastity so that when her AK 1769 49 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS husband came home and enquired what was the cause of the disorder she was in she be gan to accuse Joseph O husband said she mayest thou not live a day longer if thou dost not punish the wicked slave who hast desired to defile thy bed who has neither recollected who he was when he came to our house so as to be have himself with modesty nor has been mindful of what favours he had received from thy bounty though he must be an ungrateful man indeed in every respect not to act agreeable to us This man I say laid a private design to abuse thy wife and this at the time of a festival observing when thouwouldst be absent so that it now is clear that his mo desty as it appeared to be formerly was only because of the restraint he was in out of  fear of thee but that he was not really of a good disposition This has been occasioned by his being advanced to honour beyond what he deserved or hoped for insomuch that he concluded that he who was deemed fit to be trusted with thy estate and the government of thy family and was preferred above thy eldest servants might be allowed to touch thy wife also When she had spoken thus she produced Joseph s garment as if he had left it with her when he attempted to force her Potiphar not being able to disbelieve what his wife said and what he saw himself and being seduced by his love did not set himself about the examination of the truth but condemning Joseph as a wicked man he threw him into the malefactor s prison and had a still higher opinion of his wife and bare her witness that she was a woman of a be coming modesty and chastity CHAP V of Joseph s situation in prison and his subsequent liberation TOW Joseph commending all his affairs J3 to God did not attempt to make any defence nor to relate the exact circumstances of the fact but silently underwent the bonds and the distress he was in firmly believing  There is something not unlike the revengeful artifice in Potiphar s wife in the representation which the poet makes of Phaedra when in an affair of the like nature she finds herself rejected by her son in law Hippoly tus Regeramus ipsa crimen atque ultro impiam that God who knew the cause of his affliction and the truth of the fact would be more powerful than those that inflicted the punish ment upon him He accordingly soon re ceived a proof of God s providence on his behalf for the keeper of the prison taking notice of his care and fidelity in the affairs he had set him about and the dignity of his countenance relaxed his bonds and thereby made his heavy calamity lighter and more supportable to him he also permitted him to make use of a diet better than that of the rest of the prisoners Now his fellow prisoners when their hard labours were over used to discourse with each other being equal sufferers and to inquire one of another what were the occasions of their being condemned to a prison Among them Pharaoh s cup bearer and one that had been respected by him was put in bonds upon the king s anger at him This man was under the same bonds with Joseph and soon grew familiar with him and upon his observing that Joseph had a better understanding than the rest he told him of a dream he had and desired he would interpret its meaning complaining that be sides the afflictions he underwent from the king God also added to him trouble from his dreams  He therefore said that in his sleep he saw three clusters of grapes hanging upon three branches of a vine large and ripe for gather ing and that he squeezed them into a cup which the king held in his hands and when he had strained the wine he gave it to the king to drink and that he received it from him with a pleasant countenance This he said was what he saw and he desired Jo seph that if he had any portion of under standing in such matters he would tell him what this vision foretold Joseph bid him be of good cheer and expect to be loosed from his bonds in three days time because the king desired his service and was about to restore it to him again for he let him know that God bestows the fruit of the vine upon men for good which wine is poured out to him and is the pledge of fidelity and â â â Venerem arguamus c Adeste Athena fida tamulorum manus Fer opem c  Ed

that has thus dis tressed us though it were for our own plea sure The cup bearer rejoiced to hear such an interpretation of his dream and waited the completion of what had been thus shewed him beforehand Another servant of the king s who had been chief baker and was now bound in prison with the cup bearer was in good hope upon Joseph s interpretation of the other s vision for he had dreamed also so he desired that Joseph would tell him what the visions he had seen the night before might mean I thought said he that I carried three bas kets upon my head two were full of loaves and the third full of sweet theats and other eataBles such as are prepared for kings but the fowls came flying and ate them all up and had no regard to my attempt to drive them away He then expected a prediction lik e to that of the cup tfea rer s but Joseph considering the dream said to him that he would willingly be an interpreter of good events to him arid riot of such as his dream pronounced tint he told him that he had ortTy three days to live as the three baskets signified but that on the third day he should be crucified and devoured by fowls while he wÂ s not able to help himself Now both these dreams had the same events that Joseph fbretold they should have and this to both parties for on the third day when the king solemnized his birth day he crucified the chief baker but set the butler free from his bonds and restored him to his former service God freed Joseph from his confinement after he had endured his bonds two years J and had received no assistance from the cup bearer who did not remember what he had said to him formerly and God contrived this method of deliverance for him Pharaoh the king had seen in his sleep the same evening two visions and after them had the interpre tation of them both given him he haT br gotten the latter but retained that of ie dreams themselves Being therefore troubl at what he had seen for it seemed to him to be all of a melancholy nature the next day he called together the wisest men among the Egyptians desiring to learn from them the An 1767 t The expression which Joseph makes use of concern ing the king s cup bearer and baker Pharaoh shall lift up thy head seems somewhat too literally translated since the words in the original mean no more than that Pharaoh would have them brought forth and examined The an cients we are to know in keeping their reckonings or accounts of time or their list of domestic officers or ser Tants made use of tables with holes bored in them in which they put a sort of pegs or nails with broad heads exhibiting the particulars either number or name or whatever it was These nails or pegs the Jews call heads and the sockets of the heads they call bases The meaning therefore of Pharaoh s lifting up his head is that Pharaoh would take out the peg which had the cup bear er s name on the top of it to read it i e would sit in Judgment and make examination into his accounts For it seems very probable that both he and the baker had been either suspected or accused of having cheated the king and that when their accounts were examined and cast up the one was acquitted while the other was found guilty And though Joseph uses the same expression in both cases yet we may observe that speaking to the baker he adds that Pharaoh shall lift up thy head from off thee i e shall order thy name to be struck out of the list of his servants by taking the peg out of the socket Bibliotheca Bibl in locum B J Gen xl 18 II The Chaldeans of old were the most famous people in the world for divinations of all kinds and therefore it is very probable that the word Hhartaumim which we render magicians is not of Hebrew but Chaldet origin The roots however from whence it springs if it be a compound word as probably it is are not so visible and therefore commentators are perplexed to know by what method men of this profession proceeded in their inquiry into secret things whether they pretended to ex pound dreams and descry future events by natural obser vations by the art of astrology which came much in re quest in future ages by such rules as are now found in the books of Oneirocrites or by certain characters images pictures and figures which were engraved with magical rites and ceremonies It is not to be doubted indeed but that the magicians whom Pharaoh consulted for the inter  an 1769 51 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  interpretation of his dreams but when they fesitated about them the king was so much the more disturbed And now it was that the memory of Joseph s skill came into the mind of the king s cup bearer when he saw the confusion Pharaoh was in so he came and mentioned Joseph to him as also the vision he had seen in prison and how the event proved as he had said as also that the chief baker was crucified on the very same day and that this also happened to him according to the interpretation of Joseph that Joseph himself was laid in bonds by Potiphar as a slave but he said he was one of the noblest of the stock of the Hebrews and that his father lived in great splendour If there fore said he  thou wilt send for him and not despise him on account of his misfortunes thou wilt learn what thy dreams signify The king thereby commanded that they should bring Joseph into his presence and those who received the command came and brought him with them having taken care of his habit that it might be decent as the king had enjoined them to do The king took him by the hand and said O young man for my servant bears witness that thou art at present the best and most skilful person I can consult with vouchsafe me the same favours which thou bestowed on this servant of mine and tell me what events are predicted by the visions of my dreams and I desire thee to suppress nothing out of fear nor to flatter me with lying words or with what may please me although the truth should be of a melancholy nature It seemed to me that as I walked by the river I saw kine fat and very large seven in num ber going from the river to the marshes and other kine of the same number like them met pretations of his dreams made use of some at least if not all these arts and the jr wish doctors would make lis be lieve that after several attempts of divers kinds they came at last to this exposition that Pharaoh s daughters for they suppose him to have seven should die and that he should have seven others born to him in their stead but this being not at all satisfactory to their master put the cup bearer in mind of Joseph s great abilities that way Le Qerc s and Patrick s Commentary B   In Barhary one stalk of wheat or barley will some times bear two ears while each of these ears will ai often shoot out into a number of less ones thereby affording a most plentiful increase May not these large prolific ears when seven are said to come upon one stalk explain what voL I â No 5 them out of the marshes exceeding lean and ill favoured which ate up the fat and large kine and yet were no better than before and not less miserably pinched with famine After I had seen this vision I awoke out ol my sleep but being in disorder and con sidering with myself what this appearance should be I fell asleep again and saw another dream much more wonderful than the fore going which did still more affright and dis turb me I saw seven ears of corn growing out of one root having their heads borne down by the weight of the grains and bend ing down with the fruit which was now ripe and fit for reaping and near these I saw seven other ears of corn meagre and weak for want of rain which fell to eating and con suming those that were fit for reaping and put me into great astonishment Joseph replied This dream O king although seen under two forms signifies one and the same event of things for when thou sawest the kine which is an animal made for the plough and for labour devoured by the poorer kine and the cars of corn eaten up by the smaller ears they foretel a famine and want of the fruits of the earth for the same number of years and equal with those when Egypt was in a happy state and this so far that the plenty of these years will be spent in the same number of years of scarcity and that scarcity of necessary provisions will be very difficult to be corrected as a sign whereof the ill favoured kine when they had devoured the better sort could not be satis fied But still God foreshows what is to come upon men not to grieve them but that when they know it beforehand they may by pru dence make the actual experience of what is foretold the more tolerable If thou there is further mentioned of the seven fruitful years in Egypt that is that the earth brought forth by handfuls This latter passage may indeed mean that the earth brought forth handfuls of stalks from single grains and not handfuls of ears from single stalks agreeably to the follow ing passage from Dr Shaw In Barbary it is common to see one grain produce ten or fifteen stalks Even some grains of the munvaany wheat which I brought with me to Oxford and sowed in the physic garden threw out each of them fiftv Bnt Muzeratty one of the late kaleefas or viceroys of the

calamity will not be felt by the Egyptians Hereupon the king wondered at the dis cretion and wisdom of Joseph and asked him by what means he might so dispense the plentiful crops in the happy years as to make the miserable crops more tolerable Joseph then added this advice to spare the good crops and not permit the Egyptians to spend them luxuriously but to reserve what they would have spent in luxury beyond their necessity against the time of want He also exhorted him to take the corn of the husband men and give them only so much as might suffice for their food Accordingly Pharaoh being surprised at Joseph not only for his interpretation of the dream but for the coun sel he had given entrusted him with dis pensing the corn with the power to do what he thought would be for the benefit of the Eeople of Egypt and for the benefit of the jng as believing that he who first disced vered this method of acting would prove the best overseer of it Joseph having this power given him by the king with leave to make use of his seal and to wear purple t drove in his chariot through all the land of Egypt  and took the corn of the husbandmen allot ting as much to every one as would be suffi cient for seed and for food but without d covering to any one the reason why he did so CHAP VI OF THE ARRIVAL OP JOSEPH S BRETHREN IN EGYPT AND HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS THEM JOSEPH was now grown up to thirty years of age and enjoyed great honours from the king who called him Psothom Phanech out of regard to his prodigious degree of wis dom for that name denotes a revealer of secrets He also married a wife of very high quality she was the daughter of Petephres Â one of the priests of Heliopolis and her name was Asenath By her he had children before the scarcity came on Manasseh the elder which signifies forgetful because his present happiness made him forget his former misfor tunes And Ephraim the younger which signifies restored because he was restored to the freedom of his forefathers Now after Egypt had happily passed over seven years according to Joseph s interpre tation of the dreams the famine came upon them on the eighth year and because this misfortune fell upon them when they had no sense of it before hand they were all sorely afflicted by it and came running to the king s  Joseph had his name changed on this occasion It was an ancient custom among eastern princes upon their promotion of any favourite to give him a new name Nebu chadnezzar we read Dan i 7 imposed new names upon DanieJ and his companions in Babylon and to this very day Mo rul never advances a man but he gives him a new name and that significative of something belonging to him but here the question is what is the meaning of the name which Pharaoh gave Joseph In the Hebrew text it is Zaphnah paaneah but in the Egyptian and Greek Penta teuch it is Pson thonphanech The oriental versions however are pretty unanimous in rendering it a revealer of secrets but there are some reasons why this should not be its true interpretation For the time that Pharaoh gave the patriarch this name was when he advanced him from the condition of an imprisoned slave to that of a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt and therefore it is reasonable to suppose that he gave it in commemoration of such promotion rather than of his expounding dreams because to have called him an interpreter of dreams only had been degrading him to the level of magicians Now if Pharaoh gave him this name in memory of his promo tion it was very likely that this name was strictly and properly Egyptian otherwise the common people could not have understood it though Moses in his recording it might endeayour to accommodate to the Hebrew idiom and if it was Egyptian the word in that language signifies what we call a prime minister or strictly the first or prince of the lords Biblintheca Bibl occas annot 41 B t To be arrayed in a rich dress and to ride in great pomp and ceremony were the ancient modes of investing with the highest degree of subordinate power in Egypt and with a small variation still remain so The history of the revolt of Ali Bey p 43 informs us that on the election of a new sheik bellet the pasha who approves of him invests him with a valuable fur treats him with sher bet and when the sheik bellet departs the pasha presents him with a horse richly caparisoned Harmer vol iii p 308 B t Gen xlv 42â 3 I That is bought it for Pharaoh at a very low price Â This Potiphar or as in Josephus Petephres who was now a priest of On or Heliopolis is the same name in Josephus and perhaps in Moses also with him who is be fore called the Head Cook or Captain of the Guard and to whom Joseph was sold See Gen xxxvii 36 xxxix 1 with xli 50 They are also affirmed to be one and the same person in the Testament of Joseph for he is there said to have married the daughter of his master and mis tress Nor is this a notion peculiar to that Testament but as Dr Bernard confesses common to Josephus to the Septuagint interpreters and toother learned Jews of old time  This intire ignorance of the Egyptians of these years ah 1756 53 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS gates and he called upon Joseph who sold the corn to them being become confessedly a saviour to the whole multitude of the Egyp tians Nor did he open this market of corn for the people of that country only but stran gers had liberty to buy also Joseph being willing that all men who are naturally akin to each other should have assistance from those that lived in happiness Jacob also when he understood that foreigners had this privilege sent all his sons into Egypt to buy corn for the land of Ca naan was grievously afflicted with the famine and this great misery touched the whole continent He only retained Benjamin who was born to him by Rachel and was of the same mother as Joseph These sons of Jacob then came into Egypt and applied them selves to Joseph to buy corn for nothing of this kind was done without his approbation since even the honour that was paid the king himself was only advantageous to the per sons that paid it when they took care to honour Joseph also Now when he well knew his brethren they thought nothing of him for he was but a youth when he left them and was now come to an age much greater that the lineaments of his face were changed and he was not known to them besides this the greatness of the dignity wherein he appeared suffered them not so much as to suspect the truth He therefore now made trial what sentiments they had about the affairs of the greatest consequence for he refused to sell them corn and said they were come as spies of the king s affairs and that they came from several countries and joined themselves together and pretended they were of kin it not being possible that a private man should breed up so many sons and those of so great a beauty of countenance as they were such an education of so many children being not easily obtained by kings themselves Now this he did in order to discover what con cerned his father and what happened to him after his own departure from him and as de siring to know what was become of Benjamin his brother for he was afraid that they had ventured on the like wicked enterprise against him that they had done to himself and had taken him off also Now these brethren of his were under dis traction and terror and thought that very great danger hung over them yet not at all reflecting upon their brother Joseph and standing firm under the accusations laid against them they made their defence by Reubel the eldest of them who now became their spokes man We come not hither said he  with any unjust design nor in order to bring any harm to the king s affairs we only want to be preserved as supposing your humanity might be a refuge for us from the miseries which our country labours under we have heard that you proposed to sell corn not only to your own countrymen but to strangers also and that you determined to allow that corn in order to preserve all that want it But that we are brethren and of the same common blood the peculiar lineaments of our face and those not much different from one another plainly shew Our father s name is Jacob an Hebrew who had twelve sons by four wives which twelve of us while we were all alive were a happy family But when one of our brethren whose name was Joseph died our affairs changed for the worse for our father could not forbear to of famine before they came told us before as well as here by Josephus seems almost incredible It is in no other copy that I know of  In scripture Joseph is represented as swearing by the life of Pharaoh Most authors take this for an oath the original of which is well explained by Mr Selden in his Titles of Honour p 45 where he observes that the names of gods being given to kings very early from the excellency of their heroic virtue which made them an ciently great benefactors to mankind thence arose the custom of swearing by them which Aben Ezra saith continued in his time about 1170 when Egypt was governed by caliphs It any man swore by the king s bead and were found to have sworn falsely he was punished capitally Extraordinary as this kind of oath which Joseph made use of may appear to us it still con tinues in the East Mr Hanway says the most sacred oath among the Persians is  by the king s head Trav vol i p 313 and among other instances of it we read in the travels of the Ambassadors p 204 there were but sixty horses for ninety four persons The Mehemander or conductor swore by the head of the king which is the greatest oath among the Persians that he could not pos sibly find any more And Thevenot says Trav p 97 part 2 his subjects never look upon him but with fear and trembling and they have such respect for him and pay so blind an obedience to his orders that how un just soever his commands might be they perform them though against the law both of God and nature Nay if they swear by the king s head their oath is more authentic and of greater credit than if they swore by all that is most sacred in heaven and upon earth 54 book II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS make a long lamentation for him and we are in affliction both by calamity of the death of our brother and the miserable state of our aged father We are now therefore come to buy corn having intrusted the care of our father and the provision of our family to Ben jamin our youngest brother and if thou sendest to our house thou mayest learn whe ther we are guilty of the least falsehood in what we say Thus did Reubel endeavour to persuade Joseph to have a better opinion of them but when he had learned that Jacob was alive and that his brother was not destroyed by them he for the present put them in prison as intending to examine more into their affairs when he should be at leisure But on the third day he brought them out and said to them Since you constantly affirm that you are not come to do any harm to the king s affairs that you are brethren and sons of the father whom you named you will satisfy me of the truth of what you say if you leave one of your company with me who shall suffer no injury here and if when you have carried corn to your father you will come to me again and bring your brother whom you say you left there along with you this shall be esteemed an assurance of the truth of what you have told me Hereupon they were in greater grief than before they wept and perpetually deplored one among another the calamity of Joseph and said they were fallen into this misery as a punishment in flicted by God for the evil contrivances they had against him And Reubel reproached them for their too late repentance whence no profit arose to Joseph and earnestly ex horted them to bear with patience whatever they suffered since it was done by God in way of punishment on his account Thus they spake to one another not imagining that Joseph understood their language A general sadness also seized on them at Reubel s words and a repentance for what they had done and they condemned the wickedness they had perpetrated for which they judged they were justly punished by God JNow when Joseph saw that they were in this dis tress he was so affected that he burst into tears but not being willing that they should take notice of him he retired and after a while came to them again and taking Simeon in order to his being a pledge for his brethren s return he bid them take the corn they had bought and go their way He also commanded his steward privily to put the money which they had brought with them for the purchase of corn into their sacks f and to dismiss them therewith who did as he was commanded When Jacob s sons were come into the land of Canaan they told their father what had happened to them in Egypt and that they were taken to have come thither as spies upon the king how they said they were brethren and had left their eleventh brother with their father but were not be lieved and that they had left Simeon with the governor until Benjamin should go thither and be a testimonial of the truth of what they had said They then begged of their father to fear nothing but to send the lad along with them but Jacob was not pleased with any thing his sons had done and being grieved at the detention of Simeon he thought it a foolish thing to give up Benjamin also Neither did he yield to Reubel s persuasion though he said that the grandfather might in way of requital kill his own sons in case any harm came to Benja min in the journey So they were distrest and knew not what to do Nay there was another accident that still disturbed them more the money that was found hidden in their sacks of corn Yet when the corn they had brought failed them and when the famine still afflicted them and necessity forced them Jacob did not still resolve to send Benjamin with his brethren although there  The reason why Simeon might be selected out of the rest for Joseph s prisoner is plain in the Testament of Simeon viz that he was one of the bitterest of all Joseph s brethren against him t There are two sorts of sacks taken notice of in the history of Joseph which ought not to be confounded one for the corn the other for the baggage There are no waggons almost through all Asia as far as to the Indies every thing is carried upon beasts of burthen in sacks of wool covered in the middle with leather the better to make resistance to water Sacks of this sort are called tambellit they inclose in them their things done up in large parcels It is of this kind of sacks we are to under stand what is said here and all through this history and not of their sacks in which they carry their corn Chardin Harmf r v i p 429 B an 1748 55 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS was no returning into Egypt unless they came with what they had promised Now the misery growing every day worse and his sons begging it of him he had no other course to take in his present circumstances and Judas who was of a bold temper on other occasions spake his mind very freely He told him that it did not become him to be afraid on account of his son nor to suspect the worst as he did for nothing could be done to his son but by the appointment of God which must also for certain come to pass though he were at home with him that he ought not to condemn them to such manifest destruc tion nor deprive them of that plenty of food they might have from Pharaoh by his unrea sonable fear about his son Benjamin but ought to take care of the preservation of Simeon lest by attempting to hinder Benja min s journey Simeon should perish He exhorted him to trust God for him and said he would either bring his son back to him safe or together with his lose his own life So that Jacob was at length persuaded and delivered Benjamin to them with the price of the corn doubled  he also sent presents to Joseph of the fruits of the land of Canaan balsam t and rosin as also turpentine and honey Now their father shed many tears at the departure of his sons as well as them selves his concern was that he might receive them back again safe after their journey and their concern was that they might find their father well and no way afflicted with the grief for them And this lamentation lasted a whole day so that the old man was at last tired with grief and stayed behind but they went on their way for Egypt endeavouring to mitigate their grief for their present misfor tunes with the hopes of better success here after As soon as they came into Egypt they were brought down to Joseph but here no small fear disturbed them lest they should be ac cused about the price of the corn as if they had cheated Joseph They therefore made a long apology to Joseph s steward and told him that when they came home they found the money in their sacks and that they had now brought it along with them He said he did not know what they meant So they were delivered from that fear And when he had loosed Simeon and put him into a handsome habit he suffered him to be with his brethren at which time Joseph came from his attend ance on the king So they offered him their presents and upon his putting the question to them about their father they answered that they found him well He also upon his dis covery that Benjamin was alive asked whe ther this was their youngest brother for they had not seen him Whereupon they said he was he replied that the God over all was his protector But when his affection made him shed tears he retired desiring he might not be seen in that state by his brethren Then Joseph took them to supper and they were seated in the same order as they used to sit at their father s table And although Joseph treated them all kindly yet did he send a mess to Benjamin that was donbleJ to what the rest of the guests had for their shares  Gen xliii 12 t Of the precious balsam of Judea and the turpentine see note on VIII 6 J Five times as much Heb and Septuagint 11 The reason which some assign for the Egyptians re fusing to eat with the Hebrews was their sacrificing some creatures which the Egyptians worshipped but though in after ages they certainly did worship several kinds of animals yet there appears nothing from the story that they did so in Joseph s days for their worship of the famous ox called Apis was a much later invention as many learned men have demonstrated It is much more likely therefore that this great abhorrence should be re solved into their different manner both of dressing and eating their victuals No people as Herodotus tells even where he treats of their manner of feasting Euterpe c 28 were more tenacious of their old customs than the Egyp tians They would not use those of any other nation whatever and therefore the Hebrews were not the only people they had an aversion to For as the same histo voL I No 5 rian informs us an Egyptian man or woman would not kiss the mouth of a Greek would not make use of a spit or a pot belonging to them nor eat any meat that was cut with one of their knives Patrick s and Le Clerc s Commentary The manner of eating among the ancients was not for all the company to eat out of one and the same dish but for every one to have one or more dishes to himself The whole of these dishes were set before the master of the feast and he distributed to every one his portion As Joseph however is here said to have had a table to him self we may suppose that he had a great variety of little dishes or plates set before him and as it was a custom for great men to honour those who were in their favour by sending such dishes to them as were first served up to themselves Joseph shewed that token of respect to his brethren but to express a particular value for Benjamin he sent him five dishes to their one which disproportion could not but be marvellous and astonishing to them if what Herodotus tells us be true 1 6 c 27 viz That the distinction in this case even to Egyptian kings them 56 book n ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now when after supper they had composed themselves to sleep J oseph commanded his steward both to give them their measures of corn and to hide its price again in their sacks and withal they should put into Benjamin s sack the golden cup out of which he himself used to drink Which things he did in order to make trial of his brethren whether they would stand by Benjamin when he should be accused of having stolen the cup and should appear to be in danger or whether they would leave him and depending on their own innocency go to their father without him When the servant had done as he was bidden the sons of Jacob knowing nothing of this went their way and took Simeon with them and had a double cause of joy both because they had received him again and because they took back Benjamin to their father as they had promised But presently a troop of horsemen encompassed them and brought with them Joseph s servant who had put the cup into Benjamin s sack Upon this unex pected attack they were much disturbed and asked the reason why they came thus upon men who a little before had been by their lord thought worthy of an honourable and hospitable reception They replied by calling them wicked wretches who had for got that very hospitable and kind treatment which Joseph had given them and did not scruple to be injurious to him and to carry off that cup out of which he had in so friendly a manner drank to them regarding their friendship with Joseph no more than the danger they should be in if they were taken in comparison of the unjust gain Hereupon he threatened that they should be punished for though they had escaped the knowledge of him who was but a servant yet had they not escaped the knowledge of God nor had gone off with what they had stolen and after all asked why they were pursued as if they knew nothing of the matter and he told them that they should immediately know it by their punishment This and more of the same nature did the servant say in way of reproach but they being wholly ignorant of any thing here that concerned them laughed at what he said and wondered at the abusive lan selves in all public feasts and banquets was no more than a double mess Patrick s Commentary and Bibliotheca Bibl B guage which he gave them when he was so hardy as to accuse those who did not before so much as retain the price of their corn which was found in their sacks but brought it again though nobody else knew of any such thing so far were they from offering any injury to Joseph voluntarily But still sup posing that a search would be a more sure justification of themselves than their own de nial of the fact they bid him search them and said if any of them had been guilty of theft he might punish them all for being no way conscious of any crime they spake with assurance and as they thought without any danger to themselves The servants desired there might be a search made but they said the punishment should extend to him alone who should be guilty of the theft So they made the search and having searched all the rest they came at last to Benjamin as knowing it was Benjamin s sack in which they had hidden the cup they having searched the rest only for a shew of accuracy so the rest were out of fear for themselves and were now only concerned about Benjamin but still were well assured that he would be also found innocent and they reproached those that came after them for their hindering them while they might have proceeded a good way on their journey But as soon as the cup was found in Benjamin s sack all was changed to mourning and lamentation They rent their garments and wept for the punishment which their brother was to undergo for his theft and for the delusion they had put on their father when they promised they would return Ben jamin safe to him What added to their misery was that this melancholy accident came unfortunately at a time when they thought they had been gotten off clear But they confessed that this misfortune of their brother as well as the grief of their father for him was owing to themselves since they had forced their father to send him with them when he was averse from it The horsemen therefore took Benjamin and brought him to Joseph his brethren also fol lowing him who when he saw him in custody and them in the habit of mourning said  How came you vile wretches as you are  This oration seems too long and too unugual a digres sion to have have been composed by Joseph on this occa sion It seems to me a speech or declaration composed as 1748 57 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to have such a strange notion of my kindness to you and of God s providence as impu dently to do thus to your benefactor who in such an hospitable manner had entertained you Hereupon they gave up themselves to be punished in order to save Benjamin and called to mind what wicked enterprise they had been guilty of against Joseph They also pronounced him more happy than them selves if he were dead in being freed from the miseries of this life and if he were alive that he enjoyed the pleasure of seeing God s vengeance upon them They said farther that they were the plague of their father since they should now add to his former grief for Joseph this other affliction for Benjamin Reubel also was very severe upon this occa sion But Joseph dismissed them for he said they had been guilty of no offence and that he would content himself with the lad s punishment for he said it was not proper to let him go free for the sake of those who had not offended nor was it just to punish them together with him who had been guilty of stealing When he promised to give them leave to go away in safety they were under great consternation and were able to say nothing on this sad occasion but Judas who had persuaded their father to send the lad from him being otherwise also a very bold and active man determined to hazard him self for the preservation of his brother  It is true said he  O governor that we have been very wicked with regard to thee and on that account deserve punishment even all of us may justly be punished although the theft were not committed by all but only by one of us and he the youngest also But yet there remains some hope for us who otherwise must be under despair on his ac count and this from thy goodness which promises us a deliverance out of our present danger And now I beg thou wilt not look at us or at that crime we have been guilty of but at thy own excellent nature and take advice of thine own virtue instead of that wrath which those that otherwise are of a low character indulge as they do their strength and that not only on great but also on very trifling occasions Overcome sir that pas sion and be not subdued by it nor suffer it to slay those that do not otherwise presume upon their own safety but are desirous to accept of it from thee For this is not the first time that thou wilt bestow it on us but before when we came to buy corn thou affordest us great plenty of food and gavest us leave to carry home to our family as much as has preserved them from perishing by famine Nor is there any difference between not over looking men that were perishing for want of necessaries and not punishing those that seem to be offenders and have been so unfortunate as to lose the advantage of that glorious benefaction which they received from thee This will be an instance of equal favour though bestowed after a different man ner For thou wilt save those this way whom thou didst feed the other and thou wilt hereby preserve alive by thy own bounty those souls which thou didst not suffer to be distressed by famine It being indeed at once a wonderful and a great thing to sustain our lives by corn and to bestow on us that par don whereby now we are distressed we may continue those lives And I am ready to sup pose that God is willing to afford thee this opportunity of shewing thy virtuous disposi tion by bringing us into this calamity that it might appear thou canst forgive the injuries that are done to thyself and mayest be es teemed kind to others besides those who on other accounts stand in need of thy assist ance since it is indeed a right thing to do well to those who are in distress for want of food but still a more glorious thing to save those who deserve to be punished when it is on account of heinous offences against thyself For if it be a thing deserving commendation to forgive such as have been guilty of small offences that tend to a person s loss and this be praise worthy in him that overlooks such offences to restrain a man s passion as to the crimes which are capital to the guilty is to be like the most excellent nature of God himself And truly as for myself had it not been that we had a father who had disco vered on occasion of the death of Joseph how miserably he is always afflicted at the loss of his sons I had not spoken on account of the saving our own lives I mean any farther than as that would be an excellent character formerly in the person of Judas and in the way of oratory that lay by him and which he thought fit to insert on this occasion See two more such speeches or declamations VI 14 58 book n ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS for thyself to preserve even those that would have nobody to lament them when they were dead but we would have yielded ourselves up to suffer whatsoever thou pleasedst But now for we do not plead for mercy to our selves though indeed if we die it will be while we are young and before we have had the enjoyment of life have regard to our father and take pity on his old age on whose account it is that we make these supplications We beg thou wilt give us those lives which this wickedness of ours has rendered obnox ious to thy punishment and this for his sake who is not himself wicked nor does his being our father make us wicked He is a good man and not worthy to have such trials of his patience now we are absent he is afflicted with care for us But if he hear of our deaths and what was the cause of it he will on that account die an immature death and the re proachful manner of our ruin will hasten his end and will directly kill him nay will bring him to a miserable death while he will make haste to rid himself out of the world and bring himself to a state of insensibility before the sad story of our end come abroad into the rest of the world Consider things in this manner although our wickedness does now provoke thee with a just desire of punishing that wickedness and forgive it for our father s sake and let thy commiseration of him weigh more with thee than our wickedness Have regard to the old age of our father who if we perish will be very lonely while he lives and will soon die himself also Grant this boon to the name of father for thereby thou wilt honour him that begat thee and wilt grant it to thy self also who enjoyest already that denomi nation thou wilt then by that denomination be preserved of God the father of all by shewing a pious regard to which in the case of our father thou wilt appear to honour him who is styled by the same name I mean if thou wilt have this pity on our father upon the consideration how miserable he will be if he be deprived of his sons It is thy part therefore to bestow on us what God has given us when it is in thy power to take it away and so to resemble him intirely in charity For it is good to use that power which can  In all this speech of Judas s we may observe that Josephus supposed death to have been the punishment of neither give nor take away on the merciful side and when it is in thy power to destroy to forget that thou ever hadst that power and to look on thyself as only allowed power for preservation and that the more any one ex tends this power the greater reputation does he gain to himself Now by forgiving our brother what he has unhappily committed thou wilt preserve us all For we cannot think of living if he be put to death since we dare not shew ourselves alive to our father without our brother But here must we par take of one and the same catastrophe And so far we beg of thee O governor that if thou condemnest our brother to die thou wilt punish us together with him as partakers of his crime for we shall not think it reasonable to be reserved to kill ourselves for grief of our brother s death but so to die rather as equally guilty with him of this crime I will only leave with thee this one consideration and then will say no more viz that our bro ther committed his fault when he was young and not yet of confirmed wisdom in his con duct and that men naturally forgive such young persons And I end here without adding what more I have to say that in case thou condemnest us that omission may be supposed to have hurt us and permitted thee to take the severer side But in case thou settest us free that this may be ascribed to thy own goodness of which thou art inwardly conscious that thou freest us from condem nation and that not by barely preserving us but by granting us such a favour as will make us appear more righteous than we really are and by representing to thyself more motives for our deliverance than we are able to pro duce ourselves If therefore thou resolvest to slay him I desire thou wilt slay me in his stead and send him back to his father or if thou pleasest to retain him with thee as a slave I am fitter to labour for thy advantage in that capacity and as thou seest am better Prepared for either of those sufferings So udas being very willing to undergo any thing for the deliverance of his brother cast himself clown at Joseph s feet and earnestly laboured to assuage and pacify his anger All his brethren also fell down before him weep ing and delivering themselves up for destruc theft in Egypt in the days of Joseph though it never wag so among the Jews by the law of Moses AS 59 1747 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tion for the preservation of the life of Ben jamin Joseph being now overcome with his affec tion and no longer able to personate an angry man commanded all that were present to depart that he might make himself known to his brethren when they were alone And when the rest were gone out he discovered himself and said I commend you for your virtue and for your kindness to your brother I find you better men than I could have ex fiected from what you contrived about me ndeed I did all this to try your love to your brother So I believe you were not wicked by nature in what you did in my case but that all has happened according to God s will who has thereby procured our enjoyment of what good things we have and if he continue in a favourable disposition of what we hope for hereafter Since therefore I know that our father is safe and well beyond expecta tion and I see you so well disposed towards your brother I will no longer remember what guilt you seem to have had about me but rather return you my thanks that you have concurred with the intentions of God to bring things to their present state I would have you also forget the same since that impru dence of yours is come to such a happy con clusion rather than to be uneasy and blush at those your offences Do not therefore let your evil intentions when you condemned me and that bitter remorse which might fol low be a grief to you now because those intentions were frustrated Go your way re joicing in what has happened by the divine providence and inform your father of it lest he should be spent with tears for you and de prive me of the most agreeable part of my felicity I mean lest he should die before he comes into my sight and enjoys the good things that we now have Take therefore with you our father and your wives and chil dren and all your kindred and remove your habitation hither for it is not proper that the persons dearest to me should live remote from me now my affairs are so prosperous espe cially when they must endure five more years of famine When Joseph had said this he embraced his brethren who were in tears and sorrow but the generous kindness of their  Gen xIt 1 vor i â no 5 brother seemed to leave among them no room for fear lest they should be punished on ac count of what they had consulted and acted against him And they were then feasting Now the king as soon as he heard that Jo seph s brethren were come to him was ex ceeding glad of it as if it had been part of his own good fortune and gave them wag gons full of corn and gold and silver to be conveyed to their father Now when they had received more of their brother part to be carried to their father and part as free gifts to every one of themselves Benjamin having still more than the rest they departed CHAP VII OF THE REMOVAL OF JACOB AND ALL HIS FAMILY INTO EGYTT ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAMINE AS soon as Jacob came to know by his sons returning home in what state Jo seph was that he had not only escaped death but that he lived in splendour and happiness and ruled over Egypt jointly with the king and had intrusted to his care almost all his affairs he did not think any thing he was told to be incredible considering the greatness of the works of God and his kindness to him although that kindness had for some time past been intermitted So he immediately and zealously set out upon his journey to him When he came to the well of the oath Beersheba he offered sacrifice to God f and being afraid that the happiness there was in Egypt might tempt his posterity to fall in love with it and settle in it and no more think of removing into the land of Canaan and pos sessing it as God had promised them also being afraid lest if this descent into Egypt were made without the will of God his family might be destroyed there and out of fear lest he should depart this life before he came to the sight of Joseph he fell asleep revolving these doubts in his mind But God stood by him and called to him twice by his name and when he asked who he was God said Is it not just that thou Jacob shouldest be acquainted with that God who has ever been a protector and a helper to thy forefathers and after them to thyself For when thy father would have deprived t Gen xlvii 1 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS book II thee of the dominion I gave it thee and by my kindness it was that when thou was sent into Mesopotamia alone thou obtainedst good wives and returnedst with many children and much wealth Thy whole fomily also has been preserved by my providence and it was I who conducted Joseph thy eon whom thou gavest up for lost to the enjoyment of great prosperity I also made him lord of Egypt so that he differs but little from a king Accordingly I come now as a guide to thee in this journey and foretel to thee that thou shalt die in the arms of Joseph and that thy posterity shall be many ages in authority and glory and I will settle them in the land which I have promised them h Encouraged by this dream Jacob went on more cheerfully for Egypt with his sons and all belonging to them Now they were in all seventy I once indeed thought it best not to set down the names of this family espe cially because of their difficult pronuncia tion by the Greeks But upon the whole I think it necessary to mention those names that I may confute such as believe that we came originally not out of Mesopotamia but are Egyptians Now Jacob had twelve sons Of these Jo seph was come thither before we will there fore set down the names of Jacob s children and grand children Reuben had four sons Anoch Phallu Assaron and Charmi Simeon had six Jamuel Jamin Avod Jachin Soar and Saul Levi had three sons Gersom Caath and Merari Judas had three sons Sala Pharez and Zerab and by Pharez two grand children Esrom and Amur Isachar had four sons Thola Phua Jasub and Sa maron Zabulon had with him three sons Sarad Helon and Jalel So far is the pos terity of Leah with whom went her daughter Dinah These are thirty three Rachel had two sons one of whom Joseph had two sons also Manasseh and Ephraim The other Benjamin had ten sons Bolau Bacchar Asabel Geras Naaman Jes Ros Momphis Opphis and Arad These fourteen added to the thirty three before enumerated amount to forty seven and this was the legitimate posterity of Jacob He had beside by Bilha the handmaid of Rachael Dan and Naphthali which last had four sons that followed him Jesel Guni Issari and Sellim Dan had an only begotten son Usi If these be added to those above mentioned they complete the number fifty four Gad and Aser were the sons of Zilpha who was the handmaid of Leah Gad had these seven sons Saphoniah Augis Sunis Azabon Aerin Ereod and Ariel Aser had a daughter Sarah and six male children whose names were Jomne Isus Isoui Baris Abar and Melchiel If we add these which are sixteen to the fifty four the afore mentioned number seventy is com pleted Jacob himself not being included When Joseph understood that his father was coming for Judas his brother arrived before him and announced his approach he went out to meet him and they met together at Heroopolis But Jacob almost fainted away at this great and unexpected joy how ever Joseph revived him though unable himself to refrain being affected in the same manner Yet he was not wholly overcome with his passion as his father was After this he desired Jacob to travel on slowly whilst he himself took five of his brethren with him and hastened to the king to tell him that Jacob and his family were come This was a joyful hearing to Pharaoh who bid Joseph tell him what sort of life his bre thren loved to lead that he might give them permission to follow the same He said they were good shepherds and had been used to follow no other employment by which he pro vided for them that they should not be sepa rated but live in the same place and take care of their father as also hereby he provided that they might be acceptable to the Egyp tians by doing nothing that would be common to them with the Egyptians for the Egyp tians are prohibitedt from feeding sheep  All the Greek copies of Josephus have the negative particle here that Jacob himself was not reckoned one of the seventy souls that cane into Egypt But the old Latin copies want it and directly assure us he was one of them It is therefore hardly certain which of these was Josephus s true reading since the number of seventy is made up without him if we reckon Leah for one but if she be not reckoned Jacob himself must be one to com plete the number N B The LXXII add Machir and Gilead and Sate taam and Taom and Edem who were bom in Egypt and so have in all seventy five souls as Act vii 14 t Josephus thought that the Egyptians hated or despised the employment of a shepherd in the days of Joseph AM 1741 61 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When Jacob was come to the king and had saluted him and wished all prosperity to his government Pharaoh asked how old he was Upon whose answer that he was a hundred and thirty years old he admired Jacob on account of the length of his life And when he had added that still he had not lived so long as his fore fathers he gave him leave to live with his children in Heli opolis for in that city the king s shepherds had their pasturage The famine now increased among the Egyptians and this heavy judgment grew more oppressive to them because neither did the river overflow the ground for it did not rise to its former height nor did God send rain upon it  Nor did they indeed make the least provisions for themselves so igno rant were they what was to be done But Joseph sold them corn for their money and when their money failed them they bought corn with their cattle and their slaves and if any of them had a small piece of land they gave up that to purchase them food By which means the king became the owner of all their substance and they were removed some to one place and some to another that so the possession of their country might be firmly assured to the king excepting the lands of the priests for their country continued still in their own possession And indeed this sore famine made their minds as well as their bodies slaves and at length compelled them to procure a sufficiency of food by such dis honourable means But when this misery ceased and the river overflowed the ground and the earth brought forth its fruits plenti fully Joseph came to every city and gathered the people thereto belonging together and gave them back entirely the land which by their own consent the king might have pos Whereas Bishop Cumberland has shewn that they rather hated such Phoenician or Canaanite shepherds as had long enslaved the Egyptians of old time See his Sanchoniath page 361â 362  Reland here puts the question how Josephus could complain of its not raining in Egypt during this famine while the ancients affirm that it never does naturally rain there His answer is that when the ancients deny that it rains in Egypt they only mean the upper Egypt above the Delta which is called Egypt in the strictest sense hut that in Delta and consequently in the lower Egypt adjoining to it it did not hold and still does rain sometimes See the note on III 1 t Josephus suppose that Joseph now restored the sessed alone and alone enjoyed the fruits of it He also exhorted them to look on it as their own possession to resume their labours of husbandry with cheerfulness and to pay as a tribute to the crown the fifth party of the fruits of the land which the king when it was his own restored to them 1 hese men rejoiced upon their becoming unexpectedly owners of their land and diligently observed what was enjoined them And by this means Joseph procured to himself a greater autho rity among the Egyptians and a greater love to the king from them Now this law that they should pay the fifth part of their fruits as tribute continued until the time of their later kings CHAP VIII OF THE DEATH OF JACOB AND JOSEPH WHEN Jacob had lived seventeen years in Egypt he fell into a disease and died in the presence of his sons but not till he had made his prayers for their prosperity and had foretold prophetically how every one of them was to dwell in the land of Canaan But this happened many years afterwards He also enlargedJ upon the praises of Joseph how he had not remembered the evil doings of his brethren to their disadvantage nay on the contrary was kind to them bestowing upon them so many benefits as seldom are bestowed on men s own benefactors He then commanded his own sons that they should admit Joseph s sons Ephraim and Manasseh into their number and divide the land of Canaan in common with them con cerning whom we shall treat hereafter How ever he made it his request that he might be buried at Hebron So he died when he had lived a hundred and forty seven years  Egyptians their lands again upon the payment of a fifth part as tribute It seems to me rather that the land was now considered as Pharaoh s and this fifth part as its rent to be paid to him as he was their landlord and they his tenants and that the lands were not properly restored and this fifth part reserved as a tribute only till the days of Sesostris J As to this encomium upon Joseph as preparatory to Jacob s adopting Ephraim and Manasseh into his own family and to be admitted into his two tribes which Jose phus here mentions all our copies of Gen omit it c xlviii nor do we know whence he took it or whether it be his own embellishment I I Gen xlvii 28 62 book II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS having not been inferior to any of his ances tors in piety towards God and having such a recompence for it as it was fit those should have who were so good as these were Jo seph by the king s permission carried his father s dead body to Hebron and there buried it at a great expense But his bre thren were at first unwilling to return back with him because they were afraid lest now their father was dead he should punish them for their secret practices against him since he was now gone for whose sake he had been so gracious to them He persuaded them however to fear no harm and to en tertain no suspicions of him so he brought them along with him and gave them great possessions and continually evinced the most particular concern for them t Joseph also died when he had lived a hundred and ten years J having been a man of admirable virtue who conducted all his affairs by the rules of reason and used his authority with moderation which was the cause of his great felicity among the Egyp tians even when he came from another coun try and that in such ill circumstances as we have already described At length his bre thren died after they had lived happily in Egypt Now the posterity and sons of these men after some time carried their bodies and buried them at Hebron But as to the bones of Joseph they carried them into the land of Canaan afterwards Â when the Hebrews went out of Egypt for so

them in the linen in which they were wrapped but the bones and those half rotten Letter vii p 281 Antique coffins of stone and sycamore wood are still to be seen in Egypt It is said that some were formerly made of a kind of pasteboard formed by folding and glueing cloth together a great number of times these were curiously plaistered and painted with hieroglyphics Thevenot part i p 137 B  Though there be something of a natural desire in most men to be buried in the places where their ancestors lie yet Jacob s aversion to have his remains deposited in Egypt seems to be more earnest than ordinary or other wise he would never have imposed an oath upon his sons and charged them all with his dying breath not to suffer it to be done For he very well knew that had his body been buried in Egypt his posterity upon that very ac count would have been too much wedded to the country ever to attempt the acquisition of the promised land and therefore to wean them from the thought of continuing in Egypt and to fix their minds and affections in Canaan he ordered his body to be carried thither beforehand in tes timony that he died in full persuasion of the truth of the promises which were given to him and his ancestors nor was it inconvenient that future generations after their re turn into Canaan should have before their eyes the Sepul chre of their forefathers for a record of their virtues and an incitement to the imitation of them But the strongest motive of all for Jacob s desiring to be buried in Canaan supposing that he foreknew that our Saviour Christ was to live and die and with some others rise again in that country was that he might be one of that blessed number as it was indeed an ancient tradition in the church that among those who came out of their graves after our Lord s resurrection Mat xxvii 53 the patriarch Jacob was one PooVs Annotations and Bibliotheca Bibl B T Gen i 21 X When Joseph died he was not only embalmed but put into a coffin This

was 1st Because his brethren after his decease might not have interest enough at court to provide themselves with such things as were necessary to set off the pomp and solemnity of a funeral befitting so great a personage Silly Because he might foresee that the Egyptians in all probability as long as their veneration for his memory was warm would hardly have suffered his remains to have been carried into ano ther country 3dly Because the continuance of his re mains among them might be a means to preserve the re membrance of the services he had done them and thereby an inducement to them to treat the relations he had left behind him with more kindness 4thly And chiefly be cause the presence of his body with the Israelites might be a pledge to assure them and a means to strengthen and confirm their faith and hope in God s promises to their progenitors that he would infallibly put their posterity in possession of the land of Canaan and accordingly when Moses delivered them out of Egypt he carried Joseph s body along with him Exod xiii 19 and committed it to the care of the tribe of Ephraim who buried it near She chem Josh xxiv 32 in the field which Jacob a little before his

pleasure and in particular to the love of gain They also became very ill affected towards the Hebrews as touched with envy at their prosperity for when they saw how the nation of the Israelites flourished and were become eminent already in plenty of wealth which they had acquired by their virtue and natural love of labour they thought their increase was to their own detriment and having in length of time forgotten the benefits they had received from Joseph par ticularly the crown being now come into another family t they became very abusive to the Israelites and contrived many ways of afflicting them for they enjoined them to cut a great number of channels for the river and to build wallsJ for their cities and ramparts that they might restrain the river and hinder its waters from stagnating upon its running over its own banks they set them also to build pyramids and by all this wore them out and forced them to learn all sorts of me chanical arts and to accustom themselves to

which ascended from abroad basis and ended in a point like a flame of fire Others whose opinion Vossius seems to approve say that the name comes from the word Pyroi which in the same language signifies wheat because they suppose them to have been the granaries of the ancient Egyptian kings But a late writer versed in the Coptic tongue has given us another etymology from that language wherein Pouro signifies a king and Misi a race or generation and the reason why the Pyramids had this name given them was as he tells us because they were erected to preserve the memory of the princes

the Hebrews were in this condition there was this occasion offered itself to the Egyptians which made them more solicitous for the extinction of our na tion One of these sacred scribes Â who are very sagacious in foretelling future events truly told the king that about this time a child would be born to the Israelites who if he were reared would bring the Egyptian dominion low and would raise the Israelites that he would excel all men in virtue and obtain a glory that would be remembered through all ages which thing was so feared by the king that according to this man s opinion he commanded that every male child which was born to the Israelites should be cast into the river and destroyed that be sides this the Egyptian midwives should watch the labours oi the Hebrew women and observe what was born for those were the women who were enjoined to do the office of midwives to them and by reason of their re lation to the king would not transgress his commands tt He enjoined also that if

name in Josephus the Targum of Jonathan names the two famous antagonists of Moses Jannes and Jambres Nor is it at all unlikely that it might be one of these who foreboded so much misery to the Egyptians and so much happiness to the Israelites from the rearing of Moses  Josephus is clear that these midwives were Egyp tians and not Israelites as in our other copies which is very probable it being not easily to be supposed that Pha raoh could trust the Israelite midwives to execute so bar barous a command against their own nation Consult therefore and correct hence our ordinary copies Exod i 15â 22 and indeed Josephus seems to have had much completer copies of the Pentateuch or other authentic records now lost about the birth and actions of Moses than either our Hebrew Samaritan or Greek Bibles afford us which enabled him to speak so largely and particularly about him tt It is generally supposed that the midwives upon this R 64 book h ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS save their male children alive they and their families should be destroyed This was a severe affliction indeed to those that suffered it not only as they were deprived of their sons and while they were the parents them selves they were obliged to be subservient to the destruction of their own children but as it was to be supposed to tend to the extirpa tion of their nation while upon the destruc tion of their children and their own gradual dissolution the calamity would become very hard and inconsolable Such was the ill state they were in but no one can overthrow the purposes of God though he contrive ten thousand subtile devices for that end for this child whom the sacred scribe foretold was brought up and concealed from the obser vers appointed by the king and he that fore told him did not mistake in the consequences of his preservation which were brought to pass under a singular manner â A man whose name was Amram one of the nobler sort of the Hebrews was afraid of his whole nation lest it should fail by the want of young men to be brought up here aftef and was very uneasy at ity his wife being then with child and he knew not what to do hereupon he betook himself to prayer to God and intreated him to have compassion on those men who had no ways transgressed the laws of his worship and to afford them deliverance from the miseries they at that time endured and to render abortive their enemies hope of the destruction of their na tion Accordingly God had mercy on him and was moved bv his supplication he stood by him in his sleep and exhorted him not to despair of his future favours He said farther that he did not forget their piety towards him and would always reward them for it as he had formerly granted his favour to their forefathers and made them increase from a few to so great a multitude He reminded him that when Abraham was come alone out of Mesopotamia into Canaan he had been made happy not only in other respects butJ that when his wife was at first barren sh was afterward by him enabled to conceive seed and bare him sons thatheleft tolshmael 1 and to his posterity the country of Arabia occasion told a lie but there is no reason for such a sup position though possibly they might conceal some part of the truth which is not unlawful but highly commendable when it is to preserve the innocent for many of the He brew women might be such as are here described though not every one of them The answer of the midwives therefore is so far from being a sneaking lie to save their lives that it is a bold confession of their faith and piety to the hazard of them viz that they saw so plain an evi dence of the wonderful hand of God in that extraordinary vigour in the travail of the women that do what Pharaoh would they durst not would not strive against it be cause they would not strive against God Lightfoot s Ser mons on 2 Sam xix 29 The making the midwives houses is by most interpreters ascribed to God and the thing is supposed to have been done in a metaphorical sense i e God gave them a numerous offspring or family and a very lasting succession or posterity For there are five things say they which go to complete the greatness or eminence of a family as such its largeness its wealth its honours its power and its duration And therefore since the mid wives hazarded their own lives to save those of the He brew children and to preserve the Israelites a numerous progeny and posterity the God of Israel in return not only made their own lives long and prosperous but gave them very numerous families and an enduring posterity in whom they Taught be said to live after death even from generation to generation But all this is a very forced construction and what the original words will by no means bear We should therefore rather think these houses were built not for the midwives but for the Israelites and that it was hot God but Pharaoh who built them The case seems to be this â Pharaoh had charged the mid wives to kill the male children that were born of the He brew women the midwives feared God omitted to do â what the king had commanded them pretending in excuse for their omission that the Hebrew women were gen erally delivered before they could get to them Pharaoh hereupon resolving to prevent their increase gave charge to his people to have all the male children of the He brews thrown into the river biit his command could not be strictly executed whilst the Israelites lived up and down the fields in tents which was their ancient and cus tomary way of living for they would shift here and there and lodge the women in childbed out of the way to save their children Pharaoh therefore built them houses and obliged them to a more settled habitation that the people whom he had set over them might know where to find every family andto take an account of all the children that should be b6rn So that this was a very cunning contri vance of Pharaoh in order to have his charge more strictly and effectually executed than it could otherwise have been done and was a particular too remarkable not to be in serted in Moses s account of this affair The only seem ing difficulty is to reconcile the words to the text in what has been here advanced but this will be none at nil if the words be rightly translated and the verses rightly distin guished in this manner Exod i 20 And God dwelt with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and this happened or Was so or came to pass f because the midwives feared God ver 21 22 And PKa rdoh built them i e Israelites houses and charged allhtii people saying every son

these things Amram awaked and told it to Joche bed his wife and now the fear increased upon them on account of the prediction in Amram s dream for they were under con cern not only for the child but on account of the great happiness that was to come to him also However the mother s labour was such as afforded a confirmation to what was foretold by God for it was not known to those who watched her by the easiness of her pains and because the throes of her delivery did not fall upon her with violence and now they nourished the child at home privately for three months But after that time Am ram fearing he should be discovered and by falling under the king s displeasure both he and his child should perish and so he should make the promise of God of none effect he determined rather to trust the safety and cafe4 of the child to God than to depend on his own concealment of him which he looked upon as a thing uncertain and whereby both the ohild so privately to be nourished ftnJF TTTTTT  T r â AÂ iW iâ i himself should be in imminent danger but he believed that God would some way for certain procure the safety of the child in order to secure the truth of his own predic tions When they had thus determined they made an ark of bulrushes after the manner of a cradle and of a bigness sufficient for an infant to be laid in without being too much straightened They then daubed it over with slime which would naturally keep out the water from entering between the bulrushes and put the infant into it and setting it afloat upon the river they left its preservation to God so the river received the child and carried him along but Miriam the child s sister passed along upon the bank over against him as her mother had bid her to see whither the ark would be carried where God demonstrated that human wisdom was nothing but that the Supreme Being is able to do whatsoever he pleases that those who in order to their own security condemn others to destruction and use great endeavours about it fail of their purpose but that others are in a surprising manner preserved and obtain a prosperous condition almost from the very midst of their calamities those 1 mean whose dangers arise by the appoint ment of God and indeed such a Providence iwas exercised in the case of this child as shewed the power of God Thermuthis the king s daughter was now diverting herself by the banks of the river and seeing a cradle borne along by the cur rent she sent some that could swim and bid them to bring the cradle to her When those that were sent on this errand came to her with the cradle and she saw the little child she was greatly in love with it on account of its largeness and beauty for God had taken such great care in the formation of Moses that he caused him to be thought worthy of bringing up and providing for by all those that had taken the most fatal resolutions on account of their dread of his nativity for the destruction of the rest of the Hebrew nation Thermuthis bid them bring her a Woman that might suckle the child yet would not the child admit of her breast but turned away fripm it and did the like to many other women Now Miriam Was by when this happened not to appear to be there on purpose but only as staying to see the child and she said  It 66 book it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS is in vain that thou O queen callest for these women tor the nourishment of the child who are by no way of kin to it but if thou wilt order one of the Hebrew women to be brought perhaps it may admit the breast of one of his own nation Now since she seemed to speak well Thermuthis bid her procure such a one so when she had such authority given her she came back and brought the mother who was known to nobody there and now the child gladly admitted the breast and seemed to adhere closely to it and so it was that at the queen s desire the nursing of the child was entirely intrusted to the mother Hereupon it was that Thermuthis imposed this name Mouses upon him from what had happened when he was put into the river for the Egyptians call water by the name of Mo and such as are saved out of it by the name of Uses so by putting these two words together they imposed this name upon him and he was by the confession of all accor ding to God s prediction as well for his great ness of mind as for his contempt of difficul ties the best of all the Hebrews Abraham was his ancestor of the seventh generation for Moses was the son of Amram who was the son of Caath whose father Levi was the son of Jacob who was the son of Isaac who was the son of Abraham Now Moses s un derstanding became far superior to his age and when he was taught he discovered greater quickness of apprehension than was usual in youth and his action at that time promised greater when he should come to the age of a man God also gave him that tallness when he was but three years old as was wonderful and every one that saw him was greatly surprised at the beauty of his countenance Nay it happened frequently that those that met him as he was carried along the road were obliged to turn again upon seeing the child that they left what they were about and stood still a great while to look on him for the beauty of the child was so remarkable on many accounts that it detained the spectators and made them stay longer to look upon him Thermuthis therefore perceiving him to be so remarkable a child adopted him for her son having no child of her own and when one time she had carried Moses to her  An 1609 father she shewed him to him and said  she thought to make him her father s successor if it should please God she should have no legitimate child of her own and said to him I have brought up a child who is of a divine form and of a generous mind and as I have received him from the bounty of the river in a wonderful manner I thought proper to adopt him for my son and the heir of thy kingdom And when she had said this she put the infant into her father s hands so he took him and pressed him to his breast and on his daughter s account in a pleasant way put the diadem upon his head But Moses threw it down to the ground and in a puerile mood he wreathed it round and trod upon it with his feet which seemed to bring along with it an evil presage concerning the king dom of Egypt But when the sacred scribe saw this he was the same person that fore told that his nativity would bring the do minion of that kingdom low he made a violent attempt to kill him and crying out in a frightful manner he said  This O king this child is he of whom God foretold that if we kill him we shall be in no danger he himself affords an attestation to the predic tion of the same thing by his trampling upon thy government and treading upon thy dia dem Take him therefore out of the way and deliver the Egyptians from the fear they are in about him and deprive the Hebrews of the hope they have of being encouraged by him But Thermuthis prevented him and snatched the child away and the king was not hasty to slay him God himself whose providence protected Moses inclining the king to spare him he was therefore educa ted with great care so the Hebrews de pended on him and were of good hopes that great things would be done by him The Egyptians indeed were suspicious of what would follow his education yet because if Moses had been slain there was no one either a kin or adopted that had any oracle of his side for pretending to the crown of Egypt and likely to be of greater advantage to them they abstained from killing him CHAP X OF THE WAR WHICH MOSES MADE WITH THE ETHIOPIANS OSES therefore when he was born and brought up in the foregoing man M an J 532 67 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ner and came to the age of maturity made his virtue manifest to the Egyptians and shewed that he was born for the bringing them down and raising the Israelites and the occasion he laid hold of was this the Ethio pians who are next neighbours to the Egyp tians made an incursion into their country which they seized upon and carried off the effects of the Egyptians who in their rage fought against them and revenged the affronts they had received but being overcome in battle some of them were slain and the rest ran away in a shameful manner and by that means saved themselves Hereupon the Ethi opians followed after them in the pursuit and thinking it would be a mark of cowardice if they did not subdue all Egypt they went on to subdue the rest with great vehemence and when they had tasted the sweets of the country they never left off the prosecution of the war and as the nearest parts had not courage enough at first to fight with them they proceeded as far as Memphis and the sea itself while not one of the cities were able to oppose them The Egyptians under this sad oppression betook themselves to their oracles and prophecies and when God had given them his counsel to make use of Moses the Hebrew and take his assistance the king commanded his daughter to produce him that he might be the general of their army upon which when she had made him swear he would do him no harm she delivered him to the king and supposed his assistance would be of great advantage to them She also re proached the priest who although he had before admonished the Egyptians to kill him was not ashamed now to own their want of his help Moses at the persuasion both of Thermu this and the king himself cheerfully under took this business and the sac rod scribes of both nations were glad those of the Egyp tians that they should at once overcome their  This history of Moses as general of the Egyptians against the Ethiopians is wholly omitted in our bibles but is thus cited by Irerweus from Josephus and that soon after his own age Josephus said that when Moses was nourished in the king s palace he was appointed general of the army against the Ethiopians and conquered them irhen he married that king s daughter because out of her affection for him they delivered the city up to him See the fragments of Irenaeus ap edit Grab page 472 Nor perhaps did St Stephen refer to any thing else when he voL I â No 6 enemies by his valour and that by the same piece of management Moses would be slain but those of the Hebrews that they should escape from the Egyptians because Mosee was to be their general Moses took and led his army before their enemies were apprised of his attacking them for he did not march by the river but by land where he gave a wonderful demonstra tion of his sagacity for when the ground was difficult to be passed over because of the multitude of serpents which it produces in vast numbers and indeed is singular in some of those productions which other countries do not breed and yet such as are worse than others in power and mischief and an unusual fierceness of sight some of which ascend out of the ground unseen and also fly into the air and so come upon men at unawares and do them a mischief Moses invented a wonder ful stratagem to preserve the army safe and without hurt for he made baskets like unto arks of sedge and filled them with ibes f and carried them along with them which animals are the greatest enemies to serpents imagi nable for they fly from them when they come near them and as they fly they are caught and devoured but the ibes are tame crea tures and only enemies to the serpentine kind Of these ibes however I say no more at pre sent since the Greeks are not themselves un acquainted with this sort of bird As soon therefore as Moses was come to the land which was the breeder of these serpents he let loose these ibes and by their means re pelled the serpentine kind and used them for his assistants before the army came upon that ground When he had therefore proceeded thus on his journey he came upon the Ethio pians before they expected him and join ing battle with them he beat them and de prived them of the hopes they had of success against the Egyptians and went on in over throwing their cities and indeed made a great said of Moses before he was sent by God to the Israelites that he was not only learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians but was also mighty in words and in deeds Acts vii 82 t Pliny speaks of these birds called ibes and says the Egyptians invoked them against the serpents Hist Nat X 28 Straho speaks of this island Meroe and these rivers Astapusaad Aslaborus XVI

slacken their diligence insomuch that the Ethiopians were in danger of being re duced to slavery and complete destruction and at length they retired to Saba a royal city of Ethiopia which Cambyses afterward named Meroe after the name of his own sis ter The place was to be besieged with very great difficulty since it was both encom passed by the Nile and the other rivers As tapus and Astaborus made it a very difficult thing for such as attempted to pass over them for the city was situate in a retired place and was inhabited after the manner of an island being encompassed with a strong wall and having the rivers to guard them from their enemies and having great ramparts between the wall and rivers insomuch that when the waters come with the greatest violence it can never be drowned which ramparts make it next to impossible for even such as have passed over the rivers to take the city How ever while Moses was uneasy at the army s lying idle for the enemy durst not come to a battle this accident happened Tharbis the daughter of the king of the Ethiopians happened to see Moses as he led the army near to the walls and fought with great cou rage and admiring the subtilty of his un dertakings and believing him to be the author of the Egyptians success when they had be fore despaired of recovering their liberty and to be the occasion of the great danger that the Ethiopians were in when they had be fore boasted of their great achievements she fell deeply in love with him and upon the prevalency of that passion sent to him the most faithful of all her servants to discourse with him about their marriage He hereupon accepted the offer on condition she would procure the delivering up of the city and gave her the assurance of an oath to take her to his wife and that when he had once taken possession of the city he would not break his oath to her No sooner was the agreement made but it took effect immediately and when Moses had cut off the Ethiopians he gave thanks to God and having consummated is marriage led the Egyptians back to their land CHAP XI OF MOSES S FLIGHT OUT OF EGYPT INTO MIDIAN NOW the Egyptians after they had been preserved by Moses entertained an hatred to him and were very eager in effect ing their designs against him and suspecting that he would take occasion from his good success to raise a sedition and bring innova tions into Egypt they told the king he ought to be slain The king had also some inten tions of the same nature and this as well out of envy at his glorious expedition at the head of his army as out of fear at being brought low by him and being instigated by the sa cred scribes he was ready to undertake to kill Moses but when he had learned before hand what plots there were against him he went away privately and because the public roads were watched he took his flight through the deserts and where his enemies could not suspect he would travel and though destitute of food he went on and despised that diffi culty courageously and when he came to the city Midian which lay upon the Red Sea and was so denominated from one of Abra ham s sons by Keturah he sat upon a certain well and rested himself there after his labo rious journey and the affliction he had been in It was not far from the city and the time of the day was noon where he had an occa sion offered him by the custom of the coun try of doing what recommended his virtue and afforded him an opportunity of bettering his circumstances For that country having but little water the shepherds used to seize on the wells be fore others came lest their flocks should want water and lest it should be spent by others before they came There were now come therefore to this well seven virgin sisters the daughters of Raguel a priest and one thought worthy by the people of the country of great honour these virgins who took care of their father s flock which sort of work it was cus tomary and very familiar for women to do in the country of the Troglodytes came first of all and drew water out of the well in a quan tity sufficient for their flocks into troughs which were made for the reception of that water but the shepherds came upon the an 1582 69 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS maidens and drove them away that they might have the command of the waters them selves Moses thought it would be a terrible reproach upon him it he should overlook this uujust oppression and should suffer the vio lence of the men to prevail over the right of the maidens he therefore drove away the men who had a mind to more than their share and afforded a proper assistance to the women who when they had received such a benefit came to their father and told him how they had been affronted by the shep herds and assisted by a stranger and in treated that he would not let this generous action go without a reward Now the father took it well from his daughters that they were so desirous to remunerate their benefactor and bid them bring Moses into his presence that he might be rewarded as he deserved And when Moses came he told him what testimony his daughters bare to him that he had assisted them and that as he admired him for his virtue he said that Moses had bestowed such assistance on persons not in sensible of benefits but where they were both able and willing to return the kindness and even to exceed the measure of his generosity so he made him his son and gave him one of his daughters in marriage and appointed him to be the guardian and superintendent over his cattle for of old all the wealth of the bar barians was in their cattle CHAP XII OF THE BURNING BUSH AND THE ROD OF MOSES WHEN Moses had obtained this favour of Jethro for that was one of the names of Raguel he stayed there and fed his flocks f but some time afterward taking his station at the mountain called Sinai he drove his flocks thither to feed them Now this is the highest of all the mountains there abouts and the best for pasturage the herb age being good and it had not been before fed upon because of the opinion men had that Cod dwelt there the shepherds not daring to ascend up to it and here it Was that a won derful prodigy appeared to Moses for a fireJ  Jetheajacus in the Greek of Josephus  Exod iii 1 fed upon a thorn bush yet did the green leaves and flowers remain untouched and the fire did not consume the fruit branches although the flame was great and fierce Mo ses was affrighted at this strange sight but he was still more astonished when the fire uttered a voice and called to him by name and spake words to him by which it signi fied how bold he had been in venturing to come into a place whither no man had ever come before because the place was divine and advised him to remove a great way from the flame and to be contented with what he had seen for though he were himself a good man and the offspring of great men he should not pry any farther and he foretold to him that he should have glory and honour among men by the blessing of God upon him He also commanded him to go with confidence to Egypt in order to his being the commander and conductor of the body of the Hebrews and to his delivering his own people from the injuries they suffered there For said God they shall inhabit this happy land which your forefather Abraham inhabited and shall have the enjoyment of all sorts of good things and thou by thy prudence shalt guide them to those good things But he still enjoined him when he had brought the Hebrews out of the land of Egypt to come to that place and offer sacrifice of thanksgiving there Such were the divine oracles which were delivered out of the fire Moses was astonished at what he saw and much more at what he heard and he said I think it would be an instance of too great madness O Lord for one of that regard I bear to thee to distrust thy power since I myself adore it and know that it has been made manifest to my progenitors but I am still in doubt how I who am a private man and one of no abilities should either persuade my countrymen to leave the country they now inhabit and to follow me to a land whither 1 lead them or if they should be persuaded how can I force Pharaoh to permit them to depart since he augments his own wealth and prosperity by the labours and works he puts upon them But God persuaded him to be courageous J An 1532 70 book u ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS on all occasions promising to be with him and to assist him in his words when he was to persuade men and in his deeds when he was lo perform wonders He bid him also take a signal of the truth of what he said by throwing his rod upon the ground which when he had done it crept along and be came a serpent f and rolled itself round in its folds and erected its head as ready to re venge itself on such as should assault it and afterwards it became a rod again as it was before After this God bid Moses put his right hand into his bosom be obeyed and when he took it out it was white and in colour like to chalk but afterward it returned to its wonted colour again He also upon God s command took some of the water that was near him and poured it upon the ground and saw the colour was that of blood Upon the surprise that Moses testified at these signs God exhorted him to be of good courage and to be assured that he would be the greatest support to him and bid him make use of those signs in order to obtain belief among all men and to demonstrate that he did all things ac cording to the Divine commands Accord ingly he was enjoined to make no more de lays but to hasten to Egypt and to travel night and day and not to draw out the time and so make the slavery of the Hebrews and their sufferings to last no longer Moses having seen and heard these won ders that assured him of the truth of God s â promises had no room left him to disbelieve them so he intreated him to grant him that power when he should be in Egypt and be sought him since he had heard and seen him that he would also tell him his name and when he offered sacrifice he might invoke him by such name in his oblations Hereupon God declared to him that name which had never been discovered to men before con cerning which it is not lawfulJ for me to say any more Now these signs accompanied Moses not then only but always when he prayed for them of all which signs he attri buted the firmest assent to the fire in the bush and believing that God would be a gracious supporter to him he hoped he should be able to deliver his own nation and bring calamities on the Egyptians CHAP XIII OF THE RETURN OF MOSES AND AARON INTO EGYPT TO PHARAOH MOSES having understood that Pharaoh in whose reign he fled away was dead asked leave of Raguel to go to Egypt for the benefit of his own people and he took with him Zipporah the daughter of Raguel whom he had married and the children he had by her Gersom and Eleazar and hastened into Egypt Now the former of those names Ger som in the Hebrew tongue signifies that he was in a strange land and Eleazar that by  Wonderful are the stories which the Hebrew doctors tell us of this rod viz That it originally grew in Paradise was brought away by Adnm from him passed to Noah and so through a succession of patriarchs till it came to be transplanted into Jethro s garden and there took root again God knows how that it was called Zaphir whence Ziphorah his daughter had her name and had the Tetra grammaton written upon it that when Ziphorah fell in love with Moses her father consented that she should nave him if he could pluck up this Zaphir rod at the same time published a proclamation that whoever did it first should marry his daughter that hereupon several lusty young men came and tried their strength in vain but that Moses by being acquainted with the true pronunciation of the name of God in virtue thereof did it with ease and so not only obtained his daughter but this rod into the bar gain with which he wrought afterwards all his wonders in Egypt But how fictitious soever all this may be it is certain that in Exod iv 20 this staff is called the rod of God and that partly because it was appropriated to God s special service to be the instrument of all his glorious works and partly to shew that whatever was done by that rod was not done by any virtue in it or in the hand of Moses but merely by the power of God who was pleased for the greater confusion of his enemies to use so mean an instrument Nor is it an improbable conjecture that the wands which great ministers are wont to carry in their hands in token of their power and office were originally derived from this of Moses Universal Hut 1 c 7 and Pool s Annot B t Exod iv 8 I This superstitious fear of discovering the name with four letters which of late have been used falsely to pro nounce Jehovah but seems to have been originally pro nounced Jahoh or Jao is never I think heard of till this passage of Josephus and this superstition in not pro nouncing that name is continued among the Rabbinical Jews to this day though whether the Samaritans and Canutes observed it so early does not appear Josephus also durst not set down the very words of the Ten Com mandments as we shall see hereafter III 5 which super stitious silence I think has yet not been continued even by the Rabbins Both these cautious concealments bow ever were probably taught Josephus by the Pharisees a body of men at once very wicked and very superstitious an 1532 71 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the assistance of the God of his fathers he had escaped from the Egyptians When they were near the borders Aaron his brother by the command of God met him to whom he declared what had befallen him at the mountain and the commands that God had given him but as they were going forward the chief men among the Hebrews having learned that they were coming met them to whom Moses declared the signs he had seen and when they could not believe them he made them see them so they took courage at these surprising and unexpected sights and conceived hopes of their entire deliverance as believing now that God took care of their preservation Since then Moses found that the Hebrews would be obedient to whatever he should direct as they promised and that they were in love with liberty he came to the king who had indeed but lately received the government and told him how much he had done for the good of the Egyptians when they were despised by the Ethiopians and their country laid waste by them and how he had been the commander of their forces and had laboured for them as if they had been his own people and he informed him in what danger he had been during that expedition without having any proper returns made him as he had deserved He also stated dis tinctly what things happened to him at Mount Sinai and what God said to him and the signs that were done by God in order to as sure him of the authority of those commands which he had given him he also exhorted him not to disbelieve what he told him nor to oppose the will of God But when the king derided Moses he made him see the signs that were done at Mount Sinai yet was the king very angry and called him a wicked man who had formerly run away from his Egyptian slavery and now come back with deceitful tricks and won ders and magical arts to astonish him And when he had said this he commanded the priests to let him see the same wonderful sights as knowing that the Egyptians were skilful in this kind of learning and that he was not the only person who knew them and pretended them to be divine he also told him that when he brought such wonderful sights before him he would only be believed by the unlearned Now when the priests threw down their rods they became serpents but Moses was not daunted at it and said O king I do not myself despise the wisdom of the Egyptians but I say that what I do is so much superior to what these perform by magic arts and tricks as divine power exceeds the power of man but I will demonstrate that what I do is not done by craft or so counter feiting what is not really true but that they appear by the providence and power of God When he had said this he cast his rod down upon the ground and commanded it to turn itself into a serpent It obeyed him and went all round and devoured the rods of the Egyp tians f which seemed to be dragons until it had consumed them all It then returned to its own form and Moses took it into his hand again However the king was no more moved when this was done than before but being very angry he said that he should gain no thing by this cunning and shrewdness against the Egyptians at the same time commanding the chief task master over the Hebrews to give them no relaxation from their labours but to compel them to submit to greater oppressions than before and though he al lowed them chaff before for making their bricks he would allow it no longer but he made them to work hard at brick making in the day time and to gather chaff in the night Now when their labour was thus doubled they laid the blame upon Moses because their labour and their misery were on his account become more severe But Moses did not let his courage sink for the king s threatenings nor did he abate of his zeal on account of the Hebrews complaints but he supported himself and set his soul resolutely against them both and used his utmost dili gence to procure liberty to his countrymen so he went to the king and persuaded him to let the Hebrews go to Mount Sinai and there to sacrifice to God because God had en taken in this entire Egyptian chronology and sp in the king of Egypt with whom Moses had to do  Josephus seems here mistaken in his Egyptian chro nology when he says that this Pharaoh who was then king had but lately began his reign nor is it any wonder since I have already observed how greatly he was mis VOL I â No 6 t Exod vii 12  72 book II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS joined them so to do He persuaded him also not to counterwork the designs of God but to esteem his favour above ail things and to permit them to depart lest he should lay an obstruction in the way of the Divine com mands and so occasion his suffering such punishments as it was probable any one that withstood the Divine commands should un dergo since the severest afflictions arise from every object to those that provoke the Divine wrath against them for such as these have neither the earth nor the air for their friends nor are the fruits of the womb according to nature but every thing is unfriendly and ad verse towards them He said farther that the Egyptians should know this by sad expe rience and that the Hebrew people should go out of their country without permission  CHAP XIV OF THE TEN PLAGUES WHICH CAME UPON THE EGYPTIANS WHEN the king despised the words of Moses and had no regard at all to them grievous plagues seized the Egyptians every one of which I will describe both be cause no such plagues ever happened to any other nation as the Egyptians now felt and because I would demonstrate that Moses did not fail in any one thing that he foretold them and because it is for the good of mankind that they may learn this caution not to do any thing that may displease God lest he be provoked to wrath and avenge their iniqui ties upon them The Egyptian river ran with bloody water at the command of God insomuch that it could not be drank and they had no other spring of water For the water was not only of the colour of blood but it brought upon those that ventured to drink it great pains and bitter torment Such was the river to the Egyptians But it was sweet and fit to drink to the Hebrews and no way different from what it naturally used to be As the king therefore knew not what to do in these surprising circumstances and was in fear for the Egyptians he gave the Hebrews leave to go away But when the plague ceased he changed his mind and would not suffer them to go But when God saw that he was ungrateful and upon the ceasing of the calamity would not grow wiser he sent another plague upon the Egyptians an innumerable multitude of frogst consumed the fruit of the ground J The river was also full of them insomuch that those who drew water had it spoiled by the blood of these animals as they died in and were destroyed by the water and the country was full of filthy slime as they were born and as they died they also spoiled their vessels in their houses which they used and were found among what they ate and what they drank and came in great numbers upon their beds There was also a noisome smell arose from them as they were born and as they died therein Now when the Egyp tians were under the oppression of these miseries the king ordered Moses to take the Hebrews with him and be gone upon which the whole multitude of the frogs vanished away and both the land and the river re turned to their former natures But as soon as Pharaoh saw the land freed from this plague he forgot the cause of it and retained the Hebrews and as though he had a mind to try the nature of more such judgments he would not yet suffer Moses and his people to depart having granted that liberty rather out of fear than out of good consideration Accordingly God punished his falseness with another plague added to the former For there arose out of the bodies of the Egyptians an innumerable quantity oflice by which wicked as they were they misera bly perished being unable to destroy this sort of vermin either with washes or with ointments Â At this terrible judgment the  Exod vii 20 t Exod viii 6 J The river Nile naturally produces frogs but so great an abundance appearing on a sudden filling the country and leaving the rivers and fields to go into the cities and houses was really miraculous How they got into the cities and houses is not so hard a matter to conceive for if expert generals according to both ancient and modern history have sometimes surprised an enemy bv entering cities through the common sewers with much less dim unity might the frogs these armies of the Divine vengeance find a conveyance into the cities which stood all upon tbe banks of the river by aqueducts and subterraneous com munications and being eot into the cities they might find apertures in the walls of the bouses which the inhabitants never perceived before Bibliotheca Bill in locum B II Exod viii 17 Â Some would have the word Cmnim which we reader 1U AJ 1  an 1532 73 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS king of Egypt was in disorder upon the fear into which he reasoned himself lest his people should be destroyed and that the manner of this death was also reproachful So that he was forced in part to recover himself from his wicked temper to a sounder mind for he gave leave for the Hebrews themselves to depart But when the plague thereupon ceased he thought it proper to require that they should leave their children and wives behind them as pledges of their return whereby he provoked God to be more vehe mently angry at him as if he thought to im pose on his providence and as if it were only Moses and not God who punished the Egyp tians for the sake of the Hebrews For he filled that country full of various sorts of pes tilential creatures with their various pro perties such indeed as never came into the sight of men before By their means the men perished themselves and the land was desti tute of husbandmen for its cultivation but if any thing escaped destruction from them it was killed by a distemper which the men underwent also Pharaoh did not yet yield to the will of God but while he gave leave to the husbands to take their wives with them he insisted that the children should be left behind God therefore resolved to punish his wickedness with several sorts of calamities and those worse than the foregoing which had yet so generally afflicted them but their bodies had terrible boils f breaking forth with blains while they were already inwardly consumed and a great part of the Egyptians perished in this manner But when the king was not brought to reason by this plague hail was sent down from heaven J and such hail as the climate of Egypt had never suffered be lice to signify gnats The Septuagint call them Kriviireg but what kind of creatures these were is not so certainly known Others would have them to be a new species of animals called analogically by an old name or if they were lice that they were such as had wings and cruelly stung and ulcerated the Egyptians But upon the suppo sition that they were no worse than common lice this was plague enough to the Egyptians who affected neatness to such a degree that they bathed themselves every day and some of them frequently shaved their bodies all over for fear of such vermin Those who pretended that these lice were a new species make this a reason why the magi cians could not counterfeit this miracle because though they could easily provide the serpents the blood and the frogs yet this sort of animal was now no where to be had and therefore as the organs of sight are more liable to be imposed upon than those of feeling the magicians might impose upon the king and the other spectators with fan tastical blood and frogs but visionary lice could not vex and torment the body so that now it was time for the en chanters to desist and to own their inability to mimic Moses any farther But supposing that what the magicians did in the three former miracles was not illusion and imposi tion upon the senses but reality the true reason why they could proceed no farther was that God Almighty had laid bis restraint and prohibition upon the evil spirits who had hitherto been subservient to them that they might not assist them any longer Le Clerc s Commentary and jBi 4 liotheca Bibl in locum B  The word Arab which we render fly in general is by the Septuagint called Kvvofwia i e dog fly from its biting for it fastens its teeth so deep in the flesh and sticks so very close that it oftentimes makes cattle run mad and the congruity of this plague seems to be greater because one of the Egyptian deities which they called Anubis bore the head of a dog The Psalmist indeed tells us that God sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them Ps Ixxviii 45 So that according to him it was not one particular kind but all sorts of flies mingled together in one prodigious swarm or conflux Some translate it a mixture of beasts which they suppose went into Egypt to infest and destroy the country but this is not so probable a construction because the punishments hitherto inflicted were nauseous and troublesome rather than mortal though this plague of infinite numbers of small tormentors is so great aone that God calls it his army Joel ii 25 and the Greeks thought fit fas Pliny 1 20 c 28 tells us to have a god to deliver them from it under the style of Myiagros or Myiodes even as Belzebub signifies the Lord or God of flies Bochart Hier part 2 B t The Hebrew word Sliechin properly signifies an in flammation which first makes a tumor or boil as we translate it and thence turns a grievous ulcer Dr Lightfoot indeed observes that in the book of Job chap ii 7 8 where the same word occurs it signifies only a burning itch or an inflamed scab an intolerable dry itch which Job could not scratch off with his nails and was therefore forced to make use of a potsherd but then he confesses that thisShechin here spoken of was more ran corous than that having blains and ulcers that broke out with it which Job s had not So that the Egyptians accor ding to this must have been vexed with a triple punish ment at once a punishment fitly calculated for the morti fication of a delicate and a voluptuous people aking boils nauseous ulcers and a burning itch and to this that com munication of Moses to the people in case they proved disobedient does without all peradventure allude The Lord mill smite thee with the botch of Egypt and with the emcrods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed Deut xxviii 27 B I This infection was the more terrible in Egypt be cause according to the account of Herodotus 1 3 c 10 a very rare thing it was to see any rain and much more any bail in that climate and accordingly he mentions it as a kind of prodigy that in the reign of Psammenitus there happened to be a shower in Thebes which was never known before in the memory of man nor ever after to the age wherein our author wrote The Psalmist has given us a very poetic description of this judgment He destroyed the vines with haU and the sycamore trees with 74 book II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS fore nor was it like to that which falls in other climatest in winter time but larger than that which falls in the middle of spring to those that dwell in the northern and north western regions This hail brake down their boughs laden with fruit After this a tribe of locusts consumed the seed which was not hurt by the hail so that to the Egyptians all the hopes of future fruits of the ground were entirely lost J One would think the aforementioned cala mities might have been sufficient for one that was only foolish without wickedness to make him sensible what was for his advantage But Pharaoh led not so much by his folly as by his wickedness even when he saw the cause of his miseries still contested with God and wilfully deserted the cause of virtue So he bid Moses to take the Hebrews away with their wives and children but to leave their cattle behind since their own cattle were destroyed But when Moses said that what he desired was unjust since they were obliged to offer sacrifice to God of those cattle and the time being prolonged on this account a thick darknessj without the least light spread itself over the Egyptians whereby their sight being obstructed and their breathing hin dered by the thickness of the air they died miserably and under a terror lest they should be swallowed up by the dark cloud Besides this when the darkness after three days and as many nights was dispatched and when Pharaoh did not still repent and let the He brews go Moses came to him and said How long wilt thou be disobedient to the command of God for he enjoins thee to let the Hebrews go nor is there any other way of being freed from the calamities you are under unless you do so But the king was angry at what he said and threatened to strike off his head if he came any more to trouble him about these matters Hereupon Moses said he would not speak to him about them Â but that he himself together with the principal men among the Egyptians should desire the Hebrews to go away So when Moses had said this he went his way When God had signified that with one frost he gave up the cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts Ps lxxviii 47 48 And from the plain account of Moses where he mixes thunder hail and fire together Exod ix 23 the observation is obvious that here were no less than three of the elements in confede racy against Pharaoh s obstinacy the air in the thunder the water in the hail and the fire in the lightning all jointly demonstrating and proclaiming that the God of Israel was the God of nature B  Exod ix 24 t As to this winter or spring hail near Egypt and Judea see the like on thunder and lightning there in the note on VI 5 and Havercamp s note on III 1 J This is the creature which we properly call the grass hopper and wonderful is the account which several authors give of them Thevenot in his travels tells us That in that part of Scythia which the Cossacks now inhabit there are infinite numbers of them especially in dry seasons which the north east wind brings over from Tartary Circassia and Mingrelia which are seldom or never free from them that they fly in the air all compact together like avast cloud sometimes 15 or 18 miles long and about 10 or 12 miles broad so that they quite darken the sky and make the brightest day obscure and that wherever they light they devour all the corn in less than two hours time and frequently make a famine in the coun try These insects says he live not above six months and when they are dead the stench of them so corrupts and infects the air that it very often breeds dreadful pes tilences God as we hinted before calls the locust the canker worm caterpillar and the palmer worm his great army which he sends amongst a wicked and rebellious peo ple Joel ii 25 And how proper the expression is in relation to the locust in particular will appear from the account which Aldrovandus and Fincelius give us of these animals viz  That in the year of our Lord 852 on in finite number of them was seen to fly over twenty miles in Germany in one day in the manner of a formed army divided in several squadrons and having their quarters apart when they rested that the captains marched a day s journey before the rest and chose the most opportune places for their camp that they never removed until sun rising at which time they went away in as much order as any army of men could do that at last having done great mischief wherever they passed after prayers made to God they were driven by a violent wind into the Belgic ocean and there drowned but that being cast by the sea upon the shore they covered 140 acres of land and caused a great pestilence in the country which is enough to shew how dreadful a punishment this was especially con sidering that these locusts were such as were never known before and yet the ordinary locust as Aristotle and Pliny have described it was an animal so fierce and formidable that one single one would kill a serpent by taking it fast by the jaws and biting it to death Arist Hist Animal 1 6 c 23 Pliny s Nat Hist 1 11 c 9 and he CUrc s Com mentary B II The Septuagint and most translations render it a darkness which might be felt i e consisting of black va pours and exhalations so condensed that they might be perceived by the organs of touch But some commentators think that this is carrying the sense too far since in such a medium as this mankind could not live an hour much less for the space of three days as the Egyptians are said to have done and therefore they imagine that instead of a darkness that may be felt the Hebrew phrase may signify a darkness wherein men were groping and feeling about for every thing they wanted B Â Exod viii 7  an 1532 J 75 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS more plague he would compel the Egyptians to let the Hebrews go he commanded Moses to tell the people that they should have a sacrifice ready and that they should prepare themselves on the tenth day of the month Xanthicus against the fourteenth which month is called by the Egyptians Pharmuthi and Nisan by the Hebrews but the Mace donians call it Xanthicus And that he should carry away the Hebrews with all they had Accordingly Moses having got the Hebrews ready for their departure and having gather ed the people into tribes kept them together in one place But when the fourteenth day was come and all were ready to depart they offered sacrifice and purified their houses with the blood using bunches of hyssop for that purpose and when they had supped they burnt the remainder of the flesh as just ready to depart Whence it is that we do still offer this sacrifice in like manner and call this festival Pasch which signifies the feast of the Passover because on that day God passed us over and sent the plague upon the Egyptians For the destruction of the first born came upon the Egyptians that night so that many of the Egyptians who lived near the king s palace persuaded Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go Accordingly he called for Moses and bid them be gone as supposing that if once the Hebrews were gone out of the country Egypt should be freed from its miseries They also honoured the Hebrews with gifts some in order to get them to de part quickly and others on account of their neighbourhood and the friendship they had with them CHAP XV OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE HF BREWS FROM EGYPT UNDER THE COSDUCT OF MOSES HUS the Hebrews went out of Egypt while the Egyptians wept and repented T  These large presents made to the Israelites of vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment were as Jose phustruly calls them gifts really given them not lent them as our English falsely renders them They were spoils required not borrowed of them  Gen xv 14 Exod iii 29 xi 2 Ps cv 37 as the same version falsely ren ders the Hebrew word here used Exod xii 35 36 God had ordered the Jews to demand these as their pay and reward during their long and bitter slavery in Egypt as atonements for the lives of the Egyptians and as the condition of the Jews departure and the Egyptian deliver ance from these terrible judgments which had they not now ceased they had soon been all dead men as they voL I â No 7 they had treated them so hardly Now they took their journey by Letopolis a place at that time deserted but where Babylon was built afterward when Cambyses ravaged Egypt But as they went away hastily on the third day they came to a place called Baalzephou on the Red Sea and when they had no food out of the land because it was a desert they eat of loaves kneaded of flour only warmed by a gentle heat and this food they made use of thirty days for what they brought with them out of Egypt would not suffice them any longer time and this only while they dispensed it to each person to use so much only as would serve for necessity but not for satiety Whence it is that in memory of the want we were then in we keep a feast for eight days which is called the feast of Unleavened bread Now the entire multitude of those that went out in cluding the women and children was not easy to be numbered but those that were of an age fit for war were six hundred thousand They left Egypt in the month of Xanthicus on the fifteenth day of the lunar month four hundred and thirty years after our forefather Abraham came into Canaan But two hun dred and fifteen yearst only after Jacob re moved into Egypt it was the eightieth year of the age of Moses and of that of Aaron three more They also carried out the bones of Joseph with them as he charged his sons to do The Egyptians however soon repented that the Hebrews were gone J and the king also was greatly concerned that this had been procured by the magical arts of Moses so they resolved to go after them Accordingly they took their weapons and other warlike furniture and pursued after them in order to bring them back if once they overtook them because they would have no pretence to pray themselves confess xii 23 Nor was there any sense in borrowing or lending when the Israelites were finally de parting out of the land t Why our Mazorete copy so groundlessly abridges this account in Exod xii 40 as to ascribe four hundred and thirty years to the sole peregrination of the Israelites in Egypt when it is clear even by that Mazorete chrono logy elsewhere as well as from the express text itself in the Samaritan Septuagint and Josephus that they so journed in Egypt but half that time and that by conse quence the other half of their peregrination was in the land of Canaan before they came into Egypt is hard to say  Exod xiv 5 u 70  book ft ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to God against them since they had already been permitted to go out  And they thought they should easily overcome them as they had no armour and would be weary with their journey So they made haste in their pursuit and enquired of every one they met which way they were gone And indeed that land was difficult to be travelled over not only by armies but single persons Now Moses led the Hebrews this way that in case the Egyptians should repent and be desirous to pursue after them they might undergo the Eunishment of their wickedness and of the reach of those promises they had made to them he also chose this route on account of the Philistines who had quarrelled with them and hated them of old that by all means they might not know of their depar ture for their country is near that of Egypt and thence it was that Moses led them not along the road that tended to the land of the Philistines but he was desirous that they should go through the desert and so after a long journey and after many afflictions they might enter upon the land of Canaan Ano ther reason was that God had commanded him to bring the people to mount Sinai that there they might offer him sacrifices Now when the Egyptians had overtaken the Hebrews they prepared to fight them and by their multitude they drove them into a narrow place for the number that pursued after them was six hundred chariots with fifty thousand horsemen and two hundred thousand footmen all armed They also seized on the passages by which they ima gined the Hebrews might fly shutting them up between inaccessible mountains and the sea for there was on each side a ridge of mountains that terminated at the sea which was impassable by reason of their roughness and obstructed their flight wherefore they there pressed upon the Hebrews with their army where the ridges of the mountains were close with the sea which army they placed at the defiles of the mountains that so they might deprive them of any passage into the plain When the Hebrews therefore were neither able to bear up being thus as it were be sieged because they wanted provisions nor saw any possible way of escaping and i they should have thought of fighting they had no weapons they expected an universal destruction unless they delivered themselves up voluntarily to the Egyptians so they laid the blame on Moses and f forgot all the signs that had been wrought by God for the reco very of their freedom and this so far that their incredulity prompted them to throw stones at the prophet while he encouraged them and promised them deliverance and they resolved that they would deliver them selves up to the Egyptians so there was sor row and lamentation among the women and children who had nothing but destruction before their eyes while they were encom passed with mountains the sea and the ene mies and discerned no way of flying from them But Moses though the multitude looked fiercely at him did not relinquish the care ot them but despised all dangers out of his trust in God who as he had afforded them the several steps already taken for the reco very of their liberty which he had foretold  Take the main part of Reland s excellent note here which greatly illustrates Josephus and the Scriptures in this history with the small map thereunto belonging as follows â A traveller says Reland  whose name was Eneman when he returned out of Egypt told me that he went the same way from Egypt to mount Sinai which he supposed the Israelites of old travelled and that he found several mountainous tracts that ran down towards the Red Sea as he delineated them to me See A B C He thought the Israelites had proceeded as far as the desert of Etham see Exod xiii 20 when they were commanded by God to return back see Exod xiv 2 and to pitch their camp between Migdol and the sea and that when they were not able to fly unless by sea they were in the place here denoted by the letter B where they were shut in on each side by mountains and that on the part where stands D was the army of Pharaoh He also thought we might evidently learn hence how it might be said that the Israelites were in Etham before they crossed the sea and yet might be said to have come into Etham after they had passed over the sea Besides he gave me an account how he passed over the river in a boat near the city Suez which he said must needs be the Heroopolis of the an cients since that city could not be situated any where else in that neighbourhood As to the famous passage produced here by Dr Ber nard out of Herodotus as the most ancient heathen tes timony of the Israelites coming from the Red Sea into Palestine Bishop Cumberland has shewn that it belongs to the old Canaanite or Phoenician shepherds and their re tiring out of Egypt into Canaan or Phoenicia long before the days of Moses t Exod xiv 11 an 1532 77 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he would not now suffer them to he suhdued by their enemies to be either made slaves or be slain by them and standing in the midst of them he said  It is not just for us to distrust even men when they have hitherto well managed our affairs as if they would not be the same men hereafter but it is no bet ter than madness at this time to despair of the providence of God by whose power all has been performed which he promised when you expected no such things I mean all that I have been concerned in for your deliv erance and escape from slavery Nay when we are in the utmost distress as you see we now are we ought the rather to hope that God will succour us by whose operation it is that we are now encompassed within that narrow place that he may deliver us out of such difficulties as are otherwise insurmount able and out of which neither you nor your enemies expect you can be delivered and may at once demonstrate his own power and his providence over us nor does God use to give his help in small difficulties to those whom he favours but in such cases where no one can see how any hope in man can better their condition Depend therefore upon such a Protector as is able to make small things great and to shew that this mighty force against you is nothing but weakness and be not affrighted at the Egyptian army nor do you despair of being preserved be cause the sea before and the mountains be hind afford you no opportunity of flying for even these mountains if God so please may be made plain ground for you and the sea become dry land CHAP XVI OF THE MIRACULOUS DIVISION OF THE SEA FOR THE HE BREWS WHEN THEY WERE PURSUED BY THE EGYPTIANS AND OF THE OVERTHROW OF THEIR ENEMIES HEN Moses had said this he led them to the sea f while the Egyptians look w ed on for they were within sight Now these were so distressed by the toil of their pursuit that they thought proper to put off fighting till the next day but when Moses was come to the sea shore he took his rod and made the supplications to God and called upon him to be their helper and assistant and said Thou art not ignorant O Lord that it is beyond human strength and human contri vance to avoid the difficulties we are now under but it must be thy work altogether to procure deliverance to this army which has left Egypt at thy appointment We despair of any other assistance or contrivance and have recourse only to that hope we have in thee and if there be any method that can promise us an escape by thy providence we look up to thee for it and let it come quickly and manifest thy power to us and do thou raise up this people unto good courage and hope of deliverance who are deeply sunk into a disconsolate state of mind We are in a helpless place but still it is a place that thou possessest for the sea is thine and the mountains that enclose us are thine so that these mountains will open themselves if thou comraandest them and the sea also if thou commandest it will become dry land nay we might escape by a flight through the air if thou shouldest determine we should have that way of salvation When Moses had thus addressed himself to God he smote with his rod upon the s a which parted asunder at the stroke and re ceiving those waters into itself left the ground dry as a road4 and a place of flight for the Hebrews  Now when Moses saw this ap pearance of God and that the sea went out of its own place and left dry land he went first of all into it and bid the Hebrews follow him along that divine road and to rejoice at the danger their enemies that followed them were in and gave thanks to God for this surprising deliverance which appeared from him  This speech is very short in our copies Exod xiv 13 14 t The Red Sea called hy the ancients Sinus Arabicus and now Gulfo de Mecca is that part or branch of the southern sea which interposes itself between Egypt on the west Arabia Felix and some parts of Petraea on the east while the northern bounds of it touch upon Idumea or the coast of Edoro Edom in the Hebrew tongue sig nifies Red and was the nickname given Esau for selling his birth right for a mess of pottage The country which his posterity possessed was called after his name and so was the sea which adjoined to it but the Greeks not under standing the reason of the appellation translated it into their tongue and called it sguSga SaXaffrfa thence the Latin Mare Rubrum and we the Red Sea The HeÂ brews call it the Sea of Suph or Flags by reason of the great abundance of that kind of weed which grows at the bottom of it and the Arabs at this day name it Bubr el 7Â book n ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now while the Hebrews made no stay but went on earnestly as led by God s presence the Egyptians supposed at first that they were distracted and were going rashly upon manifest destruction but when they saw that they were gone a great way without any harm and that no obstacle or difficulty fell in their journey they made haste to pursue them and hoping that the sea would be calm for them also they put their cavalry foremost and went down into the sea Now the Hebrews while these were putting on their armour were before hand with them and got first over to the land on the other side without any hurt whence the others were en couraged and more courageously pursued them as hoping no harm would come to them neither but the Egyptians were not aware that they went into a road made for the He brews and not for others that this road was made for the deliverance of those in danger but not for those that were earnest to make use of it for the other s destruction As soon therefore as the whole Egyptian army was within it the sea flowed to its own place and came down with a torrent raised by storms of wind and encompassed the Egyptians Showers of rain also came down from the sky and dreadful thunder and lightning with flashes of fire Thunderbolts also were darted upon them nor was there any thing which God sends upon men as indications of his Wrath which did not happen at this time for a dark and dismal night oppressed them and thus did all these men perish so that there was not one man left to be a messenger of this calamity to the rest of the Egyptians t The Hebrews were not able to contain themselves for joy at their wonderful deliver ance and destruction of their enemies now indeed supposing themselves firmly deliv ered when those that would have forced them into slavery were destroyed and when they found they had God so evidently for their protector and how having escaped the dan ger they were in after this manner and see ing their enemies punished in such a way as is never recorded of any other men they were all the night employed in singing of hymns and in mirth MosesJ also composed Chaisem i e the sea of Clysona from a town situate on its western coast much about that place where the Israel ites passed over from the Egyptian to the Arabian shore But as the word Clysona may denote a drowning or over flowing with water it is not improbable that the town built in this place as well as this part of the sea might have such a name given it in memory of the fate of the Egyp tians who were drowned herein Well s Geography of the Old Testament vol ii B J Exod xiv 29 The waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left Diodorus Siculus relates that the Ichthyophagi who lived near the Red Sea had a tradition handed down to them through a long line of ancestors that the whole bay was once laid bare to the very bottom the waters retiring to the opposite shore and that they afterwards returned to their accustomed chan nel with a most tremendous revulsion Bib Hist lib iii p 174 Even to this day the inhabitants of the neigh bourhood of Corondel preserve the remembrance of a mighty army having been once drowned in the bay which Ptolomy calls Clysma Shaw s Travels p 349 The very country where the event is said to have happened in some degree bears testimony to the accuracy of the Mosaical narrative The scriptural Etham is still called Etti the wilderness of Shur the Mountain of Sinai and the country of Paran are still known by the same names Niebuhr s Travels vol i p 189 191 Marah s Elath and Midian are still familiar to the ears of the Arabs The grove of Elim

army are almost wanting in our copies of Exodus but fully extant in that of David Ps lxxvii 16 17 18 T Exod xiv 28 J What some have here objected against this passage of the Israelites over the Red Sea in this one night from the common maps viz that this sea being here about thirty miles broad so great an army could not pass over it in so short a time is a great mistake Mons Thevenot an eye witness informs us that this sea for about five days journey is no where more than eight or nine miles across and in one place but four or five miles according to De Lisle s map which is made from the best autho rities What has been farther objected against this passage of the Israelites and drowning of the Egyptians being mira culous also viz That Moses might carry the Israelites over at a low tide without any miracle while yet the Egyptians not knowing the tide so well as he might be drowned upon the return of the tide is truly absurd Yet does Artapanus an ancient heathen historian inform us that this was what the more ignorant Memphites who lived at a great distance pretended though he confesses that the more learned Heliopolitans who lived much nearer owned the destruction of the Egyptians and the deliverance of the Israelites to have been miraculous And De Castro a mathematician who surveyed this sea with great exactness informs us that there is no great flux or reflux in this part of the Red Sea to give a colour to the hypothesis nay that the elevation of the tide there is little above half the height of a man So vain and groundless are these and the like evasions and subterfuges of our modern sceptics and unbelievers and so certainly do thorough enquiries and authentic evidence disprove and confute such evasions and subterfuges upon all occasions aN 1532 J 79 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS a song unto God containing his praises and a thanksgiving for his kindness in hexameter verse As for myself I have delivered every part of this history as I found it in the sacred books nor let any one wonder at the strangeness of the narration if a way were discovered to those men of old time who were free from the wickedness of the modern ages whether it happened by the will of God or whether it happened of its own accord while for the sake of those that accompanied Alexander king of Macedonia who yet lived comparatively but a little while ago the Pamphylian sea retired and afforded them a passage through itself when they had no other way to go I mean when it was the will of God to destroy the monarchy of the Per sians and this is confessed to be true by all that have written about the actions of Alex ander but as to these events let every one determine as he pleases On the next day Moses gathered together the weapons of the Egyptians which were brought to the camp of the Hebrews by the current of the sea and the force of the winds assisting it and he conjectured that this also happened by Divine providence that so they might not be destitute of weapons So when he had ordered the Hebrews to arm them selves with them he led them to Mount Sinai in order to offer sacrifice to God and to ren der oblations for the salvation of the multi tude as he had been previously commanded  Take here the original passages of the four old authors that still remain as to the transit of Alexander the Great over the Pamphylian Sea for most of the oldest authors seen by Josephus are entirely lost I mean of Callis thenes Strabo Arrian and Appian As to Callisthenes who himself accompanied Alexander in this expedition Eustatius in his notes upon the third Iliad of Homer tells us that this Callisthenes wrote how the Pamphylian Sea did not only open a passage for Alexander but by rising and elevating its waters did pay him homage as its king Strabo s account is this Geog XIV page 666  Now about Phaselis is that narrow passage by the sea side through which Alexander led his army There is a mountain called Climax which adjoins to the sea of Pam phylia leaving a narrow passage on the shore which in calm weather is bare so as to be passable by travellers but when the sea overflows it is covered to a great degree by the waves Now the ascent by the mountains being round about and steep in still weather they make use of the road along the coast But Alexander fell into the winter season and committing himself chiefly to fortune he marched on before the waves retired and so it hap pened that they were a whole day journeying over it and were under water up to the navel Arrian s ac count is this I page 72 73 When Alexander removed from Phaselis he sent some part of his army over the mountains to Perga which road the Thracians shewed him A difficult way it was but short However he himself conducted those that were with him by the sea shore The road is impassable at any other time than when the north wind blows but if the south wind prevail there is no passing by the shore Now at this time after strong south winds a north wind blew and that not with out the Divine providence as both he and they that were with him supposed and afforded him an easy and quick passage Appian when he compares Caesar and Alex ander together DeBell Civil II page 522 says  That they both depended on their boldness and fortune as much as on their skill in war As an instance of which Alexander journeyed over a country without water in the heat of summer to the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon and quickly passed over the bay of Pamphylia when by Di vine providence the sea was cut off this Providence re straining the sea on his account as it had sent him rain when he travelled over the desert N B Since in the days of Josephus as he here assures us all the more numerous original historians of Alexander gave the account he has here set down as to the provi dential going back of the waters of the Pamphylian Sea when he was going with his army to destroy the Persian monarchy which the afore named authors now remaining fully confirm it is without any foundation that Josephus is here blamed by some late writers for quoting those ancient authors upon the present occasion Nor can the reflections of Plutarch or any other author later than Josephus be in the least here alledged to contradict him Josephus went by all the evidence he then had and that evidence of the most authentic sort So that whatever the moderns may think of the thing itself there is hence not the least colour for finding fault with Josephus He had rather been to blame had he omitted these quotations However since the pretended epistles of Alexander omitted what all the ancient historians asserted about this matter and which I know no sufficient grounds to con tradict as Plutarch informs us De Vit Alexand page 674 there will be reason to question those Epistles whether they were genuine or at least to think they were an imperfect collection of them VOL I â No 7 ao book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK III Containing an Interval of Two Years FROM THE EXODUS OUT OF EGYPT TO THE REJECTION OF THAT GENERATION CHAP I OP THE VICISSITUDES EXPERIENCED BY THE HEBREWS IN THEIR JOURNEY TO MOUNT SINAI WHEN the Hebrews had obtained such a wonderful deliverance the country was a great trouble to them for it was en tirely a desert and had not water enough to suffice any of the cattle for it was parched up and had not moisture that might afford nutriment to the vegetables So they were forced to travel over this country as having no other route They had indeed carried water with them from the land over which they had travelled before as their conductor had bidden them but when that was spent they were obliged to draw water out of wells with pain by reason of the hardness of the soil The water thus obtained also was bitter and unfit for drinking and this in small quantities And as they thus travelled they came late in the evening to a place called Marah from the badness of its waters for Mar denotes bitterness f Thither they came afflicted both by the tediousness of the jour ney and by want of food for it entirely failed them at that time Now here was a well which induced them to stay in the place for although it was not sufficient to satisfy so great an army it afforded them some comfort in such a desert place for they heard from those who had been to search that there was nothing to be found if they travelled farther  Dr Bernard takes notice here that this place Mar where the waters were bitter is called by the Syrians and Arabians Mariri and by the Syrians sometimes Marath all derived from the Hebrew Mar as also he takes notice that it is called the bitter fountain by Pliny The water however was bitter and not fit for men to drink and not only so but it was intolerable even to the cattle themselves When Moses saw how much the people were cast down and that the occasion of it could not be contradicted for the people were not in the nature of a complete army of men who might oppose a manly fortitude to the necessity that distressed them and the multitude of the children and of the women being of too weak capacities to be persuaded by reason blunted the courage of the men themselves Moses was in great difficulties and made every body s calamities to be his own for they all ran to him and begged of him the women begged for their infants and the men for the women that he would not overlook them but procure some way or other for their deliverance He therefore betook himself to prayer to God that he would change the water and make it fit for drinking And when God had granted him that favour he took the top of a stick that lay at his feet and divided it in the middle and made the section lengthways he then let it down into the well and persuaded the He brews that God had hearkened to his prayers and had promised to render the water such as they desired it to be in case they would be subservient to him in what he should en join them to do and this not after a remiss or negligent manner And when they asked what they were to do in order to have the himself Which waters are bitter still as Thevenot as sures us as there are also abundance of palm trees See his Travels part I chap xxvi page 166 t Exod xv 23 an 1532 J 81 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS water changed for the better he bid the strongest men among them that stood there to draw up water and told them that when the greatest part was drawn up the remain der would be potable So they laboured at it till the water was so agitated and purged as to be fit to drink Removing from thence they came to Elim f which place looked well at a distance for there was a grove of palm trees but when they came nearer it appeared to be a bad place for the palm trees were no more than seventy and they were ill grown and creep ing trees by the want of water for the coun try about was all parched and no moisture sufficient to water them and make them hope ful and useful was derived to them from the fountains which were twelve in number they were rather a few moist places than springs which not breaking out of the ground nor running over could not sufficiently water the trees And when they dug into the sand they met with no water and if they took a few drops of it into their hands they found it to be useless on account of its mud The trees also were too weak to bear fruit for want of being sufficiently cherished and enli vened by the water So they laid the blame on their conductor and made heavy com plaints against him and said that this their miserable state and the experience they had of adversity were owing to him for that they had then journeyed thirty days and had spent all the provisions they had brought with them and meeting with no relief they were in a very desponding condition Thus by fixing their attention upon nothing but their present misfortunes they were hindered from remembering what deliverances they had received from God and those by the virtue and wisdom of Moses also so they were very angry at their conductor and were zealous to stone him as the direct oc casion of their present miseries But while the multitude were irritated and bitterly set against him Moses cheerfully re lied upon God and upon his consciousness of the care he had taken of his own people and he came into the midst of them even while they clamoured against him and had stones in their hands in order to despatch him Now he was of an agreeable presence and very able to persuade the people by hi9 speeches accordingly he began to mitigate their anger and exhorted them not to be over mindful of their present adversities lest they should thereby suffer the benefits that had formerly been bestowed on them to slip out of their memories and he desired them by no means on account of their present uneasi ness to cast those great and wonderful fa vours and gifts which they had obtained of God out of their minds but to expect deli verance out of their present troubles which they could not free themselves from and this by the means of that Divine providence which watched over them as it was probable that God merely tried their virtue and exercised their patience by these adversities that it might appear what fortitude they had and what memory they retained of his former wonderful works in their favour and whether they would not think of them upon occasion of the miseries they now felt He told them it appeared they were not really good men either in patience or in remembering what had been successfully done for them some times by contemning God and his commands when by those commands they left the land of Egypt and sometimes by behaving them selves ill towards him who was the servant of God and this when he had never deceived them either in what he said or had ordered them to do by God s command He also re  The additions here to Moses s account of the sweet ening the waters at Marah seem derived from some an cient profane author and he such an author also as looks less authentic than are usually followed by Josephus Philo has not a syllable of these additions nor any other ancient writer that we know of Had Josephus written his Antiquities for the use of the Jews he would hardly have jriven them these very improb ible circumstances but writing to Gentiles that they might not complain of his omission of any accounts of such miracles derived from Gentiles he did not think proper to conceal what he had met with there about this matter Which procedure is perfectly agreeable to the character and usage of Josephus upon many occasions This is however barely conjectu ral and since Josephus never tells us when his own copy taken out of the temple had such additions or when any ancient notes supplied them or indeed when they were derived from Jewish and when from Gentile antiquities we can go no farther than bare conjecture in such cases Only the notions of Jews were generally so different from those of Gentiles that we may sometimes make no impro bable guesses to which sort such additions belong See also somewhat like these additions in Josephus s account of Elisha s making sweet the bitter and barren spring neax Jericho Of the War IV 8 t Exod xv 27 U2 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS minded them of all that had passed how the Egyptians were destroyed when they at tempted to detain them contrary to the com mand of God and after what manner the very same river was to the others bloody and not fit for drinking but was sweet and potable to them and how they went a new road through the sea which fled a long way from them by which means they were themselves preserved but saw their enemies destroyed and that when they were in want of weapons God gave them plenty of them Thus he re counted all the particular instances when they were in appearance just going to be de stroyed but God had saved them in a sur prising manner that he had still the same power and that they ought not even now to despair of his providence over them and ac cordingly he exhorted them to continue quiet and to consider that help would not come too late though perhaps not immediately if it were present with them before they suffered any great misfortune You ought said he to reason thus that God delays to assist you not because he has no regard to you but because he will first try your fortitude and the pleasure you take in your freedom that he may learn whether you have souls great enough to bear want of food and scarcity of water on its account or whether you really love to be slaves as cattle are slaves to such as own them and feed them liberally but only in order to make them more useful in their service As for myself I shall not be so much concerned for my own preservation for if I die unjustly I shall not reckon it any affliction but I am concerned for you lest by casting stones at me you should be thought to condemn God himself By this means looses pacified the people and restrained them from stoning him and brought them to repent of what they were going to do And because he thought the necessity they were under made their passion less unjustifiable he thought it needful to ap ply to God by prayer and supplication and going up to an eminece he requested some succour for the people and some way of de liverance from the want they were in because in God and in him alone was their hope of salvation He also desired that he would for give what necessity had forced the people to do since such was the nature of mankind hard to please and very complaining under adversities Accordingly God promised he would take care of them and afford the suc cour they were desirous of Now when Mo ses had heard this he came down to the mul titude and as soon as they saw him joyful at the promises he had received from God they changed their sad countenances into gladness So he placed himself in the midst of them and told them he came to bring them from God a deliverance out of their present dis tress Accordingly a little time after came a vast number of quails which birds are more plentiful in this Arabian Gulf than any where else flying over the sea and hovered over them till wearied with their laborious flight and indeed as usual flying very near to the earth they fell down among the Hebrews who caught them and satisfied their hunger with them supposing this was the method whereby God meant to supply them with food Hereupon Moses returned thanks to God for affording them assistance so suddenly and sooner than he had promised But soon after this first supply of food they received a second for as Moses was lifting up his hands in prayer a dew fell down and Moses when he found it adhere to his hands supposed this was also come for food from God he tasted it and perceiving that the people knew not what it was but thought it snowed and that it was what usually fell at that time of the year he informed them that this dew did not fall from heaven after the manner they imagined but came for their preservation and sustenance so he gave them some of it that they might be satisfied about what he had told them They also imitated their conductor and were pleased with the food for it was like honey in sweetness and in substance like to bdellium one of the sweet spices but in bigness equal to coriander seed The people were now very earnest in gather ing it but they were enjoined to gather it equally the measure of a homer for every one every day because this food should not come in too small quantity lest the weaker  It seems to me from what Moses Exod xri 18 St Paul 2 Cor viii 15 and Joaephus here says compared together that the quantity of manna that fell daily and did not putrefy was just so much as come to a homer a piece through the whole host of Israel and no more   an 1532 83 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  might not be able to get their share by rea son of the overbearing of the strong in col lecting it However these strong men when they had gathered more than the measure appointed for them they had no more than others but only tired themselves more in gathering it for they found no more than a homer a piece and the advantage they got by what was superfluous was none at all as it corrupted both by worms breeding in it and by its bitterness So divine and wonderful a food was this It also supplied the want of other sorts of food to those that fed on it and even now in all that place this manna comes down in rain according to what Moses then obtained of God to send it the people for their sustenance Now the Hebrews call this food manna f for the particle man in our language is the asking of a question what is this So the Hebrews were very joyful at what was sent them from heaven and they made use of this food for forty years J or as long as they remained in the wilderness As soon as they removed thence they came to Rephidim distressed to the last degree by thirst for though in the foregoing days they had met with a few small fountains they now found the earth entirely destitute of wa ter and were in an evil case They again turned their anger against Moses but he at first avoided the fury of the multitude and then betook himself to prayer beseeching God that as he had given them food when they were in the greatest want of it so he would give them drink since the favour of giving them food was of no value to them while they had nothing to drink God did not long delay to grant this request but pro mised that he would procure them a fountain and plenty of water from a place where they did not expect any so he commanded Moses to smite the rockÂ which they saw lying there with his rod and out of it to receive plenty in what they wanted for he had taken care that drink should come to them without any labour or exertion When Moses had re ceived this command he came to the people who waited for and looked upon him for they saw already that he was coming apace from his eminence As soon as he was come he told them that God would deliver them from their present distress and had granted them an unexpected favour and informed them that a river should run for their sakes out of the rock but they were amazed at that hearing supposing they were of necessity to cut the rock in pieces now they were distressed by their thirst and by their journey Moses however by only smiting the rock with his rod opened a passage and out of it burst water in great abundance and very clear while they were astonished at this wonderful effect and as it were quenched their thirst by the very sight of it so they drank this pleasant this sweet water and such it seemed to be as might well be expected where God was the donor They were also in admira tion how Moses was honoured by God and they made grateful returns of sacrifices to God for his providence towards them Now that scripture which is laid up in the temple informs us how God foretold to Moses that water should in this manner be derived out of the rock CHAP II OF THE HOSTILITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THE HEBREWS BY THE AMALEKITES AND OF THEIR COMPLETE DEFEAT HE name of the Hebrews began already to be every where renowned and ru T  This supposal that the sweet honey dew or manna so celebrated in ancient and modern authors as falling usu

Josephus thought so nor would he here contradict him though just before and IV 3 he seems directly to allow that it had not been seen pre viously However this food from heaven is here described by the word v i pei6au that it fell like snow and in Artapa nus a heathen writer it is compared to meal like to oat meal in colour like to snow rained down by God Essay on the Old Test Appendix page 239 But

to de fend themselves and to endeavour to destroy these men Those that induced the rest to do so were such as inhabited Gobilitis and Petra they were called Amalekites and were the most warlike of the nations that lived thereabout and whose kings exhorted one another and their neighbours to engage in this war against the Hebrews telling them that an army of strangers who had ran aM ay from slavery under the Egyptians lay in wait to ruin them which army they were not in common prudence and regard to their own safety to overlook but to crush them before they should gather strength and come to be in prosperity and perhaps attack them first in an hostile manner as presuming upon their indolence in not attacking them before and that they ought to avenge themselves for what had been done in the wilderness but that this could not be so well done when the He brews had once laid their hands on their cities and goods that those who endeavoured to crush a power in its first rise were wiser than those that attempted to stop its progress when it became formidable as these last seem to be angry only at the flourishing of others but the former do not leave any room for their enemies to become troublesome to them After they had sent such ambassages to the neighbouring nations and among each other they resolved to attack the Hebrews in battle These proceedings of the people of those countries occasioned perplexity and trouble to Moses who expected no such warlike pre parations and when these nations were ready to fight the multitude of the Hebrews were obliged to try the fortune of war they were in great disorder and in want of all neces saries and yet were to make war with men who were well prepared for it Then it was therefore that Moses began to encourage them and to exhort them to have a good heart and rely on God s assistance by which they had been advanced into a state of free dom and to hope for victory over those who were ready to fight with them in order to de prive them of that blessing He said they were to suppose their own army to be nume rous wanting nothing neither weapons nor money nor provisions nor such other con veniences as when men are in possession of they fight undauntedly and that they were to judge themselves to have all these advantages in the Divine assistance They were also to suppose the enemies army to be small un armed and weak and such as want those conveniences which they know must be wanted when it is God s will that they should be beaten He reminded them that they had experienced the value of God s assistance in abundance of trials and those such as were more terrible than war for that is only against men but these were against famine and thirst things that were in their own nature insu perable as also against mountains and that sea which affording them no way for esca ping yet had all these difficulties been con quered by God s gracious kindness so he exhorted them to be courageous at this time and to consider their entire prosperity to de pend on the present conquest of their ene mies Moses having thus encouraged the multi tude called together the princes of their tribes and their chief men both separately and jointly The young men he charged to obey their elders and the elders to hearken to their leader so the people were elevated in their minds and ready to try their fortune   The Amalekites were a people descended from Ama lek the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau by a concubine Gen xxxvi 12 And the ground of their enmity against the Israelites is generally supposed to have been an innate hatred from the remembrance of Jacob s depriving their progenitor both of his birth right and blessing Their falling upon them however and that without any provo cation when they saw them reduced to so low a condition by the fitigue of their march and the excessive drought they laboured under was an inhuman action and justly deserved the defeat which Joshua gave them Bu then the reason why God thought fit to denounce a perpetual war against them is to be resolved into this â â That know ing the Israelites were pre ordained by God to be put in possession of the land of Canaan they came against them with an armed force in hopes of frustrating the designs of Providence concerning them And this is the reason which Moses himself assigns for this declaration of war because his i e

delay that no backwardness might be an hin drance to their present resolution so Moses classed all that were fit for war into different troops and set over them Joshua the son of Nun of the tribe of Ephraim one that was of treat courage and patient to undergo la ours of great abilities to understand and to speak what was proper and very serious in the service of God and indeed made like another Moses a teacher of piety towards God He also appointed a small party of the armed men to be near the wafer and to take care of the children and the women and of the entire camp so that whole night they prepared themselves for the battle they took their weapons if any of them had such as were well made and attended to their com manders as ready to rush forth to the battle as soon as Moses should give the word of command Moses also kept awake teach ing Joshua after what manner he should order his camp but when the day began Moses called Joshua again and exhorted him to ap prove himself in deeds such a one as his repu tation made men expect from him and to gain glory by the present expedition in the opinion of those under him for his exploits in this battle he also gave a particular exhor tation to the principal men of the Hebrews and encouraged the whole army as it stood before him and when he had thus animated them both by his words and works and pre pared every thing he retired to a mountain and committed the army to God and to Joshua v The armies having joined battle soon came to a close fight hand to hand both sides shew ing great alacrity and encouraging one ano ther and indeed while Moses stretched out his hands towards heaven the Hebrews were too hard for the Amalekites but Moses  This eminent circumstance that while Moses s hands were held up towards heaven the Israelites prevailed and while they were let down towards the earth the Amalekites prevailed seems the earliest intimation we have of the proper posture used of old in solemn prayer which was the stretching out the hands and eyes towards heaven as other passages of the Old and New Testament inform us Nay hy the way this posture seems to have continued in the Christian church till the clergy instead not being able to sustain his hands thus stretched out for as often as he let down his hands so often were his own people worsted he bade his brother Aaron and Hur their sister Miriam s husband to stand on each side of him and take hold of his hands and not to permit his weariness to prevent it but to assist him in the extension of his hands When this was done the Hebrews conquered the Amalekites by main force and indeed they had all perished unless the approach of night had obliged the Hebrews to desist from killing any more So our forefathers obtained a most signal and most seasonable victory for they not only overcame those that fought against them but also terrified the neigh bouring nations and got great and splendid advantages which they obtained of their ene mies by their hard pains in this battle for when they had taken the enemies camp they got great booty for the public and for their own private families whereas till then they had not any plenty even of necessary food The afore mentioned victory was also the occasion of their prosperity not only for the present but for future ages also for they not only made slaves of the bodies of their ene mies but effectually damped their nlinds and after this battle became terrible to all that dwelt round about them They also acquired a vast quantity of riches for a great deal of silver and gold was left in the enemies camp as also brazen vessels which they made com mon use of in their families many utensils also that were embroidered there were of both sorts that is of what were woven and what were the ornaments of their armour and other things that served for use to their family and for the furniture of their rooms they got also the prey of their cattle and of whatso ever uses to follow camps when they remove from one place to another so the Hebrews now valued themselves upon their courage and claimed great merit for their valour and they perpetually inured themselves to take of learning their prayers by heart read them out of a book which is in a great measure inconsistent with such an elevated posture and which seems to me to have been only a later practice under the corrupt state of the church Though the constant use of divine forms of prayer praise and thanksgiving appears to have been the practice of God s people Patriarchs Jews and Christians in all the past ages        86 boor

gathered to gether the armour of those that were fled and gave rewards to such as had signalised themselves in the action and highly com mended Joshua their general who was at tested to by all the army on account of the great actions he had done nor was any one of the Hebrews slain though the slain of the enemies army were too many to be enume rated So Moses offered sacrifice of thanks giving to God and built an altar which he named the Lord the conqueror He also foretold that the Amalekites should be utterly destroyed and that hereafter none of them should remain because they fought against the Hebrews when they were in the wilder ness and in their distress Moreover he re freshed the army with feasting and thus did they fight this first battle with those that ven tured to oppose them after they were gone out of Egypt But when Moses had cele brated this festival for the victory he per mitted the Hebrews to rest for a few days and then brought them out after the fight in order of battle for they had now many sol diers in light armour and going gradually on he came to mount Sinai and three months after they were removed out of Egypt at which mountain as we have before

a prosperous con dition his affairs were he willingly came to meet him and Moses took Zipporah his wife and his children and pleased himself with his coming and when he had offered sacrifice he made a feast for the multitude near the bush he had formerly seen everyone accor ding to their families partaking of the festi val But Aaron and his family took Raguel and sung hymns to God as to him who had been the author and procurer of their deliver  Exod xviii 1 ance and their freedom They also praised their conductor as him by whose virtue it was that all things had succeeded so well with them Raguel also in his eucharistical oration to Moses made great encomiums upon the whole multitude and he could not but admire Moses for his fortitude and that humanity he had shewed in the delivery of his friends CHAP IV OF RAGUEL s FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS RESPECTING THE GO VERNMENT OF THE HEBREWS WHICH WERE ADOPTED BV MOSES THE next day Raguel saw Moses in the midst of a crowd of business f for he determined the differences of those that re ferred them to him every one still going to him and supposing they should then only obtain justice if he were the arbitrator and those that lost their causes thought it no great harm while they thought they lost them justly and not by partiality Raguel however said nothing at that time as not desirous to be any hindrance to such as had a mind to make use of the virtue of their conductor but after ward he took Moses to himself and when he had him alone he instructed him in what he ought to do and advised him to leave the trouble of lesser causes to others but himself to take care of the greater and of the people s safety for that others of the Hebrews might be found that were fit to determine causes but that nobody but a Moses could take care of the safety of many thousands Be not therefore said he  insensible of thine own virtue and what thou hast done by minister ing under God to the people s preservation Leave therefore the determination of com mon causes to others but do thou reserve thyself to the attendance on God only and look out for methods of preserving the multi tude from their present distress Make use of the method I suggest as to human affairs and take a review of the army and appoint chosen rulers over tens of thousands and then over thousands and then divide them into five hundreds and again into hundreds and into fifties and set rulers over each of them who may distinguish them into thirties and keep them in order and at last number t Exod xviii 13 AN 1532 87 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them by twenties and by tens And let there be one commander over each number to be nominated from the number of those over whom they are rulers but such as the whole multitude have tried and approve of as be ing good and righteous men and let these rulers decide the controversies they have one with another if any great cause arise let them bring the cognizances of it before the rulers of a higher dignity and if any great difficulty arise that is too hard for even their determination let them send it to thee By these means two advantages will be gained that the Hebrews will have justice done them and thou wilt be able to attend con stantly on God and procure him to be more favourable to the people This was the admonition of Raguel which Moses received very kindly and acted accor ding to his suggestion nor did he conceal the invention of this method nor pretend to it himself but informed the multitude who it was that invented it nay he has named Ra guel in the books he wrote as the person who invented the ordering of the people as thinking it right to give a true testimony to worthy persons although he might have ob tained reputation by ascribing to himself the invention of other men whence we may learn the virtuous disposition of Moses but of that disposition we shall have occasion to speak in other places CHAP V OF MOSES S ASCENT TO MOUNT SINAI AND OF THE DIVINE LAWS WHICH HE RECEIVED FROM GOD AND DELIVERED TO THl HEBREWS N OW Moses called the multitude together and told them that he was going unto mount Sinai to converse with God to receive and to bring back with him a certain oracle But he enjoined them to pitch their tents near the mountain and prefer the habitation that was nearest to God before one more remote When he had said this he ascended up to mount Sinai which is the highest of all the mountains f that are in that country and is not only very difficult to be ascended by men on account of its vast altitude but because of the sharpness of its precipices Nay in deed it cannot be looked at without pain to the eyes and besides this it was terrible and inaccessible on account of a general rumour that God dwelt there But the Hebrews re moved the tents as Moses had bidden them and took possession of the lowest parts of the mountain and were elevated in their minds in expectation that Moses would return with promises of the good things he had proposed to them So they feasted and waited for their conductor and kept themselves pure foT three days as he had before ordered them to do And they prayed to God that he would favourably receive Moses in his conversing with him and bestow some such gifts upon them by which they might live well They also lived more plentifully as to their diet and put on their wives and children more ornamental clothing than they usually wore Two days passed in this way of feasting but on the thirdJ day before sun rise a cloud spread itself over the whole camp of the He brews such an one as none had before seen and encompassed the place where they had pitched their tents And while all the rest of the air was clear there came strong winds that raised up large showers of rain which became a mighty tempest There was also such lightningjl as was terrible to those that  This manner of electing the judges and officers of the Israelites by the testimonies and suffrages of the people before they were ordained by God or Moses deserves to be carefully noted because it was the pattern of the like manner of the choice and ordination of bishops presby ters and deacons in the Christian church See Constitut Apost VIII 4 16 18 t Since this mountain Sinai is here said to be the high est of all the mountains in that country it must be that now called St Catharine s which is one third higher than that within a mile of it now called Sinai as Monsieur Thevenot informs as Travels Part I chap xxviii page 168 169 The other name of it Horeb is never used by Tosephus and perhaps was its name among the Egyptians only whence the Iraelites were lately come as Sinai was its name among the Arabians Oanaanites and other voL I No 8 nations Accordingly when 1 Kings ix 8 the Scripture says that Elijah came to Horeb the mount of God Jose phus justly says Anliq VIII 13 that he came to the mountain called Sinai and Jerome here cited by Dr Hudson says that he took this mountain to have two names Sinai and Choreb De Nomin Heb j age 427 Edit Benedict X Exod xix 16 II That fire and lightning should attend the presence of God is a notion so frequent in the most ancient and Orien tal theology that it might possibly give occasion to the worship of fire among the Chaldeans and Persians to the magi among the Cappadocians called Purrethi which Strabo mentions and to the vestal fires among the Greeks and Romans as well as the ancient Britons 88 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS saw it and thunder with its thunderbolts were sent down and declared God to be there present in a gracious way to such as Moses desired he should be gracious Now as to these matters every one of my readers may think as he pleases but I am under the necessity of relating this history as it is de scribed in the sacred books This sight and the amazing sound that came to their ears disturbed the Hebrews to a prodigious de gree for they were not such as they were accustomed to And then the rumour that was spread abroad how God frequented that mountain greatly astonished their minds so they sorrowfully remained within their tents as both supposing Moses to be destroyed by the Divine wrath and expecting the like de struction for themselves While they were under these apprehen sions Moses appeared joyful and greatly ex alted When they saw him they were freed from their fear and admitted more comfort able hopes as to what was to come The air also was become clear and pure of its former disorders upon the appearance of Moses whereupon he called the people together in order to their hearing what God would say to them And when they were assembled he stood on an eminence whence they might all hear him and said God has received me graciously O Hebrews as he has formerly done and has suggested a happy method of living for you and an order of political go vernment and is now present in the camp I therefore charge you for his sake and the sake of his works and what we have done by his means that you do not put a low value on what I am going to say because the com mands have been given by me nor because it is the tongue of a man that delivers them to you But if you have a due regard to the great importance of the things themselves you will understand the greatness of Him whose institutions they are and who has not disdained to communicate them to me for our Hvixa 8Xs  jjÂ ftopprjs aÂ p EuiEpov tfup

bed but he who obliged the Nile to run bloody for your sakes and tamed the haugh tiness of the Egyptians by various sorts of judgments he who provided a way through the sea for us he who contrived a method of sending us food from heaven when we were distressed for want of it he who made the water to issue out of a rock when we had very little of it before he by whose means Adam was made to partake of the fruits of the land and of the sea he by whose means Noah escaped the deluge he by whose means our forefather Abraham of a wander ing pilgrim was made the heir of the land of Canaan he by whose means Jacob was adorned with twelve virtuous sons he by whose means Joseph became a potent lord over the Egyptians he it is who conveys these instructions to you by me as his interpreter And let them be to you venerable and con tended for more earnestly by you than your own wives and children for if you will follow them you will lead a happy life you will en joy the land fruitful the sea calm and the fruit of the womb complete as nature re quires you will also be terrible to your ene mies for I have been admitted into the pre sence of God and been made a hearer of his incorruptible voice so great is his concern for the welfare of your nation When he had said this he brought the people with their wives and children so near the mountain that they might hear God him self speaking to them about the precepts which they were to practise that the energy of what should be spoken might not be hurt by its utterance by that tongue of a man which could but imperfectly deliver it to their understanding And they all heard a voice that came from above insomuch that none of those words escaped them which Moses wrote in two tables and though it is not s say the Chaldaic oracles and as for earthquakes or shaking of mountains this is no more than what all nations suppose have ever come to pass upon God s manifesting himself at any time for it is not only the Psalmist who tells us that the earth shook and the heaven dropped at the presence of God but in the description which Virgil gives us of the approach of Phoebus he does in a manner translate the words of Moses Tremere

there is but one God and that we ought to worship him only The second commands us not to make the image of any living crea ture to worship it The third that we must not swear by God in a false matter The fourth that we must keep the seventh day by resting from all sort of work The fifth that we must honour our parents The sixth that we must abstain from murder The seventh that we must not commit adultery The eighth that we must not be guilty of theft The ninth that we must not bear false witness The tenth that we must not admit of the desire of any thing that is another s f Now when the multitude had heard God himself giving those precepts which Moses had discoursed of they rejoiced at what was said and the congregation was dissolved But on the following day they came to his tent and desired him to bring them besides other laws from God Accordingly he ap pointed such laws and afterward informed them in what manner they should act in all cases which laws I shall mention in their proper place but I shall reserve most of them for another work and make there a distinct explication of them When matters were brought to this state Moses went up again to mount Sinai of which he had told them beforehand He made his ascent in their sight but when he had been absent from them forty days fear seized upon the Hebrews lest he should have come to any harm Nor was there any thing that so much troubled them as the idea that Moses had perished Now there was a variety in their sentiments about it some saying that he was fallen among wild beasts and those that were of this opinion were chiefly such as were ill disposed to him but others saying that he was departed and gone to God The wiser sort were led by their reason to em brace neither of those opinions with any satisfaction thinking that as it was a thing that sometimes happens to men to fall among wild beasts and perish that way so it was probable enough that he might depart and goto God on account of his virtue they therefore were quiet and expected the event though they were exceeding sorrowful upon the probability that they were deprived of a governor and a protector such an one in deed as they could never recover again Nor would this suspicion give them leave to expect any comfortable event about this man nor could they prevent their trouble and me lancholy upon this occasion However the camp durst not move all this while because Moses had commanded them to stay there When forty days and as many nights were expired Moses came down having tasted nothing of food usually appointed for the nourishment of men His appearance filled the army with gladness and he declared to them what care God had of them and by what manner of conduct they might live hap pily telling them that during his absence God had suggested to him also that he would have a tabernacle built for him into which he would descend when he came to them and how they hould carry it about with them when they removed and that there should be no longer any occasion for going up to mount Sinai but that he would himself come and pitch his tabernacle amongst them and be present at their prayers As also that the tabernacle should be of such measures and construction as he had shewed him and that the work must he immediately begun and prosecuted diligently When he had said this he shewed them the two tables with the Ten Commandments engraven upon them five upon each table and the writing was by the hand of God CHAP VI OF THE TABERNACLE WHICH MOSES BUILT IN THE WILDER NESS FOR THE HONOUR OF COD N OW the Israelites rejoiced at what they had seen and heard of their conductor  As disobedience to parents is by the law of Moses threatened to be punished with death so on the contrary long life is promised to the obedient and that in their own country which God had peculiarly enriched with abundance of blessings Heathens also gave the very same encouragement saying that such children should be dear to the gods both living and dying So Euripides It was also one of their promises Thou shalt live long if thou nourish thy ancient parents Whence children are called by Xenophon TspoSoirxoi Patrick in locum B t

and were not wanting in diligence according to their ability but they brought silver and gold and brass and the best sorts of wood and such as would not at all decay by putre faction camels hair also and sheep skins some of them dyed of a blue colour and some of a scarlet some brought the flower for the purple colour and others for white with wool dyed by the aforementioned flowers and fine linen and precious stones which those that use costly ornaments set in ounces of gold they brought also a great quantity of spices For of these materials did Moses build the tabernacle which did not at all differ from a moveable temple Now when these things were brought together with great diligence for every one was ambitious to further the work even beyond their ability he set ar chitects over the works and this by the com mand of God and indeed the very same which the people themselves would have chosen had the election been allowed to them Now their names are set down in wri ting in the sacred books and they were these Bazaleel the son of Uri of the tribe of Judah the grandson of Miriam the sister of their conductor and Aholiab the on of Ahisa mach of the tribe of Dan Now the people went on with what they had undertaken with so great alacrity that Moses was obliged to restrain them by making proclamation that what had been brought was sufficient as the artificers had informed him so they fell to work upon the building of the tabernacle Moses also informed them according to the direction of God both what the measures were to be and its dimensions and how many vessels it ought to contain for the use of the sacrifices The women also were ambitious to do their parts about the garments of the priests and about other things that would be wanted in this work both for orna ment and for the divine service itself When all things were prepared the gold and the silver and the brass and what was  woven Moses having previously appointed that there should be a festival and that sacri fices should be offered according to every one s ability reared up the tabernacle And when he had measured the open court fifty cripts omitted here the heinous sin of the Israelites in making and worshipping the golden calf or the Egyptian Apis made of wood but covered over with cast gold round cubits broad and a hundred long he set up brazen pillars five cubits high twenty on each of the longer sides and ten pillars for the breadth behind Every one of the pillars also had a ring Their chapiters were of silver but their bases were of brass they resembled the sharp ends of spears and were of brass fixed into the ground Cords were also put through the rings and were tied at the farther ends to brass nails of a cubit long which at every pillar were driven into the floor and would keep the tabernacle from being shaken by the violence of winds But a curtain of fine soft linen went round all the pillars and hung down in a flowing man ner from their chapiters and enclosed the whole space forming a kind of wall about it Such was the structure of three of the sides of this enclosure but as for the fourth side which was fifty cubits in extent and was the front of the whole twenty cubits of it were for the opening at the gates wherein stood two pillars on each side after the resem blance of open gates these were made wholly of silver and polished all over excepting the bases which were of brass Now on each side of the gates there stood three pillars which were inserted into the concave bases of the gates and were suited to them and round them was drawn a curtain of fine linen But to the gates themselves which were twenty cubits in extent and five in height the curtain was composed of purple and scarlet and blue and fine linen and em broidered with divers sorts of figures except ing the figures of animals Within these gates was the brazen laver for purification having a bason beneath of the like matter in which the priests might wash their hands and sprinkle their feet And this was the ornamental construction of the enclosure about the court of the tabernacle which was exposed to the open air As to the tabernacle itself Moses placed it in the middle of that court with its front to the east that when the sun rose it might send its first rays upon it Its length when it was set up was thirty cubits and its breadth was ten cubits One of its walls was on the south and the other was exposed to the north about it See Isaiah xl 19 20 Jer x 3 4 and Hab ii 19  Exod xxx 19    aN 1532 91 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and on the back part of it remained the west It was necessary that its height should be equal to its breadth ten cubits There were also pillars made of wood twenty on each side they were wrought into a quadrangular figure in breadth a cubit and a half but the thickness was four fingers they had thin plates of gold affixed to them on both sides inwardly and outwardly they had also each of them two silver tenons inserted into their bases in each of which was a socket to re ceive the tenon But the pillars on the west ern wall were six Now all these tenons and sockets accurately fitted one another inso much that the joints were invisible and both seemed to be one united wall it was also covered with gold both within and without The number of pillars was equal on the op posite sides and there were on each part twenty and every one had the third part of a span in thickness so that the number of thirty cubits were fully made up between them But as to the wall behind where the six pillars made up together only nine cubits they made two other pillars and cut them out of one cubit which they placed in the cor ners and made them equally fine with the others Now every one of the pillars had rings of gold affixed to their fronts outward as if they had taken root in the pillars and stood one row over against another round about through which were inserted gilded bars each of them five cubits long and these bound together the pillars the head of one bar running into another after the nature of one tenon inserted into another But for the wall behind there was but one row of bars that went through all the pillars into which row ran the ends of the bars on each side of the longer walls and all joined so fast toge ther that the tabernacle could not be shaken either by the winds or by any other means but remained firm quiet and immoveable As for the inside Moses divided its length into three partitions At the distance often cubits from the most sacred end he placed four pillars whose workmanship was the game with that of the rest and they stood upon the like bases with them each at a small distance from his fellow Now the room within those pillars was the most holy place but the rest of the room was the tabernacle which was open for the priests However this VOL I â NO e proportion of the measures of the tabernacle proved to be an imitation of the system of the world for that third part which was within the four pillars to which the priests were not admitted is as it were a heaven peculiar to God but the space of the twenty cubits is as it were sea and land on which men live and so this part is peculiar to the priests only At the front where the entrance was made they placed seven pillars of gold that stood on bases of brass and they spread over the tabernacle veils of fine linen and purple and blue and scarlet colours embroidered The first veil was ten cubits every way and this was spread over the pillars which parted the temple and kept the most holy place con cealed within and this veil was that which made this part not visible to any Now the whole temple was called the Holy Place but that part which was within the four pillars and to which none were admitted was called the Holy of Holies This veil was very orna mental and embroidered with all sorts of fine flowers and there were interwoven into it a variety of ornaments excepting only the forms of animals Another veil which covered the five pillars at the entrance was like the for mer in its magnitude texture and colour and at the corner of every pillar a ring re tained it from the top downwards half the depth of the pillars the other half affording an entrance for the priests who crept under it Over this was a veil of linen of the same size with the former it was to be drawn this way or that way by cords whose rings fixed to the texture of the veil and to the cords also were subservient to the drawing and un drawing of the veil and to the fastening it at the corner that it might be no hindrance to the view of the sanctuary especially on so lemn days but that on other days and espe cially when the weather was inclined to snow it might be expanded and afford a covering to the veil of divers colours Hence that custom of ours is derived of having a fine linen veil after the temple has been built to be drawn over the entrances The ten other curtains were four cubits in breadth and twenty eight in length and had golden clasps which joined the one curtain to the other so exactly that they seemed to be one entire curtain These were spread over the temple and covered all the top and part of the walls Aa 92 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS on the sides and behind within one cubit of the ground There were other curtains of the same breadth with these but one more in number and longer for they were thirty cu bits long these were woven of hair and were extended loosely down to the ground appearing like a triangular front and elevation at the gates the eleventh curtain being used for this very purpose There were also other curtains made of skins above these which afforded covering and protection to those that were woven both in hot weather and when it rained And great was the surprise of those who viewed these curtains at a dis tance for they seemed not at all to differ from the colour of the sky But those that were made of hair and of skins reached down in the same manner as did the veil at the gates and kept off the rain and heat of the sun and after this manner was the taber nacle reared There was also an ark made sacred to God of wood that was naturally strong and could not be corrupted This was called Eron in our own language Its construction was thus its length was five spans f but its breadth and height was each of them three spans It was covered with gold both within and without so that the wooden part was not seen It had also a cover united to it by golden hinges after a wonderful manner which cover was every way evenly fitted to it and had no eminences to hinder its exact conjunction There were also two golden rings belonging to each of the longer boards and passing through the entire wood and through them gilded bars passed along each board that it might thereby be moved and carried about as occasion should require for it was not drawn in a cart by yokes of kine but borne on the shoulders of the priests Upon this cover were two images called cherubim They are flying creatures but their form is not like to that of any of the creatures which men have seen though Mo ses said he had seen such beings near the throne of God In this ark he put the two tables whereon the Ten Commandments were written five upon each table and two and a half upon each side of them and this ark he placed in the most holy place In the holy place he placed a table like those at Delphi Its length was two cubits its breadth one cubit and its height three spans It had feet also the lower half of which were complete feet resembling those which the Dorians put to their bedsteads but the upper parts towards the table were wrought into a square form The table had a hollow towards every side having a ledge of four fingers depth that went round about like a spiral both on the upper and lower   We meet with imitations of this divinely instituted emblem among several heathen nations both in ancient and modern times Thus Tacitus de Mor German cap 40 informs us that  the inhabitants of the north of Germany our Saxon ancestors in general worshipped Herthum that is the mother earth and believed her to interpose in the affairs of men and to visit nations that to her within a sacred grove in a certain island of the ocean a vehicle covered with a vestment was consecrated and allowed to be touched by the priest alone who perceived when the goddess entered into this her sacred place and with pro found veneration attended her vehicle which was drawn by cows While the goddess was on her progress days of rejoicing were kept at every place which she vouchsafed to visit They engaged in no war they meddled not with arms they locked up their weapons peace and quiet ness only were then known these only relished till the game priest reconducted the goddess satiated with the con versation of mortals to her temple Among the Mexicans Vitziputzli their supreme god was represented in a human shape sitting on a throne supported by an azure globe which they called heaven Four poles or sticks came out from two sides of this globe at the ends of which serpents heads were carved the whole making a litter which the priests carried on their shoulders whenever the idol was shewn in public Picart s Ceremonies vol iii p 146 In Lieutenant Cook s voyage round the world pub lished by Dr Hawksworth vol ii p 252 we find that the inhabitants of Huaheine one of the islands lately dis covered in the South Sea had  a kind of chest or ark the lid of which was nicely sewed on and thatched very neatly with palm nut leaves It was fixed upon two poles and supported upon little arches of wood very neatly carved the use of the poles seemed to be to remove it from place to place in the manner of our sedan chair in one end of it was a square hole in the middle of which was a ring touching the sides and leaving the angles open so as to form a round hole within a square one without The first time Mr Banks saw this coffer the aperture at the end was stopped with a piece of cloth which lest he should give offence he left untouched Probably there was then something within but now the cloth was taken away and upon lookipg into it it was found empty The general resemblance between this repository and the ark of the Lord among the Jews is remarkable but it is still more remarkable that upon enquiring of the boy what it was called he said Ewharra no Eautau the house of God he could however giye no account of its sig nification or use Parkhurst s Heb Lex p 690 4th edit 8 t A cubit was about twenty one inches and a span half a cubit  an 1532 93 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS part of the body of the work Upon every one of the feet was also inserted a ring not far from the cover through which went bars of gilded wood beneath to be taken out upon occasion there being a cavity where it was joined to the rings for they were not entire rings but before they came quite round they ended in acute points one of which was inserted into the prominent part of the table and the other into the foot and by these it was carried when they journeyed Upon this table which was placed on the north side of the temple not far from the most holy place were laid twelve unleavened loaves of bread six upon each heap one above another they were made of two tenth deals of the purest flour which tenth deal is a measure of the Hebrews containing seven Athenian cotylae Above those loaves were put two vials full of frankincense Now after seven days other loaves were brought in their stead on the seventh day which is by us called the sab bath but for the occasion of this invention of placing loaves here we will speak of it in another place Over against this table near the southern wall was set a candlestick of cast gold hol low within and of the weight of one hundred pounds which the Hebrews call cinchares which if it be turned into the Greek language denotes a talent  It was made with its knobs lilies pomegranates and bowls which orna ments amounted to seventy in all By this means the shaft elevated itself from a single base and spread into as many branches as there are planets including the sun among mem It terminated in seven hands in one row all standing parallel to each other and these branches carried seven lamps one by one in imitation of the number of the planets these lamps looked to the east and the south the candlestick being situate obliquely Between this candlestick and the table which as we said were within the sanctuary was the altar of incense made of wood in deed but of incorruptible wood and en tirely crusted over with a golden plate Its breadth on each side was a cubit but the height double Upon it was a grate of gold above the altar which had a golden crown encompassing it round about whereto be  A homer longed rings and bars by which the priests carried it when they journeyed Before this tabernacle there was reared a brazen altar but it was within made of wood five cubits by measure on each side but its height was but three in like manner adorned with brass plates as bright as gold It had also a bra zen hearth of net work for the ground un derneath received the fire from the hearth because it had no basis to receive it Near this altar lay the basons the vials the cen sers and the caldrons made of gold but the other vessels made for the use of the sacri fices were all of brass And such was the construction of the tabernacle and the ves sels thereto belonging CHAP VII OF THE SACERDOTAL GARMENTS THERE were peculiar garments ap pointed for the priests and for all the rest which garments they call cahanaeae or priestly garments as also for the high priests which they call cahanaeae rabbae and denote the high priest s garment Such was there fore the habit of the rest but when the priest approaches the sacrifices he purifies himself with the purification which the law prescribes And in the first place he puts on that which is called machanase which means somewhat that is fast tied It is a girdle composed of fine twined linen into which the feet are in serted in the nature of breeches but above half of it is cut ofF and it ends at the thighs where it is tied fast Over this he wore a linen vestment made of fine flax doubled and called chethone for we call linen by the name of chethone This vestment reaches to the feet and sits close to the body and has sleeves that are tied fast to the arms it is girded to the breast a little above the elbows by a girdle often going round four fingers broad but so loosely woven that it resembles the skin of a serpent It is embroidered with flowers of scarlet pur ple blue and fine twined linen but the warp is nothing but fine linen The beginning of its circumvolution is at the breast and when it has gone often round it is there tied and hangs loosely down to the ankles I mean this all the time the priest is not about any 94 book hi ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS laborious service for in this position it ap pears in the most agreeable manner to the spectators but when he is obliged to assist at offering sacrifices and to do the appointed service that he may not be hindered in his operations by its motion he throws it to the left and bears it on his shoulder Moses calls this belt abaneth but we have learned from the Babylonians to call it emia This vest ment has no loose or hollow parts any where in it but only a narrow aperture about the neck and it is tied with certain strings hang ing down from the edge over the breast and over the back and is fastened above each shoulder It is called massabazanes Upon his head he wears a cap not brought to a conic form nor including the entire head but still including more than the half of it It is named masnaemphthes or a mitre but its make is such that it seems to be a crown It is made of thick swaths but the contexture is of linen and it i3 doubled round many times and sewed together besides which a piece of fine linen covers the whole cap from the upper part and reaches down to the forehead and hides the seams of the swaths which would otherwise appear in decently this adheres closely upon the solid part of the head that it may not fall off du ring the sacred service about the sacrifices Such was the habit of the generality of the priests The high priest is adorned with the same garments already described but over these he puts on a vestment of a blue colour this also is a long robe reaching to his feet in our language it is called meeir and is tied round with a girdle embroidered with the same colours and flowers as the former in terwoven with a mixture of gold to the bot tom are hung fringes in colour like pome granates with golden bells f by a curious and beautiful contrivance so that between two bells hangs a pomegranate and between two pomegranates a bell Now this vesture was not composed of two pieces nor was it sewed together upon the shoulders and the sides but it was one long vestment so woven as to have an aperture for the neck not an oblique one but parted all along the breast and the back a border also was sewed to it lest the aperture should look too indecently it was also parted where the hands were to come out Besides these the high priest put on a third garment called the epnod which resembles the epomis of the Greeks It was woven to the depth of a cubit of several colours with gold intermixed and embroidered but it left the middle of the breast uncovered it was X  The use of these golden bells at the bottom of the high priest s long garment seems to have been this that by shaking his garment at the time of his offering incense in the temple on the great day of expiation or at other proper periods of his sacred ministrations on the great festivals the people might have notice of it and mieht fall to their own prayers at the time of incense or other pro per periods and so the whole congregation might at once offer those common prayers jointly with the high priest to the Almighty See Luc i 10 Nor probably is the father of Sirach to be otherwise understood when he says of Aaron the first high priest Ecclus xlv 9 God com passed Aaron with pomegranates and with many golden bells round about that as he went there might be a sound and a noise made that might be heard in the temple for a memorial to the children of his people t The bell seems to have been a sacred utensil of very ancient use in Asia Golden bells formed a part of the ornaments of the pontifical robe of the Jewish high priest with which he invested himself upon those grand and peculiar festivals when he entered into the sanctuary That robe was very magnificent it was ordained to be of sky blue and the border of it at the bottom was adorned with pomegranates and gold bells intermixed equally and at equal distances The use and intent of these bells is evident from these words And it shall be upon Aaron to minister and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord and when he cometh out that he die not The sound of the numerous bells that covered the hem of his garment gave notice to the assembled people that the most awful ceremony of their religion had commenced When arrayed in this garb he bore into the sanctuary the vessel of incense it was the signal to prostrate themselves before the Deity and to commence those fervent ejaculations which were to ascend with the column of that incense to the throne of heaven One indispensable ceremony in the Indian Pooja is the ringing of a small bell by the officiating Brahmin The women of the idol or dancing girls of the pagoda have little golden bells fastened to their feet the soft harmonious tinkling of which vibrates in unison with the exquisite melody of their voices Maurice s Indian Antiquities vol v p 137 The ancient kings of Persia who in fact united to their own persons the regal and sacerdotal office were accustomed to have the fringes of their robes adorned with pomegranates and golden bells The Ara bian courtesans like the Indian women have little golden bells fastened round their legs neck and elbows to the sound of which they dance before the king The Arabian princesses wear golden rings on their fingers to which little bells are suspended as well as in the flowing tresses of their hair that their superior rank may be known and they themselves in passing receive the homage due to their exalted station CalmeCt Dictionary article Bell B an 1532 95 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS also made with sleeves and appeared like a short coat but in the void place of this gar ment was inserted a piece of the bigness of a span embroidered with gold and the other colours of the ephod it is called essen or the breast plate which in the Greek language signifies the oracle This piece exactly filled up the void space in the ephod and was united to it by golden rings at every corner and a blue riband was made use of to tie them together by those rings and that the intermediate space might not appear empty they contrived to fill it up with stitches of blue ribands There were also two sardo nyxes upon the ephod at the shoulders to fasten it in the nature of buttons having each end running to the sardonyxes of gold that they might be buttoned by them On these were engraven the names of the sons of Ja cob in Hebrew characters six on each of the stones on either side and the elder sons names were on the right shoulder twelve stones also were upon the breast plate of extraordinary size and beauty and they were ornaments not to be purchased by men because of their immense value These stones however stood in three rows by four in a row being set in ouches of gold and inserted in the breast plate so that they might not fall out  The first three stones were a sar donyx a topaz and an emerald the second row contained a carbuncle a jasper and a sapphire the first of the third row was a ligure then an amethyst and the third an agate being the ninth of the whole number the first of the fourth row was a chrysolite the next was an onyx and then a beryl which was the last of all Now the names of all those sons of Jacob were engraven in these stones whom we esteem the heads of our tribes each stone having the honour of a name in the order according to which they were born and whereas the rings were too weak for themselves to bear the weight of the stones they made two other rings of a larger size at the edge of that part of the breast plate which reached to the neck and inserted it into the very texture of the breast plate to receive chains finely wrought which connected them with golden bands to the tops of the shoulders whose extremity turned backwards and went into the ring on the prominent back part of the ephod And this voL i â No 8 was for the security of the breast plate that it might not fall out of its place there was also a girdle sewed to the breast plate which was of the aforementioned colours inter mixed with gold which when it had gone once round was tied again upon the seam and hung down there were likewise golden loops that admitted its fringes at each ex tremity of the girdle and included them en tirely The high priest s mitre was the same as we described before and was wrought like that of all the other priests above which there was another with swaths of blue embroidered and round it was a golden crown of three rows one above another out of which arose a cup of gold resembling the herb which we call saccharus but those Greeks that are skilful in botany call it hyoscyamus Now lest any one that has seen this herb but has not been taught its name and is unacquainted with its nature or having known its name knows not the herb when he sees it I shall give a description of it  This herb is often in tallness above three spans its root is like that of a turnip but its leaves are like the leaves of mint its branches send out a calyx cleaving to the branch and a coat encom passes it which it naturally puts off when it is changing in order to produce its fruit this calyx is ofthe bigness of the bone of the lit tle finger but in the compass of its aperture is like a cup To render this more plain suppose a sphere be divided into two parts round at the bottom but having another seg ment that grows up to a circumference from that bottom suppose it to become narrower by degrees and that the cavity of that part grow decently smaller and then gradually grow wider again at the brim such as we see in the navel of a pomegranate with its notches And indeed such a coat grows over this plant as renders it an hemisphere and that as one may say turned accurately in a lathe and having its notches extant above it which as I said grow like a pomegranate only that they are sharp and end in nothing but prick les Now the fruit is preserved by this coat of the calyx which fruit is like the seed of the herb sideritis it sends out a flower that may seem to resemble that of poppy Of this was a crown made as far as from the hinder part ofthe head to each of the temples but this Bb   96 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ephielis for so this calyx may be called did not cover the forehead but was covered with a golden plate which had inscribed upon it the name of God in sacred characters and such were the ornaments of the high priest Now here one may wonder at the ill will which men bear to us and which they pro fess to be on account of our despising that Deity which they pretend to honour for if any one do but consider the fabric of the tabernacle and take a view of the garments of the high priest and of those vessels which we make use of in our sacred ministration he will find that our legislator was a divine man and that we are unjustly reproached by others for if anyone without prejudice and with judgment look upon these things he will find they were every one made in imitation and representation of the universe for when Moses distinguished the tabernacle into three parts f and allowed two of them to the priests as a place accessible and common he deno ted the land and the sea for these are acces sible to all but when he set apart the third division for God it was because heaven is inaccessible to men When he ordered twelve loaves to be set on the table he denoted the year as distinguished into so many months When he made the candlestick of seventy parts he secretly intimated the decani or seventy divisions of the planets and as to the seven lamps upon the candlesticks they re ferred to the course of the planets of which that is the number and for the veils which were composed of four things they declared the four elements for the fine linen was pro per to signify the earth because the flax grows out of the earth the purple signified the sea because that colour is dyed by the blood of a shell fish the blue is fit to signify the air and the scarlet will naturally be an indication of fire Now the vestment of the high priest being made of linen signified the earth the blue denoted the sky being like lightning in its pomegranates and in the noise of its bells resembling thunder and the ephod shewed that God had made the uni verse of four elements and as for the gold interwoven I suppose it related to the splen dour by which all things are enlightened He also appointed the breast plate to be placed in the middle of the ephod to resemble the earth for that has the very middle place in the world and the girdle which encomf assed the high priest round signified the ocean which goes round about and includes the universe Each of the sardonyxes declares to us the sun and the moon those I mean that were in the nature of buttons on the high priests shoulders And for the twelve stones whether we understand by them the months or the like number of the signs of that circle which the Greeks call the Zodiac we shall not be mistaken in their meaning The mitre which was of a blue colour seems to me to denote heaven for how otherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it It was also illustrated with a crown of gold because of that splendour with which God is pleased Let this explication suffice at present since the course of my narration will on many occa sions afford an opportunity of enlarging on the virtue of our legislator  The reader ought to take notice that the very Mo saic Â Â TaXov or golden plate for the forehead of the Jewish high priest was itself preserved not only till the days of Josephus but of Origen and that its inscription Holiness to the Lord was in the Samaritan characters See Antiq VIII 3 and Reland De Spol Templi page 132 133 t When Josephus both here and chap 6 supposes the tabernacle to have been divided into three parts he seems to esteem the bare entrance to be a third division dis tinct from the holy and the most holy places and this the rather because in the temple afterward there was a dis tinct third part which was called the porch Otherwise Josephus would contradict his own description of the tabernacle which gives us a particular account of no more than two parts J These Decani or seven times ten parts for the pla nets are described in Julius Firmicus Maturnus to whom the reader is referred  This explication of the mystical meaning of the Jew ish tabernacle and its vessels with the garments of the high priest is taken out of Philo and adapted to Gentile philosophical notions This may possibly be forgiven in Jews greatly versed in heathen learning and philosophy as Philo had ever been and as Josephus had long been when he wrote these Antiquities In the mean time it is not to be doubted but in their education they must have both learned more Jewish interpretations such I mean as we meet with in the epistle of Barnabas in that to the He brews and elsewhere among the old Jews Accordingly when Josephus wrote his books of the Jewish War for the use of the Jews at which time he was comparatively youflg and less used to Gentile books we find one specimen of such a Jewish interpretation for there VII 5 he makes the seven branches of the temple candlesticks with their seven lamps an emblem of the seven days of creation and rest which are here emblems of the seven planets nor ought ancient Jewish emblems to be explained any other wise than according to ancient Jewish and not Gentile notions See of the War I 33 an 1532 97 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP vin OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF AAROH WHEN what has been described was brought to a conclusion gifts not being yet presented God appeared to Moses and enjoined him to bestow the high priest hood upon Aaron his brother as upon him that best deserved to obtain that honour on account of his virtue and when he had ga thered the multitude together he gave them an account of Aaron s virtue and of his good will to them and of the dangers he had un dergone for their sakes upon which when they had given testimony to them in all re spects and shewed their readiness to receive him Moses said to them O ye Israelites this work is already brought to a conclusion in a manner most acceptable to God and ac cording to our abilities and now since you see that he is received into this tabernacle we shall first of all stand in need of one that may officiate for us and may minister to the sacrifices and to the prayers that are to be put up for us And indeed had the enquiry after such a person been left to me I should have thought myself worthy of this honour both because all men are naturally fond of themselves and because I am conscious to myself that I have taken a great deal of pains for your deliverance but now God himself has determined that Aaron is worthy of this honour and has chosen him for his priest as knowing him to be the most righteous person among you so that he is to put on the vest ments which are consecrated to God he is to have the care of the altars and to make provision for the sacrifices and he it is that must put up prayers for you to God who will readily hear them not only because he is himself solicitous for your nation but also because he will receive them as offered by one that he hath himself chosen to this office The Hebrewsf were pleased with what was said and they gave their approbation to him whom God had ordained tor Aaron was the most deserving of this honour on account of his own gift of prophecy and his brother s virtue He had at that time four sons Na dab Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar Now Moses commanded them to make use of all the utensils which were more than were necessary to the structure of the tabernacle for covering the tabernacle itself the candle stick and altar of incense and the other ves sels that they might not be at all hurt when they journeyed either by the rain or by the rising of the dust and when he had gathered in the multitude together again he ordained that they should offer half a shekel for every man as an oblation to God which shekel is a Hebrew coin and is equal to four Athenian drachmae whereupon they readily obeyed what Moses had commanded and the number of offers was six hundred and five thousand five hundred and fifty Now this money that was brought by the men that were free wai given by such as were above twenty years old but under fifty and what was collected was spent in the uses of the tabernacle Moses now purified the tabernacle and the priest which purification was performed after the following manner He commanded them to take five hundred shekels of choice myrrh an equal quantity of cassia and half the fore going weight of cinnamon and a sort of sweet spice called calamus to beat them small and wet them with a hin of olive oil to mix them together and boil them and prepare them after the art of the apothecary and make them into a very sweet ointment and afterward to take it to anoint and purify the priests themselves and all the tabernacle as  Exod xxviii 1 t It is worthy observation that the two principal quali fications here required for the constitution of the first high priest viz that he should have an excellent character for virtuous and good actions as also that he should have the approbation of the people are here noted by Josephus even where the nomination belonged to God himself which are the very same qualifications which the Christian religion requires in the choice of Christian bishops priests and deacons as the Apostolical Constitution informs us II 3 VIII Nor is it unworthy of our notice that Philo s peculiar word here cited apieivSriv that the governor was to be of a most excellent character is also the peculiar word of the Apostolical Constitutions on this occasion VIH 4 J This weight and value of the Jewish shekel in the days of Josephus equal to about 2s lOd sterling is by the learned Jews owned to be one fifth larger than their old shekels which determination agrees perfectly with the remaining shekels that have Samaritan inscriptions coined generally by Simon the Maccabee about 230 years before Josephus published his Antiquities which never weighed more than 2s 4 Jd and commonly but 2s 4 d See Reland De Nummis Samaritanorum p 188 II This hin is a Hebrew measure and contains two Athenian choas or congiuses ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS book III also the sacrifices There were also many and various kinds of sweet spices that be longed to the tabernacle and such as were very costly and were brought to the golden altar of incense whose nature I do not now describe lest it should be troublesome to my readers But incense was to be offered twice a day both before sun rising and sun setting They were also to keep oil ready purified for the lamps threet of which were to give light all day long upon the sacred candlestick before God and the rest were to be lighted at the evening When all was finished Besaleel and Aho liab appeared to be the most skilful of the workmen for they invented finer works than what others had done before them and were of great abilities to gain notions of what they were formerly ignorant of and of these Besa leel was judged to be the best Now the whole time they were about this work was seven months and after this ended the first year since their departure out of Egypt But at the beginning 01 the second year f in the month Xanthicus as the Macedonians call it but in the month Nisan as the Hebrews call it on the new moon they consecrated the tabernacle and all its vessels which I have already described God shewed himself pleased with the work of the Hebrews and did not permit their labours to be in vain nor did he disdain to use what they had made but he came and sojourned with them and pitched his taber nacle in the holy house And in the follow ing manner did he come to it the sky was clear but there was a mist over the taberna cle only encompassing it but not with such a very deep and thick cloud as is seen in the winter season nor yet in so thin an one as men might be able to discern any thing through it but from it there dropped a sweet dew which shewed the presence of God to those that desired and believed it When Moses had bestowed such honorary presents on the workmen as it was fit they should receive who had wrought so well he offered sacrifices in the open court of

morning and at the ninth hour XIV 4 tabernacle as God commanded him a bull a ram and a kid of the goats for a sin offer ing Now I shall speak of what we do in our sacred offices in my discourse about sacrifi ces and therein shall inform men in what cases Moses bid us offer whole burnt offer ings and in what cases the law permits us to partake of them as food And when Moses had sprinkled Aaron s vestments himself and his sons with the blood of the beasts that were slain and had purified them with spring water and ointment they became God s priests After this manner did he consecrate them and their garments for seven days together The same he did to the taberna cle and the vessels thereto belonging both with oil first incensed as I said and with the blood of bulls and of rams slain day by day one according to its kind But on the eighth day he appointed a feast for the people and commanded them to offer sacrifice according to their ability Accordingly they contended one with another and were ambitious to ex ceed each other in the sacrifices which they brought and so fulfilled Moses s injunctions But as the sacrifices lay upon the altar a sud den fire was kindled from among them of its own accord and appeared to the sight like fire from a flash of lightning and consumed whatsoever was upon the altar Hereupon an affliction befel Aaron con sidered as a man and a father but he sup ported it with true fortitude for he had in deed a firmness of soul in such accidents and he thought this calamity came upon him according to God s will for whereas he had four sons as I said before the two elder of them Nadab and Abihu did not bring those sacrifices which Moses bade them bring but which they used to offer formerly and were burnt to death Now when the fire rushed upon them and began to burn them nobody could quench it accordingly they died in this manner and Moses bid their father and their brethren to take up their bodies to carry them out of the camp and to bury them magnifi cently Now the multitude lamented them and were deeply affected at this death which t Hence we may correct the opinion of the modern Rabbins who say that only one of the seven lamps burned in the day time when Josephus an eye witness says there were three J An 1531 AN 1532 J 99 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS so unexpectedly befel them but Moses in treated their brethren and their father not to be troubled for them to prefer their honour of God before their grief about them for Aaron had already put on his sacred garments Moses refused all that honour which he saw the multitude ready to bestow upon him and attended to nothing but the service of God He went no more up to mount Sinai but he went into the tabernacle and brought back answers from God to what he prayed for His habit was also that of a private man and in all other circumstances he behaved him self like one of the common people and was desirous to appear without distinguishing himself from the multitude but would have it known that he did nothing but to take care of them He also set down in writing the form of their government and those laws by  These answers by the oracle of Urimand Thummim which words signify light and perfection or astheLXXII renders them Aiikugis xai AXrjdsia revelation and truth and denote nothing faither that I see but the shining stones themselves which were used in this method of illu mination in revealing the will of God after a perfect and true manner to his people Israel I say these answers were not made by the shining of the precious stones after an awkward manner in the high priest s breast plate as the modern Rabbins vainly suppose and as the learned interpret Philo and Josephus but without any sufficient foundation so far as I see for certainly the shining of the stones might precede or accompany the oracle without itself delivering that oracle see Antiq VI 6 but rather by an audible voice from the mercy seat between the cherubim See Prid Connect at the year 534 at large This oracle had been silent as Josephus here informs us 200 years before he wrote his Antiquities or ever since the days of John Hyrcanus the last good high priest of the family of the Maccabees Now it is worth our observa tion that the oracle before us was that by which God ap peared to be present with and gave directions to his people Israel as their king all the while they submitted to him in that capacity and did not set over them such in dependent kings as governed according to their own wills and political maxims instead of divine directions accord ingly we met with this oracle besides angelic and pro phetic admonitions all along from the days of Moses and Joshua to the anointing of Saul the first of the succession of kings Numb xxvii 21 Judg i 1 xviii 5 6 xx 18 23 26 27 1 Sam i 14 iii per tot iv per tot Nay till Saul s rejection of the divine commands in the war with Amalek when he took upon him to act as he thought fit himself 1 Sam xiv 18 19 36 37 Then this oracle left Saul entirely which indeed he had seldom consulted before see 1 Sam xvi 35 1 Chron xiii 3 Joseph Antiq VII 4 and accompanied David who was anointed to succeed him and who consulted God by it frequently and complied with its directions constantly See 1 Sam xxii 13 15 xxiii 9 10 xxx 7 8 2 Sam ii l v 19 23 xxi 1 1 Chron xiv 10 14 Joseph Antiq VI 12 VII â ¼oi â no 9 obedience to which they would lead their lives so as to please God and so as to have no quarrels one among another However the laws he ordained were such as God sug gested to him so I shall now discourse con cerning that form of government and those laws I will now treat of what I before omitted the garment of the high priest for Moses left no room for the evil practices of false prophets but if some of that sort should at tempt to abuse the Divine authority he left it to God to be present at his sacrifices when he pleased and when he pleased to be ab sent And he was willing this should be known not to the Hebrews only but to those foreign ers also who were there For as to those sardonyxes which the high priest bare on his shoulders the one of them shined out when 4 Saul indeed long after his rejection by God and when God had given him up to destruction for his disobe dience did once afterwards endeavour to consult God when it was too late but God would not then answer him neither by dreams nor by Urim nor by prophets 1 Sam xxvii 6 Nor did any of David s successors the kings of Judah that we know of consult God by this ora cle till the Babylonish captivity when those kings were at an end they taking upon them I suppose too much of despotic power and royalty and too little owning the God of Israel for the supreme King of Israel though a few of them consulted the prophets sometimes and were an swered by them At the return of the two tribes with out the return of the kingly government the restoration of this oracle was expected Neh vii 65 1 Esd v 40  1 Mac iv 46 and indeed it may seem to have been re stored for some time after the Babylonish captivity at least in the days of that excellent high priest John Hyr canus whom Josephus esteemed as a king a priest and a prophet and who he says foretold several things that came to pass accordingly but about the time of his death he here implies that this oracle quite ceased and not be fore the following high priests now putting diadems on their heads and ruling according to their own will and by their own authority like the other kings of the pagan countries about them so that while the God of Israel was allowed to be the supreme King of Israel and his direc tions to be their authentic guides God gave them such directions as their supreme king and governor and they were properly under a theocracy this oracle of Urim but no longer see Dr Bernard s notes here though I con fess I cannot but esteem the high priest Jaddus s divine dream Antiq XI 8 and the high priest Caiaphas s most remarkable prophecy John xi 47â 52 as two small re mains or specimens of this ancient oracle which properly belonged to the Jewish priests nor perhaps ought we entirely to forget that eminent prophetic dream of our Josephus himself one next to the high priest as of the family of the Asmoneans or Maccabees by his mother s side and by his father of the first of the twenty four classes of the priests as to the succession of Vespasian Cc 100 BOOK III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS God was present at their sacrifices bright rays darting out thence and being seen even by those who were most remote which splendour yet was not before natural to the stone This has appeared a wonderful thing to such as have not so far indulged them selves in philosophy as despise divine reve lation Yet will I mention what is still more wonderful for God declared beforehand by those twelve stones which the high priest bare on his breast and which were inserted into his breast plate when they should be victorious in battle for so great a splendour shone forth from them before the army began to march that all the people were sensible of God s being present for their assistance Whence it came to pass that those Greeks who had a veneration for our laws because they could not possibly contradict this called the breast plate the Oracle Now this breast Elate and this sardonyx left off shining two undred years before I composed this book God having been displeased at the trans gression of his laws Of which things we shall further discourse on a fitter opportunity but I will now go on with my proposed nar ration The tabernacle being consecrated and a regular order settled for the priests the mul titude judged that God now dwelt among them and betook themselves to sacrifices f and praises to God as being now delivered from all expectation of evils and entertain ing a hopeful prospect of better times here after They offered also gifts to God some as common to the whole nation and others as peculiar to themselves and these tribe by tribe For the heads of the tribes combined together two by two and brought a waggon and a yoke of oxen these amounted to six and these carried the tabernacle when they journeyed besides which every head of a tribe brought a bowl a charger and a spoon of ten daricks4 full of incense Now the charger and the bowl were of silver and together they weighed two hundred shekels but the bowl cost no more than seventy she kels and these were full of fine flour min gled with oil such as they used on the altar about the sacrifices They brought also a young bullock and a ram with a lamb of a year old for a whole burnt offering as also a goat for the forgiveness of sins Every one of the heads of the tribes brought also other sacrifices called peace offerings for every day two bulls and five rams with lambs of a year old and kids of the goats These heads of tribes were twelve days in sacrificing one sacrificing every day Now Moses went no longer up to mount Sinai but went into the tabernacle and learned of God what they were to do and what laws shonld be made which laws were preferable to what have been devised by human understanding and proved to be firmly observed for all time to come as being believed to be the gift of God insomuch that the Hebrews did not transgress any of those laws either as tempted in times of peace by luxury or in times of war by distress of affairs and Titus to the Roman empire and that in the days of Nero and before either Galba Otho or Vitellus were thought of to succeed him Of the War III 8 IV 10 and this confirmed by Suetonius in Vespas Â 5 and Dio in Xiphiline page 317 This I think may be considered as the very last instance of any thing like the prophetic Urim among the Jewish nation and just preceded the fatal desolation But how it could possibly come to pass that such great men as Sir John Marsham and Dr Spencer should imagine that this oracle of Urim and Thummim with other practices as old or older than the law of Moses should have been ordained in imitation of somewhat like them among the Egyptians which we never heard of till the time of Diodorus Siculus Elian and Maimonides or little earlier than the Christian era at the highest is almost unaccountable While the main business of the law of Moses was evidently to preserve the Israelites from the idolatrous and superstitious practices of the neighbouring pagan nations and while it is so undeniable that the evi dence for the great antiquity of Moses s law is incompara bly beyond that for the like of greater antiquity of such customs in Egypt or other nations which indeed is gene rally none at all it is absurd to derive any of Moses s laws from the imitation of those heathen practices Such hy potheses demonstrate to us how far inclination can pre vail over evidence in even some of the most learned parts of mankind See Dr Bernard s very valuable notes upon this chapter in opposition to Dr Spencer as they stand at large in Havercamp s edition  About an 107 two hundred years before A D 93

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP IX OF THE MANNER OF OFFERING SACRIFICES 1WILL now make mention of a few of our laws which belong to purifications and the like sacred offices since I am accidentally come to this matter of sacrifices these sacri fices are of two sorts one being offered for private persons and the other for the people in general and they are done in two differ ent ways In one case what is slain is burnt as a whole burnt offering whence that name is given to it but the other is a thank offer ing and as designed for feasting those that sacrifice I will speak of the former Sup pose a private man offer a burnt offering he must slay either a bull a lamb or a kid of the goats and the two latter of the first year though of bulls he is permitted to sacrifice those of a greater age but all burnt offer ings are to be of males When they are slain the priests sprinkle the blood round about the altar they then cleanse the bodies di vide them into parts salt them and lay them upon the altar while the pieces of wood are piled one upon another and the fire is burn ing They then cleanse the feet of the sacri fices and the inwards in an accurate man ner and so they lay them to the rest to be purified by the fire while the priests receive the hides this is the way of offering a burnt offering Those who offer thank offerings do indeed sacrifice the same creatures but such as are unblemished and above a year old however they may take either males or females They also sprinkle the altar with their blood but they lay upon the altar the kidneys the caul and all the fat and the lobe of the liver with these they bring also the rump of the lamb they give also the breast and the right shoulder to the priests so they feast upon the remainder of the flesh for two days and what remains they burn The sacrifices for sins are offered in the same manner as is the thank offering but those who are unable to purchase complete sacrifices offer two pigeons or turtle doves one of which is made a burnt offering to God and the other is given as food for the priests But we shall treat more accurately about the oblation of these creatures in our dis course concerning sacrifices but if a person fall into sin by ignorance he offers an ewe lamb or female kid of the goats of the same age and the priest sprinkles the blood at the altar not after the former manner but at the corners of it They also bring the kidneys and the rest of the fat together with the lobe of the liver to the altar while the priests bear away the hides and the flesh and spend it in the holy place f on the same day for the law does not permit them to leave of it until the morning But if any one sin and is con scious of it himself but hath nobody that can prove it upon him he offers a ram the flesh of which the priests eat as before in the holy place on the same day And if the rulers offer sacrifices for their sins they bring the  It is says Bp Patrick no improbable conjecture of Fortunatus Scacchus that from hence the heathens learned their Taurobolia and Criobolia which in process of time they disguised with infernal rites and ceremonies The Taurobolium of the ancients was a ceremony in which the high priest of Cybele was consecrated and might be called a baptism of blood which they conceived imparted a spi ritual new birth to the liberated spirit In this dreadful and SfHiguinary ceremony according to the poet Pruden tiu s cited at length by Banier on the ancient sacrifices the high priest about to be inaugurated was introduced into a dark excavated apartment adorned with a long silken robe and a crown of gold Above this apartment was a floor perforated in a thousand places with holes like a ie ve through which the blood of a sacred bull slaughtered for the purpose descended in a copious torrent upon the inclosed priest who received the purifying stream on every part of his dress rejoicing to bathe with the bloody shower his hands his cheeks and even to bedew his lips and his tongue with it when all the blood had run from the throat of the immolated bull the carcass of the victim was removed and the priest issued forth from the cavity a spectacle ghastly and horrible his head and vestments being covered with blood and clotted drops of it adhering to his venerable beard As soon as the pontifex appeared before the assembled multitude the air was rent with con gratulatory shouts so pure and so sanctified however was he now esteemed that they dared not approach his per son but beheld him at a distance with awe and veneration Maurice s Ind Ant voL v p 196 B t What Reland observes here out of Josephus as com pared with the law of Moses Levit vii 15 that the eat ing of the sacrifice the same day it was offered seems to mean only before the morning of the next although the latter part i e the night be in strictness part of the next day according to the Jewish reckoning is greatly to be observed upon other occasions also The Jewish maxim in such cases it seems is this that the day goes before the night and this appears to me to be the language both of the Old and New Testament See alsothe note on IV 4 and Reland s note on IV 8 102 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS same oblations that private men do except they so far differ that they are to bring for sacrifices a bull or a kid of the goats both males Now the law requires both in private and public sacrifices that the finest flour be also brought for a lamb the measure of one tenth deal for a ram two and for a bull three This they consecrate upon the altar when it is mingled with oil for oil is also brought by those that sacrifice for a bull the half of a hin for a ram a third part of the same man ner and one quarter of it for a lamb They bring the same quantity of oil which they do of wine and they pour the wine about the altar but if any one does not offer a com plete sacrifice of animals but brings fine flour only for a vow he throws a handful upon the altar as its first fruits while the priests take the rest for their food either boiled or min gled with oil but made into cakes of bread but whatsoever it be that a priest himself offers it must of necessity be all burnt Now the law forbids us to sacrifice any animal at the same time with its dam and in other cases not till the eighth day after its birth Other sacrifices are also appointed for es caping distempers or for other occasions in which meat offerings are consumed together with the animals that are sacrificed of which it is not lawful to leave any part till the next day only the priests are to take their own share CHAP X CONCERNING THE FESTIVALS AND HOW EACH DAY OF SUCH FESTIVAL IS TO BE OBSERVED THE law requires that out of the public expenses a lamb of the first year be killed every day at the beginning and ending of the day but on the seventh day which is called the Sabbath they kill two and sa crifice them in the same manner On the new moon they both perform the daily sacrifices and slay two bulls with seven lambs of the first year and a kid of the goats also for the expiation of sins that is if they have sinned through ignorance On the seventh month which the Macedo nians call Hyperberetaeus they make an ad dition to those already mentioned and sacri fice a bull a ram seven lambs f and a kid of the goats for sins The tenthJ day of the same lunar month they fast till the evening and this day they sacrifice a bull two rams seven lambs and a kid of the goats for sins and besides these they bring two kids of the goats one of which is sent alive out of the limits of the camp into the wilderness for the scape goat and to be an expiation of the sins of the whole multi tude but the other is brought into a place of great cleanness within the limits of the camp and is there burnt with its skin without any sort of cleansing With this goat is burnt a bull not brought by the people but by the high priest at his own charge which when it is slain he brings of the blood into the holy place together with the blood of the kid of the goats and sprinkles the ceiling with his finger seven times as also its pavement and as often towards the most holy place and about the golden altar He also at last brings it into the open court and sprinkles it about the great altar Besides this they set the ex tremities and the kidneys and the fat with the lobe of the liver upon the altar and the high priest presents a ram to God as a burnt offering j On the fifteenth day of the same month when the season of the year is changing for winter the law enjoins us to pitch tabernacles in every one of our houses but so that we preserve ourselves from the cold of that time of the year as also that when we should ar rive at our own country we should come to that city which we should have then for our metropolis because of the temple therein to be built and keep a festival for eight days and offer burnt offerings and sacrifice thank offerings that we should then carry in our hands a branch of myrtle and willow and a bough of the palm tree with the addition of the pomecitron that the burnt offering on the first of those days was to be a sacrifice of thirteen bulls fourteen lambs and fifteen rams with the addition of a kid of the goats as an expiation for sins that on the following days the same number of lambs and of rams  Exod xxix 38 t Numb xxix 2 Numb xxviii 3 t Levit xxiii 27 II Numb xxix 12  jyfa rMicr hinx IS iaoLtcfc  Phil N AN 10S 1532 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS with the kids of the goats but abating one of the bulls every day till they amounted to seven only On the eighth day all work was laid aside and then as we said before they sacrificed to God a bullock a ram seven lambs and a kid of the goats for an expiation of sins and this is the accustomed solemnity of the Hebrews when they pitch their taber nacles But in the month of Xanthicus which is by us called Nisan and is the beginning of our year on the fourteenth day of the lunar month when the sun is in Aries for on this month it was that we were delivered from bondage under the Egyptians the law ordained that we should every year slay that sacrifice which I before observed we slew when we came out of Egypt and which was called the Passover and so do we celebrate this pass over in companies and leave nothing of what we sacrifice till the day following The feast of unleavened bread succeeds that of the passover and falls on the fifteenth day of the month and continues seven days wherein they feed on unleavened bread on every one of which days two bulls are killed and one ram and seven lambs Now these lambs are entirely burnt besides the kid of the goats which is added to all the rest for sins for it is intended as a feast for the priest on every one of those days But on the second day of unleavened bread which is the sixteenth day of the month they first partake of the fruits of the earth for before that day they do not touch them And while they suppose it pro per to honour God from whom they obtain this plentiful provision in the first place they offer the first fruits of their barley and that in the manner following They take a handful of the ears and dry them they then beat them small and cleanse the barley from the bran they then bring one tenth deal to the altar to God and casting one handful of it upon the fire they leave the rest for the use of the priests and after this it is that they may publicly or privately reap their harvest They also at this participation of the first fruits of the earth sacrifice a lamb as a burnt offering to God When a week of weeks has passed over after this sacrifice which weeks contain forty  Or Abid Deut xvi 1 voL I â No 9 and nine days on the fiftiethf day called by the Hebrews Asartha which signifies Pente cost they bring to God a loaf made of wheat flour of two tenth deals with leaven and for sacrifices they bring two lambs and when they have only presented them to God they are made ready for supper for the priests nor is it permitted to leave any thing of them till the day following They also slay three bullocks for a burnt offering and two rams and fourteen lambs with two kids of the goats for sins nor is there any one of the festivals but in it they offer burnt offerings They also allow themselves to rest on every one of them accordingly the law prescribes in them all what kinds they are to sacrifice and how they are to rest entirely and must slay sacrifices in order to feast upon them However out of the common charges baked bread was set on the table of shew bread without leaven of twenty four tenth deals of flour for so much is spent upon this bread two heaps of these were baked they were taken the day before the sabbath but were brought into the holy place on the morning of the sabbath and set upon the holy table six on a heap one loaf still standing over against another where two golden cups full of frank incense were also set upon them and there they remained till another sabbath and then other loaves were brought in their stead while the loaves were given to the priests for their food and the frankincense was burnt in that sacred fire wherein all their offerings were burnt also and so other frankincense was set upon the loaves instead of what was there before The high priest also at his own expense offered a sacrifice twice every day It was made of flour mingled with oil and gently baked by the fire The quantity was one tenth deal of flour He brought the half of it to the fire in the morning and the other half at night The account of these sacrifices I shall give more accurately here after but I think I have premised what for the present may be sufficient concerning them M CHAP XI OF THE PURIFICATIONS OSES took out the tribe of Levi from communicating with the rest of the t Levit xxiii 16 Dd 104 book ra ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS people and set them apart to be a holy tribe and purified them by water taken from per petual springs and with such sacrifices as were usually offered to God on the like occa sions He also delivered to them the taber nacle and the sacred vessels and the other curtains which were made for covering the tabernacle that they might minister under the conduct of the priests who had been already consecrated to God He also determined concerning animals which of them might be used for food and which they were obliged to abstain from which matters when this work shall give me occasion shall be farther explained and the causes shall be added by which he was in duced to allot some of them to be our food and enjoined us to abstain from others How ever he forbade us entirely the use of blood for food and esteemed it to contain the soul and spirit He also forbade us to Cat the flesh of the animal that died of itself as also the caul and the fat of goats and sheep and bulls He also ordered that those whose bodies were afflicted with leprosy and that had a gonorrhoea should not come into the city nay he removed the women under certain situations till the seventh day after which he looked upon them as pure and permitted them to come in again The law permits those also who have taken care of funerals to come in after the same manner when this number of days is over but if any continued longer than that number of days in a state of pollution the law appointed the offering two lambs for a sacrifice one of which they are to purge by the fire and the other the priests take for themselves In the same manner do those sacrifice who have had the gonorrhoea but for the lepers he suffered them not to come into the city at all nor to live with any others as if they were in effect dead persons But if any one had obtained by prayer to God a recovery from that distemper and had gained a healthful complexion again such a one returned thanks to God with several sorts of sacrifices concerning which we will speak hereafter Hence one cannot but smile at those who â  â Hâ â â â  We may here note that Josephus frequently calls the camn the city and the court of the Mosaic tabernacle a temple and the tabernacle itself a holy house with allu say that Moses was himself afflicted with the leprosy when he fled out of Egypt and that he became the conductor of those who on that account left that country and led them into the land of Canaan for had this been true Moses would not have made these laws to his own dishonour which indeed it was more likely he would have opposed if others had endeavoured to introduce them and this the rather because there are lepers in many nations who are yet in honour and not only free from reproach and avoidance but who have been great captains of armies and been entrusted with high offices in the common wealth and have had the privilege of enter ing into holy places and temples so that nothing hindered but if either Moses himself or the multitude that was with him had been liable to such a misfortune he might have made laws about them for their credit and advantage and have laid no manner of diffi culty upon them Accordingly it is a plain case that it is out of violent prejudice only that they report these things about us But Moses was pure from any such distemper and lived with countrymen who were pure of it also and thence made the laws which con cerned others that had the distemper He did this for the honour of God but as to these matters let every one consider them after what manner he pleases As to the women when they have borne a child Moses forbade them to come into the temple or to touch the sacrifices before forty days were over supposing it be a boy but if she hath borne a girl the law is that she cannot be admitted before twice that number of days be over and when after the afore mentioned time appointed for them they per form their sacrifices the priests distribute them before God But if any one suspected that his wife had been guilty of adultery he was to bring a tenth deal of barley flour they then cast one handful to God and gave the rest of it to the priests for food One of the priests set the woman at the gates that are turned towardfe the temple and took the veil from her head and wrote the name of God on parchment and enjoined her to swear that she had not â i v Tâ T t           sion to the latter city temple and holy house which he knew so well long afterwards  â i av 1532 105 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS at all injured her husband and to wish that if she had violated her chastity her right thigh might be put out of joint that her belly might swell and that she might die thus but that if her husband by the violence of his affection and of the jealousy which arose from it had been rashly moved to this sus picion that she might bear a male child on the tenth month Now when these oaths were over the priest wiped the name of God out of the parchment and wrung the water into a vial He also took up some dust out of the temple if any happened to be there and put a little of it into the vial and gave it her to drink whereupon the woman if she were un justly accused conceived a child and brought it to perfection but if she had broken her faith of wedlock to her husband and had sworn falsely before God she died in a re proachful manner her thigh fell off from her and her belly swelled with a dropsy and these are the ceremonies about sacrifices and about the purifications thereto belong ing which Moses provided for his country men He also prescribed the following laws to them CHAP XII OF SEVERAL LAWS INSTITUTED BY MOSES AS for adultery Moses forbade it entirely as esteeming it a happy thing that men should be wise in the affairs of wedlock and that it was profitable both to cities and fami lies that children should be known to be genu ine He also abhorred a man s connection with his mother father s wife aunt sister or son s wife as instances of abominable wick edness He also forbade a man to lie with his wife when she was defiled and not to come near brute beasts nor to approve of the lying with a male in order to hunt after unlawful pleasures on account of beauty To those which were guilty of such insolent be haviour he ordained death for their punish ment   Â iiii ii   Numb y 27 â  f These words of Josephus are remarkable that the lawgiver of the Jews required of the priests a double de gree otf purity in comparison of that required of the peo ple of which he gives several instances This was the case also among the first Christians of the eletfgy in com parison of the laity as the apostolical constitutions and canons every where inform us As for the priests he prescribed to them also a double degree of purity f for he re strained them in the foregoing instances and also forbade them to marry a harlot a slave or a captive and such as got their living by cheating trades and by keeping inns as also a woman parted from her husband on any occasion whatsoever Nay he did not think it proper for the high priest to marry even the widow of one that was dead though he al lowed that to the priests but he permitted him only to marry a virgin and to retain her whence it is that the high priest is not to ap proach one that is dead J although the rest are not prohibited from coming near to their brethren parents or children when they are dead but they are to be unblemished in all respects He ordered that the priests who had any blemish should have his portion in deed among the priests but he forbade him to ascend the altar or to enter into the holy house He also enjoined them not only to observe purity in their sacred ministrations but in their daily conversation that it might be unblameable also and on this account it is that those who wear the sacerdotal gar ments are without spot and eminent for their purity and sobriety Nor are they permitted to drink wine so long as they wear those gar ments Moreover they offer sacrifices that are entire and have no defect whatever Moses gave them all these presents being such as were observed during his own life time but though they lived now in the wil derness yet did he make provision how they might observe the same laws when they should have taken the land of Canaan He gave then rest to the land from ploughing and planting every seventh year as he had prescribed to them to rest from working every seventh day and ordered that then what grew of its own accord out of the earth should in common belong to all that pleased to use it making no distinction in that respect between their own countrymen and foreigners and he or dained that they should do the same after t Levit xxi 11 11 We must here note with Reland that the precept given to the priests of not drinking wine while they wore the s acred garments is equivalent to their abstinence from it while they ministered in the temple because they thsn only wore those sacred garments which were laid up there from one time of ministration to another 106 book III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS seven times seven years which in all are fifty years and the fiftieth year is called by the Hebrews the Jubilee At that time debt ors are freed from their debts and slaves are set at liberty which slaves became such though they were of the same stock by trans gressing some of those laws whose punishment was not capital but they were punished by this method of slavery This year also re stores the land to its former possessors in the following manner when the jubilee is come which name denotes liberty he that sold the land and he that bought it meet together and make an estimate on one hand of the fruits gathered and on the other hand of the expenses laid out upon it If the fruits ga thered come to more than the expenses laid out he that sold it takes the land again but if the expenses prove more than the fruits the present possessor receives of the former owner the difference that was wanting and leaves the land to him but if the fruits re ceived and the expenses laid out prove equal the present possessor relinquishes it to the former owner Moses would have the same law obtain as to those houses also which were sold in villages but he made a differ ent law for such as were sold in a city for if he that sold it tendered the purchaser his money again within a year he was forced to restore it but in case a whole year had in tervened the purchaser was to enjoy what he had bought This was the constitution of the laws which Moses learned of God when the camp lay under mount Sinai and this he de livered in writing to the Hebrews Now when this settlement of laws seemed to be well over Moses thought proper to take a review of the host in order to settle the affairs of war so he charged the heads of the tribes excepting the tribe of Levi to take an exact account of the number of those who were able to go to war for as to the Levites they were holy and free from all such bur dens Now when the people had been num bered there were found six hundered thou sand that were able to go to war from twenty to fifty years of age besides three thousand six hundred and fifty Instead of Levi Moses took Manasseh the son of Joseph among the  Levit xxv 1 t Book II chap 8 heads of tribes and Ephraim instead of Jo seph It was indeed the desire of Jacob himself to Joseph that he would give him his sons to be his own by adoption f as I have be fore related When they set up the tabernacle they re ceived it into the midst of their camp three of the tribes pitching their tents on each side of it and roads were cut through the midst of these tents It was like a well appointed market and every thing was there ready for sale in due order and all sorts of artificers were in the shops and it resembled nothing so much as a city that sometimes was movea ble and sometimes fixed The priests had the first places about the tabernacle then the Levites who because their whole mul titude was reckoned from thirty days old were twenty three thousand eight hundred and eighty males and during the time that the cloud stood over the tabernacle they thought proper to stay in the same place as supposing that God there inhabited among men but when that removed they journeyed also J Moses was also the inventor of the form of the Hebrew trumpet which was made of silver In length it was little less than a cu bit It was composed of a narrow tube some what thicker than a flute but with so much breadth as was sufficient for admission of the breadth of a man s mouth it ended in the form of a bell like common trumpets Its sound was called in the Hebrew tongue assosra There were two of them made and when the first of them gave a signal the heads of the tribes were to assemble and consult about the affairs to them properly be longing but when both of them sounded they called the multitude together which was done when the tabernacle was to remove When the second signal was given those that were on the south quarter did the like In the next place the tabernacle was taken to pieces and was carried in the midst of six tribes that went before and of six that fol lowed Now all the Levites were about the tabernacle When the third signal was given that part which had their tents towards the west put themselves in motion and at the X Exod xl 36 37 aN 1532 107 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS fourth signal those on the north did so like wise 1 hey also used trumpets in their sa cred ministrations when they were bringing their sacrifices to the altar as well as on the sabbaths and on the rest of the festival days And now it was that Moses offered that sacri fice which was called the Passover in the wil derness as the first he had offered after the departure out of Egypt CHAP XIII OF MOSES S REMOVAL FROM MOUNT SINAI TOWARDS THE BORDERS OF THE CANAANITES A LITTLE while afterwards Moses rose up and went from mount Sinai and having passed through several mansions of which we will speak anon he came to a place called Hazeroth where the multitude began again to be mutinous and to blame him for the misfortunes they had suffered in their travels and that when he had persuaded them to leave a good land they at once had lost that land and instead of the happy state he had promised them they were still wan dering in their present miserable condition being already in want of water and if the manna should happen to fail they must then utterly perish yet while they generally spake many bitter things against the men there was one who exhorted them not to be unmindful of Moses and of what great pains he had been at about their common safety and not to des pair of assistance from God The multitude however became still more unruly and more mutinous against Moses than before here upon Moses f although he was so basely abused by them encouraged them in their despairing condition and promised that he would procure them a great quantity of flesh meat and that not for a few days only but for many days and when they could not believe him and one of them asked whence he could obtain such vast plenty of what he promised he replied Neither God nor I although we hear such opprobrious words from you will leave off our labours for you and this shall soon appear As soon as he had said this  These two signals are wanting in the Hebrew and Samaritan but extant in the Septuagint as in Josephus t This circumstance clearly evinces the propriety with which Moses is denominated the meekest of men The provocations he received would have excited resentment vol I â No 9 the whole camp was filled with quails and they stood round about them and gathered them in great numbers However it was not long ere God punished the Hebrews for that insolence and those reproaches they had used towards him for no small number of them died and to this day the place retains the memory of their destruction and is named Ki broth Hattaavah which is the graves of lust4 CHAP XIV OF THE SPIES WHO WERE SENT TO SEARCH OUT THE LAND OF CANAAN AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR REPORT WHEN Moses had led the Hebrews to a place called Paran which was near the borders of the Canaanites and a place difficult to be continued in he gathered the multitude together and standing in the midst of them he said Of the two things that God determined to bestow upon us liberty and the possession of a happy country the one ye are already partakers of by the gift of God and the other you will quickly obtain for we now have our abode near the borders of Ca naan and nothing can hinder the acquisition of it when we now at last are fallen upon it I say not only no king nor city but neither the whole race of mankind if they are all gathered together could do it Let us there fore prepare ourselves for the work for the Canaanites will not resign up their land to us without fighting but it must be wrested from them by great struggles in war Let us then send spies who may take a view of the good ness of the land and what strength it is of but above all things let us be of one mind and let us honour God who is our supreme helper and assister When Moses had said thus the multitude requited him with marks of respect and chose twelve spies of the most eminent men one out of each tribe who passing over all the land of Canaan from the borders of Egypt came to the city Hamath and to mount Leba non and when they had learned the nature of the land and of its inhabitants they re in most men but on him it had no other effect than to induce him to exert himself the more for the good of the people B X Numb xi 34 Ee 108 BOOK III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS N turned home having spent forty days in the whole work They also brought with them of the excellent fruits which the land bare and gave an account of the great quantity of the good things the country afforded which were motives to the multitude to go to war but then they terrified them again with the great difficulty there was in obtaining it say ing that the rivers were so large and deep that they could not be passed over the hills were so high that they could not travel along for them and the cities were strengthened with walls and firm fortifications They told them also that they found at Hebron the pos terity of the giants Accordingly these spies who had seen the land of Canaan when they perceived that all these difficulties were greater there than they had met with since they came out of Egypt were affrighted at them themselves and endeavoured to intimi date the multitude also From this account the people supposed that it was impossible to get the possession of the c jntry and when the congregation was dissolved they their wives and children continued their lamentations as if God would not indeed assist them but only promised them fair they also again blamed Moses and made a clamour against him and his brother Aaron the high priest accordingly they passed that night very ill and with con tumelous language against them but in the morning they ran to a congregation intend ing to stone Moses and Aaron and then to return into Egypt f But of the spies there were Joshua the son of Nun of the tribe of Ephraim and Caleb of the tribe of Judah who were afraid of the consequence and came into the midst of them and stilled the multitude desiring them to be of good courage and neither to con demn God as having deceived them neither to hearken to those who had affrighted them by telling what was not true concerning the Canaanites but believe those that encouraged them to hope for good success and that they should gain possession of the happiness pro mised them because neither the height of mountains nor the depth of rivers could  This was the effect of their unhelief a sin with which they are repeatedly charged in the Scriptures and which was the more aggravated in them as they had wit hinder men of true courage from attempting them especially while God would take care of them beforehand and be assistant to them Let us go then said they against our enemies and have no suspicion of ill success trusting in God to conduct us and following those that are to be our leaders Thus did these two exhort them and endeavour to pa cify the rage they were in but Moses and Aaron fell on the ground and besought God not for their own deliverance but that he would now put a stop to what the people were unwarily doing and would bring their minds to a quiet temper which were now dis ordered by their present passion The cloud also now appeared and stood over the taber nacle declaring the presence of God to be there J CHAP XV OF THE PUNISHMENT THREATENED TO THE ISRAELITES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR REBELLION SKETCH OF THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF THE JEWISH LEGISLATOR MOSES now came boldly to the multi tude and informed them that God was moved at their abuse of him and would in flict punishment upon them not indeed such as they deserved for their sins but such as parents inflict on their children in order to their correction for he said that when he was in their tabernacle and was bewailing with tears that destruction which was coming upon them God put him in mind what things he had done for them and what benefits they had received from him and yet how ungrate ful they had proved that just now they had been induced by the timorousness of the spies to think their words truer than his own pro mise to them and that on this account though he would not destroy them all nor utterly ex terminate their nation which he had honoured more than any other part of mankind he would not permit them to take possession of the land of Canaan nor enjoy its happiness but would make them wander in the wilder ness and live without a fixed habitation and without a city for forty years together as a punishment for their transgression but at the nessed so many signal and repeated exertions of the Divine power B t Numb xiv 4  Numb xiv 10 AN 1531 109 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS same time he promised to give that land to their children and to bestow on them those good things which their fathers had forfeited by their ungoverned passions When Moses had discoursed thus accord ing to the direction of God the multitude grieved and were in affliction and intreated Moses to procure their reconciliation to God and to permit them no longer to wander in the wilderness but to bestow cities upon them but he replied that God would not admit of any such trial for that God was not moved to this determination from any human levity or anger but that he had judiciously condemned them to that punishment Now we are not to disbelieve that Moses who was but a sin gle person pacified so many ten thousands when they were in anger and converted them to a mildness of temper for God was with him and prepared the way to his persuasions of the multitude and as they had often been diso bedient they were now sensible that such dis obedience was disadvantageous to them and that they had thereby fallen into calamities This man was indeed admirable for his virtue and powerful in making men give credit to what he delivered not only during the time of his natural life but even there is still no one of the Hebrews who does not act even now as if Moses were present and ready to punish him if he should do any thing that is indecent nay there is no one but is obedient to what laws he ordained although they might be concealed in their transgres sions There are also many other demonstra tions that his power was more than human for some have even come from the parts be yond Euphrates a journey of four months through many dangers and at great expenses  This great famine as Dr Hudson observe in the days of Claudius is again mentioned in the Antiquities XX 4 and Acts xi 28 as also by Tacitus Phlegon Dio and Africanus  in honour of our temple and yet when they had offered their oblations could not partake of their own sacrifices because Moses had forbidden it by somewhat in the law that did not permit them or somewhat that had be fallen them which our ancient customs made inconsistent therewith so that some of these did not sacrifice at all and others left their sacrifices in an imperfect condition nay many were not able even at first so much as to enter into the temple but went their ways in this state as preferring a submission to the laws of Moses before the fulfilling of their own inclinations even when they had no fear upon them that any body could convict them but only out of a reverence to their own con science so that this legislation which ap peared to be divine made this man to be esteemed as one superior to his own human nature Nay farther a little before the be ginning of this war when Claudius was em peror of the Romans and Ismael was our high priest and when so great a famine was come upon us that one tenth deal of wheat was sold for four drachmae and when no less than seventy corifof flour was brought into the temple at the feast of unleavened bread not one of the priests was so hardy as to eat one crumb of it even while so great a distress was on the land and this out of a dread of the law and of that wrath which God retains against acts of wickedness even when no one can accuse the actors whence we are not to wonder at what was then done while this very day the writings left by Moses have so great force that even those who hate us confess that he who established this set tlement was God and that it was by the means of Moses and of his virtue t These cori are thirty one Sicilian or forty one Athe nian medimni 110 book it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK IV Containing an Interval of Thirty eight Years FROM THE REJECTION OF THAT GENERATION TO THE DEATH OF MOSES CHAP I OF THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE HEBREWS AND THE CANAANITES WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF MOSES THE residence of the Hebrews in the wilderness was so disagreeable to them and they were so uneasy at it that although God had forbidden them to meddle with the Canaanites yet could they not be persuaded to be obedient to the words of Moses and to be quiet but supposing they should be able to beat their enemies even without his appro bation they accused him and suspected that he made it his business to keep them in a distressed condition that they might always stand in need of his assistance Accordingly they resolved to fight with the Canaanites and said that God gave them his assistance not out of regard to their leader s interces sions but because he took care of their entire nation on account of their forefathers whose affairs he took under his own conduct as also that it was on account of their own virtue that he had formerly procured them their liberty and would assist them now they were willing to take pains for it They also said that they were of themselves of abilities suffi cient for the conquest of their enemies al though Moses should have a mind to alienate God from them and that however it was for their advantage to be their own masters and not so far to rejoice in their deliverance from the indignities they endured under the Egyp tians as to bear the tyranny of Moses and to suffer themselves to be deluded and live ac cording to his pleasure as though God did only foretel what concerned them out of his kindness to him and as though they were not all the posterity of Abraham and that God made him alone the author of all their know ledge and they must still learn it from him They said it would be prudent to oppose his arrogant pretences and to put their confi dence in God and to resolve to take posses sion of that land which he had promised them and not to give ear to him who on this account and under the pretence of divine authority forbade them so to do Consider ing therefore the distressed state they were in at present and that in those desert places they were still to expect things would be worse with them they resolved to fight with the Canaanites as submitting only to God their supreme commander and not waiting for any assistance from their legislator When they had come to this resolution they went against their enemies but those enemies were not dismayed either at the at tack itself or at the great multitude that made it but received them with such courage that many of the Hebrews were slain and the re mainder of the army upon the disorder of their troops were pursued and fled after a shameful manner to their camp Where upon this unexpected misfortune made them quite despond and they hoped for nothing that was good as gathering from it that this affliction came from the wrath of God be cause they rashly went out to war without his approbation When Moses saw how deeply they were affected with this defeat and when he was  Numb xiv 45 AN 1531 Ill ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS afraid lest the enemies should grow insolent upon this victory and should attack them in order to gain still greater glory he resolved that it was proper to withdraw the army into the wilderness to a farther distance from the Canaanites So the multitude gave them selves up again to his conduct for they were sensible that without his care their affairs could not be in a good condition and he caused the host to remove and he went far ther into the wilderness as intending there to let them rest and not to permit them to fight the Canaanites before God should afford them a more favourable opportunity CHAP II OF THE SEDITION OF CORAH AND OF THE MULTITUDE AGAINST MOSES AND AARON CONCERNING THE PRIESTHOOD THAT which is usually the case with great armies and especially upon ill success to be hard to be pleased and go verned with difficulty did now befal the Jews for being in number six hundred thousand and by reason of their great multi tude not readily subject to their governors even in prosperity they at this time were more than usually angry both against each other and against their leader because of the distress they were in and the calamities they then endured on which account such a sedition overtook them as we have not the like example either among the Greeks or the Barbarians by means of this they were in danger of being all destroyed but were not withstanding saved by Moses who would not remember that he had been almost stoned to death by them Nor did God neglect to pre vent their ruin but notwithstanding the in dignities they offered their legislator and the laws and their disobedience to the command ments which he had sent them by Moses he delivered them from those terrible calamities which without his providential care had been brought upon them by this sedition so I will first explain the cause whence this se dition arose and then will give an account of the sedition itself as also of what settlements Moses made for their government after it was over  About an 1512 t Evil example is peculiarly influential because it strikes in with the corrupt propensities of human nature VOL â No 10 Corah f a Hebrew of principal account both by his family and by his wealth one that was also able to speak well and that could easily persuade the people by his speeches saw that Moses was in an exceeding great dignity and was uneasy at it and envied him on that account he was of the same tribe with Moses and of kin to him He was par ticularly grieved because he thought he bet ter deserved that honourable post as being more opulent and not inferior to him in his birth so he raised a clamour against him among the Levites who were of the same tribe and especially among his kindred say ing that it was a very sad thing that they should overlook Moses while he hunted after and paved the way to glory for himself and by ill arts should obtain it under pretence of God s command while contrary to the laws he had given the priesthood to Aaron not by the common suffrage of the multitude but by his own vote as bestowing dignities in a ty rannical way upon whom he pleased He added that that concealed way of imposing on them was harder to be borne than if it had been done by an open force upon them be cause he did not only take away their power without their consent but even while they were unapprized of his contrivances against them for whosoever is conscious to himself that he deserves any dignity aims to get it by persuasion and not by an arrogant method of violence But those that believe it impos sible to obtain those honours justly make a shew of goodness and do not introduce force but by cunning tricks grow wickedly power ful That it was proper for the multitude to punish such men even while they think them selves concealed in their designs and not suffer them to gain strength till they have them for their open enemies What ac count said he is Moses able to give why he has bestowed the priesthood on Aaron and his sons For if God determined to bestow that honour on one of the tribe of Levi I am more worthy of it than he is as being equal to Moses by my family and superior to him both in riches and in age But if God had determined to bestow it on the eldest tribe that of Reubel might have it more justly and When it is set in opposition to good pursuits it is generally most prevalent This easily accounts for the success of the conspiracy of Corah B Ff 112 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS then Dathan and Abiram and On the son of Peleth would have it For these are the old est men of that tribe and potent on account of their great wealth also Now Corah when he said this wished to appear careful of the public welfare but in reality he was endeavouring to procure to have that dignity transferred by the multitude to himself And thus did he out oi a malig nant design but with plausible words dis course to those of his own tribe And when these words did gradually spread to more of the people and the hearers still added to what tended to the scandals that were cast upon Aaron the whole army was full of them Now of those that conspired with Corah there were two hundred and fifty of the principal men who were eager to have the priesthood taken from Moses s brother and to bring him to disgrace Nay the multitude themselves were provoked to be seditious and attempted to stone Moses and gathered themselves together after an indecent manner with con fusion and disorder And now they all were in a tumultuous manner raising a clamour be fore the tabernacle of God to prosecute the tyrant and to relieve the multitude from their slavery under him who under colour of the Divine commands laid violent injunctions upon them For that had it been God who chose one that was to perform the office of a priest he would have raised a worthy person to that dignity and would not have produced such an one as was inferior to many others nor have given him that office and that in case he had judged it fit to bestow it on Aaron he would have permitted the multi tude to bestow it and not have left it to be bestowed by his own brother Now although Moses had long foreseen this calumny of Corah s and had seen that the people were irritated yet was he not alarmed at it But being of good courage because he had given them good advice about their af fairs and knowing that his brother had been made partaker of the priesthood at the com mand of God and not by his own favour to him he came to the assembly and as for the multitude he said not a word to them but spake as loud to Corah as he could and  Reland here observes that although our Bibles say little or nothing of these riches of Corah yet both the being very eloquent and having this natural talent among others that he could greatly move the multitude with his discourses he said O Corah both thou and all those with thee pointing to the two hundred and fifty men seem to be worthy of this honour Nor do I pretend but that this whole company may be worthy of the like dignity although they may not be so rich or so great as you are Nor have I given this office to my bro ther because he excelled others in riches for thou exceedest us both in the greatness of thy wealth nor indeed because he was of an eminent family for God by giving us the same common ancestor has made our families equal nay nor was it out of brotherly affec tion which another might yet have justly done For certainly unless I had bestowed this honour out of regard to God and to hi laws I had not passed by myself and given it to another as having a closer intimacy with myself than I have with him For surely it would not be a wise thing for me to expose myself to the dangers of offending and to be stow the happy employment on this account upon another But I am above such practi ces nor would God have overlooked this matter and seen himself thus despised nor would he have suffered you to be ignorant of what you were to do in order to please him But he hath himself chosen one that is to per form that sacred office to him and thereby freed us from that care So that it was not a thing that I pretended to give but only ac cording to the determination of God I there fore propose it still to be contended for by such as please to put in for it only desiring that he who has already been preferred and has already obtained it may be allowed now also to offer himself a candidate He pre fers your peace and your living without sedi tion to this honourable employment although in truth it was with your approbation that he obtained it For though God were the donor yet do we not offend when we think fit to ac cept of it with your good will Yet would it have been an instance of impiety not to have taken that honourable employment when he offered it nay it had been exceedingly un reasonable when God had thought fit any Jews and Mahometans as well as Josephus are full of it AN 1531 113 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS one should have it for all time to come and had made it secure and firm to him to have refused it However he himself will judge again who it shall be whom he would have to offer sacrifices to him and to have the di rection of matters of religion For it is ab surd that Corah who is ambitious of this ho nour should deprive God of the power of giving it to whom he pleases Put an end therefore to your sedition and disturbance on this account and to morrow morning let every one who desires the priesthood bring a censer from home and come hither with in cense and fire And do thou O Corah leave the judgment to God and await to see on what side he will give his determination upon this occasion But do not thou make thyself greater than God Do thou also come that this contest about this honourable em ployment may receive determination And suppose we may admit Aaron without of ence to offer himself to this scrutiny since le is of the same lineage with thyself and las done nothing in his priesthood that can be liable to exception Come ye therefore together and offer your incense in public be fore all the people and when you offer it he whose sacrifice God shall accept shall be ordained to the priesthood and shall be clear of the present calumny on Aaron as if I had granted him that favour because he was my brother CHAP Ill OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE WHO FOMENTED THE SE DITION J AND OF THE DIVINE APPROVAL OF AARON S PRIESTHOOD WHEN Moses had said this the multi tude left off the turbulent behaviour they had indulged and the suspicion they had entertained of Moses and commended what he had said for those proposals were good and were so esteemed of the people At that time therefore they dissolved the assembly But on the next day they came to the congre gation in order to be present at the sacrifice and at the determination that was to be made between the candidates for the priesthood Now this congregation proved a turbulent one and the multitude were in great sus  Numb xiv 6 7 pense in expectation of what was to be done And some of them would have been pleased if Moses had been convicted of evil practices but the wiser sort desired that they might be delivered from the present disorder and dis turbance for they were afraid that if this sedition went on the good order of their settlement would be destroyed But the whole body of people do naturally delight in clamours against their governors and by changing their opinions upon the harangues of every speaker disturb the public tran quility And now Moses sent messengers for Abiram and Dathan and ordered them to come to the assembly and wait there for the holy offices that were to be performed But they answered the messengers that they would not obey his summons nay would not overlook Moses s behaviour who was grow ing too great for them by evil practices Now when Moses heard this answer he desired the heads of the people to follow him and he went to the faction of Dathan not fearing to go to these insolent people so they made no opposition but went along with him But Da than and his associates when they understood that Moses and the principal of the people were coming to them came out with their wives and children and stood before their tents and looked to see what Moses would do They had also their servants at hand to defend them in case Moses should use force But he came near and lifted up his hands to heaven and cried out with a loud voice in order to be heard by the whole multitude and said  O Lord of the creatures that are in the heaven in the earth and in the sea for thou art the most authentic witness to what I have done that it has all been done by thy appointment and that it was thou that afford est us assistance when we attempted any thing and shewed mercy to the Hebrews in all their distresses Do thou come now and hear all I say for no action nor thought es capes thy knowledge so that thou wilt not disdain to speak what is true for my vindica tion without any regard to the ungrateful imputations of these men As for what was done before I was born thou knowest best as not learning them by report but seeing them and being present with them when they were done But for what has been done of late and which these men although they 114 book it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS know them well enough unjustly pretend to suspect he thou my witness When I lived a private quiet life I left those good things which by my own diligence and by thy coun sel I enjoyed with Raguel my father in law and I gave myself up to this people and un derwent many miseries on their account I also bore great labours at first in order to obtain liberty for them and now in order to their preservation and have always shewed myself ready to assist them in every distress Now therefore since I am suspected by those very men whose being is owing to my la bours come thou as it is reasonable to hope thou wilt thou I say who shewedst me that fire at mount Sinai and madest me to hear its voice and to see the several wonders which that place afforded thou who commandedst me to go to Egypt and declare thy will to this people thou who disturbedst the happy estate of the Egyptians and gavedst us the opportunity of flying from our slavery under them and madest the dominion of Pharaoh inferior to my dominion thou who didst make the sea dry land for us when we knew not whither to go and didst overwhelm the Egyptians with those destructive waves which had been divided for us thou who didst be stow upon us the security of weapons when we were naked thou who didst make the corrupted fountains to flow so as to be fit for drinking and didst furnish us with water that came out of the rocks when we were in the greatest want of it thou who didst preserve our lives with quails which was food from the sea when the fruits of the ground failed us thou who didst send us such food from heaven as had never been seen before thou who didst suggest to us the knowledge of thy laws and appoint us a form of government Come thou O Lord of the whole world and that as such a judge and a witness to me as cannot be bribed and show how I have never admitted of any gift against justice from any of the Hebrews and have never con demned a poor man that ought to have been acquitted on occount of one that was rich and have never attempted to hurt this com monwealth I am now here present and am suspected of a thing the remotest from my in tentions as if I had given the priesthood to Aaron not at thy command but out of my own favour to him Do thou at this time de monstrate that all things are administered by thy providence and that nothing happens by chance but is governed by thy will and thereby attains its end as also demonstrate that thou takest care of those that have done good to the Hebrews Demonstrate this I say by the punishment of Abiram and Da than who condemn thee as an insensible be ing and one overcome by my contrivances This wilt thou do by inflicting such an open punishment on those men who so madly fly in the face of thy glory as will take them out of the world not in an ordinary manner but so that it may appear that they do not die as other men go out of the world let that ground on which they tread open about them with their families and goods This will be a de monstration of thy power to all men and this method of their sufferings will be an instruc tion of wisdom for those that entertain pro found sentiments of thee By this means I shall be found a good servant in the precepts thou hast given by me But if the calumnies they have raised against me be true mayest thou preserve these men from every evil ac cident and bring all that destruction on me which I have imprecated upon them And when thou hast inflicted punishment on those that have endeavoured to deal unjustly with this people bestow upon them concord and peace Save this multitude that follow thy commandments and preserve them free from harm and let them not partake of the punish ment of those that have sinned For thou knowest thyself it is not just that for the wickedness of those men the whole body of the Israelites should suffer punishment When Moses had said this with tears in his eyes the ground was moved on a sudden and the agitation that set it in motion was like that which the wind produces in waves of the sea The people were all affrighted and the ground that was about their tents sunk down at that terrible sound and carried whatsoever was dear to the seditious into it self who so entirely perished that there was not the least appearance that any men had ever been seen there the earth that had opened itself about them closing again and becoming entire as it was before insomuch that such as saw it afterward did not perceive  AN 1512 115 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS that any such accident had happened Thus did these men perish and became a demon tration of the power of God And truly any one would lament them not only on account of this calamity that befel them which yet deserves our commiseration but also because their kindred were pleased with their suffer ings for they forgot the relation they bare to them and at the sight of this sad accident approved of the judgment given against them and because they looked upon the people about Dathan as pestilent men they thought they perished as such and did not grieve for them Moses now called for those that contended about the priesthood that trial might be made who should be priest and that he whose sacri fice God was best pleased with might be or dained to that function So the two hundred and fifty men approached who indeed were honoured by the people not only on account of their ancestors but also on account of their own power in which they excelled the others Aaron and Corah also came forth and they all offered incense in those censers which they brought with them before the taber nacle Hereupon so great a fire shone out as no one ever saw in any that is made by the hand of man neither in those eruptions out of the earth that are caused by subterrane ous burnings nor in such fires as arise of their own accord in the woods when the agi tation is caused by the trees rubbing one against another but this fire was very bright and had a terrible flame such as is kindled at the command of God by whose irruption on them all the company and Corah himself weref destroyed so entirely that their very bodies left no remains Aaron alone was pre served and not at all hurt by the fire be cause it was God that sent the fire to burn those only who ought to be burned Here upon Moses after these men were destroyed was desirous that the memory of this judgment might be delivered down to posterity and that future ages might be acquainted with it and he commanded Eleazar the son of Aaron to put their censers near the brazen altar that they might be a memorial to posterity of  Numb xvi 33 t It appears here from the Samaritan Pentateuch and jÂ effect from the Psalmist as also from the Apostolical Constitutions from Clement s first Epistle to the Corin voi I â No 10 what these men suffered for supposing that the power of God might be eluded And thus Aaron was no longer esteemed to have the priesthood by the favour of Moses but by the public judgment of God and he and his child ren peaceably enjoyed that honour afterward CHAP IV OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HEBREWS DURIN6 THIRTT EICHT YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS THE sedition however was so far from ceasing upon this destruction that it grew much stronger J and became more in tolerable And the occasion of its growing worse was of that nature as made it likely the calamity would last for a long time For the men believing already that nothing is done without the providence of God would have it that these things came thus to pass not without God s favour to Moses They there fore laid the blame upon him that God was so angry and that this happened not so much because of the wickedness of those that were punished as because Moses procured the punishment and that these men had been destroyed without any sin of theirs only be cause they were zealous about the divine worship as also that he who had been the cause of this diminution of the people by de stroying so many men and those the most ex cellent of them all besides his escaping any punishment himself had now given the priest hood to his brother so firmly that nobody could any longer dispute it with him for no one else could now put in for it since he must have seen those that first did so to have mise rably perished Nay besides this the kindred of those that were destroyed made great en treaties to the multitude to abate the arro gance of Moses because it would be safest for them so to do Moses upon his hearing that the people were tumultuous was afraid they would at tempt some other innovation and that some great and sad calamity would be the conse quence So he called the multitude to a con gregation and patiently heard what apology they made for themselves without opposing thians from Ignatius s Epistle to the Magnesians and from Eusebius that Corah was not swallowed up with the Reubenites but burnt with the Levites of his own tribe J Numb xvi 41 Gg 116 book it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them and lest he should embitter the multi tude he only desired the heads of the tribes to bring their rods with the names of their tribes inscribed upon them and he should receive the priesthood in whose rod God should give a sign This was agreed to so the rest brought their rods as did Aaron also who had written the tribe of Levi on his rod These rods Moses laid up in the tabernacle of God On the next day he brought out the rods which were known from one another by those who brought them they having dis tinctly noted them as had the multitude also and as to the rest in the same form Moses had received them in that they saw them still but they also saw buds and branches grown out of Aaron s rod with ripe almonds upon them the rod having been cut out of that tree The people were so amazed at this strange sight that though Moses and Aaron were before under some degree of hatred they now laid that hatred aside and began to admire the judgment of God con cerning them So that hereafter they ap plauded what God had decreed and per mitted Aaron to enjoy the priesthood peace ably And thus God ordained him priest three several times and he retained that ho nour without farther disturbance And hereby this sedition of the Hebrews which had lasted a great while was at length composed And now Moses because the tribe of Levi was made free from war and warlike expedi tions and was set apart for the Divine wor ship lest they should want and seek after the necessaries of life and so neglect the temple commanded the Hebrews according to the will of God that when they should gain the possession of the land of Canaan they should assign forty eight good cities to the Levites and permit them to enjoy their suburbs as far as the limit of two thousand cubits would extend from the walls of the city And besides this he appointed that the people should pay the tithe of their annual fruits of the earth both to the Levites and to the priests And this is what that tribe receives of the multitude But I think it necessary to set down what is paid by all peculiarly to the priests  Concerning these twelve rods of the twelve tribes of Israel see St Clement s account much larger than that in our Bible 1 Epist Â 43 Accordingly he commanded the Levites to yield up to the priests thirteen of their forty eight cities and to set apart for them the tenth part of the tithe which they every year receive of the people as also that it was but just to offer to God the first fruits of the entire product of the ground and that they should offer the first born of those four footed beasts that are appointed for sacrifices if it be a male to the priests to be slain that they and their entire families may eat them in the holy city but that the owners of those first born which are not appointed for sacrifices in the laws of our country should bring a shekel and a half in their stead but for the first born of a man five shekels that they should also have the first fruits out of the shearing of the sheep and that when any baked bread corn and made loaves of it they should give some what of what they baked to them More over when any have made a sacred vow I mean those that are called Nazarites f that suffer their hair to grow long and use no wine when they consecrate their hair and offer it for a sacrifice they are to allot that hair to the priests to be thrown into the fire Such also as dedicate themselves to God as a corban which denotes what the Greeks call a gift when they are desirous of being freed from that ministration are to lay down money for the priests thirty shekels if it be a woman and fifty if it be a man but if any be too poor to pay the appointed sum it shall be lawful for the priest to determine the sum as they think fit And if any slay a beast at home for a private festival but not for a religious one they are obliged to bring the maw and the cheek or breast and the right shoulder of the sacrifice to the priests With these Moses contrived that the priests should be plentifully maintained besides what they had out of these offerings for sins which the people gave them as I have set it down in the fore going book He also ordered that out of every thing allotted for the priests their ser vants their sons their daughters and their wives should partake as well as themselves excepting what came to them out of the sa crifices that were offered for sins For of those none of the family of the priests might t Grotius observes that the Greeks as well as the Jews sometimes consecrated the hair of their heads to th  gods On Numb vi 18 ait 1493 117 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS cat and in the temple also and the same day they were offered When Moses had made these constitutions after the sedition was over he removed to gether with the whole army and came to the borders of Idumea He then sent ambassa dors to the king of the Idumeans and desired him to give him a passage through his coun try and agreed to send him what hostages he should desire to secure him from any in jury He desired also that he would allow his army liberty to buy provisions and if he insisted upon it he would pay down a price for the very water they should drink But the king was not pleased with this ambassage from Moses nor did he allow a passage for the army but brought his people armed to meet Moses and to hinder them in case they should endeavour to force their passage Upon which Moses consulted God by the Oracle who would not have him begin the war first and so he withdrew his forces and travelled round about through the wilder ness Then it was that Miriam the sister of Moses came to her end having completed herf fortieth year since she left Egypt on J the first day of the lunar month Xanthicus They then made a public funeral for her at a great expense She was buried upon a cer tain mountain which they call Sin And when they had mourned for her thirty days Moses purified the people after this manner He brought a heifer that had never been used to the plough or to husbandry that was complete in all its parts and entirely of a red colour at a little distance from the camp into a place perfectly clean This heifer was slain by the high priest and her blood sprinkled with his finger seven times before the taber nacle of God After this the entire heifer was burnt in that state together with its skin and entrails and they threw cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool into the midst of the fire Then a clean man gathered all her ashes together and laid them in a place per fectly clean When therefore any persons were defiled by a dead body they put a little of these ashes into spring water with hyssop and dipping part of these ashes in it they sprinkled them with it both on the third day and on the seventh and after that they were clean This he enjoined them to do also when the tribes should come into their own land Now when this purification which their leader made upon the mourning for his sister as it had now been described was over he caused the army to remove and to march through the wilderness and through Arabia And when he came to a place which the Ara bians esteem their metropolis which was for merly called Arce but has now the name of Petra at this place which was encompassed with high mountains Aaron went up one of them in the sight of the whole army Moses having before told him that he was to die for this place was over against them He there put off his pontifical garments and de livered them to Eleazar his son to whom the high priesthood belonged because he was the elder brother and died while the multitude looked upon him He died in the same year wherein he lost his sister having lived in all an hundred and twenty three years He died on the first day of that lunar month which is called by the Athenians Hecatombaeon by the Macedonians Lous but by the Hebrews Abba CHAP V OF THE CONQUEST OF SIHON AND OG KINGS OF THE AMO RITES J AND THE DIVISION OF THEIR LAND BY LOT TO TWO TRIBES AND A HALF OF THE HEBREWS THE people mourned for Aaron

into the lake Asphaltites and became the limit between the land of the Moabites and the land of the Amorites This land is fruitful and sufficient to maintain a great number of men with the  Numb xx 1

messengers to Sihon the king of this country desiring that he would grant his army a passage upon what security he should please to require he promised that he should be no ways injured neither as to that country which Sihon governed nor as to its inhabi tants and that he would buy his provisions at such a price as should be to their advan tage even though he should desire to sell them their very water But Sihon refused his offer and put his army in array preparing every thing in order to hinder their passage over Arnon When Moses saw that the Amorite king was disposed to commence hostilities he thought he ought not to bear that insult and deter mining to wean the Hebrews from their indo lent temper and prevent the disorders which arose thence which had been the occasion of their former sedition nor indeed were they now thoroughly easy in their minds he en quired of God whether he would give him leave to fight which when he had done and God had promised him the victory he was very courageous and ready to proceed to fighting Accordingly he encouraged the soldiers and desired of them that they would take the pleasure of fighting now God gave them leave so to do Upon this commission which they so much longed for they put on their armour and set about the work without delay But the Amorite king was not now like to himself when the Hebrews were ready to attack him both himself was affrighted at the Hebrews and his army which before had shewn themselves to be of good courage were then found to be timorous So they could not sustain the first onset nor bear up against the Hebrews but fled away think ing this would afford them a more likely way for their escape than fighting For they de pended upon their cities which were strong from which they reaped no advantage when they were forced to fly from them For as soon as the Hebrews saw them giving ground they immediately pursued and when they had broken their ranks they greatly terrified them And some of them broke off from the rest and ran away to the cities Now the Hebrews pursued them briskly and obsti nately persevered in the labours they had already undergone and being very skilful in slinging and very dexterous in throwing darts or any thing else of that kind and also having on nothing but light armour which made them quick in pursuit they over took their enemies And for those that were most remote and could not be overtaken they reached them by their slings and their bows so that many were slain and those that escaped the slaughter were sorely wounded and these were more distressed with thirst than with any of those that fought against them for it was the summer season and when the greatest number of them were brought down to the river out of a desire to drink as also when others fled away by troops the Hebrews came round them and shot at them so that what with darts and what with arrows they made a slaughter of them all Sihon also their king was slain So the He brews spoiled their dead bodies and took their prey f The land also which they took was full of fruits and the army went all over it without fear and fed their cattle upon it and took the enemies prisoners For they could no way put a stop to them since all the fighting men were destroyed Such was the destruction which overtook the Amorites who were neither sagacious in counsel nor courageous in action Hereupon the He brews took possession of their land which is situate between three rivers and naturally resembling an island the river Arnon being its northern limit and the river Jabbok de termining its southern side which running into Jordan loses its own name and takes the other While Jordan itself runs along by it on its western coast J When matters were come to this state Og the king of Gilead and Gaulanitis fell upon the Israelites He brought an army with him and came in haste to the assistance of his friend Sihon But though he found him already slain he resolved to fight the He brews

passed over the river Jabbok and over ran the kingdom of Og He overthrew their cities and slew all their inhabitants who exceeded in riches all the men in that part of the continent on account of the goodness of the soil and the great quantity of his wealth Now Og had very few equals either in the largeness of his body or the beauty of his appearance He was also a man of great activity so that his

country of the Midianites and to take their cities Now the occasion which he took for making war upon them was as follows When Balak the king of the Moabites who had from his ancestors a friendship and league with the Midianites saw how greatly the Israelites were increased he was much affrighted on account of his own and his king dom s danger For he was notJ acquainted with this that the Hebrews would not med dle with any other country but were to be contented with the possession of the land of Canaan God having forbidden them to go any farther So he with more haste than wisdom resolved to make an attempt upon them by words but he did not judge it pru dent to fight against them after they had had the prosperous successes and even became out of ill successes more happy than before but he thought to hinder them if he could from growing greater and so he resolved to send ambassadors to the Midianites about them Now these Midianites knowing there was one Balaam who lived by Euphrates and was the greatest of the prophets at that time and one that was in friendship with them sent some of their honourable princes along with the ambassadors of Balak to intreat the prophet to come to them that he might im precate curses to the destruction of the Is raelites So Balaam received the ambassa dors and treated them very kindly And when he had supped he inquired what was God s will and what this matter was for which the Midianites intreated him to come to them but when God opposed his going he came to sons but whole armies to destruction This they are said to have done sometimes by words of imprecation of which there was a set form among some people which JZschines calls Siap opevrpi apav the determinate curse Sometimes they also offered sacrifices and used certain rites and ceremonies with solemn charms A famous in stance of this we find in the life of Crassus where Plu tarch tells us that Atticus tribune of the people made a fire at the gate out of which Crassus was to march to the war against the Parthians into which he threw certain things to make a fume and offered sacrifices to the most angry gods with horrid imprecations upon him these he says according to ancient tradition had such a power that no man who was loaded with them could avoid being un done 8 Hb 120 BOOR If ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the ambassadors and told them that he was himself willing and desirous to comply with their request but that God was opposite to his intentions even that God who had raised him to great reputation on account of the truth of his predictions For that this army which they entreated him to come to curse was in favour of God On which account he advised them to go home again and not to persist in their enmity against the Israelites And when he had given them that answer he dismissed the ambassadors Now the Midianites at the earnest en treaties of Balak sent other ambassadors to Balaam who desiring to gratify the men in quired again of God but he was displeased at this second trial and bid him by no means to contradict the ambassadors Balaam did not imagine that God gave this injunction in order to deceive him so he went along with the ambassadors But when the Divine angel met him in the way when he was in a narrow passage and edged in with a wall on both sides the ass on which Balaam rode under stood that it was a Divine spirit that met him and thrust Balaam to one of the walls with out regard to the stripes which her master when he was hurt by the wall gave her But when the ass upon the angel s continuing to distress her and upon the stripes which were given her fell down by the will of God she made use of the voice of a man and com plained of Balaam as acting unjustly to her that whereas he had no fault to find with her in her former service he now inflicted stripes upon her as not understanding that she was hindered from serving him in what he was now going about by the providence of God And when he was disturbed by reason of the voice of the ass which was that of a man the angel plainly appeared to him and blamed him for the stripes he had given his ass in forming him that the creature was not in fault but that he was himself come to obstruct his journey as being contrary to the will of God Upon this Balaam was afraid and was pre paring to return back yet God excited him to go on his intended way but added this in junction that he should declare nothing but what he himself should suggest f When God had given him this charge the prophet came to Balak and after the king had entertained him in a magnificent manner he desired him to go to one of the mountains to take a view of the state of the camp of the Hebrews Balak himself also came to the mountain and brought the prophet along with him with a royal attendance This mountain lay over their heads and was dis tant sixty furlongs from the camp J He then  Numb xxii 31 Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way There are several instances to be found both in the scriptures and in profane authors where the eyes have been opened by a divine power to perceive that which they could not see by mere natural discernment Thus the eyes of Hagar were opened that she might see the fountain Gen xxi 19 Homer also presents us with an example of this kind Minerva says to Diomed Yet more from mortal mists I purge thy eyes And set to view the warring deities II v 164 Pope And in Virgil Venus performs the same office to iEneas and shews him the gods who were engaged in the destruc tion of Troy Aspice namque omnem quae nunc obducta tuenti Mortales hebetat visus tibi ethumida circum c JEn ii 604 Now cast your eyes around while I dissolve The mists and films that mortal eyes involve Purge

the world and the fortunes of his posterity then purg d with euphrasy and rue The visual nerve for he had much to see And from the well of life three drops instill d Paradise Lost b xi 414 B t Note that Josephus never supposes Balaam to be an idolater nor to seek idolatrous enchantments or to pro phesy falsely but to be no other than an ill disposed pro phet of the true God and intimates that God s answer the second time permitting him to go was ironical and on design that he should be deceived which sort of decep tion by way of punishment for former crimes Josephus never scruples to admit as ever esteeming such wicked men justly and providentially deceived But perhaps we had better to adhere closely to the text which says Numb xxiii 20 21 that God only permitted Balaam to go along with or in the Septuagint version to follow the ambassadors in case they came and called him or posi tively insisted on his going along with them on any terms Whereas Balaam seems out of impatience to have risen up in the morning and saddled his ass and rather to have called them than staid for their calling him So zealous does he seem to have been for his reward of divination his wages of unrighteousness Numb xxii 7 17 18 37 2 Pet ii 15 Jude 11 which reward or wages the truly religious prophets of God never required nor accepted as Josephus justly takes notice in the cases of Samuel Antiq VI 4 and Daniel Antiq X 17 See also Gen xiv 23 24 2 Kings v 15 16 26 and Acts viii 18â 24  Balaam required seven altars to be built and suitable an 1493 121 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS slew the sacrifices and offered them as burnt offerings that he might observe some signal of the Sight of the Hebrews Then said he 44 Happy is this people on whom God be stows the possession of innumerable good things and grants them his own providence to be their assistant and their guide so that there is not any nation among mankind but you will be esteemed superior to them in virtue and in the earnest prosecution of the best rules of life and of such as are pure from wickedness and will leave those rules to your excellent children and this out of the regard that God bears to you and the pro vision of such things for you as may render you happier than any other people under the sun You shall retain that land to which he hath sent you and it shall be ever under the command of your children and both all the earth as well as the sea shall be filled with their glory And you shall be sufficiently numerous to supply the world in general and every region of it in particular with inhabi tants out of your stock However O blessed army wonder that you are become so many from one father and truly the land of Canaan can now hold you as being yet comparatively few but know ye that the whole world is proposed to be your place of habitation for ever Your posterity shall also live in the islands as well as on the continent and shall be more numerous than the stars of heaven And when you are become so many God will not relinquish his care of you but will afford you an abundance of all good things in times of peace with victory and dominion in times of war May the children of your enemies have an inclination to fight against you and may they be so hardy as to come to arms and to assault you in battle for they will not return with victory nor will their return be agreeable to their wives and children To so great a degree of valour will you be raised by the providence of God who is able to dimi nish the affluence of some and to supply the wants of others sacrifices to be prepared The ancients were very super stitious about certain numbers supposing that God de lighted in odd numbers Terna tibi haec primum triplici diversa colore Licia circumdo terque haec altaria circum Effigiem duco numero Deus impare gaudet Virg Eclog viii 73 Thus did Balaam speak by inspiration as not being in his own power but moved to say what he did by the Divine spirit But Balak was greatly displeased and said he had broken the contract whereby he was to come as he and his confederates had invited him by the promise of great presents For whereas he came to curse their enemies he had pronounced an encomium on them and had declared they were the happiest of men To which Balaam replied O Balak if thou rightly considerest this whole matter canst thou suppose that it is in our power to be silent or to say any thing when the Spirit ol God seizes upon us for he puts such words as he pleases in our mouths and such dis courses as we are not ourselves conscious of I well remember by what entreaties both you and the Midianites brought me hither and on that account I took this journey It was my prayer that I might not put any affront upon you as to what you desired of me But God is more powerful than the purposes I had made to serve you For those that take upon them to foretel the affairs of mankind as from their own abilities are entirely unable to do it or to forbear to utter what God suggests to them or to offer violence to his will For when he prevents us and enters into us no thing that we say is our own I then did not intend to praise this army nor to notice the several good things which God intended to do to their race But since he was so favour able to them and so ready to bestow upon them a happy life and eternal glory he sug gested the declaration of those things to me But now because it is my desire to oblige thee thyself as well as the Midianites whose entreaties it is not decent for me to reject let us again rear other altars and offer the like sacrifices that we did before and I may see whether I can persuade God to permit me to bind these men with curses Balak readily agreed to this proposal but God would not even upon second sacrifices con sent to his cursing the Israelites Then fell Around his waxen image first I wind Three woollen fillets of three colours join d Thrice bind about his thrice devoted head Which round the sacred altar thrice is led Unequal numbers please the gods Drvden B  Whether Josephus had in his copy but two attempts of Balaam in all to curse Israel or whether by his twice 122 BOOK IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Balaam upon his face and foretold what ca lamities would befal the several kings of the nations and the most eminent cities some of which of old were not so much as inhabited which events have come to pass among the several people concerned both in the pre ceding ages and in this till my own memory both by sea and land From which comple tion of these predictions one may naturally expect that the rest will have their comple tions in time to come Balak being very angry that the Israelites were not cursed sent away Balaam without thinking him worthy of any honour Where upon when he was just upon his journey in order to pass the Euphrates he sent for Ba lak and tor the princes of the Midianites and spake thus to him O Balak and you Mi dianites that are here present I am obliged even without the will of God to gratify you It is true no entire destruction can seize upon the nation of the Hebrews neither by war nor by plague nor by scarcity of the fruits of the earth nor can any other unexpected ac cident be to their entire ruin For the pro vidence of God is concerned to preserve them from such a misfortune nor will it permit any such calamity to come upon them whereby they may all perish But some small misfor tunes and those for some time whereby they may appear to be brought low may still befal them But after that they will flourish again to the terror of those who brought those mis chiefs upon them So that if you are desirous of gaining a victory over them for a short space of time you will obtain it by following my directions Do you therefore set out the comeliness of such of your daughters as are most eminent for beauty and proper to con quer the modesty of those that behold them and these decked and ornamented to the highest degree you are able Then send them to the Israelites camp and give them in charge that when the young men of the He brews desire their company they allow it them And when they see that they are ena moured of them let them take their leave and if they entreat them to stay let them not give their consent till they have persuaded them to neglect their own laws and the wor ship of that God who established them and to worship the gods of the Midianites and Moabites for by this means God will be in censed againstt them Accordingly when Balaam had suggested this course he went his way When the Midianites had sent their daugh ters as Balaam had exhorted them the He brew young men were allured by their beauty and besought them not to grudge them the enjoyment of their beauty nor to deny them their conversation These daughters of the Midianites received their words gladly and consented to stay with them But when they had brought them to be perfectly enamoured they began to talk of departing Then it was that these men became greatly disconsolate at the women s departure and were urgent with them not to leave them but begged they would continue there and become their wives and promised them they should be owned as mistresses of all they had This they said with an oath calling God for the arbitrator of what they promised and this with tears in their eyes and such other marks of concern as might show how miserable they thought themselves without them and so might move their compassion So the women as soon as they perceived they had made them their slaves and had enamoured them with their conversation began to speak thus to them O ye illustrious young men we have houses of our own at home and great plenty of good things there together with the na tural affectionate love of our parents and friends Nor is it out of our want of any such things that we are come to discourse with you nor did we admit of your invitation with design to prostitute our beauty for gain but offering sacrifice he meant twice beside the first time already mentioned which is not yet very probable can not now be certainly determined In the mean time  all other copies have three such attempts of Balaam to curse them in the present history  Such a large and distinct account of this perversion of the Israelites by the Midianite women of which our other copies give us but short intimations Numb xxxi 16 2 Pet ii 15 Jude 11 Apoc ii 14 is preserved as Roland informs us in the Samaritan chronicle in Philo and in other writings of the Jews as well as here by Josephus t This grand maxim that God s people of Israel could never be hurt nor destroyed but by drawing them to sin against God appears to be true by the entire history of that people both in the Bible and in Josephus and is often noticed in them both See in particular a most re markable Ammonite testimony to this purpose Judith v 5 21 aN MÂ a 123 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEVT taking you for brave and worthy men we agreed to your request that we might treat you with such honours as hospitality required And now seeing yao say that you nave a great affection for us and are troubled when you think we are departing we are not averse to your entreaties and if we may receive sa tisfactory assurance of your good will we will be glad to lead our lives with you as your wives but we are afraid that you will in time be weary of our company and will then abuse us and send us back to our parents after an ignominious manner You must therefore excuse us in guarding against that danger The young men professed they would give them any assistance they should desire nor did they at all contradict what they requested so great was the passion they had for them If then rejoined they this be your resolution since you make use of such cus toms and conduct of life as are entirely dif ferent from all other men insomuch that your kinds of food are peculiar to yourselves and your kinds of drink not common to others it will be absolutely necessary if you would have us for your wives that you do withal worship our gods Nor can there be any other demonstration of the kindness which you say you already have and promise to have hereafter to us than this that you wor ship the same gods as we do For has any one reason to complain that now you are come into this country you should worship the proper gods of the same country espe cially while our gods are common to all men and yours such as belong to nobody but your selves So they said they must either come into such methods of divine worship as all others came into or else they most look out for another world wherein they might live by themselves according to their own laws Now the young men were induced by the fondness they had for these women tb think they spake very welK So they gave them selves up to what they suggested and trans gressed their own laws and supposing there  What Jbsephus here puts into the mouths of these Midianite women who came to entice the Israelites to lewdness and idolatry viz that their worship of the God of Israel m opposition to their idol gods implied their living according to the holy laws which the true God had given them by I fosesr in opposition to those impure laws which were observed under ifteif false gods well deserves VOL I NOS 11  12 were many gods and resolving that they would sacrifice to them according to the law of that country which ordained them they both were delighted with their strange food and went on to do every thing that the women would have them do though in contradiction to their own laws So far indeed that this transgression was already gone through the whole army of the young men and they fell into a sedition that was much worse than the former and into the danger of the entire abo lition of their own institutions For when once the youth had tasted of these strange customs they went with insatiable inclinations into them and some of the principal men who were illustrious on account of the virtues of their fathers were also corrupted together with the rest Even Zimri the head of the tribe of Simeon accompanied with Cozbi a Midianitish woman who was the daughter of Sur a man of authority in that country and being desired by his wife to disregard the raws of Moses and to follow those she was used to he complied with her and this both by sacrificing after a manner different from his own and by taking a stranger to wife When things were in this state Moses was afraid that matters would grow worse and called the people to a congregation he then accused nobody by name as unwilling to drive those to despair who by lying con cealed might come to repentance but ho said that they did not do what was either worthy of themselves or of their fathers by preferring pleasure to God and to the living according to his will that it was fit to change their courses while affairs were in a good state and think that to be true fortitude which instead of offering violence to their laws enabled them to resist their lusts And besides that he said it was not a reasonable thing when they had lived soberly in the wilderness to act madly now they were in prosperity and that they ought not to lose in abandance what they had gained when they had Kttre And thus did he endeavour to cor our consideration and gives us a substantial reason for the great concern that was ever showed under the laws of Moses to preserve the Israelites from idolatry and in the worship of the true God rt being of no less conse quence than whether God s people should be governed by the holy laws of the true GÂ d or by the impure laws derived from demons under the pagan idolatry Il m book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS rect the young men and to bring them to re pentance for what they had done But Zimri arose up after him and said Yes indeed Moses thou art at liberty to make use of such laws as thou art so fond of and hast by accustoming thyself to them made them firm Otherwise if things had not been thus thou hadst often been punished before now and hadst known that the He brews are not easily put upon But thou shalt not have me one of thy followers in thy tyran nical commands for thou didst nothing else hitherto but under pretence of laws and of God wickedly impose upon us slavery and gain dominion to thyself while thou deprivest us of the sweetness of life which consists in acting according to our own wills and is the right of free men and of those that have no lord over them Nay indeed thou art harder upon the Hebrews than were the Egyptians themselves as pretending to punish accord ing to law every one s acting as is most agree able to himself But thou thyself better de servest to suffer punishment who presumest to abolish what every one acknowledges to be good for him and aimest to make thy single opinion of more force than that of the rest and what I now do and think to be right I shall not hereafter deny to be according to my own sentiments I have married as thou sayest rightly a strange woman and thou hearest what I do from myself as from one that is free for truly I did not intend to con ceal myself I also own that I sacrifice to those gods to whom you do not think fit to sacrifice and I think it right to acquire know ledge by inquiring of many people and not like one that lives under tyranny to suffer the whole hope of my life to depend upon one man Nor shall any one find cause to rejoice who declares himself to have more authority over my actions than myself When Zimri had said these things about what he and some others had wickedly done the people held their peace both out of fear of what might come upon them and because they saw that their legislator was not willing to bring his insolence before the public any farther or openly to contend with him For he avoided that lest many should imitate the impudence of his language and thereby dis turb the multitude Upon this the assembly was dissolved However this mischievous attempt had proceeded farther if Zimri had not been slain on the following occasion Phineas a man in other respects better than the rest of the young men and also one that surpassed his contemporaries in the dignity of his father for he was the son of Eleazar the high priest and the grandson of Aaron Mo ses s brother was greatly troubled at what was done by Zimri So he resolved to intlict punishment on him before his unworthy be haviour should grow stronger by impunity and in order to prevent this transgression from proceeding farther which would hap pen if the ringleaders were not punished He was of so great magnanimity both in strength of mind and body that when he un dertook any very dangerous attempt he did not relinquish it till he got an entire victory So he came into Zimri s tent and slew him with his javelin and with it he slew Cozbi also Upon which all those young men that had a regard to virtue and aimed to do a glorious action imitated Phineas s boldness and slew those that were found to be guilty of the same crime with Zimri Accordingly many of those who had transgressed perished by the magnanimous valour of these young men The rest all perished by a plague which God himself inflicted upon them So that all those who instead of hindering them from such wicked actions as they ought to have done had persuaded them to go on were esteemed by God as partners in the wickedness and died Accordingly there perished out of the army no fewer than twenty four thousand at this time This was the cause why Moses was pro voked to destroy the Midianites concerning which expedition we will speak presently when we have first related what has been omitted For it is but just not to pass over our legislator s due encomium on account of his conduct here because although Balaam who was sent for by the Midianites to curse the Hebrews and when he was hindered from doing it by Divine Providence did still suggest that advice to them by making use of which our enemies had nearly corrupted the multitude cf the Hebrews with their artifices yet did he do him great honour by setting down his prophecies in writing And while it was in his power to claim this glory to himself and make men believe they were his  an 1493 125 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS own predictions there being no one that could be a witness against him and accuse him for so doing he stiil gave his attestation to Balaam and did him the honour to make mention of him on this account CHAP VII OF THE PUNISHMENT INFLICTED ON THE MIDIANITES BT THE HEBREWS THE APPOINTMENT OF MOSES S SUCCES SOR GRANT OF AMORITE LANDS C MOSES for the causes aforementioned sent against the land of Midian an army of twelve thousand men taking an equal number out of every tribe and ap pointing for their commander Phineas who had guarded the laws of the Hebrews and had inflicted punishment upon Zimri when he had transgressed them Now the Midianites perceived beforehand how the Hebrews were coming and would suddenly be upon them So they assembled their army and fortified the entrances into their country and there awaited the enemy s approach When they were come and had joined battle with them an innumerable mul titude of the Midianites fell among whom were their five kings Evi Zur Reba Hur and Rekem the latter of whom was of the same name with the capital city of all Ara bia which is till now so called by the whole Arabian nation Arecem from the name of the king that built it but is by the Greeks called Petra Now when the enemies were discomfited the Hebrews spoiled their coun try and took a great prey and destroyed the men that were its inhabitants together with the women only they preserved the virgins  Numb xxxi 5 t The slaughter of all the Midianite women that had prostituted themselves to the lewd Israelites and the preservation of those that had not been guilty therein which latter were no fewer than 32 000 both here and Numb xxxi 15 16 17 35 and both by the particular command of God are highly remarkable and shew that even in nations doomed to destruction for their wicked ness the innocent were sometimes particularly and pro videntially taken care of and delivered from that destruc tion Which directly implies that it was the wickedness of the nations of Canaan and nothing else that occasioned their excision See Gen xv 16 1 Sam xv 18 33 In the first of which places the reason of the delay of the punishment of the Araorites is given because their ini quity was not yet full In the second Saul is ordered to go and destroy the sinners the Amalekites plainly im as Moses had commanded Phineas who in deed came back bringing with its victorious army fifty two thousand beeves seventy five thousand six hundred sheep and sixty thou sand asses with an immense quantity of gold and silver furniture which the Midianites made use of in their houses for they were so wealthy that they were very luxurious There were also led captive aboutf thirty two thousand virgins So Moses divided the prey into parts and gave one fiftieth part to Eleazar and to the priests and another fiftieth part to the Levites and distributed the rest of the prey among the people After which they lived happily as having obtained an abundance of good things by their valour and there being no misfortune that attended them or hindered their enjoyment of that happiness Moses being now grown old appointed Joshua for his successor both to receive di rections from God as a prophet and for a commander of the army if they should at any time stand in need of such a one And this was done by the command of God that to him the care of the public should be com mitted Now Joshua had been instructed in all those kinds of learning which concerned the laws and God himself and Moses had been his instructor At this time the two tribes of Gad and Reubel and the half tribe of Manassehi abounded in a multitude of cattle as well as in all other kinds of prosperity whence they had a meeting and besought Moses to give them as their peculiar portion that land of the Amorites which they had taken by right of war because it was fruitful and for feed plying that they were therefore to be destroyed because they were sinners and not otherwise In the third the reason is given why king Agag was not to be spared viz because of his former cruelty As thy sword hath made the Hebrew women childless so shall thy mother be made childless among women by the Hebrews The Apostles also or their amanuensis Clement gives this reason of the necessity of the coming of Christ that men had formerly perverted both the positive law and that of nature and had cast out of their minds the memory of the flood the burning of Sodom the plagues of the Egyptians and the slaughter of the inhabitants of Palestine as signs of the most amazing impenitence and insensibility under the punishment of horrid wickedness Constitut Apoit viii 12 page 402 J Numb xxvii 22 Deut xxxiv 9 y 11 2 m BOOK IV AHfTlQUITIES OF THE TEWS ing cattle But MG3es supposing that they were afraid of fighting the Canaanitcs and invented this provision for their cattle as a handsome excuse for avoiding that war called them arrant cowards and said they had only contrived a decent excuse for their timi dity and that they had a mind to live in luxury and ease while all the rest were la bouring with great pains to obtain the land they were desirous to have and that they were not willing to undergo the remaining hard service whereby they were under the Divine promise to pass over Jordan and over come those enemies which God had shewed them and so obtain their land But these tribes when they saw that Moses was angry with them and when they could not deny but he had a just cause to be displeased at their petition made an apology for themselves and baid that it was not on account of their bar of danger nor on account of their indo lence that they made this request but that they might leave the prey they had gotten in places of safety and thereby might be more expeditious and ready to undergo difficulties and to fight battles They added also that when they had built cities wherein they might preserve their children and wives and possessions if he would bestow them upon them they would go along with the rest of the army Hereupon Moses called for Ele azar the high priest and Joshua and the chief of the tribes and permitted these tribes to possess the land of the Amorites but upon this condition that they should join with their kinsmen in the war until all things were set tled Upon which condition they took pos session of the country and built them strong cities and put into them their children and their wives and whatsoever else they had that might be an impediment to the labours of their future marches Moses also now built those ten cities which were to be of the number of forty eight for the Levites Three of these he allotted to those that slew any person involuntarily and fled to them and he assigned the same time for their banishment with that of the life of the high priest under whom the slaughter and flight happened after which he permitted  Numb xxxvi 2 et 8  From An 1532 to 1492 B C the slayer to return home the relations of him ihat were slain having the power to kill the slayer if they caught him without the bounds of the city to which he fled though this permission was not granted to any other person Now the cities which were set apart for this flight were Bezer at the borders of Arabia Ramoth of the land of Gilead and Golan in the land of Bashan There were to be also by Moses s command three other cities allotted for the habitation of these fu gitives out of the cities of the Levites but not till after they should be in possession oi the land of Canaan At this time the chief men of the tribe of Manasseh came to Moses and informed him that there was an eminent man of their tribe dead whose name was Zelophehad who had no male children but left daughters and asked him whether the daughters might in herit his land or not He made this answer that if they shall marry into their own tribe they shall carry their own estate along with them but if they shall marry to any of ano ther tribe they shall leave their inheritance in their father s tribe And then it was that Moses ordained that every one s inheritance should continue in his own tribe CHAP VIU OF THE POLITY SETTLES BY MOSES AND HIS DISAPPEARANCE FROM AMONG MANKIND WHENt forty years were completed within thirty days Moses gathered the congregation near Jordan where the city Abila now stands which place is full of palm trees and when all the people were come together he spake thus to them  O ye Israelites and fellow soldiers who have been partners with me in this long and toilsome journey Since now the will of God and the course of old age at an hundred and J twenty requires that I depart out of this life and since God has forbidden me to be a pa tron or an assistant to you in what remains to be done beyond Jordan I

tilings and a memorial for myself when you shall be in the fruition of great plenty and prosperity Let me therefore suggest to you by what means you may be happy and may leave an eternal prosperous possession to your children after you and then let me go out of the world And I cannot but deserve to be believed by you both on account of the great things I have already done for you and because when souls are about to leave the body they speak with the sincere st freedom O children of Israel there is but one source of happiness for all mankind the favour of God for he alone is able to give good things to those that deserve them and to deprive those of them that sin against him If you behave yourselves according to his will and according to what I who well understand his mind do advise you will both be esteemed blessed and will be admired by all men and will never come into misfortunes nor cease to be happy you will then preserve the pos session of the good things you already have and will quickly obtain those that you at pre sent are in want of Only be obedient to those whom God would have you to follow Nor prefer any other constitution of govern ment before the laws now given you neither disregard that way of Divine worship which you now have nor change it for any other form And if you do this you will be most courageous of all men in undergoing the fa tigues of war and will not be easily con quered by any of your enemies For while God is present to assist you it is to be ex pected that you will be able to despise the opposition of all mankind And great rewards of virtue are proposed to you if you preserve that virtue through your whole lives Itself is indeed the principal and the first reward and after that he bestows abundance of others So that your exercise of virtue to wards other men will make your own lives happy and render you more glorious than foreigners can be and procure you an un disputed reputation with posterity These blessings you will be able to obtain in case you hearken to and observe those laws which by divine revelation I have ordained for you that is in case you meditate upon the wisdom that is in them I am now going from you rejoicing in the good things you enjoy and I recommend you to the wise con duct of your law to the becoming order of your polity and to the virtues of your com manders who will take care of what is for your advantage And that God who has been till now your leader and by whose good will 1 have myself been useful to you will not put a period now to his providence over you but as long as you desire to have him your protector in your pursuits after virtue so long will you enjoy his care over you Your high priest also Eleazar as well as Joshua with the senate and chief of your tribes will go before you and suggest the best advices to you by following which advices you will continue to be happy to them therefore do you give ear without reluctance as sensible that all such that know well how to be go verned will also know how to govern if they be promoted to that authority themselves And do not you esteem liberty to consist in opposing such directions as your governors think fit to give you for your practice as at present indeed you place your liberty in nothing else but abusing your benefactors which error if you can avoid for the time to come your affairs will be in a better condi tion than they have hitherto been Nor do you ever indulge such a degree of passion in these matters as you have oftentimes done when you have been very angry at me for you know that I have been oftener in danger of death from you than from our enemies What I now put you in mind is not done in order to reproach you for I do not think it proper now I am going out of the world to bring this to your remembrance in order to leave you offended at me since at the time when I underwent those hardships I was not angry at you but I do it in order to make you wiser hereafter and to teach you that this will be for your security I mean that you never be injurious to those that preside over you even when you are become rich as you will be to a great degree when you have passed over Jordan and are in possession of  Josephus in this one sentence sums up his notion of Moses s very long and serious exhortations in the book of Deuteronomy And his words are so true and of such importance that they deserve to be had in constant re membrance both by Jews and Christians O children of Israel there is but one source of happiness for all man kind the favour of God  128 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the land of Canaan Since when you shall have once proceeded so far by your wealth as to a contempt and disregard of virtue you will also forfeit the favour of God and when you have made him your enemy you will be beaten in war and will have the land which you possess taken away again from you by your enemies and this with great reproaches upon your conduct You will be scattered over the whole world and will as slaves entirely fill both sea and land and when once you have had the experience of what I now say you will repent and remember the laws you have broken when it is too late Whence f would advise you if you intend to preserve these laws to leave none of your enemies alive when you have conquered them but to look upon it as for your advantage to destroy them all lest if you permit them to live you imbibe their manners and thereby corrupt your own proper institutions I also farther exhort you to overthrow their altars and their groves and whatsoever temples they have among them and to burn all such their na tion and their very memory with fire For by this means alone the safety of your own happy constitution can be firmly secured to you And in order to prevent your ignorance of virtue and the degeneracy of your nature into vice I have also ordained you laws by divine suggestion and a form of government which are so good that if you regularly ob serve them you will be esteemed of all men most happy When he had spoken thus he gave them the laws and the constitution of government written in a book Upon which the people fell into tears and appeared already touched with the sense that they should have a great want of their conductor because they re membered what a number of dangers he had passed through and what care he had taken for their preservation they desponded about what would come upon them after he was dead supposing they should never have another governor like him and fearing that God would take less care of them when Mo ses was gone who used to intercede for them They also repented of what they had said to him in the wilderness when they were angry and so were in grief on those accounts So that the whole body of the people fell into tears with such bitterness that it was past the power of words to comfort them in their afflic tion However Moses gave them some con solation and by calling them off the thought how worthy he was of their weeping for him he exhorted them to adhere to that form of government he had given them And then the congregation was dissolved at that time 1 shall now first describe this form of go vernment which was agreeable to the dignity and virtue of Moses and shall thereby in form those that peruse these Antiquities what our original settlements were and shall then proceed to the remaining histories Now these settlements are still in writing as he left them and we shall add nothing by way of ornament nor any thing besides what Mo ses left us Only we shall so far innovate as to digest the several kinds of laws into a regular system For they were by him left in writing as they were accidentally scat tered in their delivery and as he upon in quiry had learned them of God On which ac count I have thought it necessary to premise this observation lest any of my own country men should blame me as having been guilty of an offence herein Now part of our con stitution will include the laws that belong to our political state but with respect to those laws which Moses left concerning our com mon conversation and intercourse with one another 1 have reserved that for a dis course concerning our manner of life and the occasions of those laws which I pro pose to myself with God s assistance to write after I have finished the work I am now upon When you have possessed yourself of the land of Canaan and have leisure to enjoy the good things of it and when you have after ward determined to build cities if you will do what is pleasing to God you will have a secure state of happiness Let there be then one city of the land of Canaan and this situate in the most agreeable place for its goodness and very eminent of itself and let it be that which God shall choose for himself by prophetic revelation Let there also be one temple therein and one altar not reared of hewn stones but of such as you gather together at random which stones when they are whitened over with mortar will have a handsome appearance and be beautiful to an 1493 129 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the sight Let the ascent to it be not by steps but by an acclivity of raised earth And let there be neither an altar nor a tem ple in any other city For God is but one and the nation of the Hebrews is but one He that blasphemeth God let him be stoned f and let him hang upon a tree all that day and then let him be buried in an igno minious and obscure manner Let those that live as remote as the bounds of the land which the Hebrews shall possess come to that city where the temple shall be and this three timesJ every year that they may give thanks to God for his former bene fits and may entreat him for those they shall want hereafter and let them by this means maintain a friendly correspondence with one another with such meetings and feastings to gether For it is a good thing for those that are of the same stock and under the same institutions not to be unacquainted with each other which acquaintance will be maintained by thus conversing together and by seeing and talking with one another and so renew ing the memorials of this union for if they do not thus converse together continually they will appear like mere strangers to one ano ther Let there be taken out of your fruits a tenth besides that which you have allotted to give to the priests and Levites This you may indeed sell in the country but it is to be used in those feasts and sacrifices that are to be celebrated in the holy city For it is fit that you should enjoy the fruits of the earth which God gives you to possess so as may be to the honour of the donor You are not to offer sacrifices out of theÂ hire of a harlot for the Deity is not pleased with any thing that arises from such abuses of nature of which sort none can be worse than this prostitution of the body in like manner no one may take the price of the co vering of a bitch either of one that is used in hunting or in keeping of sheep and thence sacrifice to God Let no oneff blaspheme the godsJJ which other cities esteem such Nor may one steal what belongs to strange temples nor take away the gitts that are dedicated to any god Let not any one of you wear a garment made of woollen and linen for that is ap pointed to be for the priests only When the multitude are assembled together unto the holy city for sacrificing every se venth year at the feast of tabernacles let the high priest stand upon a high desk whence he might be heard and let him read the laws to allÂ Â the people And let neither women children nor servants be hindered from hearing For it is a good thing that those laws should be engraven in their souls and preserved in their memories that so it may not be possible to blot them out For by this means they will not be guilty of sin when they cannot plead ignorance of what the laws have enjoined them The laws also will have a great authority among them as foretelling what they will suffer if they break them and imprinting in their souls by this hearing what they command them to do That so there may always be within their minds that intention of the laws which they have despised and broken and have thereby been the causes of their own mischief Let the children also learn the laws as the first  This law both here and Exod xx 25 26 of not going up to God s altar by ladder steps but on an accli vity  seems not to have belonged to the altar of the taber nacle which was in all but three cubits high Exod xxvii 1 nor to that of Ezekiel which was expressly to be gone up to by steps xliii 17 but rather to occasional altars of any considerable altitude and largeness as also probably to Solomon s altar to which it is here applied by Josephus as well as that of Zorobabel s and Herod s temple which were I think all ten cubits high See 2 Chron iv 1 and Joseph Antiq VIII 3 And the reason why these temples and these only were to have this as cent on an acclivity and not by steps is obvious that be fore the invention of stairs such as we now use decency could not be otherwise provided for in the loose garments which the priests wore as the law required See Lamy of the Tabernacle and Temple p 444 t Levit xxiv 86 J Exod xxiii 14 Deut xvi 16 II Levit xxvii 30 Â The hire of public harlots was given to Venus in Syria as Lucian informs us page 878 And against some such vile practice of the old idolaters this law seems to have been made  Deut xxiii 18 tt The Apostolical Constitutions II expound this law of Moses Exod xxii 28 Thou shaltnot revile or blas pheme the gods of magistrates which is a much more probable exposition than this of Josephus of Heathen gods t Exod xxii 28 IIII Levit xix 19 Â Â What book of the law was thus publicly read see the note on X 5 and 1 Esd Ix 60â 55 130 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS thing they arc taught which will be the best thing they can be taught and will be cause of their future felicity Let every one commemorate before God the benefits which he bestowed upon them at their deliverance out of the land of Egypt and this twice every day both when the day begins and when the hour of sleep comes Gratitude being in its own nature a just thing and serving not only by way of return for ast but also by way of invitation of future avours They are also to inscribe the prin cipal blessings they have received from God upon their doors and shew the same remem brance of them on their arms t as also they are to bear on their forehead and their arm those wonders which declare the power of God and his good will towards them that God s readiness to bless them may appear every where conspicuous about them J Let there be seven men to judge in every city Â and these such as have been before most zealous in the exercise of virtue and righteousness Let every judge have two officers allotted bim out of the tribe of Levi Let those that are chosen to judge in the several cities be had in great honour and let none be permitted to revile any others when these are present nor to carry them selves in an insolent manner to them It be ing natural that reverence towards those in high offices among men should procure men s fear and reverence towards God Let those that judge be permitted to determine accord ing as they think right unless any one can shew that they have taken bribes to the per version of justice or can ailedge any other accusation against them whereby it may ap pear that they have passed an unjust sen  Deut xxxi 12 t Whether these phylacteries and other Jewish me morials of the law here mentioned by Josephus and by Moses besides the fringes on the border of their gar ments Numb xv 37 were literally meant by God I much question That they have been long observed by the Pharisees and the Rabbinical Jews is certain How ever the Karaites who receive not the underwritten tra ditions of the elders but keep close to the written law with Jerome and Grotius think they were not literally to be understood as Bernard and Reland here take notice Nor indeed do I remember that either in the ancienter books of the Old Testament or in the books we call Apo crypha there are any signs of such literal observations appearing among the Jews Though their real or mys tical signification i e the constant remembrance and ob tence For it is not fit that causes should be openly determined out of regard to gain or to the dignity of the suitors but that the judges should esteem what is right before all other things for otherwise God will be des pised and esteemed inferior to those the dread of whose power has occasioned the un just sentence For justice is the power of God he therefore that gratifies those in great dignity supposes them more potent than God himself But if these judges are unable to give a just sentence about the causes that come before them which case is not unfre quent in human affection let them send the cause undetermined to the holy city and there let the high priest the prophet and the Sanhedrim determine as shall seem good to them But let not a single witness be credited but three or two at the least and those such whose testimony is confirmed by their good lives But let not the testimony offt women be admitted on account of the levity and boldness of their sex Nor let servants be admitted to give testimony on account of their ignoble spirit since it is probable they may not speak truth either out of hope of gain or fear of punishment But if any one be believed to have borne false witness let him when he is convicted suffer all the same punishments which he against whom he bore witness was to have suffered If a murder be committed in any place and he that did it be not found nor is there any suspicion upon one as if he had hated the man and so had killed him let there be a very diligent inquiry made after the man and rewards proposed to any that will disco ver him But if no information can be pre servation of the lawsof God and Moses be frequently in culcated in all the sacred writings X Numb xv 38 39 II Here as well as Of the War n 20 are but seven judges appointed for small cities instead of twenty thiee in the modern Rabbins which modern Rabbins are always but of very Htde authority in comparison of Josephus Â Deut xvi 18  I have never observed elsewhere that in the Jewish government women were not admitted as legal witnesses in courts of Justice None of our copies of the Penta teuch say a word of it It is very probable however that this was an exposition of the Scribes and Pharisees and the practice of the Jews in the days of Josephus tt Deut xvii 6  an 1493 131 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS cured let the magistrates and senate of those cities that lie near the place in which the murder was committed assemble together and measure the distance from the place where the dead body lies then let the ma gistrate of the nearest city purchase a heifer and bring it to a valley and to a place therein where there is no land ploughed or trees planted and let them cut the sinews of the heifer then the priests and Levites and senate of that city shall take water and wash their hands over the head of the heifer and they shall openly declare that their hands are innocent of this murder and that they have neither done it themselves nor been assisting to any that did it They shall also beseech God to be merciful to them that no such horrid fact may any more be done in that land Aristocracy and the way of living under it is the best constitution And may you never have any inclination to any other form of go vernment and may you always love that form and have the laws for your governors and govern all your laws according to them For you need no supreme governor but God But if you shall desire a king let him be one of your ownt nation let him be always care ful of justice and other virtues perpetually let him submit to the laws and esteem God s commands to be his highest wisdom But let him do nothing without the high priest and the votes of the senators let him not have a great number of wives nor presume abun dance of riches nor a multitude of horses whereby he may grow too proud to submit to the laws And ii he affect any such things let him be restrained lest he become so po tent that his state be inconsistent with your welfare Let it not be esteemed lawful to remove boundaries neither our own nor of those with whom we are at peace Be careful that you do not take thoseJ landmarks away  Dent xxi 1â 9 t Dent xvii 16 j Deut xix 14 It was the common practice both with the Hebrews and with the Romans to erect landmarks to distinguish the boundaries of particular estates and in setting apart land for any use they erected a pillar upon which was marked its length and breadth From many ancient inscriptions it is evident that the Romans added the following letters H M H N S Hoc monumentum ha redes non sequitur See Horace b i sat viii 12 voL I NOS 11  12 which are as it were a divine and unshaken limitation of rights made by God himself to last for ever since this going beyond limits and gaining ground upon others is the occa sion of wars and seditions for those that re move boundaries are not far off an attempt U subvert the laws He that plants a piece of land whose trees produce fruits before the fourth year is not to bring thence any first fruits to God nor is he to make use of that fruit himself for it is not produced in its proper season For when nature has a force put upon it at an unseason able time the fruit is not proper for God nor for the master s use but let the owner gather all that is grown on the fourth year for then it is in its proper season And let him that has gathered it carry it to the holy city and spend that together with the tythe of his other fruits in feasting with his friends with the orphans and the widows But on the filth year the fruit is his own and he may use it as he pleases  You are not to sow a piece of land with seed which is planted with vines for it is enough that it supply nourishment to that plant and be not harassed by ploughing also You are to plough your land with oxen and not to oblige other animals to come under the same yoke with them but to till your land with those beasts that are of the same kind with each other The seeds are also to be pure and without mixture and not to be com pounded of two or three sorts since nature does not rejoice at the union of things that are not in their own nature alike nor are you to permit beasts of different kinds to gender together Â For there is reason to fear that this unnatural abuse may extend from beasts of different kinds to men though it takes its first rise from evil practices about such smaller things Nor is any thing to be allowed by imitation whereof any degree of subversion may creep into the constitution The heathens had a deity called Jupiter Terminalig ap pointed to preside over bounds and landmarks Numa Pompilius appointed stones to be set as bounds to every man s land and dedicated them to Jupiter Terminalis He ordered that those who removed them should be slain as sacrilegious persons and they and their oxen devoted to destruction B I Levit xix 25 Â Levit xix 19 Kk 132 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Nor do the laws neglect smaller matters but provide that even those be managed after an Unblameahle manner Let not those that reap and gather in the corn that is reaped gather in the gleanings also but let them rather leave some handfuls for those that are in want of the necessaries of life that it may be a support and a supply to them in order to their subsistence In like mariner when they gather their grapes let them leave some smaller bunches for the poor and let them pass over some of the fruits of the olive trees when they gather them and leave them to be partaken by those that have none of their own For the advantages arising from the exact collection of all will not be so considerable to the owners as will arise from the gratitude of the poor And God will provide that thejand shall more wil lingly produce what shall be for the nourish ment of its fruits in case you do not merely take care of your own advantage but have regard to the support of others also Nor are you to muzzle the mouths of the oxen when they tread the ears of corn in the threshing floor f for it is not just to restrain our fellow labouring animals and those that work in order to its production of this fruit of their labours Nor are you to prohibit those that pass by at the time when your fruits are ripe to touch them but to give them leave to fill themselves full of what you have and this whether they be of your own country or strangers as being glad of the opportunity of giving them some part of your fruits when they are ripe But let it not be esteemed lawful for them to carry any a way 4 Nor let those that gather the grapes and carry them to the wine presses restrain those whom they meet from eating of them For it is unjust out of envy to hinder those that desire it to partake of the good things that come into the world according to God s will and this while the season is at the height and is hastening away as it pleases God Nay if some out of bashfulness are unwilling to touch these fruits let them be encouraged to take of them I mean those that are Israelites as if they were themselves the owners and lords on account of the kindred there is between them Nay let them desire men that come from other countries to partake of these tokens of friend ship which God has given in their proper season For that is not to be deemed as idly spent which any one out of kindness commu nicates to another Since God bestows plenty of good things on men not only for themselves to reap the advantage but also to give to others in a way of generosity and he is de sirous by this means to make known to others his peculiar kindness to the people of Israel and how freely he communicates happiness to them while they abundantly communicate out of their great superfluities to even these foreigners also But for him that acts con trary to this law let him be beaten with forty stripes save one by the public execu tioner let him undergo this punishment which is a most ignominious one for a free man and this because he was such a slave to gain as to lay a plot upon his own dignity For it is proper for you who have had the ex perience of the afflictions of Egypt and of those in the wilderness to make provision for those that are in the like circumstance and while you have now obtained plenty your selves through the mercy and providence of God to distribute of the same plenty to such as stand in need of it Besides those two tithes which I have already said you are to pay every year one to the Levites the other for the festivals you are to bring every third year a third tithe to be distributed to those that want them Â to women also that are widows and to children that are orphans but as to the fruits let them carry that which is ripe first of all unto the temple and when they have blessed God for that land which bare them and which he had given them for a possession when they have also offered those sacrifices which the law has commanded them to bring let them  Deut xxiv 20 t Deut xxv 4 I Deut xxiii 24 II This penalty of forty stripes save one was five times inflicted on St Paul by the Jews 2 Cor xi 34 Â Tosephus s plain and express interpretation of this law of Moses Deut xiv 28 29 c that the Jews were bound every third year to pay three tithes that to the Levites that for sacrifices at Jerusalem and this for the indigent the widow rnd the orphans is fully confirmed by the practice of good old Tobit even when he was a captive at Assyria against the opinion of the UabbinÂ Tobit i 6 7 8  Deut xxvi 12 an 1492 133 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS give the first fruits to the priests But when any one hath done this and hath brought the tithe of all that he hath together with those first fruits that are for the Levites and for the festivals and when he is about to go home let him stand before the holy house and re turn thanks to God that he hath delivered them from the injurious treatment they had in Egypt and hath given them a good land and permits them to enjoy the fruits thereof and when he has openly testified that he hath fully paid the tithes and other dues accord ing to the law of Moses let him intreat God that he will be ever merciful and gracious to him and continue to be so to all the Hebrews both by preserving the good things he hath already given them and by adding what is still in his power to bestow Let the Hebrews marry at a proper age virgins that are free and born of good parents And he that does not marry a virgin let him not corrupt another man s wife and marry her nor grieve her former husband Nor let free men marry slaves although their af fections should strongly bias any of them so to do for it is decent and for the dignity of the persons themselves to govern such affections And farther no one ought to marry a harlot whose matrimonial oblations arising from prostitution God will not receive For by these means the dispositions of the children will be liberal and virtuous I mean when they are not born of base parents and of the conjunction of such as marry women that are not free If any one has been espoused to a woman as to a virgin and does not afterward find her so to be let him bring his action and accuse her and let him make use of such in dications to prove his accusation as he is fur nished withal And let the father or the bro ther of the damsel or some one that is after the nearest kin to her defend her And if the damsel obtain a sentence in her favour that she had not been guilty let her live with her husband that accused her And let him not have any farther power at all to put her away unless she give him very great occa sion of suspicion and such as can no way be contradicted But for him that brings an ac cusation and calumny against his wife in an  These words of Josephus are very like those of the Pharisees to our Saviour upon this very subject Matthew impudent and rash manner let him be pu nished by receiving forty stripes save one and let him pay fifty shekels to her father but if the damsel be convicted as having been corrupted and is one of the common people let her be stoned because she did not preserve her chastity till she were law fully married but if she were the daughter of a priest let her be burnt alive If any one hath two wives and if he greatly respect and be kind to one of them either of his affection to her or for her beauty or for some other reason while the other is of less esteem with him and if the son of her that is beloved be the younger by birth than another born of the other wife but endeavours to obtain the right of primogeniture from his father s kindness to his mother and would thereby obtain a double portion of his father s substance for that double portion is what I have allotted him in the laws let not this be permitted For it is unjust that he who is the elder by birth should be deprived of what is due to him on the father s disposition of his estate because his mother was not equally regarded by him He that hath corrupted a damsel espoused to another man in case he had her consent let both him and her be put to death for they are both equally guilty the man because ho persuaded the woman willingly to submit to an impure action and to prefer it to lawful wedlock the woman because she was per suaded to yield herself to be corrupted either for pleasure or for gain However if a man meet with a woman when she is alone and force her where nobody is present to conic to her assistance let him only be put to death Let him that hath corrupted a virgin not yet espoused marry her but if the father of the damsel be not willing she should be his wife let him pay fifty shekels as the price of her prostitution He that desires to be divorced from his wife for any cause what soever and many such causes happen among men let him in writing give assurance that he will never use her as nis wife any more for by this means she may be at liberty to marry another husband although before this bill of divorce be given she is not to be permitted so to do But if she be misused by him also xix 3 Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause Kk2 134 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS or if when he is dead her first husband would marry her again it shall not be lawful for her to return to him If a woman s husband die and leave her without children let his brother marry her and let him call the son that is born to him by his brother s name and edu cate him as the heir of his inheritance for this procedure will be for the benefit of the public because thereby families will not fail and the estate will continue among the kin dred and this will be for the solace of wives under their affliction that they are to be mar ried to the next relations of their former hus bands But if the brother will not marry her let the woman come before the senate and protest openly that his brother will not admit her for his wife but will injure the memory of his deceased brother while she is willing to continue in the family and to bear him children And when the senate have enquired of him for what reason it is that he is averse to this marriage whether he gives a bad or good reason the matter must come to this issue that the woman shall loose the sandals of the brother and shall spit in his face and say  He deserves this reproachful treatment as having injured the memory of the de ceased And then let him go away out of the senate and bear this reproach upon him all his life long and let her marry to whom she pleases of such as seek her in marriage But if any man take captive either a virgin or one that hath beenf married and has a mind to marry her let him not be allowed to bring her to his bed or to live with her as his wife before she hath her head shaven and hath put on her mourning habit and lamented her relations and friends that were slain in the battle that by this means she may give vent to her sorrow for them and after that may betake herself to feasting and matri mony for it is good for him who takes a wo man in order to have children by her to be complaisant to her inclinations and not merely to pursue his own pleasure while he hath no regard to what is agreeable to her But when thirty days are past as the time of mourning for so many are sufficient for prudent per sons for lamenting the dearest friends then let them proceed to the marriage But in case when he hath gratified his desires he be too proud to retain her for his wife let him not have it in his power to make her a slave but let her go away whither she pleases and have that privilege of a free woman J As to those young men that despise their parents and do not pay them honour but offer them affronts either because they are ashamed of them or think themselves wiser than they In the first place let their parents admonish them in words for they are by nature of authority sufficient for becoming their judges and let them say thus to them That they cohabited together not for the sake of pleasure nor for the augmentation of their riches by joining both their stocks to gether but that they might have children to take care of them in their old age and might by them have what they then should want and say farther to him  When thou wast born we took thee up with gladness and gave God the greatest thanks for thee and brought thee up with great care and spared for nothing that appeared useful for thy preservation and for thy instruction in what was most excellent And now since it is reasonable to forgive the sins of those that are young let it suffice thee to have given so many indications of thy con many other customs of that ancient people in common with the inhabitants of Syria and with the Arabians in general  Deut xxv 5 From this ancient custom the Athe uians appear to have that remarkable law that no heiress must marry out of her kindred but shall resign up her self and fortune to her nearest relations and by the same law the nearest relation was obliged to marry her Pot ter s Gr Ant vol i p 159 Among the modern eastern nations we still meet with the law or custom of marrying the brother s widow Thus Olearius Ambassador s Travels into Persia p 417 Eng edit informs us concerning the Circassians When a man dies without issue his brother is obliged to marry the widow to raise up seed to him Volney Voyage en Syrie tom ii p 74 observes that the Druzes re tain to a certain degree the custom of the Hebrews which directed a man to marry his brother s widow but this is not peculiar to them for they have this as well as Amongst the Arabians if a father left one or more widows the sons often marry them provided they were not their own mothers This usage was suppressed by Mohammed and before this time it was marked with a degree of detestation Lord Haile s Annals of Scotland p 39 informs us that this custom prevailed in Scotland so late as the eleventh century and he supposes that it might have originated from avarice in order to relieve the heir from the payment of a jointure B t Here it was supposed that this captive s husband if she were before a married woman was dead before or rather was slain in this battle Otherwise it would have been adultery in him that married her t Deut xxi 14 an 1492 135 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tempt of us reform thyself and act more wisely for the time to come Considering that God is displeased with those that are inso lent towards their parents because he is himself the Father of the whole race of man kind and seems to bear part of that disho nour which falls upon those that have the same name when they do not meet with due returns from their children And on such the law inflicts inexorable punishment of which punishment mayst thou never have the expe rience Now if the insolence of young men be thus cured let them escape the reproach which their former errors deserved for by this means the lawgiver will appear to be good and parents happy while they never behold either a son or a daughter brought to punishment But if it happen that these words and the instructions conveyed by them in order to reclaim the man appear to be useless then the offender renders the law an implacable enemy to the insolence he has offered his parents Let him therefore be brought forth by these very parents out of the city with a multitude following him and let him be stoned f and when he has con tinued there for one whole day that all the people may see him let him be buried in the night And thus it is that we bury all whom the laws condemn to die upon any account whatsoever Let our enemies that fall in battle be also buried nor let any one dead body lie above ground or suffer a punishment beyond what justice requires Let no one lend to any of the Hebrews upon usury neither usury of what is eaten or what is drank J For it is not just to make advantage of the misfortunes of one of thy own countrymen but when thou hast admi nistered to his necessities think it thy gain if thou obtainest his gratitude to thee and withal that reward which will come to thee from God for thy humanity towards him Those who have borrowed either silver or any sort of fruits whether dry or wet I mean this when the Jewish affairs shall by the blessing of God be to their own mind let the borrowers bring them again and restore them with pleasure to those who lent them  See Herod the Great insisting on the execution of this law with relation to two of his own sous before the judges at Berytus t Deut xxi 21 laying them up as it were in their own trea suries and justly expecting to receive them thence if they shall want them again But if they be without shame and do not restore it let not the lender go to the borrower s house and take a pledge himself before judgment be given concerning it but let him require the pledge and let the debtor bring it of him self without the least opposition to him that comes upon him under the protection of the law And if he that gave the pledge be rich let the creditor retain it till what ne lent be paid him again but if he be poor let him that takes it return it before the going down of the sun especially if the pledge be a garment that the debtor may have

pay double If any one kill a man that is stealing something out of his house let him be esteemed guiltless although the man were only breaking in at the wall Let him that hath stolen cattle pay fourfold what is lost excepting the case of an ox for which let the thief pay fivefold Let him that is so poor that he cannot pay what mulct is laid upon him be his servant to whom he was adjudged to pay it If any one be sold to one of his own nation let him serve him six years and on the se venth let him go free But if he have a son by a woman servant in his purchaser s house and if on account of his good will to his mas ter and his natural affection to his wife and children he will be his servant still let him be set free only at the coming of the year of Jubilee which is the fiftieth year

loss of another And the same rule is to be observed in cattle found to have wandered away into a lonely place If the owner be not presently discovered let him that is the finder keep it with himself and appeal to God that he has not purloined what belongs to another It is not lawful to pass by any beast that is in distress when in a storm it is fallen down in the mire but to endeavour to preserve it as having a sympathy with it in its pain t It is also a duty to shew the roads to those who do not know them and not to esteem it a matter of sport when we hinder other s ad vantage by setting them in a wrong way In like manner let no one revile a person blind or dumb J If men strive together and there be no in strument of iron let him that is smitten be avenged immediately by inflicting the same punishment on him that smote him But if when he is carried home he lie sick many days and then die let him that smote him escape punishment but if he that is smitten escape death and yet be at great expense for his cure the smiter shall pay for all that has been expended during the time of his sickness and for all that he has paid the phy sician I He that kicks a pregnant woman so that sheÂ miscarry let him pay a fine of money as the judges shall determine as having diminished the multitude by the de struction of her offspring and let money also be given the woman s husband by him that kicked her but if she die of the stroke let him also be put to death the law judging it equitable that life should go for life Let no one of the Israelites keep any poi son that may cause death or any other harm but if he be caught with it let him be put to death and suffer the same mischief that he would have brought upon them for whom the poison was prepared He that maimeth any one let him undergo the same himself and be deprived of the same member of which he hath deprived the other tt unless he that is maimed will accept of money instead of it For the law makes the sufferer the judge of the value of which he has suffered and permits him to estimate it unless he will be more severe Let him that is the owner of an ox which pusheth with his horn kill him but if he push and gore any one in the threshing floor let him be put to death by stoning and let him not be thought fit for food But if his owner be convicted as having known what his na ture was and hath not kept him up let him also be put to death as being the occasion of the ox s having killed a man f But if the ox have killed a man servant or a maid ser vant let him be stoned and let the owner of the ox pay thirty

prevent any person from rolling down and perishing Let him that has received any thing in trust for another take care to keep it sacred and let no one invent any contrivance whereby to deprive him that hath intrusted it with him of the same and this whether it be a man or a woman no not although he or she were to gain an immense sum of gold and this where he cannot be convicted of it by any body for it is fit that a man s own conscience which knows what he hath should in all cases oblige him to do well Let his conscience be his witness and make him always act so as may Etrocure him commendations from others and et him chiefly have regard to God from whom no wicked man can lie concealed But if he in whom the trust was reposed without any deceit of his own lose what he was in trusted withal let him come before the seven judges and swear by God that nothing hath been lost willingly or with a wicked inten tion and that he hath not made use of any part thereof And so let him depart without blame But if he hath made use of the least f art of what was committed to him and it be ost let him be condemned to repay all that he had received after the same manner as in these trusts it is to be if any one defraud those that undergo bodily labour for him And let it be always remembered that we are not to defraud a poor man of his wages as be ing sensible that God has allotted that wages to him instead of land and other possessions Nay this payment is not at all to be delayed but to be made that very day f since God is not willing to deprive the labourer of the im mediate use of what he hath laboured for You are not to punish children for he faults of their parents J but on account of their own virtue rather to vouchsafe them commisera tion because they were born of wicked pa rents than hatred because they were born of bad ones Nor indeed ought we to impute the sin of children to their fathers while young persons indulge themselves in many practices different from those they have been instructed in and this by their refusal of such instruction  Exod xxii 7 11 f Â evit xix 13 Deut xxiv 14 16 i I eÂ t xxiv 16 Let those that have made themselves eu nuchs be had in detestation and do you avoid any conversation with them who have deprived themselves of their manhood and of that which God had given to men for the increase of their kind Let such be driven away as if they had killed their children since they beforehand have lost what should procure them For it is evident that while their soul is become effeminate they have withal transfused that effeminacy to their body also In like manner do you treat all that is of a monstrous nature when it is looked on Nor is it lawful to castrate either men or any other animals Â Let this be the constitution of your political laws in times of peace and God will be so merciful as to preserve this excellent settle ment free from disturbance And may that time never come which may innovate any thing and change it for the contrary but since it must needs happen that mankind fall into troubles and dangers either undesign edly or intentionally let us make a few con stitutions concerning them that so being ap prised beforehand what ought to be done you may have salutary counsels ready when you want them and may not then be obliged to seek what is to be done and so be unpro vided and fall into dangerous circumstances May you be a laborious people and exercise your souls in virtuous actions and thereby possess and inherit the land without wars while neither any foreigners make war upon it and SO afflict you nor any internal sedition seize upon it whereby you may do things that are contrary to your fathers and so lose the laws which they have established And may you continue in the observance of those laws which God hath approved and hath de livered to you Let all sort of warlike opera tions whether they befall you now in your own time or hereafter in the times of your posterity be done out of your own borders But when you are about to go to war send ambassages and heralds to those who are your voluntary enemies for it is a right thing to make use of words to them before you come to your weapons of war and assure them II Deut xxiii 1 â Â We may hence observe that the Jews could have no oxen but only bulls and cows in Judea 138 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS thereby that although you have a numerous army with horses and weapons and above these a God merciful to you and ready to assist you you do however desire them not to compel you to fight against them nor to take from them what they have which will indeed be our gain but what they will have no reason to wish we should take to ourselves And if they hearken to you it will be proper for you to keep peace with them but if they trust on their own strength as superior to yours and will not do you justice lead your army against them making use of God as your supreme commander but ordaining as a lieutenant under him one that is of the great est courage among you For these different commanders besides their being an obstacle to actions that are to be done on the sudden are a disadvantage to those that make use of them Lead an army pure and of chosen men composed of all such as have extraor dinary strength of body and hardiness of soul but send away the timorous part lest they flee in the time of action and so afford an advantage to your enemies Do you also give leave to those that have lately built them houses and have not yet lived in them a year s time and to those that have planted them vineyards and have not been yet partakers of their fruits to continue in their own coun try as well as to those also who have be trothed or lately married wives lest they have such an affection for these things that they be too sparing of their lives and by re serving themselves for these enjoyments they become voluntary cowards When you have pitched your camp take care that you do nothing that is cruel and when you are engaged in a siege and want timber for making warlike engines do not render the land naked by cutting down trees that bear fruit but spare them as consider ing that they were made for the benefit of men and that if they could speak they would have a just plea against you because though they are not occasions of the war they are unjustly treated and suffer in it and would if they were able remove themselves into another land When you have beaten your enemies in battle slay those that have fought against you but preserve the others alive that they may pay you tribute excepting the nation of the Canaanites for as to that people you must entirely destroy them Take care especially in your battles that no woman use the habit of a man nor man the garment of a woman f This was the form of political government which was left us by Moses Moreover he hadJ already delivered laws in writing in the fortieth year after they came out of Egypt concerning which we will discourse in ano ther book But now on the following days for he called them to assemble continually he delivered blessings to them and curses upon those that should not live according to the laws but should transgress the duties that were determined for them to observe After this he read to them a poetic song which was composed in hexameter verse and left it to them in the holy book it contained a prediction of what was to come to pass after ward agreeably whereto all things have hap pened all along and do still happen to us and wherein he has not at all deviated from the truth Accordingly he delivered these books to the priests with the ark into which he also put the Ten Commandments written in two tables He also delivered to them the tabernacle and exhorted the peo ple that when they had conquered the land and were settled in it they should not forget the injuries of the Amalekites Â but make war against them and inflict punishment upon  Deut xx 7 i Deut xxii 5 Deut xxii 5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a wo man s garment This prohibitory law seems directed against an idolatrous usage which appears to be as ancient as Moses and which later writers inform us was to be found among several nations in after times and that too attended with the most abominable practices From Plu tarch De Isid et Osir tom ii p 368 edit Xylandr we learn that thp Egyptians called the moon the mother of the world and assigned to her a nature both male and ft  male and Boyse Pantheon p 72 says of Diana Luna or the moon that the Egyptians worshipped this deity both as male and female the men sacrificing to it as Luna the women as Lunus and each sex on these occasions assuming the dress of the other Parkhurst s Heb Lex p 107 B J These laws seem to be those previously recited in this chapter I I What laws were now delivered to the priests see the note on HI 1  Â Â Deut xxv 1 an 1492 139 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them for what mischief they did them when they were in the wilderness and that when they had got possession of the land of the Canaanites and when they had destroyed the whole multitude of its inhabitants as they ought to do they should erect an altar that should face the rising sun not far from the city Shechem between the two mountains that of Gerizim situate on the right hand and that called Ebal on the left and that the army should be divided that six tribes should stand upon each of the two mountains and with them the Levites and the priests And that first those that were upon mount Gerizim should pray for the best blessings upon those who were diligent about the wor ship of God and the observance of his laws and who did not reject what Moses had said to them while the other wished them all manner of happiness also And when these last put up the like prayers the former praised them After this curses were de nounced upon those who should transgress those laws they answering one another alter nately by way of confirmation of what had been said Moses also wrote their blessings and their curses that they may learn them so thoroughly that they might never be for gotten by length of time And when he was ready to die he wrote these blessings and curses upon the altar on each side of it where he says also the people stood and then sacrificed and offered burnt offerings though after that day they never offered upon it any other sacrifice for it was not lawful so to do These are the constitutions of Moses and the Hebrew nation still live according to them On the next day Moses called the people together with the women and children to a congregation so as the very slaves were pre sent also that they might engage themselves to the observance of these laws by oath and that duly considering the meaning of God in them they might not either for favour of their kindred or out of fear of any one or indeed for any motive whatsoever think any thing ought to be preferred to these laws and so  Deut xxvii 12 t Dr Bernard well observes here how unfortunate this neglect of consulting the Urim was to Joshua himself in the case of the Gibeonites who put a trick npon him and ensnared him together with the rest of the Jewish rulers with a solemn oath to preserve them contrary to voL I â NOS 11  12 might transgress them that in case any one of their own blood or any city should at tempt to confound or dissolve their constitu tion of government they should take ven geance upon them both all in general and each person in particular and when they had conquered them should overturn their city to the very foundations and if possible should not leave the least vestige of such madness but if they were not able to take such vengeance they should still demonstrate that what was done was contrary to their wills So the multitude bound themselves by oath so to do Moses taught them also by what means their sacrifices might be most acceptable to God and how they should go forth to war making use off the stones in the high priest s breast plate for their direction as I have before sig nified Joshua also prophesiedJ while Moses was present And when Moses had recapitu lated whatsoever he had done for the preser vation of the people both in their wars and in peace and had composed them a body of laws and procured them an excellent form of government he foretold as God had declared to him that if they transgressed that institu tion for the worship of God they should ex perience the following miseries their land should be full of weapons of war from their enemies their cities should be overthrown and their temple should be burnt that they should be sold for slaves to such men as would have no pity on them in their afflic tions and that they would repent when that repentance would no way profit them under their sufferings Yet said he will that God who founded your nation restore your cities to your citizens with their temple also and you shall lose these advantages not once only but often Now when Moses had encouraged Joshua to lead out the army against the Canaanites by telling him that God would assist him in all his undertakings and had blessed the whole multitude he said Since T am going to my forefathers and God has determined his commission to extirpate all the Canaanites which oath yet he and the other rulers never durst break And this snare they were brought into because they did not ask counsel at the moutb of the Lord Josh ix 14 I Deut  xxxiv 9 LI 140 book IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS that this should be the day of my departure to them I return him thanks while 1 am still alive and present with you for that provi dence he hath exercised over you which hath not only delivered us from the miseries they lay under but hath bestowed a state of pros perity among us as also that he hath assisted me in the pains I took and in all the contri vances I had in my care about you in order to better your condition and hath on all oc casions shewed himself favourable to us Or rather he it was who first conducted our af fairs and brought them to a happy conclu sion by making use of me as a general un der him and as a minister in those matters wherein he was willing to do you good On which accounts I think it proper to bless that divine power which will take care of you for the time to come and this in order to repay that debt which I owe him and to leave be hind me a memorial that we are obliged to worship and honour him and to keep those laws which are the most excellent gift of all those he hath already bestowed upon us or which if he continue favourable to us he will bestow upon us hereafter Certainly a hu man legislator is a terrible enemy when his laws are affronted and are made to no pur Sose And may you never experience that ispleasure of God which will be the conse quence of the neglect of those laws which he who is your Creator hath given you When Moses had spoken thus at the end of his life and had foretold what would be fall every one of their tribes afterward with the addition of a blessing to them the multi tude fell into tears insomuch that even the women by beating their breasts evinced the deep concern they had when he was about to die The children also lamented still more as not able to contain their grief and thereby declared that even at their age they were sensible of his virtue and mighty deeds and truly there seemed to be a strife between the young and the old who should most grieve for him The aged grieved because they knew what a careful protector they were to be deprived of and so lamented their future state but the young grieved not only for that but also because it so happened that they were to be left by him before they had well tasted of his virtue Now one may form some idea of the excess of this sorrow and la mentation of the multitude from what hap pened to the legislator himself For although he was always persuaded that he ought not to be cast down at the approach of death since the undergoing it was agreeable to the will of God and the law of nature yet what the people did so affected him that he wept himself Now as he went thence to the place where he was to vanish out of their sight they all followed after him weeping But Moses beckoned with his hand to those that were remote from him and bid them stay be hind in quiet while he exhorted those that were near him that they would not render his departure so lamentable Whereupon they thought it their duty to let him depart according as he desired so they restrained themselves though weeping still towards one another All those who accompanied him were the senate and Eleazar the high priest and Joshua their commander Now as soon as they were come to the mountain called Abarim which is a very high mountain situ ate over against Jericho and one that affords to such as are upon it a prospect of the great est part of the excellent land of Canaan he dismissed the senate and as he was going to embrace Eleazar and Joshua and was still discoursing with them a cloud suddenly over shadowed him and he disappeared in a cer tain valley t although he wrote in the holy books that he died which was done out of fear lest they should venture to say that be  Since Josephus assures us here as is most naturally to be supposed and as the Septuagint gives the text Deut xxxiii 6 that Moses blessed every one of the tribes of Israel it is evident that Simeon was not omitted in his copy as it unhappily now is both in our Hebrew and Sa maritan copies t Deut xrxiv 6 But notwithstanding all this pre caution of God the Christians boast that they have dis covered the sepulchre which had been kept secret for so many ages For in the year 1655 some goats that were separated from the rest of the flock went to feed in a cer tain place in the mountain Nebo and returned from thence so odoriferous and perfumed that the shepherds asto nished at so wonderful a prodigy ran presently to consult with the patriarch of the Maronites who sent thither two monks from mount Lebanon and they discovered a monu ment on which was this inscription Moses the servant of the Lord But there is too much reason to think that this is all a fiction on purpose to raise the reputation of the Maronites as Basnage in his History and Religion of the Jews has sufficiently proved lib 4 cap 17 B an 1492 141 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS cause of his extraordinary virtue he went to God Now Moses lived in all one hundred and twenty years a third part of which time abating one month he was the people s ruler And he diedf in the last month of the year which is called by the Macedonians Dystrus but by us Adar on the first day of the month He was one that exceeded all men in under standing and made the best use of what that understanding suggested to him He had a very pleasing way of speaking and addressing the multitude and as to his other qualifica tions he had such a full command over his passions as if he hardly had any such in his soul and only knew them by their names as rather perceiving them in other men than in  Deut xxxiv 7 t Nothing can be plainer from the text than that Mo ses did die and was really buried nay Josephus tells us that the Scripture affirms that he died lest people should think because of the excellency of his person that he was still alive and with God And yet notwithstanding this some of the Jewish doctors do positively affirm that he was translated into heaven where he stands and minis ters before God and of those who admit of his death himself He was also such a general of an army as is seldom seen as well as such a pro phet as was never known J and this to such a degree that whatsoever he pronounced you would think you heard the voice of God him self So the people mourned for him thirty days Nor did ever any grief so deeply affect the Hebrews as did this upon the death of Mo ses Nor were those that had experienced his conduct the only persons that desired him but those also that perused the laws he left behind him had a strong desire after him and by them gathered the extraordinary vir tue he was master of And this shall suffice for the declaration of the manner of the death of Moses and that his soul and body were really separated the ma jor part will not allow that he died a common death for their notion is that his soul departed with a kiss because he is said to die al pi at the mouth as it is literally in the Hebrew i e according to the word of God but if there be any sense in the expression it must be that he parted with his soul with great cheerfulness and serenity of mind Witsius s Miscel lacra B  Deut xxxiv 10 LIS 142 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK V Containing an Interval of Four Hundred and Seventy six Years FROM THE DEATH OF MOSES TO THE DEATH OF ELI CHAP I OF THE WAR CARRIED ON BY JOSHUA AGAINST TJIE CA NAANITES AND THE SIGNAL SUCCESSES OF THE HEBREWS WHEN Moses had been taken from among men in the manner already described and when all the solemnities be longing to the mourning for him were finished Joshua commanded the multitude to get themselves ready for an expedition He also sent spies to Jericho to discover what forces they had and what were their intentions But he put his camp in order as intending to pass over Jordan at a proper season And calling to him the rulers of the tribe of Reu bel and the governors of he tribe of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh for half of this tribe had been permitted to have their habi tation in the country of the Amorites which was thet seventh part of the land of Canaan he put them in mind what they had promised Moses and exhorted them that for the sake of the care that Moses had taken of them who had never been weary of taking pains for them no not when he was dying and for the sake of the public welfare they would prepare themselves and readily perform what they had promised So he took fifty thousand of them and marched with them from Abila to Jordan sixty furlongs  Josh ii 1 Jericho was a city of Canaan which afterwards fell to the lot of the tribe of Benjamin about seven leagues distant from Jerusalem and two from Jor dan Moses calls it likewise the city of palm tftes Deut xxxiv 3 because there were great numbers of them in the plains of Jericho and not only of palm trees but as Josephus tells us Antiq lib 4 c 5 balsam trees like wise which produced the precious liquor in such high esteem among the ancients The plain of Jericho was watered with a rivulet which was formerly salt and bitter but was afterward sweetened by the prophet Elisha 2 Kings ii 21 22 whereupon the adjacent country which was watered by it became not only one of the most agree able but most fertile spots in all that country As to the cityitself after it was destroyed by Joshua it was in the days of Ahab king of Israel rebuilt by Hiel the Bethelite 1 Kings xvi 24 and in the times of the last kings of Ju dea yielded to none except Jerusalem For it was adorned with a royal palace wherein Herod the Great died with an hippodromus or place where the Jewish nobility learned to ride the great horse and other arts of chivalry with an amphitheatre and other magnificent buildings  but during the siege of Jerusalem the treachery of its inhab itants provoked the Romans to destroy it After the siege was over there was another city built but not upon the same place where the two former stood for the ruins of them are seen to this day Of what account and bigness it was we have no certain information but some later travellers inform us that at present it is no more than a poor nasty village of the Arabs Well s Geog of the Old and jvea Testament and MaundreWs Journey from Aleppo B f The Amorites were one of the seven nations of Ca naan Hence Reland is willing to suppose that Josephus did not here mean that their land beyond Jordan was a seventh part of the whole land of Canaan but meant the Amorites as a seventh nation His reason is that Jose phus as well as our Bible generally distinguish the land beyond Jordan from the land of Canaan Nor can it be denied that in strictness they were different Yet after two tribes and a half of the twelve tribes came to inherit it it might in a general way be included under the land of Canaan Palestine or Judea Of which we have a clear example before us in Josephus whose words evidently imply that taking the whole land of Canaan or that in habited by all the twelve tribes together and parting it into seven parts the part beyond Jordan was in quantity of ground one seventh of the whole And this agrees with Reland s map of that country Although this land beyond Jordan was so peculiarly fruitful and good for pasturage as the two tribes and a half took notice Numb xxxii 1 4 16 that it maintained about a fifth part of the whole people an 1492 143 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When he had pitched his camp the spies came to him immediately well acquainted with the whole state of the Canaanites For at first hefore they were all discovered they took a full view of the city of Jericho without disturbance and saw which parts of the walls were strong and which parts were insecure and which of the gates were so weak as might afford an entrance to their army Now those that met them took no notice of them when they saw them and supposed they were only strangers who used to be very curious in ob serving every thing in the city and did not take them for enemies At even they retired to a certain inn that was near the wall whither they went to eat their supper but when they had finished their repast and were considering how to get away information was given the king that there were some persons come from the Hebrews camp to view the city as spies and that they were in the inn kept by Rahab and were very solicitous that they might not be discovered So he sent immediately and commanded to catch them and bring them to him that he might examine them by torture and learn what their business was there As soon as Rahab understood that these messengers were coming she hid the spies under stalks of flax which were laid to dry on the top of her house and said to the messengers that were sent by the king that certain unknown strangers had supped with her a little before sun setting and were gone away who might easily be taken if they were any terror to the city or likely to bring any danger to the king So these messengers being thusf deluded by the woman and sus pecting no imposition went their ways with out so much as searching the inn but they immediately pursued them along those roads which they most probably supposed them to have gone and those particularly which led to the river but could hear no tidings of them so they left off any farther pursuit But when the tumult was over Rahab brought the men down and desired them as soon as they should have obtained possession of the land of Canaan when it would be in their power to make her amends for her preserva tion of them to remember what danger she had undergone for their sakes for that if she had been caught concealing them she could not have escaped a terrible destruc tion she and all her family and so bid them go home and desired them to swear to her to preserve her and her family when they should take the city and destroy all its in habitants as they had resolved to do For  The eastern writers tell us that these spies whom they make to be Caleb and Phineas were valiant and re ligious men and in the prime of their youth that to pass unobserved they changed their habits as if they had come from a distant country and if any one asked them any questions their reply was to this effect We are people from the east and our companions have heard of this powerful people who were forty years in the wilder ness without either guide or provision and it was re ported to us that they had a God whom they called tlie Kins of Heaven and earth and who as they say hath given them both your and our country Our principals have therefore sent us to find out the truth hereof and to report it to them â We have likewise heard of their cap tain whom they call Joshua the son of Nun who put the Amalekiteslo flight who destroyed Sihon and Og the kings of Mmian and Moab Woe therefore be to us and you and all that flee to us for shelter They are a people who pity none leave none alive drive all out of their country and make peace with none We are all accounted by them infidels profane proud and rebellious Who ever of us or you therefore that intend to take care of themselves let them take their families and be gone lest they repent of their stay when it is too late By this means they imposed upon the people and as Josephus informs us went whither they would and saw whatever they had a mind to without any stop or question They took a view of the wills the gates the ramparts and passed the whole day for men of curiosity only without any design So that if any credit may be given to this ac count it was but just that they who thus imposed upon the Canaanites should in the same manner be imposed upon by the Gibeonites Chronicon Samaritanum Jtrabice scrip turn page 65 B t It plainly appears by the history of these spies and the innkeeper Rahab s deception of the king of Jericho s messengers by telling them what was false in order to save tlie lives of the spies and yet the great commendation of her faith and good works in the New Testament Heb xi 32 Jam ii 25 as well as by many other parallel ex amples both in the Old Testament and in Josephus that the best men did not then scruple to deceive those public enemies who might justly be destroyed as also to de ceive ill men in order to save life and deliver themselves from the tyranny of their unjust oppressors and this by telling direct falsehoods I mean all this where no oath was demanded of them otherwise they never durst ven ture on such a procedure Nor was Josephus himself of any other opinion or practice as I shall remark in the note on Antiq IX 4 3 And observe that I still call this woman Rahab an innkeeper not a harlot the whole his tory both in our other copies and especially in Josephus implying no more It was indeed so frequent a thing that women who were innkeepers were also harlots or main tainers of harlots that the word commonly used for real harlots was usually given them See Dr Bernard s note here and Judg xi 1 and Josephus Antiq V 7 144 BOOK V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS so far she said she had been assured by those divine miracles of which she had been informed So these spies acknowledged that they owed her thanks for what she had done already and withal swore to requite her kind ness not only in words but in deeds but they gave her this advice that when she should perceive that the city was about to be taken she should put her goods and all her family by way of security in her inn and hang out scarlet threads before her doors or windows that the commander of the Hebrews might know her house and take care to do her no harm For said they we will inform him of this matter because of the concern thou hast had to preserve us but if any of thy family fall in the battle do not blame us and we beseech that God by whom we have sworn not then to be displeased with us as though we had broken our oaths So these men when they had made this agreement went away letting themselves down by a rope from the wall and escaped and came and told their own people whatsoever they had done in their journey to this city Joshua also told Eleazar the high priest and the senate what the spies had sworn to Rahab who confirmed what had been sworn Now while Joshua the commander was in fear about their passing over Jordan for the river ran with a strong current and could not be passed over with bridges for there never had been bridges laid over it hitherto and while he suspected that if he should attempt to make a bridge the enemies would not afford him time to perfect it and ferry boats they had none God promised so to dispose of the river that they might pass over it and hat by taking away the main part of its wa ters So Joshua after two days caused the army and the whole multitude to pass over in the following manner â The priests went first having the ark with them then went the Le vites bearing the tabernacle and the vessels that belonged to the sacrifices after which the entire multitude followed according to their tribes having their children and their wives in the midst of them as being afraid for them lest they should be borne away by the stream But as soon as the priests had en tered the river first it appeared fordable the depth of the water being restrained and the sand appearing at the bottom because the current was neither so strong nor so swift as to carry it away by its force so they all passed over the river without fear finding it to be in the very same state as God had fore told he would put it in But the priests stood still in the midst of the river till the multi tude should be passed over and should get to the shore in safety and when all were gone over the priests came out also and per mitted the current to run freely as it used to do before Accordingly the river as soon as the Hebrews were gone out of it arose again presently and came to its proper height as before So the Hebrews went on farther fifty fur longs and pitched their camp at the distance of ten furlongs from Jericho But Joshua built an altar of those stonest which all the heads of the tribes at the command of the prophet had taken out of the river to be afterward a memorial of the division of the stream and upon it offered sacrifice to God and in that place celebrated the passover and had great plenty of all things which they had wanted hitherto For they reaped the corn of the Canaanites which was now ripe and took other things as prey for then it was that their former food which was manna and of which they had eaten forty years failed them While the Israelites did this and the Ca naanites did not attack them but remained quiet within their own walls Joshua resolved to besiege them So on the first day of the feast of the passover the priests carried the ark round about which was some part of the armed men to be a guard to it These priests went forward blowing with their seven trum pets and exhorted the army to be of good courage and went round the city with the senate following them and when the priests had only blown with their trumpets J for they did nothing more at all they returned to the  Josh iv 10 t It has been a custom in all nations to erect monuments of stone in order to preserve the memory of covenants victories and other great transactions and though there was no inscription upon these stones yet the number of them and the place where they lay which was not at all stony was sufficient to signify some memorable thing which posterity would not fail to hand down from one generation to another Patrick s Commentary on Joshua iv 7 B  Josh vi IS an 1492 145 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS camp And when they had done this for six days on the seventh Joshua gathered the armed men and all the people together and told them the city should now be taken since God would on that day give it them by the falling down of the walls and this of their own accord and without their labour However he charged them to kill every one whom they should take and not to abstain from the slaughter of their enemies either for weari ness or for pity and not to fall on the spoil and be thereby diverted from pursuing their enemies as they ran away but to destroy all the animals and to take nothing for their own peculiar advantage He commanded them also to bring together all the silver and gold that it might be set apart as first fruits unto God out of this glorious exploit as having gotten them from the first city they took only that they should save Rahab and her kindred alive because of the oath which the spies had sworn to her When he had said this and had set his army in order he brought it against the city so they went round the city again the ark going before them and the priests en couraging the people to be zealous in the work and when they had gone round it seven times and had stood a little the wall fell down while no instruments of war nor any other force was applied to it by the He brews So they entered into Jericho and slew all the men that were therein while they were affrighted at the surprising overthrow of the walls and their courage was become useless and they were not able to defend themselves so they were slain and their throats cut some in the ways and others as caught in their houses nothing afforded them assistance but they all perished even to the women and the children and the city was filled with dead bodies and not one person escaped They also burnt the whole city and the country about it but they saved alive Rahab with her family who had fled to her inn and when she was brought to him Joshua owned that they owed her thanks for her preservation of the spies He also said he would not appear to be behind her in his benefaction to her and therefore he gave her certain lands im mediately and held her in great esteem ever afterwards If any part of the city escaped the fire he overthrew it from its foundation and de nounced a curse against its inhabitants if any one should desire to rebuild it how upon his laying the foundations of the walls he should be deprived of his eldest son and upon finishing it he should lose his youngest son f but what happened hereuponJ we

public enemies had been for their wickedness solemnly devoted to destruction according to the divine command as were generally the seven wicked nations of Canaan and those sinners the Amalekites 1 Sam xv 18 see the note on IV 7 it was utterly un lawful to permit those enemies to be redeemed but they were to be all utterly destroyed See also Numb xxi 2 3 The words of Joshua s execration are these â Cursed be the man before the Lord that raiseth up and buildeth this city Jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first born and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it Josh vi 26 This anathema says Maimonides was pronounced that the miracle of the subversion of Jericho might be kept in perpetual memory for whosoever saw the walls sunk deep in the earth as he understands it would clearly discern that this was not the form of a building destroyed by men but miraculously thrown down by God Hiel however in the reign of Abab either not remembering or not believing this denuncia tion was so taken with the beauty of its situation that he rebuilt Jericho and as the sacred history informs us laid the foundation thereof in Ahiram his first born and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub according to the word of the Lord which he spake to Joshua the son of Nun 1 Kings xvi 34 However after that Hiel had ventured to rebuild it no scruple was made of inhabiting it for it afterwards became famous upon many accounts Here the prophet sweetened the waters of the spring that sup plied it and the neighbouring countries Here Herod built a sumptuous palace it was the dwelling place of Zaccheus and was honoured with the presence of Christ who vouchsafed likewise to work some miracles here Univer Hist lib 1 c 7 B t Josh vi 26 J This is now wanting in Josephus 146 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS priests to be laid up among their treasures and thus did Jericho perish But there was one Achar the son of Char mi the son of Zebedias of the tribe of Judah who finding a royal garment woven entirely of gold f and a piece of gold that weighed two hundred shekels f and thinking it a very hard case that what spoils he by running some hazard had found he must give away and offer them to God who stood in no need of them made a deep ditch in his tent and laid them up therein as supposing he should not only be concealed from his fellow sol diers but from God also Now the place where Joshua pitched his camp was called Gilgal which denotes liberty for since they had now passed over the river Jordan they looked upon them selves as freed from the miseries which they had undergone from the Egyptians and in the wilderness A few days after the calamity that befel Jericho Joshua sent three thousand armed men to take Ai a city situate above Jericho but upon the fight of the people of Ai with them they were driven back and lost thirty six of their men When this was told the Israelites it made them very sad and ex ceeding disconsolate not so much because of the relation the men that were destroyed bare to them though those that were de stroyed were all good men and deserved their esteem as by the despair it occasioned for while they believed that they were al ready in effect in the possession of the land and should bring back the army out of the battle without loss as God had promised beforehand they now saw unexpectedly their enemies bold with success so they put sack cloth over their garments and continued in tears and lamentation all the day without the least enquiry after food but laid what had happened greatly to heart When Joshua saw the army so much af flicted and possessed with forebodings of evil as to their whole expedition he used free dom with God and said We are not come thus far out of any rashness of our own as though we thought ourselves able to subdue this land with our own weapons but at the instigation of Moses thy servant because thou hast promised us by many signs that thou wouldst give us this land for a possession and that thou wouldst make our army always su perior in war to our enemies and accordingly some success has already attended upon us agreeably to thy promises but because we have now unexpectedly been foiled and have lost some men out of our army we are grieved at it as fearing what thou hast promised us and what Moses foretold us cannot be de pended on and our future expectation trou bles us the more because we have met with such a disaster in this first attempt But do thou O Lord free us from these suspicions for thou art able to find a cure for these dis  That the name of this thief was not Achan as in the common copies but Achar as here in Josephus and in the Apostolic Constitutions VII 2 and elsewhere is evi dent by the allusion to that name in the curse of Joshua Why hast thou troubled us The Lord shall trouble thee Where the Hebrew words allude only to the name Achar but not to Achan accordingly this valley of Achar or Achor was and is a known place a little north of Gilgal so called from the days of Joshua to this day See Josh vii 24 26 Is lxv 10 Hos ii 15 and Dr Ber nard s notes here t In the original this robe is called a garment ofShinar i e of Babylon and the general opinion is that the rich ness and excellency of it consisted not so much in the stuff whereof it was made as in the colour whereof it was dyed which most suppose to have been scarlet a colour in high esteem among the ancients and for which the Ba bylonians were justly famous Bochart however main tains that the colour of this robe was various and not all of one sort that the scarlet colour the Babylonians first received from Tyre but the party colour whether so woven or wrought with the needle was of their own in vention for which he produces many passages out of Heathen authors Such as Non ego praetulerim Babylonica picta superbe Texta Semiramia quaj variantur acu Mart Ep lib 8 Ha c mihi Memphitis tellus dat munera victa est Pectine Niliaco jam Babylonis acus Ibid lib 14 with many more citations out of several other writers However this be it is certain that the robe could not fail to be a very rich and splendid one and therefore capti vated either Achar s pride or rather covetousness since his purpose seems to have been not so much to wear it himself as to sell it for a large price Bochart s Phaleg lib I e 9 Saurin lib 3 dissertation 3 B J Here Dr Bernard justly observes that a few words are dropped out of Josephus s copies on account of the repetition of the word shekels and that it ought to be read thus A piece of gold that weighed 60 shekels

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS orders by giving us victory which will both take away the grief we are in at present and prevent our distrust at what is to come These intercessions Joshua put up to God as he layprostrate on his face whereupon God answered him that he should rise up and pu rity his host from the pollution which was got into it for that consecrated things had been impudently stolen and that this was the oc casion which this defeat had happened to them and that when they should search out and punish the offender he would ever take care they should have the victory over their enemies This Joshua told the people and calling Eleazar the high priest and the men in authority he cast lots tribe by tribe and when the lot shewed that this wicked action was done by one of the tribe of Judah he then again proposed the lot to the several families thereto belonging so it was found to belong to the family of Zachar and when the enquiry was made man by man they took Achar who upon God s reducing him to a terrible extremity could not deny the fact but confessed the theft and produced what he had taken in the midst of them so this man was immediately put to death and at tained no more than to be buried in the night in a disgraceful manner and such as was suitable to a condemned malefactor When Joshua had thus purified the host he led them against Ai and having by night laid an ambush round about the city he at tacked the enemies as soon as it was day but as they advanced boldly against the Is  Josh Til 25 Since the law against sacrilege con demns transgressors to the flames and God commanded the person here guilty to be burnt accordingly Josh vii 18 the Jews affirm that Achar was actually burnt and whereas it is said in the text that he was stoned they think that this was done not judicially but accidentally by the people who were so highly provoked that they could not forbear casting stones at him as he was led to execution Vid Munst on Joshua vii B t It is a question among the casuists whether the Gibe onites could with a good conscience pretend that they were foreigners and tell a lie to save their lives And to this Puffendorf Droit de la Nature lib 4 c 2 thus replies  The artifice of the Gibeonites says he  had nothing blameable in it nor does it properly deserve the name of a lie for what crime is there in any one s ma king use of an innocent fiction in order to elude the fury of an enemy that would destroy all before them Nor did the Israelites indeed properly receive any damage from this imposture for what does any one lose in not shed ding the blood of another when he has it in his power to voL I â NOS 13  14 raelites because of their former victory he made them believe he retired and by that means drew them a great way from the city they still supposing that they were pursuing their enemies and despised them as though the case had been the same with that in the former battle after which Joshua ordered his forces to turn about and placed them against their front He then made the signals agreed upon to those that lay in ambush and so excited them to fight so they ran suddenly into the city the inhabitants being upon the walls nay others of them being in perplexity and coming to see those that were without the gates Accordingly these men took the city and slew all that they met with but Joshua forced those that came against him to come to a close fight and discomfited them and made them run away and when they were driven towards the city and thought it had not been touched as soon as they saw it was taken and perceived it was burnt with their wives and children they wandered about in the fields in a scattered condition and were no where able to defend them selves because they had none to support them Now when this calamity was come upon the men of Ai there were a great num ber of children and women and servants and an immense quantity of furniture The Hebrews also took herds of cattle and a great deal of money for this was a rich coun try so when Joshua came to Gilgal he di vided all these spoils among the soldiers But the Gibeonitesf who inhabited very take from him all his substance after having so weakened and disarmed him that he is no more able to rebel against him But the opinion of this great man seems to be a little erroneous in this case Had the Israelites indeed been a pack of common murderers who without any commission from Heaven were carrying blood and deso lation into countries where they had no right or had the Gibeonites been ignorant that a miraculous Providence con ducted these conquerors the fraud which they here put upon them might then be deemed innocent For there is no law that obliges us under the pretence of sincerity to submit to such incendiaries and merciless usurpers as are for setting fire to our cities and putting us and our fami lies to the edge of the sword But the case of the Gibeo nites was particular and if in other things they went con trary to truth in this they certainly adhered to it when they told Joshua We are come bemuse of the name of the Lord thy God for we have heard of the fame of him and all that he did in Egypt and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan fyc Josh ix 9 10 The idea which they had conceived of the God of Mm 148 book t ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS near to Jerusalem when they saw what mise ries had happened to the inhabitants of Je richo and to those of Ai and suspected that the like sore calamity would come as far as themselves they did not think fit to ask for mercy of Joshua for they supposed they should find little mercy from him who made war that he might entirely destroy the nation of the Canaanites But they invited the people of Cephirah and Kiriathjearim who were their neighbours to join in the league with them and told them that neither could they themselves avoid the danger they were all in if the Israelites should prevent them and seize upon them so when they had per suaded them they resolved to endeavour to escape the forces of the Israelites Accord ingly upon their agreement to what they pro posed they sent ambassadors to Joshua to make a league of friendship with him and chose such of the citizens as were best ap proved of and most capable of doing what was most advantageous to the multitude Now these ambassadors thought it dangerous to confess themselves to be Canaanites but thought they might avoid the danger by say ing that they bare no relation to the Canaan ites at all but dwelt at a very great distance from them and they said farther that they came a long way on account of the reputation Joshua had gained for his virtue and as a proof of the truth of what they said they shewed him the habit they were in for that their clothes were new when they came out but were greatly worn by the length of time they had been on their journey for indeed they took torn garments on purpose that they might make him believe so so they stood in the midst of the people and said that they were sent by the people of Gibeon and of the circumjacent cities which were very re mote from the land where they now were to make such a league of friendship with them and this on such conditions as were customary among their forefathers for when they un derstood that by the favour of God and his gift to them they were to have the possession Israel should have put them upon some other expedient than that of lying and deceit They should have enquired as far as the obscure dispensation they were under would have permitted them into the cause of God s severity against them They should have acknowledged that it was their grievous sins which drew down this heavy judgment upon their nation and after they had repented of the land of Canaan bestowed upon them they said they were very glad to hear it and desired to be admitted into the number of their citizens Thus did these ambassadors speak and shewing them the marks of their long journey they intreated the Hebrews to make a league of friendship with them Ac cordingly Joshua believing that they were not of the nation of the Canaanites entered into friendship with them and Eleazar the high priest with the senate sware to them that they would esteem them their friends and associates and would attempt nothing that should be unfair against them the multi tude also assenting to the oaths that were made to them so these men having obtained what they desired by deceiving the Israel ites went home but when Joshua led his army to the country at the bottom of the mountains of this part of Canaan he under stood that the Gibeonites dwelt not far from Jerusalem and that they were of the stock of the Canaanites so he sent for their go vernors and reproached them with the cheat they had put upon him But they alleged on their own behalf that they had no other way to save themselves but that and were therefore forced to have recourse to it So he called for Eleazar the high priest and for the senate who thought it right to make them public servants that they might not break the oath they had made to them and they ordained them to be so and this was the method by which these men found secu rity under the calamity that was ready to overtake them But the king of Jerusalem took it to heart that the Gibeonites had gone over to Joshua so he called upon the kings of the neighbour ing nations to join together to make war against them Now when the Gibeonites saw these kings which were four besides the king of Jerusalem and perceived that they had pitched their camp at a certain fountain not far from the city and were getting ready for the siege they called upon Joshua to assist them for such was their case as to expect thereof in sackcloth and ashes they should have committed the rest to Providence never doubting but that he who had changed the very course of nature to punish the guilty would always find out some means or other to save the penitent but this they did not do and therefore they were culpable Scncrin vol 3 dissertation 4 B  Josh ix 87 aN H92 J 149 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to be destroyed by these Canaanites but to suppose that they should be saved by those that came for the destruction of the Canaan ites because of the league of friendship that was between them Accordingly Joshua has tened with his whole army to assist them and marching day and night in the morning he fell upon the enemies as they were going up  Josh x 11 t This miracle is thus related in holy writ Joshua said in the sight of all Israel Sun stand thou still upon Gibeon and thou Moon in the valley of Ajalon and the sua stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves of their enemies Is not this written in the book of Jasher So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel Josh x 12 c Now for the better understanding of these words we must ob serve â I That nothing is more common in Scripture than to express things not according to the strict rules of philoso phy but according to their appearances and the vulgar apprehension concerning them The sun and moon for instance are called two great lights Gen i 16 but however that title may agree with the sun it is plain that the moon is but a small body the least that has yet been discovered in the planetary system and that it has no light at all but what it borrows and reflects from the rays of the sun and yet because it is placed near us it appears to us larger than other heavenly luminaries and from that appearance the holy Scriptures give it such an appellation And in like manner because the sun seems to us to move and the earth to be at rest the Scriptures speak a great deal of the pillars and basis and foundations of the earth and of the sun s rejoicing like a giant to run its race Psalm xix 5 and of his arising and going do am and hasting to the place where it arose c Eccles i 6 Whereas it is certain that if the sun were made to revolve round about the earth the general law of nature would thereby be violated the harmony and proportion of the heavenly bodies destroyed and no small confusion and disorder brought into the frame of the universe but on the contrary if the earth turned upon its own axis every day be made to go round the sun in the space of a year it will then perform its circulation according to the same law which the other planets observe and without the least exception there will be a most beautiful order and harmony of motions every where preserved through the whole frame of nature As therefore the Scriptures were designed to teach us the art of holy living and not to in struct us in the rudiments of natural knowledge it can be deemed no diminution either to their perfection or divine authority that they generally speak according to the com mon appearance of things and not according to their reality or philosophic truth The plain matter of fact is that in the early ages both before and long after the days of Joshua the most learned astronomers had no notion of the improvements which our modern professors have since attained to They never once dreamed of the earth s ro tation upon its own axis  but according to common appear ance were fully persuaded that the sun and moon had to the siege and when he had discomfited them he followed and pursued them down the descent of the hills The place is called Beth horon where he also understood that God assisted him which he declared by thun der and thunderbolts as also by the falling of hail larger than usual Moreover it hap pened that the day was lengthened f that the their respective courses Upon this supposition they formed their schemes and thought themselves able to an swer every phenomenon by them And therefore if God had prompted Joshua to desire the prolongation of the day in a manner more agreeable to our new astronomy or to record the miracle in terms more suitable to it this would have been a plain contrariety to all the rules of science then in use The people who heard him utter the words Earth rest upon thy axis would have thought him dis tracted and those who read his account of what had hap pened if related in suitable expressions would have de cried it as false in fact or passed it by with contempt and disregard as a wild fancy or blunder of his own  II In relation to the places over which the two hea venly bodies were to stand the sun over Gibeon and the moon over the valley Ajalon we must observe that even upon the supposition of the sun s motion the Jewisn ge neral cannot be thought to speak in a proper and philo sophical sense For since the sun is almost a million of times bigger than the earth and 95 millions of miles dis tant from it to justify the strict sense of the words a line drawn from the centre of the sun to that of the earth must exactly pass by Gibeon which we know it cannot do be cause no part of the Holy Land lies within the tropics and therefore we must conclude that Joshua here speaks ac cording to the outward appearance of things which makes the sense of his words plain and intelligible  Wherever we are if so be we are not hindered by ob jects immediately surrounding us we can cast our eyes upon part of the surface of the earth and at the same time take into our prospect some small extent of the firmament of heaven which seems as it were to cover the other and each celestial body which we perceive in this extent above appears to us to be directly over such and such part of the earth as we alternately turn our eyes to and it is thus that the sun when Joshua spake seemed to him and to those that were with him to he over Gibeon and the moon to be over the valley of Ajalon This valley in all likelihood took its name from some adjacent town but then as there are three Ajalons mentioned in scrip ture one in the tribe of Ephraim 1 Chron vi 69 another in Zabulon Judg xii 12 and another in Dan Josh xix 42 it is reasonable to think that the place here spoken ofwas in Dan the most remote province in Gibeon for we must suppose that these two places were at some considerable distance otherwise Joshua could not see the sun and moon both appear at the same time as it is probable they were both in his eye when he uttered these words III In relation to the time when this miracle began and how long it lasted the Scripture s expression is that the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day which words can import no less than that the sun stood still in the meridian or much about noon and that in this position it continued for th  Mm2 ISO book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS night might hot come on too soon and be an obstruction to the zeal of the Hebrews in pur suing their enemies insomuch that Joshua took the kings who were hidden in a certain cave at Makkedah and put them to death Now that the day was lengthened at this time and was longer than ordinary is ex pressed in the books laid up in the temple These kings who made war with and were ready to fight the Gibeonites being thus overthrown Joshua returned again to the mountainous parts of Canaan And when he made a great slaughter of the people there and took their prey he came to the camp at Gilgal And now there went a great fame abroad among the neighbouring people of the courage of the Hebrews and those that heard what a number of men were destroyed were greatly affrighted at it So the kings that lived about mount Libanus who were Canaanites and those Canaanites that dwelt in the plain country with auxiliaries out of the land of the Philistines pitched their camp at Beroth a city of the Upper Galilee not far from Cadesh which is itself also a place in Galilee The number of the whole army was three hundred thousand armed footmen ten thousand horsemen and twenty thousand chariots So that the multitude of the ene mies alarmed both Joshua himself and the Israelites and they instead of being full of hope of success were superstitiously timo rous with the great terror with which they were stricken Whereupon God upbraided them with the fear they were in and asked them whether they desired a greater help than he could afford them and promised them that they should overcome their ene mies withal charging them to make their enemies horses useless and to burn their chariots So Joshua became full of courage upon these promises of God and went out suddenly against the enemies and after five days march he came upon them and joined battle with them and there was a terrible fight and such a number were slain as could not be believed by those that heard it He also went on the pursuit a great way and destroyed the entire army of the enemies few only escaped and all the kings fell in the battle insomuch that when there wanted men to be killed Joshua slew their horses and space of a civil or artificial day i e for twelve hours But Maimonides is of opinion More Nevoch part 2 chap 39 and in this he is followed by some Christian writers Grotius and Masius in locum that there was no such cessation of the sun and moon s motion but that the whole purport of the miracle was this â That God at Joshua s request granted him and his soldiers such a de gree of spirits activity and despatch as enabled them to gain a complete victory and as much execution in one day as might otherwise have taken up two but this is a con struction so repugnant to the genuine sense of the words as to need no formal confutation There is something more however to be said to the notion of other learned men who with regard to the time when Joshua might send up his request and the miracle begin think it more probable that he should pray for a longer day when he perceived the sun just going to leave him than when it was in its height But Joshua no doubt had reasons for what he did He was an old experienced general eager for a complete victory and able to compute what time it would take to achieve it so that his fear of losing any part of the present advantage might make him pray that the day might be thus prolonged until he had obtained the whole If the sun in its declension had stopped its course it might have answered his purpose per haps hut then it had given a juster handle to the sug gestions of those who would deny the whole merit of the miracle For if the retardation of the sun had not hap pened until it was going to set Spinosa might with a much better grace have attributed the extraordinary length of this day to the refraction of its rays from the clouds which at that time were loaded with hail Tract Theol Politic C 2 or Peirerius to some aurora borealis or parhelium which after the setting of the sun might appear about the territories of Gibeon and so be mistaken for the sun s standing still but now by fixing it in its meridian point all the cavils are effectually silenced Praedam lib 4 c 6 and God no doubt who heard him so readily Cal met s Disser sur le Commandment c inspired the He brew general with that wish or prayer which otherwise perhaps would never have come into his head KeiVs Astronomical Lectures Besides this general argument of Mr Keil s Mr Whis ton has one which he accounts no less than a demonstra tion If the earth says he  have an annual revolution about the sun it must affect the apparent motion of all the other planets and comets and notwithstanding the regu larity of their several motions in their own orbits must render these regular motions to us as living upon the moving earth sometimes direct and that swiftly and slowly sometimes stationary and sometimes retrograde and that swiftly or slowly also and all this at such cer tain periods in such certain places for such certain dura tions and according to such certain circumstances as geometry and arithmetic will certainly determine and not otherwise Now that this is the real case in fact and that every one of these particulars are true in the astro nomical world all that are skilful in that science do freely confess even those who do not think fit to declare openly for this annual revolution of the earth which yet is the natural and certain consequence of that concession Whiston s Astron Princ of Relig The reader that is desirous to know more both

that seemed a fit place for it because of the beauty of its situation until such times as their affairs would permit them to build a temple And from thence he went to She chem together with all the people and raised an altar where Moses had previously di rected Then did he divide the army and placed one half of them on Mount Geriz zim and the other half on Mount Ebal on which mountain the altar was he also placed there the tribe of Levi and the priests And when they had sacrificed and denounced the blessings and the curses and had left them engraven upon the altar they returned to Shiloh And now Joshua was old and saw that the cities of the Canaanites were not easily to be taken not only because they were situated in such strong places but because of the strength of the walls themselves which be ing built round about the natural strength of the places on which the cities stood seemed capable of repelling their enemies from be sieging them For when the Canaanites had learned that the Israelites came out of Egypt in order to destroy them they were busy all that time in making their cities strong So he gathered the people together at Shiloh and when they with great zeal and haste were come thither he observed to them what prosperous successes they had already had and what glorious things had been done and those such as were worthy of that God who enabled them to do those things and worthy of the virtue of those laws which they fol lowed He took notice also thatJ thirty one of those kings that ventured to give them battle were overcome and every army how great soever it were that confided in their  An 1487 t Josh xviii 1 power and fought with them was utterly de stroyed 60 that not so much as any of their posterity remained And as for the cities since some of them were taken but the others must be taken in length of time by long sieges both on account of the strength of their walls and of the confidence the inhabitants had in them he thought it reasonable that those tribes that came along with them from beyond Jordan and had partaken of the dangers they had undergone being their own kindred should now be dismissed and sent home and should have thanks for the pains they had taken together with them As also he thought it reasonable that they should send one man out of every tribe and he such as had the testimony of extraordinary virtue who should measure the land faithfully and without any fallacy or deceit should inform them of its real magnitude Now Joshua when he had thus spoken found that the multitude approved of his pro posal So he sent men to measure their country and sent with them some geometri cians who could not easily fail of ascertain ing the truth on account of their skill in that art He also gave them a charge to estimate the measure of that part of the land that was most fruitful and what was not so good For such is the nature of the land of Canaan that one may see large plains and such as are ex ceedingly fit to produce fruit which if they were compared with other parts of the coun try might be reckoned exceeding fruitful yet in comparison with the fields about Jeri cho and those that belong to Jerusalem they will appear to be of no account at all And although it happen that these people have but very little of this sort of land and that it is in general mountainous also yet does it not come behind other parts on account of its exceeding goodness and beauty For which reason Joshua thought that the land for the tribes should be divided by estimation of its goodness rather than its extent it often hap pening that one acre of some sort of land was equivalent to a thousand other acres Now the men that were sent which were in num ber ten travelled all about and made an es timation of the land and in the seventh J Josh xii 8â 24   452 book v ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS month they returned to the city of Shiloh where they had set up the tabernacle Joshua now took both Eleazar and the senate and with them the heads of the tribes and distributed the land to the nine tribes and to the half tribe of Manasseh appointing the dimensions according to the largeness of each tribe So when he had cast lots Judah had assigned him by lot the upper part of Judea reaching as far as Jerusalem and its breadth extending to the lake of Sodom and the lot of this tribe included the cities of As calon and Gaza The lot of Simeon which was the second comprehended that part of Idumea which bordered upon Egypt and Arabia As to the Benjamites their lot fell so that its length reached from the river Jor dan to the sea but in breadth it was bounded Dy Jerusalem and Bethel and this lot was the narrowest of all by reason of the good ness of the land for it included Jericho and the city of Jerusalem The tribe of Ephraim had the land that extended in length from the river Jordan to Gezer but in breadth as far as from Bethel to the great plain The half tribe of Manasseh had the land from Jor dan to the city of Dora but its breadth was at Bethshan which is now called Scythopolis And after these was Issachar which had its limits in length mount Carmel and the river but its limit in breadth was mount Tabor The tribe of Zabulon s lot included the land which lay as far as the lake of Gennesareth and that which belonged to Carmel and the sea The tribe of Aser had that part which was called The Valley for such it was and all that part that lay over against Sidon The city Arce belonged to their share which is also named Actipus The Naphthalites re ceived the eastern parts as far as the city of Damascus and the Upper Galilee unto mount Libanus and the fountains of Jordan which arise out of that mountain that is out of that part of it whose limits belong to the neigh bouring city Arce The Danites lot included all that part of the valley which respects the sun setting and were bounded by Azotus and Dora they also had all Jamnia and Gath from Ekron to that mountain where the tribe of Judah begins After this manner did Joshua divide the six  If I were writing to the learned I must have made particular notes on this and the rest of Josephus s geogra nations that bear the names of the sons of Ca naan with their land to be possessed by the nine tribes and a half for Moses had pre vented him and had already distributed the land of the Amorites which was so called from one of the sons of Canaan to the two tribes and a half as we have shewed already but the parts about Sidon as also those that belonged to the Arkites the Amathites and the Arabians were not yet regularly dis posed of But now Joshua was hindered by his age from executing what he intended and those who succeeded him in the government took little care of what was for the advantage of the public so he gave it in charge to every tribe to leave none of the race of the Canaan ites in the land that had been divided to them by lot for that Moses had assured them be forehand and they might rest fully satisfied that their own security and their observance of their own laws depended wholly upon it He also enjoined them to give thirty eight cities to the Levites for they had already received ten in the country of the Amorites and three of these he assigned to fugitive man slayers who were to inhabit there for he was very solicitous that nothing should be neglected which Moses had ordained These cities were of the tribe of Judah Hebron of that of Ephraim Shechem and that of Naphthali Cadesh which is a place of the Upper Galilee He also distributed among them the rest of the prey not yet distributed which was very great whereby they had an affluence of great riches both all in general and every one in particular and this of gold vestments and other furniture besides a multitude of cattle whose number cannot be told After this he gathered the army together and spake thus to those tribes that had their settlement in the land of the Amorites beyond Jordan for fifty thousand men of them had armed themselves and had gone to the war along with them Since that God who is the Father and Lord of the Hebrew nation has now given us this land for a possession and promised to preserve us in the enjoyment of it as our own for ever and since you have with alacrity offered yourselves to assist us phy of Canaan but in this version it shall suffice to refer the English reader to my map of Palestine ah 1487 153 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS whenever we wanted that assistance accord ing to his command it is but just now all our difficulties are over that you should be permitted to enjoy rest and that we should trespass on your alacrity to help us no longer that so if we should again stand in need of it we may readily have it on any future emergency and not tire you out so much now as may make you slower in assisting us another lime We therefore return you thanks for the dangers you have undergone with us and we do it not at this time only but we shall always be disposed to remember our friends and to preserve in mind what advan tages we have had from them and how you have put off the enjoyment of your own hap piness for our sakes and have laboured for what we have now by the good will of God obtained and resolved not to enjoy your own prosperity till you had afforded us that as sistance However you have by joining your labours with ours gotten great plenty of riches and will carry home with you much prey with gold and silver and what is more than all these our good will towards you and a mind willingly disposed to make a requital of your kindness in what case soever you shall desire it for you have not omitted any thing which Moses previously required of you nor have you despised him because he was dead and gone from you so that there is nothing to diminish that gratitude which we owe you We therefore dismiss you joy ful to your own inheritances and intreat you to suppose that there is no limit to be set to the intimate relation that is between us and that you will not imagine that because this river is interposed between us that you are of a different race from us and not Hebrews for we are all the posterity of Abraham both we that inhabit here and you that inhabit there and it is the same God who brought our forefathers and yours into the world whose worship and form of government we are to take care of which he has ordained and are most carefully to observe because while you continue in those laws God will also shew himself merciful and assisting to you but if you imitate the other nations and forsake those laws he will reject your na tion When Joshua had spoken thus and  Josh xxii 1â 6 had saluted them all both those in authority one by one and the whole multitude in com mon he himself stayed where he was but the people conducted these tribes on their journey and that not without tears in their eyes and indeed they hardly knew how to part one from the other Now when the tribe of Reubel and that of Gad and as many of the Manassites as fol lowed them were passed over the river they built an altart on the banks of Jordan as a monument to posterity and as a sign of their relation to those that should inhabit on the other side But when those on the other side heard that those who had been dismissed had built an altar but did not hear with what in tention they built it but supposed it to be by way of innovation and for the introduction of strange gods they did not incline to disbe lieve it but thinking this defamatory report as if it were built for divine worship was credible they appeared in arms as though they would avenge themselves upon those that built the altar and they were about to pass over the river and to punish them for their subversion of the laws of their country for they did not think it fit to regard them on account of their kindred or the dignity of those that had given the occasion but to re gard the will of God and the manner wherein he desired to be worshipped so these men put themselves in array for war but Joshua and Eleazar the high priest and the senate restrained them and persuaded them first to make trial by words of their intention and afterwards if they found that their intention was evil then only to proceed to make war upon them Accordingly they sent as am bassadors to them Phineas the son of Eleazar and ten more persons that were in esteem among the Hebrews to learn what was in their mind when upon passing over the river they had built an altar upon its banks But as soon as these ambassadors were passed over and were come to them and a congregation was assembled Phineas stood up and said The offence you have been guilty of is of too heinous a nature to be punished by words alone or by them only to be amended for the future Yet we do not so look at the heinousness of your transgression as to have t Josh xxii 10 s 154 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS recourse to arms and to a battle for your punishment immediately but on account of our kindred and the probability that you may be reclaimed we have taken this method of sending an ambassage that when we have learned the true reasons by which you have been moved to build this altar we may neither seem to have been too rash in assaulting you by our weapons of war if it prove that you made the altar for justifiable reasons and may then justly punish you if the accusation prove true for we can hardly suppose that you who have been acquainted with the will of God and have been hearers of those laws which he himself hath given us now you are separated from us and gone to that patrimony of yours which you through the grace of God and that providence he exercises over you have obtained by lot can forget him and can leave that ark and that altar which is peculiar to us and can introduce strange gods and imitate the wicked practices of the Canaanites Now this will appear to have been a small crime if you repent now and proceed no farther in your madness but pay a due reverence to and keep in mind the laws of your country But if you persist in your sins we will not grudge our pains to preserve your laws but will pass over Jor dan and defend them and defend God also and shall esteem of you as of men no way differing from the Canaanites but shall de stroy you in the like manner as we destroyed them for do not you imagine that because you are got over the river you are beyond the reach of God s power You are every where in places that belong to him and it is impos sible to overrun his power and the punish ment he will bring on men thereby But if you think that your settlement here will be any obstruction to your conversion to what is good nothing need hinder us from dividing the land anew and leaving this old land to be for the feeding of sheep but you will do well to return to your duty and to leave off these new crimes And we beseech you by your wives and children not to force us to punish you Take therefore such measures in this assembly as supposing that your own safety and the safety of those that are dearest to you is therein concerned and believe that it is better for you to be conquered by words than to continue in your purpose and thereby to experience deeds and war When Phineas had discoursed thus the governors of the assembly and the whole multitude began to make an apology for themselves concerning what they were ac cused of and they said We neither will depart from the relation we bear to you nor have we built the altar in way of innovation we own one and the same God with all the Hebrews and that brazen altar which is be fore the tabernacle on which we will offer our sacrifices As to the altar we have raised on account of which we are thus suspected it was not built for worship but that it might be a sign and a monument of our relation to you for ever and a necessary caution to us to act wisely and to continue in the laws of our country but not a handle for transgressing them as you suspect And let God be our authentic witness that this was the occasion of our building this altar Whence we beg you will have a better opinion of us and do not impute such a thing to us as would render any of the posterity of Abraham well worthy of perdition in case they attempt to bring in new rites and such as are different from our usual practices When they had made this answer and Phineas had commended them for it he came to Joshua and explained before the people what answer they had received Now Joshua was glad that he was under no necessity of setting them in array or of leading them to shed blood and make war against men that were of their own kindred and accordingly he offered sacrifices of thanksgiving to God for the same so Joshua after that dissolved this great assembly of the people and sent them to their own inheritances while himself lived at Shechem But in the twentieth year after this when he was very old he sent for those of the greatest dignity in the several cities with those in authority and the senate and gathered together as many of the com mon people as he could and when they were come he put them in mind of all the benefits God had bestowed on them which could not but be a great many since from a low estate they were advanced to so great a degree of glory and plenty and exhorted them to take  An 1467 aN 1487 155 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS notice of the intentions of God which had been so gracious towards them and told them that the Deity would continue their friend by nothing else but their piety and that it was proper for him now he was about to depart out of this life to leave such an admonition to them and he desired that they would keep in memory this his exhortation to them So Joshua when he had thus discoursed to them died having lived an hundred and ten years forty of which he lived with Moses in order to learn what might be for his ad vantage afterwards He also became their commander after Moses s deathf for twenty five years He was a man that wanted no wisdom nor eloquence to declare his inten tions to the people but was eminent on both accounts He was of great courage and magnanimity in action and in dangers and very sagacious in procuring the peace of the people and of great virtue at all proper sea sons He was buried in the city of Timnath of the tribe of Ephraim J Aboutj the same time died Eleazar the high priest leaving the high priesthood to his son Phineas His monument also and sepulchre are in the city Gabatha CHAP II OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE ISRAELITES AFTER THE DEATH OF JOSHUA J THEIR TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY J AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN EXCEPTING ONLY SIX HUNDRED MEN A FTER the death of Joshua and Eleazar Phineas prophesiedÂ that according to God s will they should commit the govern ment to the tribe of Judah and that ibis tribe should destroy the race of the Canaanites for then the people were concerned to learn what was the will of God They also took to their assistance the tribe of Simeon but upon this condition that when those that had been tributary to the tribe of Judah should be slain they should do the like for the tribe of Simeon But the affairs of the Canaanites were at this time in a nourishing condition and they expected the Israelites with a great army at the city Bezek having put the government into the hands of Adonibezek which name denotes the lord of Bezek for Adoni in the Hebrew tongue is called Lord Now they hoped to have been too hard for the Israel ites because Joshua was dead but when the Israelites had joined battle with them I mean the two tribes before mentioned they fought valiantly and slew above ten thousand of them and put the rest to flight and in the Cursuit they took Adonibezek who when is fingers and toes were cut off by them said Nay indeed I was not always to lie con cealed from God as I find by what I now en dure while I have not been ashamed to do the same to seventy two kings ff So they carried him alive as far as Jerusalem and when he was dead they buried him in the earth and went on still in taking the cities and when they had taken the greatest part of them they besieged Jerusalem and when they had taken the lower city which was not under a considerable time they slew all the inhabitants But the upper city was not to come to inhabit here See the note there Nor is it unworthy our notice what Moses Chorenensis adds page 53 and this upon a diligent examination viz that  One of those eminent men among the Canaanites came at the same time into Armenia and founded the Genthunian family or tribe and that this was confirmed by the man ners of the same family or tribe as being like those of the Canaanites â Â By prophesying when spoken of a high priest Jose phus both here and frequently elsewhere means no more than consulting God by Urim which the reader is still to bear in mind upon all occasions And if St John who was contemporary with Josephus and of the same country made use of his style when he says that Caiaphas being high priest that year prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad xi 51 52 he may possibly mean that this was revealed to the high priest by an extraordt Nn  Josh xxiv 29 t From An 1492 to An 1467  This place is in Judges ii 9 called Timnath Heres because of the image of the sun engraven on his sepulchre in memory of that famous day when the sun stood still till be had completed his victory This is asserted by several of the Jewish authors that memorials alluding to particu lar transactions in the lives of great men were frequently made use of to adorn their tombs Tully has recorded concerning Archimedes that a sphere and a cylinder were put upon his monument B  Since not only Procopius and Suidas but an earlier author Moses Chorenensis p 52 53 and perhaps from his original author Mariba Catina one as old as Alexander the Great sets down the famous inscription at Tangier concerning the old Canaanites driven out of Palestine by Joshua take it here in that author s own words  We are those exiles that were governors of the Canaanites but have been driven out by Joshua the robber and are VOL I â NOS 13  14 y 156 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS be taken without great difficulty through the strength of its walls and the nature of the place For this reason they removed their camp to Hebron and when they had taken it they slew all the inhabitants There were till then left the race of giants who had bodies so large and countenances so entirely dif ferent from other men that they were sur prising to the sight and terrible to the hear ing The bones of these men are shewn to this very day unlike to any credible relations of other men Now they gave this city to the Levites as an extraordinary reward with the suburbs of two thousand cubits But the land thereto belonging they gave as a free gift to Caleb according to the injunctions of Moses This Caleb was one of the spies which Moses sent into the land of Canaan they also gave land for habitation to the pos terity of Jethro the Midianite who was the father in law to Moses For they had left their own country and followed them and accompanied them in the wilderness Now the tribes of Judah and Simeon took the cities which were in the mountainous part of Canaan as also Ascalon and Ashdod of those that lay near the sea But Gaza and Ekron escaped them for they lying in a flat country and having a great number of cha riots sorely galled those that attacked them So these tribes when they were grown very rich by this war retired to their own cities and laid aside their weapons of war But the Benjamites to Whom belonged Je rusalem permitted its inhabitants to pay tri bute so they all left off the one to kill and the other to expose themselves to danger and had time to cultivate the ground The rest of the tribes imitated that of Benjamin and did the same and contenting themselves with the tributes that were paid them permitted the Canaanites to live in peace However the tribe of Ephraim when they besieged Bethel made no advance nor per formed any thing worthy of the time they spent and of the pains they took about that siege Yet did they persist in it still sitting down before the city though they endured great trouble thereby But after some time they caught one of the citizens that came to them to get necessaries and they gave him some assurances that if he would deliver up the city they would preserve him and his kindred So he sware that upon those terms he would put the place into their hands Accordingly he was preserved with his fa mily whue the Israelites slew all the other inhabitants and retained the city for them selves After this the Israelites grew effeminate as to fighting any more against their enemies but applied themselves to the cultivation of the land which producing great plenty and riches they neglected the regular disposition of their settlement and indulged themselves in luxury and pleasures Nor were they any longer careful to hear the laws that belonged nary voice from

government among several nations before the monar chies began viz That every city or large town with its neighbouring villages was a distinct government by itself Which is the more remarkable because this was certainly the form of ecclesiastical government that was settled by the apostles and preserved throughout the Christian church in the first age of Christianity Mr Addison is of opinion that it would be for the good of mankind to have all the mighty empires and monarchies of the world cantoned out into petty states and principalities that like so many large families might lie under the observation of their proper governors so that the care of the prince might extend itself to every individual person under his protection though he despairs of such a scheme being brought about and thinks that if it were it would quickly be destroyed Remarks on Italy 4to p 151 Nor is it unfit to be observed here that the Armenian records though they give us the history of thirty nine of their ancientest heroes or governors after the flood before the days of Sardana lus had no proper king till the 40th Pararus See Mora s Chorenensis p 55 and the note there And the Almighty God does not approve of such absolute or tyrannical monarchies and one may learn that reads Deut xvii 14â 20 and 1 Sam viii 1â 22 xii 1â 26 Although if such kings are set up as own him for their supreme King and

contrary to his directions they had spared the Canaanites and after that how those Canaanites as opportunity served used them very barbarously But the Israel ites though they were in heaviness at these admonitions from God yet were they still very unwilling to go to war And since they got large tributes from the Canaanites and were indisposed for taking pains by their luxury they suffered their aristocracy to be corrupted also and did not ordain themselves a senate nor any such magistrates as their laws had formerly required But they were very much given to cultivating their fields in order to get wealth which great indolence of theirs brought a terrible sedition upon them and they proceeded so far as to fight one against another from the following occa sion There was a Levite f a man of a vulgar family that belonged to the tribe of Ephraim and dwelt therein This man married a wife from Bethlehem which is a place belonging to the tribe of Judah Now he was very fond of his wife and overcome with her beauty but he did not meet with a return of affection for she was averse to him which did more inflame his passion for her So they quar relled one with another perpetually and at last the woman was so disgusted at these quarrels that she left her husband and went to her parents in the fourth month The husband being very uneasy at her departure went to his father and mother in law made up their quarrels and lived with them there four days as being kindly treated On the fifth day he resolved to go home and went aw y in the evening for his wife s parents were loth to part with their daughter and delayed the time till the day was gone Now they had one servant that followed them and an ass on which the woman rode and when they were near Jerusalem having gone al readyJ thirty furlongs the servant advised them to take up their lodgings somewhere lest some misfortune should befal them if they travelled in the night especially since they were not far off enemies that season often giving reason for suspicion of dangers from even such as are friends But the hus band was not pleased with this advice nor was he willing to take up his lodging among strangers for the city belonged to the Ca naanites but desired rather to go twenty furlongs farther and so take their lodging in some Israelite city Accordingly he came to Gibeah a city of the tribe of Benjamin when it was just dark and while no one that lived in the market place invited him to lodge with him there came an old man out of the field one that was indeed of the tribe of Ephraim but resided in Gibeah and asked him who he was for what reason he came thither so late and why he was looking out for pro visions for supper when it was dark to which he replied that he was a Levite and was bringing his wife from her parents and was going home but he told him his habitation was in the tribe of Ephraim So the old man as well because of their kindred as because they lived in the same tribe and also because they had thus accidentally met together took him to lodge with him Now certain young men of the inhabitants of Gibeah having seen the woman in the market place and ad miring her beauty when they understood that she lodged with the old man came to the doors as contemning the weakness and few ness of the old man s family And when the old man desired them to go away and not to offer any violence or abuse there they de sired him to yield them up the strange wo uan and then he should have no harm done to him And when the old man alleged that the Levite was of his kindred and that they would be guilty of horrid wickedness if  Josephus s early date of this history before the be ginning of the Judges or when there was no king in Israel Judges xix 1 is strongly confirmed by the large number of Benjamites both in the days of Asa and Jehoshaphat 2 Chron xtv 8 and xvi 17 who yet were here reduced to 6O0 men Nor can those numbers be at all supposed genuine if they were reduced so late as the end of the Judges where our other copies place this reduction t About An 1460 B C J Reland in his Palestina tom II p 810 finds a con tradiction in Josephus as to the distance of Gibeah of Saul in the tribe ofBenjamin from Jerusalem 30 furlongs here but of the War V 2 20 furlongs and no more Yet is there no necessity of making these two places to contra dict each other These 20 furlongs only they had now to go to Gibeah indeed but it was not from Jerusalem but from the place where they now were which might easily be eight or ten furlongs from Jerusalem in the way to Gibeah So that here does not appear any real contra diction at all  Nn2 158 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS they suffered themselves to be overcome by their pleasure and so offend against their laws they despised his righteous admonition and laughed him to scorn they also threat ened to kill him if he became an obstacle to their inclinations Whereupon when he found himself in great distress and yet was not willing to overlook his guests and see them abused he produced his own daughter to them and told them that it was a smaller breach of the law to satisfy their lust upon her than to abuse his guests supposing that he should by this means prevent an injury from being done to those guests When they no way abated of their earnestness for the strange woman but insisted absolutely on their desires to have her he intreated them not to perpetrate any such act of injustice but they proceeded to take her away by force and indulging still more the violence of their inclinations they took the woman away to their house and when they had abused her the whole night they let her go about day break So she came to the place where she had been entertained under great affliction at what had happened and durst not look her husband in the face for shame for she concluded that he would never for give her for what she had done So she fell down and gave up the ghost but her hus band supposed his wife was only fast asleep and thinking nothing of a more melancholy nature had happened endeavoured to raise her up resolving to speak comfortably to her since she did not voluntarily expose herself to those men s lust but was forced away to their house But as soon as he perceived that she was dead he acted as prudently as the greatness of the misfortune would admit and laid his dead wife upon the beast and carried her home Then cuttingt her limb by limb into twelve pieces he sent them to every   __  See Gen xix 8 t Interpreters say but little concerning the real views of the Levite in this transaction they merely intimate that it was done to excite a general indignation against the authors of the injury he had sustained His motives cer tainly were good and regular He intended to unite the whole nation in vengeance against a crime in which it was interested but as they might be checked in the extent of the punishment by the number the credit and the power of the offenders by the natural commiseration which is felt for those who are of the same blood or by an aver sion to involve a city in destruction he sought and seized a method which put them to the indispensable necessity of espousing his cause The only part which he had to take w s to cut in pieces the body of his wife which he did or else that of an ox or other like animal which had been either devoted or offered in sacrifice and to send a part of it to each tribe In consequence of this every tribe en tered into an indissoluble engagement to see justice done him for the injury he had received This is what the in terpreters of scripture seem not to have known and which it is necessary to explain The ancients had several ways of uniting themselves together by strict ties which lasted for a stipulated time amongst these may be noticed the sacrifice of Abraham the circumstances of which are mentioned Gen xvi 9 kc Another method was to take a bullock offered or de voted in sacrifice cut it into pieces and distribute it All who had a piece of this devoted bullock were thencefor ward connected and were to concur in carrying on the affair which had given occasion for the sacrifice But as this devoting and dividing was variously practised it also produced different engagements If he who was at the expense of the sacrifice were a public person or in high office he sent of his own accord a piece of the victim to all who were subject to him and by this act obliged them to enter into his views If the sacrifice were offered by a private person those only who voluntarily took a piece of the sacrifice entered into a strict engagement to espouse his interest Connections of this kind derived their force from the deities in honour of which the sacrifice was offered from the true God when made by the Jews from idols when made by the Gentiles The Jews were content to invoke and take the Lord to witness whereas the Pagans never failed to place upon an altar of green turf the deities which presided over their covenant These deities were called common because they were the common deities of all who were thus united and re ceived in common the honours which they thought proper to pay them A direct proof of these facts is recorded in 1 Sam xi 7 And Saul took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers saying Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen And the fear of the Lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent Another proof is drawn from the customs observed by the Scythians and Molos sians Lucian thus speaks of what passed between these people upon urgent occasions When any one had re ceived an injury and had not the means of avenging him self he sacrificed an ox and cut it into pieces which he caused to be dressed and publicly exposed then he spread out the skin of the victim and sat upon it with his hands tied behind him All who chose to

strength and ability They who had only their person engaged to march themselves Now an army composed of such soldiers far from retreating or disbanding was in vincible as it was engaged by oath These circumstances compared with the account given of the Levite s conduct and the subsequent behaviour of the tribes clearly point out that the method used by the Levite to obtain redress was consistent

inform the tribes of those that were the cause of his wife s death and of the violence they had offered her Upon this the people were greatly dis turbed at what they saw and heard as never having had the experience of such a thing before So they gathered themselves to Shi loli out of a just anger and assembling in a great congregation before the tabernacle they immediately resolved to take arms and to treat the inhabitants of Gibeah as enemies But the senate restrained them from doing so and persuaded them that they ought not so hastily to make war upon people of the same nation with them before they discoursed with them by words concerning the accusation laid against them It being part of their law that they should not bring an army against foreigners themselves when they appear to have been injurious without sending an am bassage first and trying thereby whether they will repent or not and accordingly they ex horted them to do what they ought in obedi ence to their laws that is to send to the in habitants of Gibeah to know whether they would deliver up the offenders to them and if they should deliver them up to rest satis fied with the punishment of those offenders but if they despised the message that was sent them to punish them by taking up arms against them Accordingly they sent to the inhabitants of Gibeah and accused the young men of the crimes committed in the affair of the Levite s wife and required of them those that had done what was contrary to the law that they might be punished as having justlyf deserved to die for what they had done But the inhabitants of Gibeah would not deliver up the young men and thought it too re proachful for them out of fear of war to sub mit to other men s demands upon them vaunting themselves to be no way inferior to any in war neither in their number nor in courage The rest of their tribe also made great preparation for war for they were so insolently mad also as to resolve to repel force by force When it was related to the Israelites what the inhabitants of Gibeah had resolved upon they took an oath that no one of them would give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite but that they would make war with greater fury against them than their forefathers had made war against the Canaanites Accord ingly they sent out an army of four hundred thousand against them while the Benjamites army wasJ twenty five thousand and six hun dred five hundred of whom were excellent at slinging stones with their left hands When the battle was joined at Gibeah the Benja mites beat the Israelites and of them there fell twenty two thousand men and probably more had been destroyed had not the night come on and broken off the fight So the Benjamites returned to the city with joy and the Israelites returned to their camp in great affliction at what had happened On the next day when they fought again the Benjamites beat them and eighteen thousand of the Israelites were slain and the rest deserted their camp out of fear of a great slaughter So they came toll Bethel a city that was near the camp andÂ fasted on the next day and besought God by Phineas the high priest that his wrath against them might cease and that he would be satisfied with these two de feats and give them the victory over their enemies Accordingly God promised them so to do by the prophesying of Phineas When therefore they had divided the army into two parts they laid the one half of them in ambush about the city Gibeah by night while the other half attacked the Benjamites these retiring upon the assault the Benja mites pursued them while the Hebrews re tired by slow degrees as desirous to draw them entirely from the city and the other followed them as they retired till both the old and young men that were left in the city as too weak to fight came running out toge ther as willing to bring their enemies under  See IV 8 and Deut xx 10 t Deut xxii 25 j Jiidg xx 46 47 II Josephus seems here to have made a small

way from the city the Hebrews turned back to fight them and gave the preconcerted signal to those that lay in ambush who rose up and with a great noise fell upon the enemy Now as soon as they perceived themselves to be deceived they knew not what to do and when they were driven into a certain hollow place which was in a valley they were shot at by those that encompassed them till they were all destroyed excepting six hundred which formed themselves into a close body of men and forced their passage through the midst of their enemies and tied to the neigh bouring mountains but the rest being about twenty five thousand were slain Then did the Israelites burn Gibeah and slew the women and the males that were under age They did the same also to the other cities of the Benjamites And indeed they were en raged to that degree that they sent twelve thousand men out of the army and gave them orders to destroy Jabesh Gilead because they did not join with them in fighting against the Benjamites Accordingly those that were sent slew the men of war with their children and wives excepting four hundred virgins To such a degree had they proceeded in their anger because they not only had the suffer ing of the Levite s wife to avenge but the slaughter of their own soldiers However they afterward were sorry for the calamity they had brought upon the Ben jamites and appointed a fast upon that ac count although they supposed those men had suffered justly for their offence against the laws So they recalled by their ambas sadors those six hundred which had es caped These had seated themselves on a certain rock called Rimmon which was in the wilderness So the ambassadors lamented not only the disaster that had befallen the Benjamites but themselves also by this de struction of their kindred and persuaded them to take it patiently and to come and unite with them and not so far as in them lay to give their suffrage to the utter destruc tion of the tribe of Benjamin and said to them  We give you leave to take the whole land of Benjamin to yourselves and as much prey as you are able to carry away with you So these men with sorrow confessed that what had been done was according to the decree of God and had happened for their own wickedness and assented to those that invited them and came down to their own tribe The Israelites also gave them the four hundred virgins of Jabesh Gilead for wives But as to the remaining two hundred they deliberated how they might obtain wives for them And whereas they had before the war taken an oath that no one would give his daughter to wife to any Benjamite some ad vised them to have no regard to what they had sworn because the oath had not been taken advisedly and judiciously but in a pas sion and thought that they should do nothing against God if they were able to save a whole tribe which was in danger of perishing and that perjury was only a sad dangerous thing not when it is committed out of necessity but with a wicked intention But when the senate were affrighted at the very name of perjury a certain person told them that he could shew them a way whereby they might pro cure wives for the Benjamites and yet keep their oath And on their asking what his proposal was he said Three times in a year when we meet in Shiloh our wives and our daughters accompany us Let then the Benjamites be allowed to steal away and marry such women as they can catch while we will neither incite nor forbid them And when their parents take it ill and desire us to inflict punishment upon them we will tell them that they were themselves the cause of what had happened by neglecting to guard their daughters and that they ought not to be over angry at the Benjamites since that anger had been permitted to rise up too high already So the Israelites were persuaded to follow this advice and decreed that the Benjamites should be allowed thus to steal themselves wives So when the festivalf was  Judg xxi 14 t All the three great festivals were to be observed in the place where God settled his habitation which was now at Shiloh and therefore some are of opinion that the feast here mentioned was one of these particularly they think it was the feast of tabernacles because this was a season of great joy for having newly gathered their vin tage and the only season wherein the Jewish virgins were allowed to dance At this time they dwelt in booths too behind which the Benjamites as they fancy might very conveniently conceal themselves and so watch an oppor tunity of carrying away the virgins But what seems to ait 1449 161 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS coming on these two hundred Benjamites lay in ambush before the city by two or three together and waited for the coming of the virgins in the vineyards and other places where they could lie concealed Accordingly the virgins came along playing and sus pected nothing of what was coming upon them and walked after an unguarded man ner So those that lay scattered in the road rose up and caught hold of them By this means these Benjamites got them wives and applied themselves to agriculture and took good care to recover their former happy state And thus was this tribe after they had been in danger of entirely perishing saved by the wisdom of the Israelites And accordingly it flourished and soon increased to be a mul titude and came to enjoy all other degrees of happiness And such was the conclusion of this war CHAP III OF THE MISFORTUNES BROUGHT UPON THE ISRAELITES BV THEIR INDOLENCE AND REMISSNESS THEIR OPPRESSION BV THE ASSYRIANS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT DELIVER ANCE BV OTHNIEL WHO RULED OVER THEM FORTY YEARS NOW it happened that the tribe of Dan suffered in the like manner with the tribe of Benjamin and on the following occa sion When the Israelites had already left off the exercise of their arms of war and were intent upon their husbandry the Canaanites despised them and brought together an army Not because they expected to suffer from them but because they had a mind to have a sure prospect of treating the Hebrews ill when they pleased and might thereby for the time to come dwell in their own cities more securely They prepared therefore their chariots and gathered their soldiers together Their cities also combined and drew over to them Ascalon and Ekron which were within the tribe of Judah and many more of those that lay in the plain They also forced the Danites to fly into the moun tainous country and left them not the least portion of the plain country to set their foot on Since then these Danites were not able to fight them and had not land enough for their own support they sent five of their men into the midland country to see for a land to which they might remove their habitation So these men went as far as the neighbour hood of mount Libanus and the fountains of the lesser Jordan at the great plain of Sidon a day s journey from the city And when they had taken a view of the land and found it to be exceeding fruitful they acquainted their tribe with it Whereupon they made an expedition with an army and built there the city of Dan of the same name with the son of Jacob and of the same name of their own tribe The Israelites now grew so indolent f that misfortunes came heavier upon them which also proceeded in part from their contempt of the Divine worship For when they had once fallen off from the regularity of their political government they indulged them selves farther in living according to their own will till they were full of the evil doings that were common among the Canaanites God therefore was angry with them and they for feited by their luxury that happy state which they had obtained by innumerable lahpurs For when Chushan king of the Assyrians had made war against them they lost many of their soldiers in the battle and when they were hesieged they were taken by force Nay there were some who out of fear vo luntarily submitted to him and though the tribute laid upon them was more than they could bear yet did they pay it and under went all sort of oppression for eight years After which time they were delivered in the following manner There was one whose name was Othniel the son of Kenaz of the tribe of Judah ar active man and of great courage He had make against this opinion is that at any of these public fes tivals the concourse of people would have been too great for a design of this nature to be put into execution since the violence which must of course have heen offered to the young women would hardly have met with a general connivance It is much more probable therefore that this was some festival peculiar to the people of Shiloh which the Benjamites perhaps might know nothing of and were therefore put in mind of it by the elders of the con gregation Josephus tells us that it was celebrated thricf every year and on this festival it might be a custom foi the voung women to go out into the fields and there dance by themselves which might

God not to overlook the Israelites in such a distress as they were now in but to endeavour boldly to regain their liberty So when he had procured some to assist him in this dangerous undertaking and few they were who either out of shame at their present circumstances or out of a desire of changing them could be prevailed on to assist him he first of all destroyed that garrison which Chushan had set over them And when it was perceived that he had not failed in his first attempt more of the people came to his assistance so they joined battle with the Assyrians and drove them entirely before them and compelled them to pass over the Euphrates Hereupon Othniel who had given such proof of bis valour re ceived from the multitude authority to judge the people And when he had ruled over them forty years he died CHAP IV OF THE SUBJUGATION OF THE HEBREWS BY THE MOABITES AND OF THEIR DELIVERANCE FROM SLAVERY BY EHUD WHO RETAINED THE DOMINION EIGHTY YEARS WHEN Othniel was dead the affairs of the Israelites fell again into disorder and while they never payed to God the honour due to him nor were obedient to the laws their afflictions increased till Eglon f king of the Moabites taking advantage of the dis orders of their political government made war upon them and overcame them in several battles and made the most courageous to submit and entirely subdued their army and ordered them to pay him tribute And when he had built him a royal palace atj Jericho he omitted no method whereby he might dis tress them and indeed he reduced them to Eoverty for eighteen years But when God ad once taken pity on the Israelites on ac count of their afflictions and was moved to compassion by their supplications he freed them from the hard usage they had met with under the Moabitea And this liberty he pro cured for them in the following manner There was a young man of the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Ehud the son of Gera a man of very great courage in bold undertakings and of a very strong body fit for hard labour but best skilled in using his left hand Â in which was his whole strength and he also dwelt at Jericho Now this man became familiar with Eglon and that by means of presents with which he obtained his favour and insinuated himself into his good opinion whereby he was also beloved of those that were about the king Now when on a time he was bringing presents to the king and had two servants with him he put a dag ger on his right thigh secretly and went in to him It was then summer time and the middle of the day when the guards were not strictly on their watch both because of the heat and because they were gone to dinner So the young man when he had offered his presents to the king who then resided in a small parlour that stood conveniently to avoid the heat fell into discourse with him for they were now alone the king having bid his attendants leave him because he had a mind to talk with Ehud He was now sitting on his throne and fear seized upon Ehud lest he should miss his stroke and not give him a deadly wound So he raised himself up and said he had a dream to impart to him by the command of God Upon this the king leaped out of his throne for joy of the dream so Ehud smote him to the heart and leaving his dagger in his body he went out and shut the door after him Now the king s servants were very still as supposing that the king had composed himself to sleep Hereupon Ehud informed the people of Jericho privately what he had done and ex horted them to recover their liberty They heard him gladly and went to their arms and sent messengers all over the country that should sound trumpets of rams horns for it was the custom to call the people together by  From An 1441 to 1401 t Judg iii 12 j It appears by the sacred history

Accordingly Josephus says it was at Jericho or rather in that fine country of palm trees upon or near the same spot of ground on which Jericho had formerly stood and on which it was afterwards rebuilt

happened they entered into his parlour and when they found him dead they were in great disorder and knew not what to do And before the guards could be got together the multitude of the Israelites came upon them So that some of them were slain immediately and some were put to flight and ran away toward the country of Moab in order to save them selves Their number was above ten thou sand The Israelites seized upon the ford of Jordan and pursued them and slew them and many they killed at the ford nor did one of them escape out of their hands And by this means it was that the Hebrews freed themselves from slavery under the Moabites Ehud also was on this account dignified with the government over all the multitude and died after he had held the government eighty years He was a man worthy of commenda tion even besides what he deserved for the aforementioned act of his After him Sham gar f the son of Anath was elected for their governor but died in the first year of his government  CHAP V OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE HEBREWS BY THE CANAANITES DURING TWENTY YEARS AND THEIR EMANCIPATION BY BARAK AND DEBORAH WHO RULED OVER THEM FORTY YEARS ND now it wasJ that the Israelites taking no warning by their former misfortunes  These 80 years for the government of Ehud are ne cessary to Josephus s usual large numbers between the Exodus and the building of the temple of 592 or 612 years but not to the smaller number of 480 years 1 Kings vi 1 which lesser number Josephus seems some times to have followed And since in the beginning of the next chapter it is said by Josephus that here was hardly a breathing for the Israelites before Jabin came and en slaved them it is highly probable that some of the copies in his time had here only eight years instead of 80 as had that of Theophilus of Antioch Ad Autoyle L III and this most probably from his copy of Josephus T Judg iii 31 t An 1375 I Judg iv 2 Â From An 1374 to 1354  The words Prophet and Prophetess are of very am

that was situate over the lake Semechonitis and had in pay three hundred thousand armed footmen and ten thousand horsemen with no fewer than three thousand chariots Sisera was the commander of all this army and was the principal person in the king s favour He so sorely beat the Israelites when they fought with him that he compelled them to pay tribute So they continued to undergo that hard ship forÂ twenty years as not good enough of themselves to grow wise by their misfor tunes God was willing also hereby the more to subdue their obstinacy and ingratitude towards himself So when at length thej were become penitent and were so wise as to learn that their calamities arose from their contempt of the laws they besought Deborah a certain prophetess whose name in th Hebrew tongue signifies a Bee to pray to God to take pity on them and not to overlook them now they were ruined by the Canaan ites So God granted them deliverance and chose for their general one Barak who was of the tribe of Naphthali and whose name in the Hebrew tongue signifies Lightning So Deborah sent for Barak and bid him choose out ten thousand young men to go against the enemy because God had said that that number was sufficient and promised them victory But when Barak said he would dued with the power of working miracles and foretelling things to come and sometimes they are used for persons endued with special though not miraculous gifts or graces for the better understanding and explaining the word of God and of this sort were the sons of the prophets or such as were brought up in the schools of the prophet As therefore we read nothing of any miraculous action that Deborah did she perhaps was only a woman of emi nent holiness and prudence and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures by which she was singularly qualified to judge the people i e to determine causes and controversies among them according to the word of God For though Jabin oppressed th m sorely yet it was rather by rigorous taxations than infringing their laws which he still suffered to be administered by their own officers And of this he might take the less notice because the supreme judicature was exercised by a woman from whose power anc au thority he thought there was no reason to apprehend any danger though this certainh gave her an opportunity cd Oo 164 book V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS not be the general unless she would go also as a general with him she had indignation at what he said and replied Thou O Barak deliverest up meanly that authority which God hath given thee into the hand of a wo man and I do not reject it So they col lected ten thousand men and pitched their camp at mount Tabor where at the king s command Sisera met them and pitched his camp not far from the enemy Whereupon the Israelites and Barak himself were so affrighted at the multitude of those enemies that they were resolved to march off had not Deborah retained them and commanded them to fight the enemy that very day for that they should conquer them and God would be their assistance So the battle began and when they were come to a close fight there came down from heaven a great storm with a vast quantity of rain and hail and the wind blew the rain in the face of the Canaanites and so darkened their eyes that their arrows and slings were of no advantage to them Nor would the coldness of the air permit the soldiers to make use of their swords This storm however did not so much incommode the Israelites because it came on their back They also took such courage upon the apprehension that God was assisting them that they fell upon the very midst of their enemies and slew a great number of them So that some of them fell by the Israelites some fell by their own horses which were put into dis order and not a few were killed by their own chariots At last Sisera as soon as he saw himself beaten fled away and came to a woman whose name was Jael a Kenite who received him when he desired to be concealed and when he asked for somewhat to drink she gave him sour milk t of which he drank so freely that he fell asleep But when he was asleep Jael took an iron nail and drove it through his temples with a hammer into the floor And when Barak came a little afterwards she shewed Sisera nailed to the ground J And thus was the victory gained by a woman as Deborah had foretold Barak also fought with Jabin at Hazor and when he met with him he slew him And when the general was fallen Barak overthrew the city to the foundation and was the commander of the Israelites for forty years CHAP VI OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE

here called a Kenite be cause originally she descended from those people who dwelt westward of the Dead Sea and extended themselves pretty far into Arabia Petraea The word Ken from which they took their name signifies a nest a hole or a cave and to this the prophet Balaam might allude when he ad dressed himself to them in these words â Strong is thy dwelling place and thou puttest thy nest on a rock  never theless the Kenites shall be wasted until Ashur shall carry thee away captive Numb xxiv 21 These Kenites indeed were some of the people whose lands God had promised to the descendants of Abraham nevertheless in consideration of Jethro all that submitted to the Israelites were permitted to live in their own country In Numb x 29 we find that Hobab was invited by Moses to accom pany him into the land of Canaan and in all probability he accepted the invitation At their first coming they settled themselves in the territories of Jericho but having contracted a particular friendship with the tribe of Jndah they removed with them into the country that fell to their lot Judg i 16 Every family of them however did not so for this Heber we find for some reasons that are not mentioned had settled his habitation in the tribe of Naph thali Jiidg i 11 The Kenites indeed though they were proselytes and worshipped the true God according to the Mosaic law yet being strangers by birth and so not pretending to any right or title to the land of Canaan held it best policy in these troublesome times to observe a neutrality and maintain peace as well as they could both with the Israelites and Canaanites and upon this footing it was that there was a peace between king Jabin and the house of Heber and that Sisera in his distress fled to Heber s tent for protection and put confidence in the feigned civilities of his wife Howell s Hist of the Bible B t Jael certainly shewed her regard for Israel by de stroying Sisera but it is as certain that she did not do it in the most honourable

ceiving him under their protection When Guy de Lusig nan king of Jerusalem was taken prisoner and was con ducted before Saladin he demanded drink and they gave him fresh water which he drank in

assistance and made war against the Israelites and were too hard for those that fought against them and when they had burnt the fruits of the earth they carried off the prey Now when they had done this for three years the multitude of the Israelites retired to the mountains and forsook the plain country They also made themselves hollows under ground and caverns and preserved therein whatsoever had escaped their enemies For the Midianites made expeditions in harvest time but permitted them to plough the land in winter that so when the others had taken the pains they might have fruits for them to carry away Indeed there ensued a famine and a scarcity of food upon which they be took themselves to their supplications to God and besought him to save them Gideon also f the son of Joash one of the principal persons of the tribe of Manasseh brought his sheaves of corn privately and threshed them at the wine press for he was too fearful of the enemies to thresh them openly in the threshing floor At this time somewhat appeared to him in the shape of a young man and told him that he was a happy man and beloved of God To which he im mediately replied A mighty indication of God s favour to me that i am forced to use this wine press instead of a threshing floor But the appearance exhorted him to be of good courage and to make an attempt for the recovery of their liberty He answered that it was impossible for him to recover it be cause the tribe to which he belonged was by no means numerous and because he was but young himself and too inconsiderable to think of such great actions But the other pro mised him that God would supply what he was defective in and would afford the Israel ites victory under his conduct Now therefore as Gideon was relating this thing to some young men they believed him and immediately an army of ten thousand men got ready for fighting But God stood by Gideon in his sleep and told him that man kind were too fond of themselves and were enemies to such as excelled in virtue Now that they might not pass God over but as cribe the victory to him and might not fancy it obtained by their own power because they were a great army and able of themselves to fight their enemies but might confess that it was owing to his assistance he advised him to bring his army about noon in the violence of the heat to the river and to esteem those  Judg vi 6 t It is generally supposed that Gideon s father had been a worshipper if not a priest of Baal and therefore it is not unlikely that he had by this time been convinced by his son that God had given him a commission to recover his people and to begin with this reformation and this made him appear so boldly in his son s cause because he knew it was the cause of God Pool s Annot and Patrick s Commentary B  He supposed that the dew which was distilled from heaven was a Divine gift as the Scripture after testifies and therefore he desired that it might be directed by God that though it commonly falls every where by his extra ordinary providence it might now only water his fleece Some are apt to think that he chose a fleece for this pur pose not only because it was ready at hand but the better to express how the land was shorn by the Midianites even as the sheep had been by him that when he begged the dew as a sign of the divine favour might fall upon the fleece it was to represent the kindness of God to him and when he begged it might fall upon the whole ground to represent his favour to all the people But there is further reason why he might desire to have the miracle inverted For as it is in the very nature of the wool to draw moisture to it some might be apt to think that there was no great matter in this and therefore he requested of God a second miracle which was contrary to the former Patrick s Commentary B  M Le Clerc is of opinion that the sacred historian has omitted one circumstance which nevertheless in the very nature of the thing is implied viz that Gideon when he led his men down to the water did forbid them to make use of any cup or pot or such like thing for lie thinks it incongruous as well he may that among such a number as ten thousand men no one should be furnished with some drinking vessel or other But then had any of these been permitted to be used upon this occasion the experiment could not have been made Comment on Judg vii 6 Interpreters are at a sad puzzle to conceive for what possible reason God made a distinction between the soldiers who lapped water in their hands and those that laid themselves down to drink Some of the Jewish doctors are of opinion that all except three hundred who lapped had been accustomed to the worship of Baal which they unwarily discovered by their kneeling to drink But this is groundless and far fetched conceit The notion of those who imputed these three hundred men s lapping some to their sloth and idleness and others to their timo rousness and the great fear they were in of being sur prised by the enemy is of no great validity For though God if he thought fit might have employed the most das tardly among them upon this expedition that the glory of the victory might entirely redound to himself yet since we are told all the fearful persons were dismissed before and since it but badly befits the character of the courageous to be lazy this action of lapping is rather to be accounted a Oo2 166 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS that bent down on their knees and so drank to be men of courage but for all those that drank hastily and tumultuously that he should esteem them to do it out of fear and as in dread of their enemies And when Gideon had done as God had suggested to him there were found three hundred men that took water with their hands tumultuously So God bid him take these men and attack the enemy Accordingly they pitched their camp at the river Jordan as ready the next day to pass over it Gideon was in great fear because God had told him beforehand that he should set upon his enemies in the night time But God being willing to free him from his fear bid him take one of his soldiers and go near the Midian itcs tents for that he should from that very place have his courage raised and grow bold So he obeyed and went and took his servant Phurah with him And as he came pear to one of the tents he discovered that those that were in it were awake and that one of them was telling his fellowvsoldier a dream of his own and that so plainly that Gideon could hear him The dream was this he thought he saw a barley cake such an one as could hardly be eaten by men it was so vile rolling through the camp and overthrow ing the royal tent and the tents of all the soldiers Now the other soldier explained this vision to signify the destruction of the army and told them what his reason was which made him so to conjecture viz That the seed called barley was all of it allowed to be of the vilest sort of seed and that the Israelites were known to be the vilest of all the people of Asia agreeably to the seed of barley And that what seemed to look big among the Israelites wasthis Gideon and the army that was with him And since thou sayest thou didst see the cake overturning our tents said he  I am afraid lest God hath granted the victory over us to Gideon When Gideon had heard this dream he was inspired with courage and commanded hie soldiers to arm themselves telling them of this vision of their enemies They also took courage upon what was told them and were ready to perform what he should command so Gideon divided his army into three parts and brought it out about the fourth watch of the nightjt each part containing a hundred men they all bare empty pitchers and lighted lamps in their hands that their onset might not be discovered by their enemies Each man had also a ram s horn in his right hand which he used instead of a trumpet The enemies camp took up a large space of ground for they had a great many camels and as they were divided into different na tions so they were all contained in one circle Now when the Hebrews did as they were ordered upon their approach to their ene mies and on the signal given sounded with their rams horns and brake their pitchers and set upon their enemies with their lamps and a great shout and cried Victory to Gideon by God s assistance a disorder and a fright seized on the other men while they were half asleep for it was night time as God would have it so that a few of them were slain by their enemies but the greatest part by their own soldiers on account of the di versity of their language and when they were once thrown into disorder they killed all that they met with as thinking thorn to be enemies also Thus there was a great slaugh token of their temperance and of the nobleness of their spirit which made them so desirous to engage the enemy that they would not stay to drink but though they were very thirsty contented themselves to moisten their mouths as we say with a little water whereas the rest indulged themselves so fir as to drink their bellyful But after all the true reason and design of this method seems to be only this That God was minded to reduce Gideon s army to a very small number which might very likely be done by this means For as the season of the year was hot and the generality of the soldiers weary thirsty and faint it w is most probable that they would lie down as indeed they did and refresh themselves plentifully and scarce to be expected that any great number would deny themselves in this matter Patrick s Comment and Saurin s Gideon clef ait des Madianies B  Judg vii 10 11 t The expression in the text is in the beginning of the middle watch For though the Romans in after ages di vided the night into four watches Matt xiv 25 yet in the eastern parts and in more ancient times it consisted but of three whereof the first began at six and continued four hours The second therefore is called the middle watch and began at eleven so that we may suppose that it was some time after this that Gideon alarmed the Midi anitish camp and the reason why he chose this part of the night to do it in is obvious because the trumpets would then seem to sound louder and the lights to shine brighter and so both increase the consternation of the enemy and conceal the smailness of his own army Pool s Annot B An 1507 167 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ter made and as the report of Gideon s vic tory came to the Israelites they took their weapons and pursued their enemies and overtook them in a certain valley encom passed with torrents a place which these could not get over so they encompassed them and slew them all with their kings Oreb and Zeeb but the remaining captains led those soldiers that were left which were about eighteen thousand and pitched their camp a great way off the Israelites How ever Gideon pursued them with all his army and joining battle with them cut off the whole enemies army and took the other leaders Zebah and Zalmunna and made them captives Now there were slain in this battle of the Midianites and of their auxil iaries the Arabians about a hundred and twenty thousand and the Hebrews took a great prey gold and silver and garments and camels and asses and when Gideon was come to his own country of Ophrah he slew the kings of the Midianites The tribe of Ephraim however was so dis pleased at the good success of Gideon that they resolved to make war against him ac cusing him because he did not tell them of his expedition against their enemies f But Gideon as a man of temper and that excelled  in every virtue pleaded that it was not the result of his own authority or reasoning that made him attack the enemy without them but that it was the command of God and that still the victory belonged to them as well as to those that were in the army and by this method of cooling their passions he brought more advantage to the Hebrews than by the success he had against their ene mies for he thereby delivered them from a sedition which was arising among them Yet did this tribe afterwards suffer the punish ment of this their injurious treatment of Gideon of which we will give an account in due time Hereupon Gideon would have resigned the government but being over persuaded re tained it forty years J and distributed justice to them as the people came to him in their differences and what he determined was es teemed valid by all and when he died he was buried in his own country of Ophrah CHAP VII â â OF THE JTTDGES WHO SUCCEEDED GIDEON AND THEIR WARi WITH THE ADJOINING NATIONS NOW Gideon had seventy sons that were legitimate for he had many wives but he had also by his concubine Drumah one that was spurious whose name was Abiine lech who after his father s death retired to Shecnem to his mother s relations for they were of that place and when he had got money of such of them as were eminent for many instances of injustice he came with them to his father s house and slew all his brethren except Jotham for he had the good fortune to escape and be preserved But Abimelech made tho government tyrannical and constituted himself a lord to do what he pleased instead of obeying the laws and he acted most rigidly against those that were the patrons of justice Now when on a certain time Â there was a public festival at Shechem and all the multi tude was there gathered together Jotham his brother

because they all descended from Abraham their common father so we may infer that there was little or no difference in them at this time Oreb in the Hebrew signifies a crow and Zeeb a wolf and these are no improper words to represent the saga ciousness and fierceness which should be in two such great commanders Nor was it an uncommon thing for great families in ancient times to derive their names from such like creatures hence the Corvini Gracchi Aquilini c among the Romans either as omens or monuments of their undaunted courage and dexterity in military achievements But after all it seems every whit as pro bable that these were only nick names which the Israel ites gave these two princes of Midian to denote their fierceness and rapaciousness of prey Bedford s Scripture Chronology lib v

from abroad the trees did not leave off their intentions to have a ruler so they thought proper to make the offer of that honour to the vine But when the vine was chosen it made use of the same words which the fig tree had used be fore and excused itself from accepting the government and when the olive tree had done the same the briar a sort of wood good for firing promised to take the government

this festival the She chemites who had now repented of having slain the sons of Gideon drove Abimelech away both from their city and their tribe whereupon he contrived how he might dis tress their

among the Jews as they are still in the eastern countries long before the time of jEsop or any other author that we know of Various are the reasons that may be assigned for the first invention of them but these two seem to be the principal 1 Because men would suffer themselves to be reprehended in this guise when they would not endure plain words and 2 Because they heard them with delight and pleasure and remembered them better than any grave or rational discourses The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them so that anointing was in use 200 years before the first king of Israel and they said unto the olive tree Reign over us But the olive tree said unto them Should I leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour God and man because oil was offered in sacrifice to God and fed the lamps of his house besides all the other uses wherein it was service able to man and go to be promoted over the trees And the trees said to tlie fig tree Come thou and reign over us But the Jig tree said to them Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit an apt representation of that content and fulness of pleasure which may be enjoyed in a private life and cannot without folly be exchanged for the trou bles and cares that men meet with in the managery of public affairs and go to be promoted over the trees Then said the trees unto tlte vine Come thou and reign over us And the vine said unto them Should I leave my wine which cheereth God and man a form of speech imitated by Hea then authors especially by Virgil Georg lib 2 where speaking of some generous wine he terms itâ mensis et diis accepta secundis since wine as well as oil was used both in Jewish and Heathen sacrifices and go to be pro moted over the trees Then said all the trees unto the bramble the meanest of all trees good for nothing but to be burnt and therefore fitly resembling Abimelech from whom the Shechemites could expect no manner of benefit but a great deal of trouble and vexation Come thou and reign over us And the bramble said unto the trees If in truth ye anoint me king then come and put your trust in my shadow an apt emblem of Abimelech s ridiculous vanity to imagine that he should be able to maintain the authority of a king any more than the bramble could afford a shadow or shelter and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon words that carry a lively image of Abimelech s ostentatious spirit and menaces to take severe vengeance on the nobles of Shechem such as the house of Millo who had been chiefly instrumental in his promotion in case they should desert him This is the parable and in some measure the interpretation The only difficulty is to know whom these trees are set to signify And here some have thought that by the olive tree we are to understand Othniel by the fig tree Deborah and by the vine Gideon for to the two former they suppose the offer of the kingdom was made for the services done their country and by them rejected as well aÂ by the last But for this there is no authority neither is there any necessity in the explication of such fables to assign a particular reason for every image that is drawn in them It is sufficient if we can but hit off their main in tendment which in this of Jotham was to convince the Shechemites of their folly in choosing a man for their king who was no more able to protect them than a bramble was to cover other trees that should resort to it under the shadow of its branches Saurin t Dissertations and Pa trick s Commentary B t Judg ix 21 an 1264 169 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS people went out and Gaal with them at the head of his soldiery bo they gathered their fruit with safety and when they were at supper in several companies they then ven tured to curse Abimelech openly and the magistrates laid ambushes in places about the city and caught many of Abimelech s followers and destroyed them Now there was one Zebul a magistrate of the Shechemites that had entertained Abim elech He sent messengers and informed him how much Gaal had irritated the people against him and excited him to lay ambushes before the city for that he would persuade Gaal to go out against him which would leave it in his power to be revenged on him and when that was once done he would bring him to be reconciled to the city So Abime lech laid ambushes and himself laid with them Now Gaal abode in the suburbs tak ing little care of himself and Zebul was with him Now as Gaal saw the armed men coming on he said to Zebul that some armed men were coming but the other replied they were only shadows of huge stones f and when they were come nearer Gaal perceived what was the reality and said they were not shadows but men lying in ambush Then said Zebul Didst not thou reproach Abim elech for cowardice why dost thou not then  Judg ix 27 t Our translation of the Book of Judges from the He brew represents Zebul as saying to Gaal upon his being alarmed at seeing troops of men making to him Thou seest the shadazes of the mountains as if they were men ch ix ver 36 Whereas Josephus represents him as telling him he mistook the shadow of the rocks for men A commentator might be at a loss to account for this change that had not read Deubdan s representation of some part of the Holy Land in which he tells us that in those places there are many detached rocks scattered up and down some growing out of the ground Voyage p 98 nd others are fragments broken off from rorky precipices the shadow of which it appears Josephus thought might be most naturally imagined to look like troops of men at a distance rather than the shadow of the mountains Har mer s Observations vol I p 98 Clarke s Edition B t In the text the expression is Then God sent an evil spirit or spirit of discord between Abimelech and the men of Shecliem Judg ix 23 which in Scripture is an un usual form of speech and denotes not any positive action but a permission only or at most a direction from God It is observed however that this manner of expression may possibly have given rise to some notions in the theo logy of the Heathens when they suppose that the furies appointed by the gods to sow the seeds of discord among men shew how very courageous thou art thyself and go and light him So Gaal being in disorder joined battle with Abimelech and some of his men fell whereupon he fled into the city and took his men with him But Zebul managed his matters so in the city that he procured them to expel Gaal out of the city and this by accusing him of cowardice in this action with the soldiers of Abimelech But Abimelech when he had learned that the Shechemites were again coming out to gather their grapes placed ambushes before the city and when they were come out the third part of his army took possession of the gates to hinder the citizens from returning whilst the rest pursued those that were scattered abroad and so there was slaughter every where and when he had overthrown the city to the very foundations for it was not able to bear a siege and had sown its ruins with salt he proceeded on with his army till all the Shechemites were slain As for those that were scattered about the country and so escaped the danger they were gathered toge ther unto a certain strong rock and settled themselves upon it and prepared to build a wall about but when Abimelech knew their intentions he prevented them and came upon them with his forces and laid fnggots of dry wood round the place he himself  1 Luctificam Alecto dirarum ab sede sororum Infernisque ciet tenebris cui tristia bella

example encouraging the soldiers to do the same And when the rock was encompassed round about with these faggots they set them on fire and threw in whatsoever by nature caught fire the most easily So a mighty flame was raised and nobody could fly away from the rock but every man perished with their wives and children in all about fifteen hun dred men and the rest were a great number also And such was the calamity which fell upon the Shechemites and men s grief on their account had been greater than it was had they not brought so much mischief on a person who had so well deserved of them and had they not themselves esteemed this as a punishment for the same Now Abimelech when he had affrighted the Israelites with the miseries he had brought upon the Shechemites seemed openly to affect greater authority than he now had and appeared to set no bounds to his violence unless it were with the destruction of all Accordingly he marched to Thebez and took the city suddenly and there being a great tower therein whereunto the whole multi tude fled he made preparation to besiege it Now as he was rushing with violence near the gates a woman threw a piece of a mill stone upon his head Upon which Abime lech fell down and desired his armour bearer to kill him lest his death should be thought to be the work of a woman So he under went this death f as a punishment for the wickedness he had perpetrated against his brethren and his insolent barbarity to the Shechemites Now the calamity that hap pened to those Shechemites was according to the prediction of Jotham However the army that was with Abimelech upon his fall was scattered abroad and went to their own homes Now it was thatJ Jair the Gileadite of the tribe of Manasseh took the government He was a man happy in other respects also but particularly in his children who were of a good character They were thirty in num ber and very skilful in riding on horses and were intrusted with the government of the cities of Gilead He kept the government twenty two years and died an old man and he was buried at Camot a city of Gilead And now all the affairs of the Hebrews were managed uncertainly and tended to disorder and to the contempt of God and of the laws So the Ammonites and Philistines had them in contempt and laid waste the country with a great army and when they had taken all Perea they were so insolent as to attempt to gain possession of all the rest But the Hebrews being now reformed by the calamities they had undergone made suppli cations to God and brought sacrifices to him beseeching him not to be too severe but to be moved by their prayers to leave off his anger against them So God became more merciful and was ready to assist them When the Ammonites had made an expe dition into the land of Gilead the inhabitants of the country met them at a certain moun tain but wanted a commander Now there was one whose name was Jephtha who both on account of his father s virtue and on ac count of that army which he maintained at his own expense was a potent man The Israelites therefore sent to him and intreated him to come to their assistance promising him the dominion over them all his life time N  Thus Plutarch relates that Pyrrhus at the siege of Argos was killed by a woman throwing a tile upon his head but there is something more remarkable in Abime lech s death by a stone because as he slew all his bre thren upon one stone for him to die by no other instru ment carried some stamp of his sin upon it The manner of his death however puts me in mind of what the same author records of the Spartan general Lysander who fell ingloriously under the wall of Haliartus Thus he died says he  but not like Cleombrotus who was slain while he was gloriously making head against an impetuous enemy at Leuctra not like Cyrus or Epaminondas who received a mortal wound while he was rallying his men and secu ring to them the victory These great men died in their callings They died the death of kings and commanders whereas he like some common soldier or one of the for lorn hope cast away his life ingloriously giving this testi mony to the ancient Spartans that they did well to avoid storming of walls in which the stoutest man may chance to fall by the hand not only of an abject fellow but by that of a boy or a woman as they say Achilles was slain in the gates of Troy by the hands of the effeminate Paris Patrick s Commentary and Plutarch s Comp of Lysander and Sylla B t An 1264 J Our present copies of Josephus all omit Tola among the Judges though the other copies have him next after Abimelech and allot 23 years to his administration Judg x 1 2 yet do all Josephus s commentators conclude that in Josephus s sum of the years of the Judges bis 23 years are included Whence we are to confess that somewhat has been here lost out of his copies II From an 1241 to 1219 6 C AN 1219 171 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS But he did not admit of their intreaty and accused them that they did not come to his assistance when he was unjustly treated and this in an open manner by his brethren For they cast him off as not having the same mother with the rest but born of a strange mother that was introduced among them by his father s fondness and this they did out of a contempt of his inability to vindicate him self So he dwelt in the country of Gilead as it is called and received all that came to him let them come from what place soever and paid them wages However when they pressed him to accept the dominion and sware that they would grant him the govern ment all his life he led them to the war When Jephtha had taken immediate care of their affairs f he placed his army at the city Mispeh and sent a message to the Ammonite king complaining of his unjust possession of their land But that king sent a contrary message and complained of the exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and desired him to go out of the land of the Amorites and yield it up to him as his paternal inheritance But Jephtha returned this answer that he did not justly complain of his ancestors about the land of the Amorites and ought rather to thank them that they left the land of the Am monites to them since Moses could have ta ken it also and that neither would he recede from that land of their own which God had obtained for them and they had now in habited above three hundred years but would fight with them about it When he had given this answer he sent the ambassadors away And when he had prayed for victory and had vowed to per form sacred offices and if he came home in safety to offer in sacrifice whatever living creature should first meet him he joined battle with the enemy and gained a great victory and in the pursuit slew the enemies all along as far as the city Minnith He then passed over the land of the Ammonites and overthrew many of their cities and took their prey and freed his own people from that sla very which they had undergone for eighteen years But as he came back he fell into a calamity no way correspondent to the great actions he had performed For it was his daughter that came to meet him she was also an only child and a virgin Upon this Jephtha heavily lamented the greatness of his affliction and blamed his daughter for being so forward in meeting him for he had vowed to sacrifice her to God However this acci dent that was to befall her was not ungrateful to her since she should die upon occasion of her father s victory and the liberty of her fellow citizens She only desired her father to give her leave for two months to bewail her youth with her companions and then she agreed that at the aforementioned time he might do with her according to his vow Â Accordingly when that time was over he sa crificed his daughter as a burnt offering offer ing such an oblation as was neither conform able to the law nor acceptable to God nor weighing with himself what opinion the hearers would have of such a practice Now the tribe of Ephraim fought against him because he did not take them along with him in his expedition against the Ammonites but because he alone had the prey and the glory of what was done to himself In an swer to their accusation he said first that they were not ignorant how his kindred had fought against him and that when they were invited they did not come to his assistance whereas they ought to have come quickly even before they were invited And in the next place that they were going to act un justly for while they had not courage enough  Judg xi 11 t An 1201 J Most copies want the word above By Josephus s large chronology it was much above 300 years but by the best chronology it was but 291 years which in a round number are justly called 300 years II JosephuÂ justly condemns Jephtha as do the Aposto lical Constitutions VII 37 for his rash vow whether it were for sacrificing his daughter as Josephus thought or for dedicating her who was his only child to perpetual virginity at the tabernacle or elsewhere  which I rather suppose If he had vowed her for a sacrifice she ought to have been redeemed Levit xxvii 1â 8 but of the VOL 1 â NOS 15  16 sense of verses 28 29 as relating not to things vowed to God but devoted to destruction see note on V 1 N B It here deserves to be remarked that in the Apostolical Constitutions VII 37 we have it distinctly observed among the many prayers of good men that were heard of God that the sacrifices and prayers of Gideon both at the rock and the fleeces were accepted only be fore his sins of Sampson in his thirst before his trans gression of Jephtha in the war before his rash vow of Manasseh in the land of the Chaldeans after his trans gression was repented of but not otherwise which facts are all true in the Old Testament History Â Judg xi 27 172 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to fight their enemies they came hastily against their own kindred And he threat ened them that with God s assistance he would inflict a punishment upon them unless they would grow wiser But when he could not persuade them he fought with them with those forces which he sent for out of Gilead and he made a great slaughter among them and when they were beaten he pursued them and seized on the passages of Jordan with a part of his army which he had sent be fore and slew about forty two thousand of them So when Jephtha had ruledt six years he died and was buried in his own country Sebee which is a place in the land of Gilead Ibzan then took the government being of the tribe of Judah and of the city Bethlehem He had sixty children thirty of them sons and the rest daughters all of which he left behind him giving the daughters in marriage to husbands and taking wives for his sons He did nothing in thej seven years of his administration that was worth recording or deserving a memorial So he died an old man and was buried in his own country When Ibzan was dead after this manner neither did Elon who succeeded him in the government and kept it ten years do any thing remarkable he was of the tribe of Zebulon AbdonÂ also the son of Hillel of the tribe of Ephraim and born at the city Pyrathon was ordained their supreme governor after Elon He is only recorded to have been happy in his children for the public affairs were then so peaceable and in such security that neither did he perform any glorious ac tion He had forty sons and by them left thirty grand children and he marched in state with these seventy who were all skilful in riding horses and he left them all alive after him He died an old man and obtained a magnificent burial in Pyrathon CHAP VIII OF THE BIRTH OF SAMPSON AND THE CALAMITIES HE BROUGHT UPON THE PHILISTINES AFTER Abdon was dead the Philistines overcame the Israelites and received tribute of them fortt forty years From which distress they were delivered after the follow ing manner There was one Manoah a person of such great virtue that he had few men his equals and without dispute the principal person of his country He had a wife celebrated for her beauty and excelling her contemporaries But he had no children and being uneasy at his want of posterity he intreated God to give them seed of their own bodies to succeed them and with that intent he came constantly into theJJ suburbs together with his wife which suburbs were in the great plain Now he was fond of his wife to a degree of mad ness and on that account was unmeasurably jealous of her Now when his wife was once alone an apparition was seen by her it was an angel of God and resembled a young man beautiful and tall who brought her the good news that she should have a son born by God s providence that should be a goodly child of great strength by whom when he was grown up to man s estate the Philistines should be afflicted He exhorted her also not to poll his hair and that he should avoid all kinds of drink except water for so had God commanded So the angel when he had delivered that message went his way his coming being by the will of God Now the woman informed her husband when he came home of what the angel had said who shewed so great an admiration of the beauty and stature of the young man that had appeared to her that her husband was astonished and out of himself for jealousy and such suspicions as are excited by that passion But she was desirous to have her husband s unreasonable sorrow taken away  111115 x 6 t From an 1201 to 1195 B C  From an 1195 to 1188  From an 1188 to 1178 Â The number of the years of Abdon s government which in the other copies are 8 are wanting in all our present copies of Josephus in the same manner as was Tola s entire government which I just now observed Nor is there any room to doubt but this is a bare omission of the scribes  Judg xii 15 tt From an 1178 to 1128  I can discover no reason why Manoah and his wife came so constantly into these suburbs to pray for chil dren but because there was a synagogue or place of devo tion in those suburbs AN 1178 173 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Accordingly she intreated God to send the angel again that he might be seen by her husband So the angel came again by the favour of God while they were in the sub urbs and appeared to her when she was alone without her husband She desired the angel to stay so long till she might bring her husband and that request being granted she went to call Manoah When he saw the angel he was not yet free from suspicion and desired him to inform him of all he had told his wife But when he said it was sufficient that she alone knew what he had said he then requested of him to tell him who he was that when the child was born they might re turn him thanks and give him a present He replied that he did not want any present for he did not bring them the good news of the birth of a son out of the want of any thing And when Manoah intreated him to stay and partake of his hospitality he did not give his consent However he was persuaded at the earnest request of Manoah to stay so long as while he brought him one mark of his hospi tality So he slew a kid of the goats and bade his wife boil it When all was ready the angel enjoined him to set the loaves and the flesh but without the vessels upon the rock Which when  they had done he touched the flesh with a rod which he had in his hand which upon the breaking out of a flame was consumed together with the loaves And the angel ascended in their sight up to heaven by means of the smoke as by a vehicle Now Manoah was afraid that some danger would come to them from this sight of God but his wife exhorted him to be of good courage for that God appeared to them for their benefit So the woman became pregnant and was careful to observe the injunctions that were given her And they called the child when it was born Sampson which name signifies one that is strong So the child grew apace and it appeared evidently that he would be af prophet both by the moderation of his diet and the permission of his hair to grow Now when he once came with his parents to Timnath a city of the Philistines when there was a great festival he fell in love with a maid of that country and desired of his pa rents that they would procure him the dam sel for his wife But they refused so to do because she was not of the stock of Israel Yet because this marriage was of God who intended to convert it to the benefit of the Hebrews he over persuaded them to procure her to be espoused to him And as he was continually coming to her parents he met a lion and though he was naked he received the animal s onset strangling him with his hands and cast his body into a woody piece of ground on the inside of the road Another time when he was going to the damsel he discovered a swarm of bees ma king their combs in the breast of the lion And taking three honey combs away he gave them together with the rest of his presents to the damsel Now the people of Timnath out of a dread of the young man s strength gave him during the time of the wedding feast for he then feasted them all thirty of the most stout of their youths in pretence to be his companions but in reality to be a guard upon him that he might not attempt to give them any disturbance Now as they were drinking merrily and playing Sampson said as was usual at such times  Come I propose you a riddle and if you can expound it in these seven days time I will give you every one a linen shirt and a garment as a reward of your wisdom So they being very ambi  Judg xiii 23 t Here by a prophet Josephus seems only to mean one that was born by a particular providence who lived after the manner of a

ancient the custom was which we find afterwards amongst the Greeks of proposing ques tions to be resolved in their compotations and feasts that they might not be spent merely in eating and drinking but that there might be something to exercise their wit and ingenuity Such riddles as were contrived to puzzle and perplex were called by the name of 7f 190s which the scholiast upon Aristophanes defines to be a question put among their cups See Bochart Hieroz lib iv cap 12 It should also be observed that they incurred a forfeiture equal to the reward if they failed altogether in their answers

very disagreeable And when they were not able in three days time to find out the meaning of the riddle they desired the damsel to discover it by the means of her husband and tell it them and they threatened to burn her if she did not tell it them So when the damsel intreated Sampson to tell it her he at first refused but when she lay hard at him and fell into tears and made his refusal to tell it a sign of his unkindness to her he informed her of his slaughter of a lion and how he found bees in his breast and carried away three honey combs and brought them to her Thus he suspecting nothing of deceit in formed her of all and she revealed it to those that desired to know it Then on the seventh day whereon they were to expound the riddle proposed to them they met together before the sun setting and said Nothing is more disagreeable than a lion to those that light on it and nothing is sweeter than honey to Thy spousal ornament neglected lies Arise prepare the bridal train arise Odyas vi 29 Pope Dacier is of opinion that the custom now alluded to pre vailed amongst the Israelites and that the proposition made by Sampson is grounded upon it From this sentiment Mr Pope dissents I am rather of opinion he says that what is said of Sampson has relation to another cus tom amongst the ancients of proposing an aenigma at fes tivals and adjudging a reward to him that solved it These the Greeks called ygupxs ffufjwroTixos B  There is reason to think that there was nothing new or uncommon in this operation as it was most obvious for the end proposed that the wit of man could devise We accordingly find that Ovid alludes to the practice and mentions that foxes and fire brands were every year ex hibited at Rome and killed in the Circus For it was the custom in many places to sacrifice by way of retaliation every animal whether goat or swine which did particular injury to the fruics of the earth In consequence of this they introduced these foxes which had been employed for that purpose with fire brands Cur igitur missae vinctis ardentia teedis Terga ferant vulpes causa docenda mihi He then mentions an instance of much injury done by a fox so accoutred by fire Qua fugit incendit vestitos messibus agros Daninosis vires ignibus aura da bat On this account the whole race according to the poet were condemned at the festival called Cerealia to be in their turns set on fire those that make use of it To which Samp son made this reply Nothing is more de ceitful than a woman for such was the per son that discovered my interpretation to you Accordingly he gave them the presents he had promised them making such Askelonites as met him upon the road his prey who were themselves Philistines also But he divorced his wife and the girl despised his anger and was married to his companion who made the former match between them At this injurious treatment Sampson was so provoked that he resolved to punish all the Philistines as well as her So it being then summer time and the fruits of the land being almost ripe enough for reaping he caught three hundred foxes and joining lighted torches to their tails he sent them into the fields of the Philistines by which means the fruits of the land perished Now when the Philistines knew that this was Sampson s doing and knew also for what cause he did it they sent their rulers to Timnath and burnt his former wife and her relations who had been the occasion of their misfortunes Ut ne luat paenas gens haec Cerealibus ardet Qjioque modo segetes perdidit ipsa perit Fast lib iv 681 707 It is alluded to proverbially more than once by Lyco phron and seems to have been well known in Greece He makes Cassandra represent Ulysses as a man both of cunning and mischief and styles him very properly yafjwroupis a fox with a fire brand at his tail for wherever he went mischief followed v 344 Suidas also takes notice of this custom when he speaks of a kind of beetle which the Boeotians named Tipha They imagined that if to this they were to fasten some inflammable matter it would be easy to set any thing on fire He adds that this was sometimes practised with foxes Bryant s Observa tions p 164 The Caliph Vathek being under the necessity when on his travels of lighting torches and making extraordinary fires to protect himself and his attendants from the fury of the wild beasts that were ready to make an attack on them set fire to a forest of cedar that bordered on their way Accidents of this kind in Persia are not unfrequent Hist of Caliph Vathek p 250 It was an ancient custom with the kings and great men to set fire to large bunches of dry combustibles fastened round wild beasts and birds which being then let loose the air and earth appeared one great illumination and as those terrified creatures natu rally fled to the woods for shelter it is easy to conceive that conflagrations would often happen which must have been peculiarly destructive Richardson s Dissert p 185 This circumstance reminds us of the destruction occasioned among the standing corn the vineyards and olives of the Philistines In Psalm Ixxxiii 14 there is a reference to one of these fires though arising from another cause See also Homer II ii 455 B AN 1158 J 175 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When Sampson had slain many of the Phi listines in the plain country he dwelt at Etam which is a strong rock of the tribe of Judah For the Philistines at that time made an expedition against that tribe But the people of Judah said they did not act justly with them in inflicting punishments upon them while they paid their tribute and this only on account of Sampson s offences They answered that in case they would not be blamed themselves they must deliver up Sampson and put him into their power So they being desirous to exculpate themselves came to the rock with three thousand armed men and complained to Sampson of the bold insults he had made upon the Philistines who were men able to bring calamity upon the whole nation of the Hebrews and they told him they were come to take him and to de liver him up to them and put him into their power So they desired him to bear this willingly Accordingly when he had received assurance from them upon oath that they would do him no other harm than only to de liver him into the enemy s hands he came down from the rock and put himself into the power of his countrymen Then did they bind him with two cords and lead him on in order to deliver him to the Philistines and when they came to a certain place which is now called the Jaw Bone on account of the great action there performed by Sampson though of old it had no particular name the Philistines who had pitched their camp not far off came to meet them with joy and shouting as having done a great thing and gained what they desired But Sampson brake his bonds asunder and catching up the jaw bone of an ass that lay at his feet he fell upon his enemies and smiting them with his jaw bone slew a thousand of them and put the rest to flight in great disorder f Upon this slaughter Sampson was too proud of what he had performed and said that this did not come to pass by the assist ance of God but that his success was to be ascribed to his own courage and vaunted himself that it was out of dread of him that some of his enemies fell and the rest ran away upon his use of the jaw bone But when a great thirst came upon him he con sidered that human courage is nothing and bare his testimony that all is to be ascribed to God and besought him that he would not be angry at any thing he had said nor give him up into the hands of his enemies but afford him help under his affliction and de liver him from the misfortunes he was under Accordingly God was moved with his in treaties and raised him up a plentiful foun tain of sweet water at a certain rock Whence it was that Sampson called the placeJ the Jaw Bone and so it is called to this day After this fight Sampson held the Philis tines in contempt and came to Gaza and took up his lodging in a certain inn When the rulers of Gaza were informed of his com ing thither they seized upon the gates and  Judg xv 15 t Setting aside the various interpretations which have been given of this expression the Editor of Calmet s Dictionary proposes to illustrate it by the following ex tract It appears probable from the following circum stances that the exercise of wrestling as it is now per formed by the Turks is the very same that was anciently used in the Olympic games For besides the previous covering of the palaestra with sand that the combatants might fall with more safety they have their pellowan bashee or master wrestler who like the ayuvoderiis of old is to observe and superintend the jura palaestra and to be the umpire in all disputes The combatants after they are anointed all over with oil to render their naked bodies the more slippery and less easily to be taken hold of first of all look one another stedfastly in the face as Diomede or Ulysses does the palladium upon antique gems They then ran up to and retire from each other several times using all the while a variety of antic and other postures such as are commonly used in the course of the ensuing conflict after this prelude they draw nearer together and challenge each other by clapping the palms of their hands first upon their own knees or thighs then upon each other and afterwards upon the palms of their respective antagonists The challenge being thus given they immediately close in and struggle with each other striving with all their strength art and dexterity which are often very extraordinary which shall give his antagonist a fall and become the conqueror Durtng these contests I have often seen their arms legs and thighs so twisted and linked together that they have both fallen together and left the victory dubious too difficult sometimes for the pellowan bashee to decide Shaw s Trav p 217 Do not these well deserve the description of leg and thigh men or shoulder and thigh men The name seems to be taken from their very attitudes and correctly to ex press them If this idea be admitted it cannot be difficult to understand the above cited expression B J This fountain called Leti or the Jaw Bone is still in being as travellers assure us and was known by this very name in the days of Josephus and hath been known by the same name in all past ages See Antiq VII 12 the Annals of Glycas and the itinerary of Antoninus ap Reland Palestin torn II p 752 170 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS placed men in ambush about them that he might not escape without being perceived but Sampson who was acquainted with their contrivances arose about midnight and ran by force upon the gates with their posts and beams and the rest of their wooden furniture and carried them on his shoulders to the mountain that is over Hebron and there laid them down However he at lengtht transgressed the law of his country and altered his own re gular way of living and imitated the strange customs of foreigners which thing was the beginning of his miseries For he fell in love with a woman that was a harlot among the Philistines her name was Delilah and he lived with her So those that administered the public affairs of the Philistines came to her and persuaded her to attempt a discovery of that strength by which Sampson became unconquerable to his enemies Accordingly when they were drinking and had the like conversation together she pretended to ad mire the actions he had done and contrived to get out of him by subtilty by what means he so much excelled others in strength Sampson in order to delude Delilah for he had not yet lost his senses replied that if he were bound with seven such green withs of a vine as might still be wreathed he should be weaker than any other man The woman said no more then but told this to the rulers of the Philistines and hid certain of their soldiers in ambush within the house and when he was disordered in drink and asleep she bound him as fast as possible with the withs and then upon her awakening him she told him some of the people were upon him but he brake the withs and endeavoured to defend himself as though some of his ene mies were really upon him Now this woman in the constant conversation Sampson had with her pretended that she took it very ill that he had such little confidence in her affec tion that he would not tell her what she de sired as if she would not conceal what she knew it was for his interest to have concealed However he deluded her again and told her that if they bound him with seven cords he should lose his strength And when upon doing this she gained nothing he told her the third time that his hair should be woven into a web but the truth was not yet disco vered At length however Sampson upon Delilah s intreaty for he was doomed to fall into some affliction was desirous to please her and told her that God took care of him and that he was born by his providence and therefore he suffered his hair to grow God having charged him never to cut it J and thence his strength was according to the in crease and continuance of his hair When she had learned thus much and had deprived him of his hair she delivered him up to his enemies when he was not strong enough to defend himself So they put out his eyes and bound him and had him led about among them But in process of time Sampson s hair grew again And there was a public festival among the Philistines when the rulers and those of the most eminent characters were feasting together Â Now the room wherein they were had its roof supported by two pillars So  Judg xvi 3 t See this justly observed in the Apostolical Constitu tions VIII 37 that Sampson s prayer was heard but that it was before this his transgression J Pliny Nat Hist lib xii cap 20 has preserved the memory of several men remarkable for their great strength The heathens were so well acquainted with the circumstances of Sampson s history that from it they formed the fable of Nisus the king of Megara upon whose hair the fortune of his kingdom depended Patrick in locum B II Judg xvi 21 Â Some persons have asserted that no building suffi ciently capacious to receive so great a number of people could be constructed so as to rest chiefly upon two pillars But this is a mistake for Pliny Nat Hist lib xxxv cap 15 mentions two theatres built by C Curio who was killed in the civil wars on Caesar s side which were made of wood and so extensive as according to his mode of writing to hold all the Roman people They were contrived with such art that each of them depended upon one hinge This caused Pliny to censure the madness of the people who would venture into a place for their pleasure where they sat tarn infida instabiliqve sede on such an uncertain and unstable seat for if that hinge had given way there had been a greater slaughter than at the battle of Cannae This entirely removes any imaginary difficulty of this nature at least from the history of Sampson The Eastern method of building may assist us in accounting for the particular structure of the temple or house of Dagon Judg xvi and the great number of people that were buried in the ruins of it by pulling down the two principal pillars We read v 27 that about three thousand persons were upon the roof to behold while Sampson made sport Sampson must therefore have been in a court or area below them and consequently the temple will be of the same kind with the ancient tc aev  or sacred inclosures surrounded only in part or AN 1158 177 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the r sent for Sampson and he was brought to their feast that they might insult him in their cups Hereupon he thinking it one of the greatest misfortunes if he should not be able to revenge himself when he was thus insult ed persuaded the boy that led him by the hand that he was weary and wanted to rest himself and desired he would bring him near the pillars And as soon as he came to them he rushed with force against them and overthrew the house by overturning its pil lars with three thousand men in it who were all slain and himself with them And such was the end of Sampson when he had ruled over the Israelitesf twenty years And indeed this man deserves to be admired for his courage and strength and his magna nimity at his death and that his wrath against his enemies went so far as to die himself with them But as for his being ensnared by a woman that is to be ascribed to human nature which is too weak to resist the temp tations to that sin But we ought to bear him witness that in all other respects he was one of extraordinary virtue His kindred took away his body and buried it in Sarasai his own country with the rest of his family CHAP IX OF THE MARRIAGE OF BOOZ AND RUTH FROM WHOM CAME OBED THE GRANDFATHER OF DAVID NOW after the death of Sampson Eli the high priest was governor of the Israel ites Under him f when the country was af flicted with a famine Elimelech of Bethle hem which is a city of the tribe of Judah being not able to support his family under so sore a distress took with him Naomi his wife and the children that were born to him by her Chilion and Mahlon and removed his habitation into the land of Moab and upon the happy prosperity of his affairs there he took for his sons wives of the Moabites Orpah for Chilion and Ruth for Mahlon But in the compass of ten years both Eli melech and a little while after him the sons died and Naomi being very uneasy at these accidents and not able to bear her lonesome condition now those that were dearest to her were dead on whose account it was that she had gone away from her own country she returned to it again for she had been informed that it was now in a flourishing condition However her daughters in law were not able to think of parting with her and when they had a mind to go out of the country with her she could not dissuade them from it But when they insisted upon it she wished them a more happy wedlock than they had with her sons and that they might have prosperity in other respects also and seeing her own affairs were so low she exhorted them to stay where they were and not to think of leaving their own country and partaking with her of that uncertainty under which she must return Accordingly Orpah stayed behind but she took Ruth along with her as she could not be persuaded to stay behind but would share her fortune whatsoever it should prove When Ruth was come with her mother in law to Bethlehem Booz who was near of kin to Elimelech entertained her And when Naomi was so called by her fellow citizens according to her true name she said You might more truly call me Mara Now Naomi signifies in the Hebrew tongue Happiness and Mara Sorrow It was now reaping time and Ruth by the leave ol altogether with some plain or cloistered buildings Sev eral palaces and dau wanas as they called the courts of justice in these countries are built in this fashion where upon their festivals or rejoicings a great quantity of sand is strewed upon the area for the wrestlers to fall upon whilst the roof of the cloisters round about is crowded with spectators of their strength and agility I have often seen several hundreds of people diverted in this imnner upon the roof of the dey s palace at Algiers which like many more of the same quality and denomi nation hath an advanced cloister over against the gate of the palace Esther v 1 made in the fashion of a large pent house supported only by one or two contiguous pil lars in the front or else in the centre In such open structures as these in the midst of their guards and counsellors are the bashas kadeeSj and other great offi cers assembled to distribute justice and transact the public affairs of their provinces Here likewise they have their public entertainments as the lords and others of the Philistines had in the house of Dagon Upon a sup position therefore that in the house of Dagon there was a cloistered structure of this kind the pulling down of the front or centre pillars only which supported it would be attended with the like catastrophe that happened to the Philistines Shaw t Travels p 283 B  Judg xvi 27 30 T From about 1158 to 1138 B C t According to the date 1350 it must have been long before the government of Eli II Ruthi 19 178 book v ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS her mother in law went out to glean that they might get a stock of corn for their food Now it happened that she came into Booz s field and after some time Booz came thither and when he saw the damsel he enquired of his servant that was set over the reapers concerning the girl The ser vant had a little before enquired about all her circumstances and told them to his master Booz then kindly embraced her both on account of her affection to her moth er in law and her remembrance of that son of her s to whom she had been married and wished that she might experience a prosperous condition So he desired her not to glean but to reap what she was able and gave her leave to carry it home He also gave it in charge to that servant who was over the reapers not to hinder her when she took it away and bade him give her her dinner and make her drink when he did the like to the reapers Now what corn Ruth received of him she kept for her mother in law and carried it to her in the evening And Naomi had kept for her a part of such food as her neighbours had plentifully bestowed upon her Ruth also told her mother in law what Booz had said and when the other had informed her that he was near of kin to them and perhaps was so pious a man as to make some pro vision for them she went out again on the days following to gather the gleanings with Booz s maid servant It was not many days before Booz after the barley was winnowed slept in his thresh ing floor When Naomi was informed of this circumstance she contrived that Ruth should lie down by him for she thought that it might be for their advantage that he should discourse with the girl Accordingly she sent the damsel to sleep at his feet who went as she bade her for she did not think it consistent with her duty to contradict any command of her mother in law And at first  Roth iii 13 t It is not easy to give an account of the origin of this custom but the reason of it is plain it being a natural signification that he resigned his interest in the land by giving him his shoe wherewith he used to walk in it that he might enter into and take possession of it himself The Targum instead of the shoe hath right hand glove it being then the custom perhaps to give that in room of the shoe X she lay concealed from Booz as he was fast asleep but when he awaked about midnight and perceived a woman lying by him he asked who she was and when she had told him her name and desired that he whom she owned for her lord would excuse her he said no more but in the morning before the servants began to set about their work he waked her and bid her take as much barley as she could carry and go to her mother in law before any body should see that she had lain down by him because it was but prudent to avoid any reproach that might arise on that account especially when there had been nothing done that was ill but as to the main point she aimed at the matter should rest here He that is nearer of kin than 1 am shall be asked whether he wish to take thee to wife if he says he does thou shalt follow him but if he refuse I will marry thee according to the law When she had informed the mother in law of this they were very glad of it out of the hope they had that Booz would make pro vision for them Now about noon Booz went down into the city and gathered the senate together and when he had sent for Ruth he called for her kinsman also And when he was come he asked him whether he did not retain the inheritance of Elim elech and his sons he confessed that he did retain it as he was permitted to do by the laws because he was their nearest kins man Then said Booz Thou must not remember the laws in part but do every thing according to them For the wife of Mahlon is come hither whom thou must marry according to the law in case thou wilt retain their fields So the man yielded up both the fields and the wife to Booz who was himself of kin to those that were dead as alleging that he had a wife already and children also So Booz called the senate to witness and bid the woman to loose his shoe f and spit in his face according to the In latter times the Jews delivered a handkerchief for the same purpose So R Solomon Jarchi says we ac quire or buy now by a handkerchief or veil instead of a shoe The giving of a glove was in the middle ages a ceremony of investiture in bestowing lands and dignities In A D 1002 two bishops were put in possession of their sees each by receiving a glove So in England in the reign of Edward the Second the deprivation rf gloves was a ceremony of degradation â With regard to AN 1183 179 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS law And when this was done Booz married Ruth and they had a son within a year s time Naomi was herself a nurse to his child and by the advice of the women call ed him Obed as being to be brought up in order to be subservient to her in her old age For Obed in the Hebrew dialect signifies a servant The son of Obed was Jesse and king David was his son who left his domi nions to his sons for one and twenty gene rations I was therefore obliged to relate this history of Ruth because I had a mind to demonstrate the power of God who with out difficulty can raise those that are of ordinary parentage to dignity and splendour to which he advanced David though he were born of such mean parents CHAP X OF THE BIRTH OF SAMUEL AND HIS PREDICTION OF THE CALAMITY THAT BEFEL THE SONS OF ELI AND now upon the ill state of the af fairs of the Hebrews they made war again upon the Philistines The occasion was this Eli the high priest had two sons Hophni and Phineas who were guilty of injustice towards men and of impiety to wards God and abstained from no sort of wickedness Some of their gifts they carried oft as belonging to the honourable employ ment they had others of them they took away by violence They also were guilty of impurity with the women that came to wor ship God at the tabernacle Nay the whole course of their life was no better than ty ranny f Their father therefore was angry at them for such wickedness and expected that God would suddenly inflict his punishments upon them for what they had done The multitude took it heinously also And as soon as God had foretold what calamity would befall Eli s sons which he did both to Eli himself and to Samuel the prophet who the shoe as a token of investiture Castell Lex Polyg col 2342 mentions that the Emperor of the Ahyssinians used the casting of a shoe as a sign of dominion See Psalm lx 8 To these instances the following may pro perly be added Childebert the Second was fifteen years old when Gontram his uncle declared he was of age and capable of governing by himself I have put gays he  this Javelin into thy hands as a token that I VOL I â nos 15  16 was yet but a child he openly shewed his sorrow for his son s destruction I will first despatch what I have to say about the prophet Samuel and after that will proceed to speak of the sons of Eli and the miseries which they brought upon the whole people of the Hebrews Elcanah a Levite one of a middling condition among his fellow citizens and one that dwelt at Rama thaim a city of the tribe of Ephraim mar ried two wives Hannah and Peninnah He had children by the latter but he loved the other best although she were barren Now Elcanah came with his wives to the city Shiloh to sacrifice for there it was that the tabernacle of God was fixed Now after he had sacrificed he distributed at that festival portions of the flesh to his wives and children and when Hannah saw the other wife s children round about their mother she burst into tears on account of her barren ness and suffering her grief to prevail over her husband s consolations she went to the tabernacle to beseech God to make her a mother and to vow to consecrate the first son she should bear to the service of God and this in such a way that his manner of living should not be like that of ordinary men And as she continued at her prayers a long time Eli the high priest who sat before the tabernacle bade her go away thinking she had been disordered with wine but when she said she had drank water but was in sorrow for want of children and was be seeching God for them he exhorted her to be of good cheer and told her that God would grant her request J So she came to her husband full of hope and ate her meal with gladness And when they returned to their own country she found herself pregnant and they had a son born to them to whom they gave the name of Samu el which may be styled one that was asked of God They therefore came to the taber nacle to offer sacrifice for the birth of the child and brought their tithes with them but have given thee all my kingdom And then turning to wards the assembly he added  You see that my son Childebert has become a man Obey him Montes quieu Spirit of Lares vol i p 361 B

might become a prophet Accordingly his hair was suffered to grow long and his drink was water So Samuel was brought up in the temple But Elcanah had other sons of Han nah and three daughters When Samuel was twelve years old f he began to prophesy and when he was once asleep God called to him by name but he supposing he had been called by the high priest came to him but when the high priest said he did not call him God did so thrice Eli was then so far illuminated that he said to him Indeed Samuel I was silent now as well as before It is God that calls thee Do thou therefore signify unto him and say I am here ready So when he heard God speak again he desired him to speak and to deliver what oracles he pleased for he would not fail to perform any ministration he should make use of him in To which God replied  Since thou art here ready learn what miseries are coming upon the Israelites such indeed as words cannot declare nor faith believe For the sons of Eli shall die in one day and the priesthood shall be transferred into the family of Eleazar for Eli hath loved his sons more than my worship and to such a degree as is not for their advantage This message Eli obliged the prophet by oath to tell him for otherwise he had no inclination to afflict him by repeating it And now Eli had a far more sure expectation of the perdition of his sons but the glory of Samuel increased more and more it being found by experience that whatsoever he prophesied came to pass ac  cordingly CHAP XI OF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH BEFEL THE SONS OF ELI THE ARK AND THE PEOPLE AND OF THE DEATH OF ELI ABOUT this timeÂ the Philistines made war against the Israelites and pitched their camp at the city Aphec Now when the Israelites had expected them a little while the very next day they joined battle but the Philistines were conquerors and slew about four thousand of the Hebrews and pursued the rest of the multitude to their camp The Hebrews being now afraid of the worst sent to the senate and to the high priest and desired that they would bring the ark of God that by putting themselves in array when it was present with them they might be too hard for their enemies as not reflecting that he who had condemned them to endure these calamities was greater than the ark and for whose sake it was that the ark came to be honoured So the ark came and the sons of the high priest with it having received an assurance from their father that if they pretended to survive the taking of the ark they should come no more into his pre sence For Phineas officiated already as high priest his father having resigned his office to him by reason of his great age So the Hebrews were full of courage as supposing they should be too hard for their enemies the  Josephus here says that Samuel was brought up in the holy place or the temple that is in the sacred build ings about the tabernacle as is the holy house used by Josephus for the tabernacle itself VI 12 and in many other places t About an 1170

extracts In Abys sinia there is an officer named Kal Hatze who stands always upon steps at the side of the lattice window where there is a hole covered in the inside with a curtain of green taffeta behind this curtain the king sits Brace s Trav vol iv p 76 The king is described in another place as very much concealed from public view He even covers his face on audiences or public occasions and when in judgment On cases of treason he sits within his balcony and speaks through a hole in the side of it to an officer called Kal Hatze the voice or word of the king by whom he sends his questions or any thing else that occurs to the judges who are seated at the council table Brace s Trav vol iii p 266 If such a custom ever obtained among the Jews the propriety of the expression the word of the Lord is obvious as the idea must have been very familiar to them This clearly appears to have been the case as to Joseph and his brethren Gen xlii 23 Joseph spake by an interpreter not of languages but of dignity and state Other instances of the same nature may probably be traced in 2 Kings v 10 Job xxxiii 23 B II Although there had been a few occasional prophets before yet was this Samuel the first of a constant succes sion of prophets in the Jewish nation as it is implied in St Peter s words Acts iii 24 Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days See also Acts xiii 20 The others were rather sometimes called righteous men See Matt x 41 xiii 17 Constitut VIII 12 Â An 1143  He was 08 years old See 1 Sam iv 15 AN 181 1148 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Philistines also were greatly afraid of the ark coming to the Israelites however the event did not prove agreeable to the expectation of either side but when the battle was joined that victory which the Hebrews expected was gained by the Philistines and what de feat the Philistines were afraid of fell to the lot of the Israelites and thereby they found that they had put their trust in the ark in vain for they were presently beaten as soon as they came to a close fight with their ene mies and lost about thirty thousand men among whom were the sons of the high priest The ark also was carried away by their ene mies When the news of this defeat came to Shiloh with that of the capture of the ark for a certain young man a Benjamite who was in the action came as a messenger thi ther the whole city was full of lamentations And Eli the high priest who sat upon a high throne at one of the gates heard their mournful cries and supposed that some strange thing had befallen his family So he sent for the young man and when he under stood what had happened in the battle he was not much grieved as to his sons or what was told him about the army as having previously known by divine revelation that those things would happen and having himself declared  From an 1188 to 1148 B C them beforehand For what sad things come unexpectedly they distress men the most but as soon as he heard the ark was carried cap tive by their enemies he was very much grieved at it because it fell out quite differ ently from what he expected so he fell down from his throne and died having Kved ninety eight years and retained the government forty On the same day the wife of his son Phi neas died also as not able to survive the misfortune of her husband For they told her of her husband s death as she was in labour However she bare a son at seven months to whom they gave the namef Icabod which name signifies disgrace and this because the army received disgrace at this time Now Eli was the first of the family of Ithamar the other son of Aaron that had the government for the family of Eleazar offici ated as high priest at first the son still re ceiving that honour from the father Eleazar bequeathed it to his son Phineas after whom Abiezer his son took the honour and de livered it to his son whose name was Bukki his son next received it after whom Eli of

their own god who was called Dagon as one of their spoils But when they went into the temple the next morning to worship their idol they found him f aying the same worship to the ark for he ay prostrate as having fallen down from the basis whereon he had stood So they took him up and set him on his basis again and were much troubled at what had happened And as they frequently came to Dagon and found him still lying along in a posture of adoration to the ark they were in very great distress and confusion At length God sent a very destructive disease upon the city and country of Ashdod for they died of the dysentery a sore distemper that brought death upon them very suddenly for before they could as usual in easy deaths be well loosed from the body they brought up their entrails and vomited up what they had eaten and what was en tirely corrupted by the disease And as to the fruits of their country a great multitude of mice arose out of the earth and hurt them and spared neither the plants nor the fruits Now while the people of Ashdod were under these misfortunes and were not able to sup port themselves under their calamities they  Dagon a famous god or idol is generally supposed to perceived that they suffered thus because of the ark and that the victory they had gotten and their having taken the ark captive had not happened for their good They there fore sent to the people of Ascalon and de sired that they would receive the ark among them This desire was not disagreeable to those of Ascalon so they readily granted it but when they had gotten the ark they were in the same miserable condition for the ark carried along with it the disasters that the people of Ashdod had suffered to those who received it from them Those of Ascalon also sent it away to others vho being pur sued by the same disasters again sent it to the neighbouring cities So that the ark went round after this manner to the five cities of the Philistines as though it exacted these disasters as a tribute for its coming among them When those that had experienced these miseries were tired out with them and when those that heard of them were taught thereby not to admit the ark among them since they paid so dear a tribute for it at length they sought for some contrivance how they might get free from it So the governors of the five cities Gath Ekron Ascalon Gaza and Ashdod met together and considered what was fit to be done And at the first they thought proper to send the ark back to its own people as allowing that God had avenged its cause that the miseries they had undergone came along with it and that those were sent on their cities upon its account have been like a man about the navel and like a fish be neath it  n i 8 n  I WB  AN 1148 183 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and together with it However there were those that said they should not do so nor suffer themselves to be deluded as ascribing the cause of their miseries to it because it could not have such power and force upon them For had God had such a regard to it it would not have been delivered into the hands of men So they exhorted them to be quiet and to bear what had befallen them and to suppose there was no other cause of it but nature which at certain revolutions of time produces such mutations in the bodies of men in the earth in plants and in all things that grow out of the earth But the counsel that prevailed over those already described was that of certain men who were believed to have distinguished themselves in former times fop their understanding and prudence and who in their present circumstances seemed above all the rest to speak properly These men said it was not right either to send the ark away or to retain it but to dedicate five golden images one for every city as a thank offering to God on account of his having taken care of their preservation and having kept them alive when their lives were likely to be taken away by such distem pers as they were not able to bear up against They also would have them make five golden mice like those that had devoured and de stroyed their country to put them in a bag and lay them upon the ark to make a new cart also for it and to yoke milchf kine to it but to shut up their calves and keep them from them lest by following after them they should prove a hindrance to their dams and that the dams might return the faster out of a desire of those calves then to drive these milch kine that carried the ark and to leave it in a place where three ways meet and to leave the kine to go along which of those ways they pleased that in case they went the way to the Hebrews and ascended to their country they should suppose that the ark was the cause of their misfortunes but if they turned into another road they should pursue after it and conclude that it had no such force So they determined that these men spake well and they immediately confirmed their opinion by doing accordingly And when they had done as hath been already de scribed they brought the cart to a place where three ways met and left it there But the kine went the right way as if some per sons had driven them while the rulers of the Philistines followed as desirous to know where they would stand still and whither they would go Now there was a certain village of the tribe of Judah called Bethshe mesh and to that village did the kine go and though there was a great and good plain be fore them to proceed in they w ent no farther but stopped the cart there This was a joyful sight to those of that village and they were very glad For it being then summer time and all the inhabitants being in their fields gathering in their fruits they left off the la bours of their hands for joy as soon as they saw the ark and ran to the cart and taking the ark down and the vessel that had the images in it and the mice they set them upon a certain rock which was in the plain And when they had offered a splendid sacrifice to God and feasted they offered the cart and the kine as a burnt offering And when the lords of the Philistines saw this they returned back But now it was that the wrath of God over  took them and struck  seventy persons dead of the village of Bethshemesh who not being priests and so not worthy to touch the ark  Spanheim informs us that upon the coins of Tenedos and those of other cities a field mouse is engraven together with Apollo Sminthous or Apollo the driver away of field mice on account of his being supposed to have freed certain tracts of ground from those mice Which coins shew how great a judgment such mice have sometimes been and how the deliverance from them was then esteemed the effect of a divine power Which ob servations arc highly suitable to this history f This device of the Philistines of having a yoke of kine to draw the cart into which they put the ark of the He brews is greatly illustrated by Sanchoniatho s account under his ninth generation that Agrouerus or Agrotes the husbandman had a much worshipped statue and a temple carried about with one or more yoke of oxen or kine in Phoenicia in the neighbourhood of these Philis tines See Cumberland s Sanchoniatho p 27 and 247 and Essay on the Old Test

was sent from God and every one mourned for his own relation And since they acknowledged themselves unworthy of the ark s abode with them they sent to the public senate of the Israelites and informed them that the ark was restored by the Philistines Which when they knew they brought it away to Kirjath jearim a city in the neighbourhood of Beth shemesh In this city lived one Abinadab by birth a Levite and who was greatly com mended for his righteous and religious course of life so they brought the ark to his house as to a place fit for God himself to abide in since therein did inhabit a righteous man His sons also ministered to the Divine service at the ark and were the principal curators of it for twenty years for so long it con tinued in Kirjathjearim having been butf four months with the Philistines CHAP II OF THE EXPEDITION OF THE PHILISTINES AGAINST THE HE BREWS AND THE HEBREWS VICTORY UNDER THE CON DUCT OF SAMUEL THE TROPHET WHO WAS THEIR GENE RAL WHILE the city of Kirjathjearim had the ark with them the whole body of the people betook themselves all at that time to offer prayers and sacrifices to God and ap peared greatly concerned and zealous about his worship So Samuel the prophet thought it a proper time to speak to them while they were in this good disposition about the re covery of their liberty and of the blessings that accompanied the same Accordingly he used such words to them as he thought were most likely to excite that inclination and to persuade them to attempt it J O ye Israel ites said he to whom the Philistines are still grievous enemies but to whom God be gins to be gracious it behoves you not only to be desirous of liberty but to take the proper methods to obtain it Nor are you to be contented with an inclination to get clear of your lords and masters while you still do what will procure your continuance under them Be righteous then and cast wicked ness out of your souls and by your worship supplicate the Divine Majesty with all your hearts and persevere in the honour you pay to him For if you act thus you will enjoy prosperity you will be freed from your slavery and will get the victory over your enemies which blessing cannot possibly be attained either by weapons of war by the strength of your bodies or by the multitude of your assistance for God has not promised to grant these blessings by those means but by being good and righteous men And if you will be such I will be security to you for the performance of God s promises When Samuel had thus said the multitude ap plauded his discourse and gave their consent to resign themselves up to do what was pleasing to God So Samuel gathered them together to a certain city called Mizpeh which signifies in the Hebrew tongue a watch tower There they drew water and poured it out to God Â and fasted all day and betook themselves to their prayers  From an 1148 to 1128 Seven months in the Hebrew and Septuagint An 1128 The Mizpeh here mentioned as appears from the circumstance of the story must be different from that which is remarked in the history of Jephtha There is indeed another Mizpeh mentioned among the cities of Judah Josh xv 38 and a third among those of Ben jamin Josh xviii 26 Some are of opinion that these two cities are one and the same and are only supposed to be two because they lie in the confines of each tribe  but if they are not the same it seems most probable that the Mizpeh in the tribe of Benjamin was the city which is here spoken of And we may observe farther that as Mizpeh is said to be situated not far from Eben ezer and probably on the east or north side so Shen if it be the name of a place and not rather on some sharp rock thereabouts was situated not far from it on the opposite i e on the west or south west side to which Bethcar must needs be contiguous WelWsGeog of the Old Test vol iii c 1 B Â The words in our translation run thus â And they gathered to Mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the Lord 1 Sam vii 6 but what we are to under stand by this water the conjectures of commentators have been various Some take these words in a metaphorical sense to denote those tears of contrition which were drawn as it were from the bottom of their hearts and fell from their eyes before the Lord Others think that with this water they washed their bodies as they are supposed to have done upon another occasion Exod xix 20 to signify the purification of their souls from the pollution of sin Others that they made use of it to cleanse the ground where Samuel was to erect an altar that it might not stand upon an impure place Some suppose that it was em ployed as an emblem of humiliation of prayer of expia tion of execration and I know not what besides But the AN 1148 185 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS This assembly did not escape the notice of the Philistines So when they had learned that so large a company had met together they fell upon the Hebrews with a great army and mighty forces as hoping to assault them when they did not expect it nor were Erepared for it This thing affrighted the ebrews and put them into disorder and ter ror So they came running to Samuel and said Our souls were sunk by our fears and by the former defeat we had received and thence it was that we lay still lest we should excite the power of our enemies against us Now while thou hast brought us hither to offer up our prayers and sacrifices and take oaths to be obedient our enemies are making an expedition against us while we are naked and unarmed Wherefore we have no other hope of deliverance but that by thy means and by the assistance God shall afford us upon thy prayers to him we shall obtain deliverance from the Philistines Hereupon Samuel bid them be of good cheer and promised that God would assist them And taking a sucking lamb he sacrificed it for the multitude and besought God to hold his protecting hand over them when they should fight with the Philistines and not to overlook them nor suffer them to come under a second misfortune Accord ingly God hearkened to his prayers and ac cepting their sacrifice with a gracious inten tion he granted them a victory over their enemies Now while the altar had the sacrifice of God upon it and had not yet consumed it wholly by the sacred fire the enemy s army marched out of their camp and was put in order of battle and this in hope that they should be conquerors since thet Jews were caught in distressed circum stances as neither having their weapons with them nor being assembled in order to fight But things so fell out that they would hardly have been credited though they had been foretold by any body For in the first place God disturbed their enemies with an earthquake and moved the ground under them to such a degree that he caused it to tremble and made them to shake insomuch that by its trembling he made some unable to keep their feet and made them fall down and by opening its chasms he caused that others should be hurried down into them After which he caused such a noise of thunder to come among them and made fiery light ning shine so terribly round about them that it was ready to burn their faces and he so suddenly shook their weapons out of their hands that he made them flee and return home naked So Samuel with the multitude pursued them to a place called Bethcar and there he set up a stone as a boundary of their victory and their enemies flight and called it the stone of power as a signal of that power God had given them against their enemies So the Pnilistines after this stroke made no more expeditions against the Israelites J but lay still out of fear and out of remem brance of what had befallen them And what courage the Philistines had formerly against the Hebrews after this victory was trans ferred to the Hebrews Samuel also made an expedition against the Philistines and slew many of them and entirely humbled their proud hearts and took from them that country which when they were formerly conquerors they had cut off from the Jews which was the country that extended from the borders of Gath to the city Ekron But the remains of the Canaanites were at this time in friend ship with the Israelites most probable opinion is that this water was upon this occasion poured out by way of libation before God And for support of this it is commonly alleged that liba tions of this kind were very customary in ancient times that Theophrastus as he is cited by Porphyry De Abstin lib 2 tells us that the earliest libations were of water though afterwards honey and wine came into request that Virgil jEneid iv mentions the practice of sprink hng the water of the lake Avernus and that Homer Odyss 12 remarks that for want of wine the com panions of Ulysses poured out water in a sacrifice which they offered to the Gods It is certain that David poured out unto the Lord the water which the three gallant men in his army brought him from the well of Bethlehem at the hazard of their lives 2 Sam xxiii 16 and therefore though the law does not enjoin any such libations of water yet since there is no positive prohibition of them why may we not suppose that upon this extraordinary occasion something singular and extraordinary might have been done Patrick s and Calmet s Comment B  1 Sam vii 9 t This is the first place so far as I remember in these Antiquities where Josephus begins to call his nation Jews he having hitherto usually if not constantly called them either Hebrews or Israelites  1 Sam vii 13 186 book VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  CHAP III of Samuel s attention to public affairs the evil administration of the government by his sons and the subsequent demand of the multitude to be governed by a king THE prophet Samuel when he had or dained the affairs of the people after a convenient manner and had appointed a city for every district of them he commanded them to come to such cities to have the con troversies that they had one with another de termined he himself going over those cities twice in a year and doing them justice And by that means he kept them in very good order for a long time But afterward he found himself oppressed with old age and not able to do as he had done formerly So he committed the govern ment and the care of the multitude to his sons the elder of whom was called Joel and the name of the younger was Abiah He also enjoined them to reside and judge the people the one at the city Bethel and the other at Beer sheba and divided the people into dis tricts that should be under the jurisdiction of each of them Now these men afforded us an evident example and demonstration how some children are not of the like dispositions with their parents but sometimes perhaps good and moderate though born of wicked parents and sometimes shewing themselves to be wicked though born of good parents For these men turning aside from their fa ther s good courses perverted justice for the filthy lucre of gifts and bribes and made their determinations not according to truth but according to bribery and turned aside to  It may probably be made a question why God did not punish Samuel as he did Eli for the wickedness of his sons But to this it may be answered that Samuel s sons were not so bad as those of Eli since taking bribes pri vately was not like openly profaning the tabernacle and making the worship of God contemptible And besides this it is possible that Samuel might be ignorant of the corruption of his sons since he lived at Ramah and they at Beer sheba Patrick s Comment B t 1 Sam viii 5 J It is generally supposed that what made the Israel ites so urgent at this time for a king was a present strait they thought themselves in for want of an able leader for Nahash the king of the Amorites coming up to Jabesh Gilead and encamping before it had put the inhabitants into such a fright that without more to do they offered to surrender upon terms telling him that they would be luxury and a voluptuous way of living So that as in the first place they practised what was contrary to the will of God so did they what was contrary to the will of the prophet their father who had taken a great deal of care and made very careful provision that the multitude should be righteous Upon these injuries offered to their former constitution and government by the prophet s sons the people were very uneasy at their actions and came running to the prophet who then lived at the city Ramah and in formed him of the transgressions of his sons and said that as he himself was old already and too infirm to oversee their affairs in the manner he used to do so they intreated him to appoint some person to be king over them f whoj might rule over the nation and avenge them of the Philistines who ought to be punished for their former oppressions These words greatly afflicted Samuel on account of his innate love of justice and his hatred to regal government for he was very fond of an aristocracy as what mad the men that used it of a divine and happy disposition Nor could he either think of eating and sleeping out of his concern and torment of mind at what they had said but all the night long did he continue awake and revolved these no tions in his mind While he was thus disposed God appeared to him and comforted him saying that he ought not to be uneasy at what the multitude desired because it was not he but Himself whom they so insolently despised and would not have to be alone their King that they had been contriving these things from the very day that they came out of Egypt that come subjects to him if he would make a league with them 1 Sam xi 1 But the haughty Amorite in contempt of Israel let them know that if he made n league with them the condition thereof should be that they should come out to him and let him thrust out all their right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel The elders of Jabesh in this sad circumstance demanded seven days respite that they might send messengers unto all the coasts of Is rael and if in that time no succours arrived they would submit This it is thought was the reason for their pressing so hard upon Samuel at this time for a king whereas their duty was to have enquired of the Lord as they had done t other times who it was that he would be pleased to constitute the general in this exigence to lead out their forces against their enemies Howell s History in the notes B Air 1116 187 ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS however in no long time they would sorely repent of what they did which repentance yet could not undo what was thus done for futurity that they would be sufficiently re buked for their contempt and the ungrateful conduct they had used towards Him and towards the prophetic office So I command thee said the Deity to ordain them such a one as I shall name beforehand to be their king when thou hast first described what mischiefs regal government will bring upon them and openly testified before them unto what a great change of affairs they are hasting When Samuel had heard this he called the Jews early in the morning and confessed to them that he was to ordain them a king but he said that he was first to describe to them what would follow what treatment they would receive from their kings and with how many mischiefs they must struggle For know ye said he that in the first place they will take your sons away from you and they will command some of them to be dri vers of their chariots and some to be their horsemen and the guards of their body and others of them to be runners before them and captains of thousands and captains of hun dreds they will also make them their arti ficers makers of armour and of chariots and of instruments they will make them their husbandmen also and the guardians df their own fields and the diggers of their own vine yards Nor will there be any thing which they will not do at their commands as if they were slaves bought with money They will also appoint your daughters to be confec tioners and cooks and bakers and these will be obliged to do all sorts of work which women slaves that are in fear of stripes and torments submit to They will besides this take away your possessions and bestow them upon their eunuchs and the guards of their bodies and will give the herds of your cattle to their own servants and in brief you and all that is yours will be servants to your king and will become no way superior to his slaves Now when you suffer thus you will be re minded of what I now say and when you re pent of what you have done you will beseech God to have mercy upon you and to grant you a quick deliverance from your kings but he will not accept your prayers but will neglect you and permit you to suffer the punishment your evil conduct has deserved But the multitude was still deaf to these predictions of what would befall them and too peevish to suffer a determination which they had injudiciously made to be taken out of their mind for they could not be turned from their purpose nor did they regard the words of Samuel but peremptorily insisted on their resolution and desired him to ordairt them a king immediately and not to trouble himself with fears of what would come here after for that it was necessary that they should have with them one to fight their bat tles and to avenge them of their enemies and that it was no way absurd when their neighbours were under regal government that they should have the same form of go vernment also So when Samuel saw that what he had said had not diverted them from their purpose but that they continued resolute he said Go you every one home for the present and I will send for you as soon as I shall have learned from God who it is that he will give you for your king t CHAP IV OF THE APPOINTMENT OF A KING OVER THE ISRAELITES BY THE COMMAND OF GOD THERE was one of the tribe of Benjamin a man of a good family and of a vir tuous disposition his name was Kish He had a son a young man of a comely counte nance and of a tall stature but his under standing and his mind were preferable to what was visible in him they called him Saul Now this Kish had some fine she asses that had wandered out of the pasture wherein they fed so he sent out his son and one ser vant with him to search for the beasts But when he had gone over his own tribe in search after the asses he went to other tribes and when he found them not there neither he de termined to return home lest he should oc casion any concern to his father about him self But his servant told him as they were  near the city of Ramah that there was a true prophet in that city and advised him to go to  Sam viii 9 voL I â NOS 15  16 t 1 Sam viii 22 Rr 188 flOOK VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him for that from him they should gain in telligence respecting their asses Saul re plied that they had nothing to give him as a reward for his prophecy for their subsistence money was spent but the servant answered that he had still the fourth part of a shekel and he would present him with that for they were mistaken out of ignorance as not know ing that the prophet received no such re ward So they went to him and when they were before the gates they met with certain maidens that were going to fetch water and they asked them which was the prophet s house They shewed them which it was and bade them make haste before he was set down to supper for he had invited many guests to a feast and that he used to sit down before those that were invited Now Samuel had gathered many together to feast with him on this very account for while he every day prayed to God to tell him beforehand whom he would make king he had informed him the day before that he would send him a certain young man out of the tribe of Benjamin about this hour and he sat on the top of the house in expectation of that time being come and when the time was completed he came down and went to supper so he met with Saul and God discovered to him that this was he who should rule over the people Then Saul went up to Samuel and saluted him and de sired him to inform him which was the pro phet s house for he said he was a stranger  Of this great mistake of Saul and his servant as if a true prophet of God would accept a gift or present for foretelling what was desired of him see the note on IV 6 t It seems not improbable that these 70 guests of Samuel as here and in the Septuagint with himself at the head of them were a Jewish Sanhedrim and that hereby Samuel intimated to Saul that these 71 were to be his constant counsellors and that he was not to act like a sole monarch but with the advice and direction of these 71 members of that Jewish Sanhedrim upon all occasions which yet we never read that he consulted afterwards J This was with design to let Saul understand that what he was going to do was by the divine order and ap pointment and that when it should come to the casting of lots as it did afterwards 1 Sam x 20 he might per ceive that he was not chosen king by chance of a lot There might be likewise this further reason for Samuel s bidding Saul to send away his servants viz lest the people suspecting Samuel to do this by his own will more than by God s appointment might be inclined to mutiny Since this royal unction then was only designed for Saul s private satisfaction it was necessary not to have it published be fore the people had proceeded to a public election of their king Howell s Hist in the notes B and did not know it Samuel told him that he was himself the person and led him in to supper assuring him that the asses were found which he had been to seek and that the greatest of good things was assured to him Saul replied  Sir I am too inconside rable to hope for any such thing and of a tribe too small to have kings made out of it and of a family smaller than several other families But thou tellest me this in jest and makest me an object of laughter when thou discoursest with me of greater matters than what I stand in need of However the pro phet led him unto the feast and made him sit down him and his servant that followed him above the other guests that were invited which were seventy in number f And he gave order to the servants to set the royal portion before Saul But when the time of going to bed was come the rest rose up and every one of them went home but Saul and his servant stayed with the prophet and slept with him As soon as it was day Samuel raised up Saul out of his bed and conducted him home ward and when he was out of the city he desired him to cause his servant to go be fore but to stay behind himself for that he had somewhat to say to him when nobody else was present Accordingly Saul sent away his servant that followed him Then the prophet took a vessel of oil and poured it upon the head of the young man Â and I1 1 Sam xi 27 Â We read of no express command for the anointing of kings and yet it is plain from the parable of Jotham Judg ix 8 that this was a custom two hundred years before this time Why oil rather than any other liquid was the symbol of conveying a regal authority we are no where informed It is true that God directed Moses to conse crate Aaron to the high priest s office by anointing his head with oil Exod xxix 7 But the anointing of kings we may presume was of a prior date Unction indeed in the days of Jacob was the common method of setting apart from common use even things inanimate Genesis xxviii 18 and therefore it may well be supposed that persons of such designation as kings were were all along admitted by the same ceremony which might be of divine appointment perhaps at the first institution of government in the antediluvian world and thence handed down by a long tradition to future generations This rite of unction in short was so much the divine care that we find G od giving Moses a prescription how to make the consecrated oil Exod xxx 23 But though Solomon was anointed with the oil taken from the tabernacle yet since Samuel was no priest and could not therefore have any access to the tabernacle which at this time was at some distance AN 1116 189 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS kissed him and said  Be thou a king by the ordination of God against the Philistines and for avenging the Hebrews for what they have suffered by them Of this thou shalt have a sign which I would have thee notice As soon as thou art departed hence thou wilt find three men upon the road going to wor ship God at Bethel the first thou wilt see carrying three loaves of bread the second carrying a kid of the goats and the third will follow them carrying a bottle of wine These men will salute thee and speak kindly to thee and will give thee two of their loaves which thou shalt accept and thence thou shalt come to a place called Rachel s Monu ment where thou shalt meet with those that will tell thee thy asses are found after this when thou comest to Gabatha thou shalt overtake a company of prophets and thou shalt be seized with the Divine Spirit and prophesy along with them till every one that sees thee shall be astonished and wonder and say Whence is it that the son of Kish has arrived at this degree of happiness And when these signs have happened to thee know that God is with thee then do thou sa lute thy father and thy kindred Thou shalt also come when I send for thee to Gilgal that we may offer thank offerings to God for these blessings When Samuel had said this he sent the young man away and all things fell out to Saul according to the prophecy of Samuel But as soon as Saul came into the house of his kinsman Abner he was asked by him con cerning his journey and what accidents had happened to him therein and he concealed none of the other things from him no not his coming to Samuel the prophet nor how he told him the asses were found but he said nothing about the kingdom andf what be longed thereto which ne thought would pro cure him envy and when such things are heard they are not easily believed Nor did he think it prudent to tell those things to him although he appeared very friendly and one whom he loved above the rest of his relations considering I suppose what human nature really is that no one is a firm friend neither among our intimates nor of our kindred nor do they preserve that kind disposition when God advances nfen to great prosperity but they are still ill natured and envious at those that are in eminent stations Then Samuel called the people together to the city Mispeh and spake to them by the command of God in the words following â When God had granted you a state of liberty and brought your enemies into subjection you became unmindful of his benefits and re jected him that he should not be your king not considering that it would be most for your advantage to be presided over by the best of Beings for God is the best of beings but you choose to have a man for your king though kings will use their subjects as beasts according to the violence of their own wills and inclinations as wholly carried away with the lust of power but will not endeavour so to preserve the race of mankind as their own workmanship and creation which for that very reason God would take care of Since however you have come to a fixed resolution and this injurious treatment of God has quite prevailed over you dispose yourselves by your tribes and cast lots When the Hebrews had so done the lot fell upon the tribe of Benjamin and when the lot was cast for the families of this tribe that which was called Matri was taken and when the lot was cast for the single persons of that family Saul the son of Kish was taken for their king When the young man knew this he prevented their sending for him and im mediately went away and hid himself I sup pose it was because he would not have it thought that he willingly took the govern ment upon him Nay he shewed such a de gree of command over himself and of mo desty that while the greatest part are not able to contain their joy even in the gaining of small advantages but presently shew themselves publicly to all men this man did not only evince nothing of that nature when he was appointed to be lord over so many and so great tribes but crept away and con cealed himself from those he was to reign over and made them seek him with a good from him it is more reasonable to think though some Jewish doctors will have it otherwise that what he made un of upon this occasion was no more than common oil Patrick s Comment B  An instance of this divine fury we have after this in Saul 1 Sam xi 6 See the like Judg iii 10 vi 34 xi 29 xiii 25 xiv 6 t 1 Sam

produce him before them So when they had learned the place where Saul was hidden they sent men to bring him and when he was come they set him in the midst of the multitude Now was he taller than all of them and his stature was very majestic Then said the prophet God gives you this man to be your king See how he is higher than all the people and worthy of this dominion So as soon as the people had made acclamation  God save the king the prophet wrote down what would come to pass in a book and read it in the hearing of the king and laid by the book in the taber nacle of God to be a witness to future gene rations of what he had foretold So when Samuel had finished this matter he dismissed the multitude and came himself to the city Ramah in his own country Saul also went to Gibeah where he was born and many good men there were who paid him the re spect that was due to him but the greater part were ill men who despised him and de rided the others who neither brought him presents nor attempted in affection or even in words to please him CHAP V of saul s expedition against the nation of the am monites AND HIS SIGNAL VICTORY OVER THEM AFTER one month the war which Saul had with Nahash king of the Ammonites obtained him respect from all the people For this Nahash had done a great deal of mischief to the Jew that lived beyond Jor dan by the expedition he had made against them with a great and warlike army He also reduced their cities into slavery and that not only by subduing them for the pre sent which he did by force and violence but weakening them by subtilty and cunning that they might not be able afterward to get clear of their slavery for he put out the rightf eyes of those that either delivered themselves to him upon terms4 or were taken by him in war and this he did that when their left eyes were covered with their shields they might be wholly useless in war Now when the king of the Ammonites had served those be yond Jordan in this manner he led his army against those that were called Gileadites and having pitched his camp at the metropolis of his enemies which was the city Jabesh he sent ambassadors to them commanding them either to deliver themselves up on condition to have their right eyes plucked out or to undergo a siege and to have their cities over thrown He gave them their choice whether they would cut off a small member of their body or universally perish However the Gileadites were so affrighted at these offers that they had not courage to say any thing to either of them neither that they would de liver themselves up nor that they would fight him But they desired that he would give them seven days respite that they might send ambassadors to their countrymen and intreat assistance and if they came to assist them they would fight but if that assistance were impossible to be obtained they would deliver themselves up to suffer whatever he pleased to inflict on them Â  1 Sam x 24 t Take here Theodoret s note cited by Dr Hudson He that exposes his shield to the enemy with his left hand thereby hides his left eye and looks at the enemy with his right eye He therefore that plucks out that right eye makes men useless in war J The reason why Nahash was for having their right eye put out was not only to bring a reproach upon Israel as himself declares but to disable them likewise from serving in war for as the manner of fighting in those days was chiefly with bow and arrow sword and shield the loss of the right eye made them incapable of either because in combat the left eye is covered with the shield and in shooting with the bow it is usual to wink with it so that depriving them of their right eye made them use less in war and yet this barbarous king thought it not proper to put out both their eyes for then he would have made them utterly incapable of doing him the service or acquiring the tribute for him which he expected from them Calmet s Comment B II It may seem a little strange that this barbarous prince should be willing to allow the Jabeshites the respite of seven days but Josephus assigns this reason for it viz that he had so mean an opinion of the people that he made no difficulty to comply with their request Saul indeed had been appointed king but having not as yet taken upon him the government he lived just as he did before in a private condition 1 Sam xi 5 So that had he upon this notice endeavoured to levy an army he could not think it possible to be done in so short a space as seven days and therefore he thought he might grant them these conditions without any danger and without driving them to despera tion as he might have done had he denied them their re quest Patricks Comment B Â 1 Sam xi 3 Air 1116 191 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Nafaash contemning the multitude of the Gileadites and the answer they gave allowed them a respite and gave them leave to send to whomsoever they pleased for assistance So they immediately sent to the Israelites city by city and informed them what Nahash had threatened to do and what great distress they were in Now the people tell into tears and grief at the hearing of what the ambassadors from Jabesh said and the terror they were in permitted them to do nothing more But when the messengers were come to the city of king Saul and declared the danger in which the inhabitants of Jabesh were the people were in the same affliction as those in the other cities for they lamented the ca lamity of those related to them And when Saul was returned from his husbandry into the city he found his fellow citizens weeping and when upon inquiry he had learned the cause of the confusion and sadness they were in he was seized with a divine fury and sent away the ambassadors from the inhabitants of Jabesh promising to come to their assistance on the third day and to beat their enemies before sun rising that the sun upon its rising might see that they had already conquered and were freed from the fears they were under But he bade some of them remain to conduct him the right way to Jabesh So being desirous to excite the people to this war against the Ammonites by fear of the losses they should otherwise undergo and that they might the more suddenly be ga thered together he cut the sinews of his oxen and threatened to do the same to all such as did not come with their armour to Jordan the next day and follow him and Samuel the prophet whithersoever they should lead them So they came together out of fear of the losses they were threatened with at the appointed time And the multitude were numbered at the city Bezek And he found the number of those that were gathered to gether besides that of the tribe of Judah to be seven hundred thousand while those of that tribe were seventy thousand So he passed over Jordan and proceeded in marching all that night thirty furlongs and came to Jabesh before sun rising So he divided the army into three companies and fell upon their  1 Sam xi 18 t 1 Sam xi 14 enemies suddenly and unexpectedly on every side and joining battle with them they slew a great many of the Ammonites together with their king Nahash This glorious ac tion was performed by Saul and was re lated with great commendation of him to all the Hebrews and he thence gained a won derful reputation for his valour For al though there were some that contemned him before they now changed their minds and honoured and esteemed him as the best of men For he did not content himself with having merely saved the inhabitants of Ja besh but he made an expedition into the country of the Ammonites and laid it all waste and took a large prey and then returned to his own country triumphantly So the people were greatly pleased at these excellent performances of Saul and re joiced that they had constituted him their king They also made a clamour against those who pretended he would be of no advantage to their affairs and they said Where now are these men let them be brought to punishment  with all the like things that multitudes usually say when elevated with prosperity against those that lately had despised the authors of it But Saul although he took the good will and the affection of these men very kindly yet did he swear that he would not see any of his countrymen slain that day since it was ab surd to mix this victory which God had given them with the slaughter of those that were of the same lineage with themselves and that it was more agreeable to be then of a friendly disposition and to betake them selves to feasting When Samuel had told them that they ought to confirm the kingdom to Saul by a second ordination of him they all came together to the city Gilgal for thither did he command them to come t So the prophet anointed Saul with the holy oil in sight of the multitude and declared him to be king the second time And so the govern ment of the Hebrews was changed into a regal government For in the days of Moses and his disciple Joshua who was their ge neral they continued under an aristocracy But after the death of Joshua for eighteen X From an 1467 to 1449 B C 192 book vr ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS years in all the multitude had no settled form of government but were in an anarchy After which they returned to their former government they then permitting them selves to be judged by him who appeared to be the best warrior and most courageous whence it was that they called this interval of their government the Judges Then did Samuel call another assembly also and said to them  I solemnly adjure you by God Almighty who brought those excellent brethren I mean Moses and Aaron into the world and delivered our fathers from the Egyptians and from the slavery they endured under them that you will not speak what you say to gratify me nor suppress any thing out of fear of me nor be overborne by any other passion but say what have I ever done that was cruel or unjust or what have I done out of lucre or covetousness or to gratify others Bear witness against me if I have taken an ox or a sheep or any such thing which yet when they are taken to support men it is esteemed blameless Or have I taken an ass for mine own use of any one to his grief Lay some one such crime to my charge now we are in your king s presence But they unanimously exclaimed that no such thing had been done by him but that he had presided over the nation after a holy and righteous manner When this testimony had been given him by them all Samuel said Since you all grant that you are not able to lay any ill thing to my charge hitherto come on now and hearken while I speak with great free dom to you You have been guilty of great impiety against God in asking you a king It behoves you to remember that our grand father Jacob came down into Egypt by reason of a famine with seventy souls only of our family and that their posterity mul tiplied there to many ten thousands whom the Egyptians brought into slavery and hard oppression that God himself upon the prayers of our fathers sent Moses and Aaron who were brethren and gave them power to deliver the multitude out of their distress and this without a king These brought us into this very land which you now possess And when you enjoyed these advantages from God you betrayed his worship and religion nay when you were brought under the hands of your enemies he delivered you first by render ing you superior to the Assyrians and their forces he then made you to overcome the Ammonites and Moabites and last of all the Philistines And these things have been achieved under the conduct of Jeph tha and Gideon What madness therefore possessed you to fly from God and to desire to be under a king yet have I ordained him for king whom he chose for you How ever that I may make it plain to you that God is angry and displeased at your choice of regal government I will so dispose him that he shall declare this very plainly to you by strange signals for what none of you ever saw here before I mean a winter storm in the midst of harvest I will intreat of God and will make it visible to you f Now as soon as he had said this God gave such strange signals by thunder and lightning and the descent of hail as attested the truth of all the prophet had said  insomuch that they were amazed and terrified and con fessed they had sinned and had fallen into that sin through ignorance and besought the prophet as one that was a tender and gentle father to render God so merciful as to for give this sin which they had added to those other offences whereby they had affronted him and transgressed against him So he promised that he would beseech God and persuade him to forgive them their sins However he advised them to be righteous  Mr Reland observes here and proves elsewhere in his note on III 1 that although thunder and lightning with us happen usually in summer yet in Palestine and Syria they are chiefly confined to winter Josephus takes notice of the same thing again of the War IV 4 See also Antiq II 14 t It is an observation of St Jerome that this harvest in Judea began about the end of June or the beginning of July in which season thunder and rain was never known but only in the spring and autumn the one called the former and the other the latter rain and therefore Samuel by this preamble hit not wheat harvest to day chap xii 17 meant to signify the greatness of the miracle God was going to work that he could in an instant and in a time when they least of all expected it deprive them of all the comforts of life as they justly deserved for their rejecting him and his prophet who was so powerful

befallen them on account of their departure from virtue as also to remember the strange signs that God had shewed and the body of laws that Moses had given them if they had any desire of being preserved and made happy with their king But he said if they should grow careless of these things great judgments would come from God upon them and upon their king And when Samuel had thus prophesied to the Hebrews he dismissed them to their own homes having confirmed the kingdom to Saul the second time CHAP VI OF AN EXPEDITION OF THE PHILISTINES AGAINST THE HE BREWS AND ITS ILL SUCCESS NOW Saul chose out of the multitude about three thousand men and took two thousand of them to be his own body guards and abode in the city Bethel but he fave the rest of them for guards to Jonathan is son and sent him to Gibeah where he besieged and took a certain garrison of the Philistines not far fromf Gilgal For the Philistines of Gibeah had beaten the Jews and taken their weapons away and had put garrisons into the strongest places of the country and had forbidden them to carry any instrument of iron or to make use of any iron in any case whatsoever And on account of this prohibition it was that the husbandmen if they had occasion to sharpen any of their  Josephus here omits the first words of this history as does the Septuagint 1 Sam xiii 1 The text runs thus in the present Hebrew Saul was  1 years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years Where in one if not in both places the decads are wanting Nor is it fit to invent idle excuses and far fetched interpreta tions in order to evade such difficulties as the learned and judicious Dr Wall has frequently observed in his very valuable but posthumous critical notes on the Old and New Testament If the text be at all genuine it might be written at first thus Saul was 21 or 31 years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years t This was Galgal by Michmas and Bethel not the fa mous Galgal or Gilgal near Jericho J The words in the original and in our translation of the Bible are thirty thousand but the Syriac and Arabic versions which we have thought proper to follow make them no more than three thousand and indeed whoever considers that Pharaoh king of Egypt when he had mus tered all his forces together could bring no more than six hundred of these chariots into the field and all the other princes whose equipages are related in Scripture much fewer must needs think it a thing incredible that the tools whether it were the coulter the spade or any other instrument of husbandry they came to the Philistines to do it Now as soon as the Philistines heard of this slaughter of their garrison they were in a rage about it and looking on this contempt as a terrible affront offered them they made war against the Jews J with three hundred thousand foot men thirty thousand chariots and six thou sand horses and they pitched their camp at the city Michmash When Saul the king of the Hebrews was informed of this he went down to the city Gilgal and made proclama tion over all the country that they should try to regain their liberty and called them to the war against the Philistines diminishing their forces and despising them as not so great but they might hazard a battle with them But when the people about Saul ob served how numerous the Philistines were they were under great consternation and some of them hid themselves in caves and in dens under ground but the greater part fled into the land beyond Jordan which belonged to Gad and Reubel But Saul sent to the prophet and called him to consult with him about the war and the public affairs So he commanded him to stay there for him and to prepare sacrifices for he would come to him within seven days that they might offer sacrifices on the seventh day and might then join battle with their enemies So he waited as the prophet commanded him to do Yet did not he ob Philistines out of their small territories which extended no farther than the two tribes of Simeon and Dan along the coasts of the Mediterranean sea could ever be able to raise so vast an armament no nor all the nations that they could possibly call in to their assistance For be sides that in the account of all armies the cavalry is always more numerous than the chariots of war which is different here the largest armies that we ever read of were able to compass a very few of these chariots in com parison of the number here specified Mithridates in his vast army had but a hundred Darius but two and An tiochus Epiphanes 2 Mac xiii 2 but three So that we must either say that the transcribers made a mistake in the Hebrew copy or with some other commentators suppose that these thirty thousand chariots were not chariots of war but most of them carriages only for the conveyance of the baggage belonging to such a vast mul titude of men or for the deportation of the plunder they hoped to be master of by having conquered the country Le Gere s Commentary and Universal History B II 1 Sam xiii 5 Â Saul seems to have staid till near the time of the evening sacrifice on the seventh day which Samuel had 194 boo vt ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS mash the report being gone abroad that they were coming down upon him to Gilgal Samuel replied  iNay certainly if thou hadst been a righteous man and hadst not diso beyed me nor slighted the commands which God suggested to me concerning the present state of affairs and hadst not acted more hastily than the present circumstances re quired thou wouldst have been permitted to reign a long time and thy posterity after thee t So Samuel being grieved at what had happened returned home But Saul came to the city Gibeah with his son Jona than having only six hundred men with him and of these the greater part had no weapons because of the scarcity of iron in that country as well as of those that could make such weapons for as we shewed a little before the Philistines had not suffered them to have such iron or such workmen J Now the Philistines divided their army into three corn office and offer sacrifice without the priest we are in some degree able to answer that question which I have ever thought a very difficult one viz Whether if there were a city or country of lay christians without any cler gymen it were lawful for the laity alone to baptize ad minister the sacrament c or indeed whether they alone could ordain themselves either bishops priests or dea cons for the due performance of such sacerdotal ministra tions or whether they ought not rather till they pro cure clergymen to come among them to confine them selves within those bounds of piety and Christianity which belong alone to the laity such particularly as are recom mended in the 1st Book of the Apostolical Constitutions which peculiarly concern the laity and are intimated in Clement s undoubted Epistle Â 40 To which latter opinion I incline serve the command that was given him But when he saw that the prophet tarried longer than he expected and that he was deserted by the soldiers he took the sacrifices and offered them At this juncture he heard that Samuel was come and went out to meet him But the prophet said he had not done well in disobeying the injunctions he had sent him and had not stayed till his coming which being appointed according to the will of God he had prevented him in offering those prayers and sacrifices that he should have made for the multitude and that he therefore had per formed divine offices rashly and in an ill manner Hereupon Saul made an apology for himself and said that he had waited as many days as Samuel had appointed that he had been so quick in offering his sacrifice upon account of the necessity he was in and because his soldiers were departing from him out of their fear of the enemies camp at Mich appointed him but not till the end of that day as he ought to have done and Samuel appears by delaying to come till the full time of the evening sacrifice on that day to have tried him who seems to have been already for some time declining from his strict subordination to God and his prophet to have taken life guards for himself and his son which was an entirely new thing in Israel and savoured of a distrust of God s providence and to have affected more than he ought that independent authority which the Pagan kings took to themselves Samuel I say seems here to have tried Saul whether he would stay till the priest came who alone could lawfully offer the sacrifices or would boldly and profanely usurp the priest s office which he ventured upon was justly rejected for his pro faneness See Constitut Apost II 27 And indeed since Saul had accepted kingly power which naturally becomes ungovernable and tyrannical as God foretold and the ex perience of all ages has shewn the divine settlement by Moses had soon been laid aside under the kings had not God by keeping strictly to his laws and severely execu ting the threatenings therein contained restrained Saul and other kings in some degree of obedience to himself Nor was even this severity sufficient to restrain most of the future kings of Israel and Judah from the grossest idolatry and impiety Of the advantage of which strictness in the observing divine laws and inflicting their threat ened penalties see Antiq VI 12 where Josephus speaks of that matter Though it seems at least in three in stances that good men did not always immediately approve of such divine severity There seems to be one instance 1 Sam vi 19 20 Another 1 Sara xv 11 And a third 2 Sam vi 8 9 Joseph Antiq VI 7 though they all at last acquiesced in the divine conduct as knowing that God is wiser than men  By this answer of Samuel and that from a divine commission which is fuller in 1 Sam xiii 14 and by that parallel note in the Apostolical Constitutions just quoted concerning the great wickedness of Saul in venturing even under a seeming necessity of affairs to usurp the priest s t 1 Sam xiii 13 J The precaution which the Philistines took to hinder the Israelites from providing themselves with weapons is no more than what other conquerors have done to the nations they have vanquished Porsenna when he made peace with the Romans restrained them from the use of all iron but what was necessary in the tillage oT their ground Cyrus when he subdued the Lydians for fear of a revolt took from them the use of arms and instead of a laborious life spent in war suffered them to sink into softness and luxury so that they soon lost their ancient valour and to instance in one prince more Nebuchad nezzar when ne had made

having no more than six hundred men with them But as he and his son and Ahiah the high priest who was of the posterity of Eli were sitting upon a pretty high hill and seeing the land laid waste they were greatly disturbed at it Now Saul s son agreed with his armour bearer that they would go pri vately to the enemies camp and make a tumult and a disturbance among them And when the armour bearer had readily pro mised to follow whithersoever he should lead him though he should be obliged to die in the attempt Jonathan made use of the young man s assistance and descended from the hill and went to their enemies Now the enemies camp was upon a precipice which had three tops that ended in a small but sharp and long extremity while there was a rock that sur rounded them like lines made to prevent the attacks of an enemy There it happened that the out guards of the camp were neg lected because of the natural security of the place and because they thought it altogether impossible not only to ascend up to the camp on that quarter but so much as to come near it As soon therefore as they came to the camp Jonathan encouraged his armour bearer and said to him Let us attack our enemies and if when they see us they bid us come up to them take that for a signal of victory But if they say nothing as not in tending to invite us to come up let us re turn back again f So when they were ap proaching to the camp just after break of day and the Philistines saw them they said to one another The Hebrews come out of their dens and caves and they said to Jona than and to his armour bearer Come on ascend up to us that we may inflict a just punishment upon you for your rash attempt So Saul s son accepted that invitation as indicative of victory and immediately came out of the place whence they were seen by their enemies so he changed his place and came to the rock which had none to guard it because of its own strength From thence they crept up with great labour and difficulty and overcame by force the nature of the place till they were able to fight with their enemies So they fell upon them as they were asleep and slew about twenty of them and thereby filled them with disorder and surprise insomuch that some of them threw away their armour and fled but the greatest part not knowing one another because they were of different nations suspected each other to be enemies for they did not ima gine that there were only two of the Hebrews that came up and so they fought one against another And some of them died in the battle and some as they were flying away were thrown headlong from the rock a matter in so short a time to recover a trade that was lost especially among a people that had no iron mines and were so wholly addicted to the feeding of cattle that they made no account of any mechanical art In the fa mous victory which they gained over Sisera we are told that there was not a shield or spear seen among fifty thousand men of Israel Judg v 8 but notwithstanding this they had bows and arrows and slings which the men of Gibeah could manage to a wonderful advantage Judg xx 16 And besides these the Israelites upon this oc casion might convert their instruments of husbandry their hatchets their spades their forks their mattocks c into instruments of war a much better shift than what we read of some who in ancient times had no other arms than clubs and sharpened stakes hardened in the fire Non jam certamine agresti Stipitibus duris agitur sudibnsque praeustis Virgil Jlneid 7 B  About an 1108 t 1 Sam xiv 9 10 J This action of Jonathan s considered in itself was doubtless a very rash attempt and contrary to the laws of war which prohibit all under command as he was voL Uâ NOS 17  18 from engaging the enemy or entering upon any enter prise without the general s order but what may very justly be said in excuse of it is â That he had a divine incitation to it which he might probably feel upon the sight of the Philistines appearing as if they intended to assault Gibeah and upon the information which he might receive of the great spoil which the three parties made of the poor people in the country Patrick s Comment B  How two men could put the whole army into such a consternation may seem somewhat extraordinary but it should be considered that Jonathan and his armour bearer climbing up a way that was never attempted be fore might come upon them unawares and surprise them that this action might happen as Josephus thinks early in the morning when a great part of the Philistines army was asleep that even had they been all awake Jonathan might have so posted himself as Horatius Codes did on a bridge so as to be able to maintain his pass against all the force of the enemy that those who made at him as only one perhaps could at a time he with one stroke might lay flat on the ground and his armour bearer imme diately despatch them that the rest seeing tbem act thug intrepidly might take them for two scouts or van couriers only of a great army that was coming up and ready to fall Ss w book VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now Saul s watchman told the king that the camp of the Philistines was in confusion Then he enquired whether any body were gone from the army and when he heard that his son and his armour bearer were absent he bade the high priest take the pontifical garments and predict what success they should have The high priest said they shpuld get the victory and prevail against their enemies So he went out after the Phi listines and set upon them as they were slaying one another Those also came run ning to him who had fled before to dens and caves upon their hearing that Saul was gaining a victory When therefore the number of the Hebrews that came to Saul amounted to about ten thousand he pursued the enemy who were scattered all over the country But then he fell into an action which was a very unhappy one and liable to be very much blamed For whether out of ignorance or whether out of joy for a victory gained so strangely for it frequently happens that per sons so fortunate are not able to use their reason consistently he was so desirous to avenge himself and to exact a due punish ment of the Philistines that he denounced a curse on the Hebrews to this purport If any one put a stop to his slaughter of the enemy and began eating and left off the slaughter or the pursuit before night came on and obliged them so to do he should be accursed Now after Saul had denounced this curse since they were in a wood be longing to the tribe of Ephraim which was thick and full of bees Saul s son who did not hear his father denounce that curse nor hear of the approbation the multitude gave to it brake off a piece of a honey comb and upon them that the army of the Philistines being made up of different nations might be in the greatest confusion as either not understanding or else suspecting one ano ther and what might complete their consternation that God at this time might send a panic fear upon them which whenever he does it even in the opinion of Heathens themselves is enough to make the stoutest tremble and the most heroic spirits betake themselves to flight Ev yap Sai

he left off eating and said his father had not done well in this prohibition because had they taken some food they had pursued the enemy with greater vigour and alacrity and had both taken and slain many more of their enemies f When therefore they had slain many ten thousands of the Philistines they began spoiling their camp but not till late in the evening They also took a great deal of prey and cattle and killed them and ate them with their blood The scribes therefore told their sovereign that the multitude were sinning against God as they sacrificed and were eating before the blood was well washed away and the flesh was made clean Then did Saul give order that a great stone should be rolled into the midst of them and he made proclamation that they should kill their sacri fices upon it and not feed upon the flesh with the blood for that was not acceptable to God And when all the people did as the king commanded SaulJ erected an altar and offered burnt offerings to God This was the first altar that Saul built So when Saul was desirous of leading his men to the enemies camp before it was day in order to plunder it and when the soldiers were not unwilling to follow him but indeed shewed great readiness to do as he com manded them the king called Ahitub the high priest and enjoined him to know of God whether he would grant them permission to go against the camp in order to destroy those that were in it But the priest said that God would not give any answer Then said Saul  This rash vow or curse of Saul s which Josephus ays was confirmed by the people and yet not executed I suppose principally because Jonathan did not know of it is very remarkable it being of the essence of the obligation of all laws that they be sufficiently known and promulgated Otherwise the conduct of Providence as to the sacredness of solemn oaths and vows in God s re fusing to answer by Urim till this breach of Saul s vow or curse was understood and set right and God propitiated by public prayer is here very remarkable as indeed it is every where else in the Old Testament See Scripture Politics p 54â 65 t t Sam xiv 29 30  Here we have still more indications of Saul s affecta tion of despotic power and of his intrenching upon the priesthood and making and endeavouring to execute a rash vow or curse without consulting Samuel or the San hedrim In this view it is also that I look upon this erec tion of a new altar by Saul and his offering of burnt offer ings himself upon it and not as any proper instance of de votion or religion II 1 Sam xiv 35 AN H08 J 197 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Â It is not without some cause that God re fuses to answer what we inquire of him who yet a little while ago declared to us all that we desired beforehand and even prevented us in his answer To be sure there is some sin against him that is concealed from us which is the occasion of his silence Now I swear by himself that though he that com mitted this sin should prove to be my own son Jonathan I will slay him and by that means will appease the anger of God against us and that in the very same manner as if I were to punish a stranger and one not at all related to me for the same offence So when the multitude cried out to him so to do he pre sently set all the rest on one side and he and his son stood on the other side and he sought to discover the offender by lot Now the lot appeared to fall upon Jonathan himself So when he was asked by his father what sin he had been guilty of and what he was con scious of in the course of his life that might be esteemed instances of guilt or profaneness his answer was this O father I have done nothing more than that yesterday without knowing of the curse and the oath thou hadst denounced while I was in pursuit of the enemy I tasted of a honey comb Saul im mediately swore that he would slay him and prefer the observation of his oath before all the ties of birth and of nature But Jonathan was not dismayed at this threatening but offering himself to it generously and undaunt edly he said Nor do I desire you father to spare me Death will be to me very ac ceptable when it proceeds from thy piety and after a glorious victory for it is the freatest consolation to me that I leave the ebrews victorious over the Philistines Hereupon all the people were greatly afflicted for Jonathan and they sware that they would not see him die who was the author of their victory By which means they snatched him out of the danger he was in from his father s curse while they made their prayers to God also for the young man that he would remit his sin So Saul having slain about sixty thousand of the enemy returned to his own city and reigned happily And he also fought against the neighbouring nations and subdued the Ammonites Moabites Edomites and Amale kites as also the king of Zobah He had three male children Jonathan Ishui and Melchi shua with Merah and Michal his daughters He had also Abner his uncle s son for the captain of his host that uncle s name was Ner Now Ner and Kish the fa ther of Saul were brothers Saul had also a great many chariots and horsemen and against whomsoever he made war he re

tribes yet that God had the dominion over him and over all things That accordingly God said to him Because the Amalekites did the Hebrews a great deal of mischief while they were in the wilderness and when upon their coming out of Egypt they were making their way to that country which is now their own I enjoin thee to punish the Amalekites by making war upon them and when thou hast subdued them to leave none of them alive but to pursue them through every age and to slay them beginning with the women and the infants and to require this as a punishment to be inflicted on them for the mischief

kites Nor indeed do we ever meet with these Amale kites but as very cruel and bloody people and particu Ss2 198 BOOK VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Saul promised to do what he was com manded and supposing that his obedience to God would be shewn not only in making war against the Amalekites but more fully in the readiness and quickness of his proceedings he immediately gathered together all his forces And when he had numbered them in Gilgal he found them to be about four hundred thousand of the Israelites besides the tribe of Judah for that tribe contained by itself thirty thousand Accordingly Saul made an irruption into the country of the Amalekites and set many men and several parties in ambush at the river that so he might not only do them a mischief by open fighting but might fall upon them unexpect edly in the ways and might thereby surround and kill them And when he had joined battle with the enemy he beat them and pursuing them as they fled he destroyed them all And when that undertaking had succeeded according as God had foretold he besieged the cities of the Amalekites and took them by force partly by warlike machines partly by mines dug under ground and partly by building walls on the outsides Some they starved out by famine and some they gained by other methods and after all he betook himself to slay the women and the children and thought he did not act therein either bar barously or inhumanly first because they were enemies whom they thus treated and in the next place because it was done by the command of God whom it was dangerous  not to obey He also took Agag the enemies  king captive The beauty and tallness of whose body he admired so much that he thought him worthy of preservation Yet was not this done according to the will of God but by giving way to human passions and suffering himself to be moved with an unseasonable commiseration in a point where it was not safe to indulge it For God hated the nation of the Amalekites to such a de gree that he commanded Saul to have no pity even on those infants which we by nature chiefly compassionate Saul however pre served the king from the miseries which the Hebrews brought on the people as if he preferred the tine appearance of the enemy to the memory of what God had sent him about The multitude were also guilty to gether with Saul for they spared the herds and the flocks and took them for a prey when God had commanded they should not spare them They also carried off the rest of their wealth and riches but if there were any thing that Was not worthy of regard that they destroyed When Saul had conquered all these Amale kites that reached from Pelusium of Egypt to the Red Sea he laid waste all the rest of the enemies country but for the nation of thef Sichemites he did not touch them al though they dwelt in the very middle of the Country of Midian For before the battle Saul had sent to them and charged them to depart thence lest they should be partakers of the miseries of the Amalekites For he had a just occasion for saving them since they were of the kindred of Raguel Moses s father in law Hereupon Saul returned home with joy for the glorious things he had done and for the conquest of his enemies as though he had not neglected any thing which the prophet had enjoined him to do when he was going to make war with the Amalekites and as though he had exactly observed all that he ought to have done But God was grieved that the king of the Amalekites was preserved alive and that the multitude had seized on the cattle for a prey because these things were done without his permission For he thought it an intolerable thing that they should con quer their enemies by that power which he gave them and then that he himself should be so grossly despised and disobeyed that a mere man that was a king would not bear it He therefore told Samuel he repented that he had made Saul king while he did nothing that he had commanded him but indulged his own inclinations When Samuel heard that he was in confusion and began to be seech God all that night to be reconciled to Saul and not to be angry with him But he larly seeking to injure and utterly to destroy the nation of Israel See Exod xvii 8â 16 Numb xiv 45 Dent xxv 17 18 19 Judg vi 3 6 vii 12 x 12 1 Sam xv 33 xxx 1 2 Psal Ixxxiii 7 and above all the most bar barous of all cruelties that of Human the Agagite or one of the posterity of Agag the old king of the Amalekites Esth iii 1â 15  1 Sam xv 9 t Kenites 1 Sam xv 6 AN 1106 199 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS did not grant that forgiveness which the pro phet solicited as not deeming it a fit thing to grant forgiveness of such sins at his entrea ties since injuries do not otherwise grow so great as by the easy tempers of those that are injured For while they seek after the glory of being thought gentle and good na tured before they are aware they produce other sins As soon therefore as God had re jected the intercession of the prophet and it plainly appeared he would not change his mind at break of day Samuel came to Saul to Gilgal When the king saw him he ran to him and embraced him and said I re turn thanks to God who hath given me the victory for I have performed every thing that he hath commanded Samuel replied How is it then that I hear the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the greater cattle in the camp Saul made answer that the people had reserved them for sacrifices but that as to the nation of the Amalekites it was entirely destroyed as he had received it in command to see done and that no one man was left but that he had saved alive the king alone and brought him to him con cerning whom he said they would advise together what should be done with him But the prophet said God is not delighted with sacrifices but with good and righteous men who are such as follow his will and his laws and never think that any thing is well done by them but when they do it as God commanded them that he then looks upon nimself as affronted not when any one does not sacrifice but when any one appears dis obedient to him But that from those that do not obey him nor pay him that duty which is the true and acceptable worship he will not kindly accept their oblations be those they offer never so many and so fat and be the presents they make him never so orna mental nay though they were made of gold and silver themselves But he will reject them and esteem them instances of wicked ness and not of piety And that he is de lighted with those that still bear in mind this one thing how to do that whatsoever it be which God pronounces or commands for them to do and to choose rather to die than to transgress any of those commands Nor  1 Sam xr 14 does he require so much as a sacrifice from them and when these sacrifice though it be a mean oblation he better accepts of it as the honour of poverty than such oblations as come from the richest men that offer them to him Wherefore take notice that thou art under the wrath of God for thou hast de spised and neglected what he commanded thee How dost thou then suppose he will respect a sacrifice out of such things as he has doomed to destruction unless perhaps thou dost imagine that it is almost all one to offer it in sacrifice to God as to destroy it Do thou therefore expect that thy kingdom will be taken from thee and that authority which thou hast abused by such insolent be haviour as to neglect that God who bertowed it upon thee Then did Saul confess that he had acted unjustly and did not deny that he had sinned because he had transgressed the injunctions of the prophet but he said that it was out of dread and fear of the soldiers that he did not restrain them when they seized on the prey But forgive me said he  and be merciful to me for 1 will be cautious how I offend for the time to come He also intreated the prophet to go back with him that he might offer his thank offerings to God But Samuel went home because he saw that God would not be reconciled to him But Saul was so desirous to retain Samuel that he took hold of his cloak and because the vehemence of Samuel s departure made the motion to be violent the cloak was rent Upon which the prophet said that after the same manner should the kingdom be rent from him and that a good and a just man should take it that Cod persevered in what he had decreed about him that to be mu table and changeable in what is determined is agreeable to human passions only but it is not agreeable to the divine power Here upon Saul said that he had been wicked but that what was done could not be undone He therefore desired him to honour him so far that the multitude might see that he would accompany him in worshipping God So Samuel granted him that favour and went with him and worshipped God Agag also the king of the Amalekites was brought to him and when the king asked how bitter death was Samuel said As thou hast made many of the Hebrew mothers to lament and 200 book VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS bewail their children so shalt thou by thy death cause thy mother to lament thee also Accordingly he gave orders to slay him im mediately at Gilgal and then went away to the city Ramah CHAP VIII OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DAVID TO THE REGAL AUTHORITY BY THE DIVINE COMMAND AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF SAUL S TRANSGRESSION SAUL being sensible of the miserable con dition he had brought himself into and that he had made God to be his enemy went up to his royal palace at Gibeah which name denotes a hill and after that day he came no more into the presence of the prophet And when Samuel mourned for him God bade him leave off his concern for him and to take the holy oil and go to Bethlehem to Jesse the son of Obed and to anoint such of his sons as he should shew him for their future king But Samuel said he was afraid lest Saul when he came to know of it should kill him either by some private method or even openly But upon God s suggesting to him a safe way of going thither he came to Beth lehem And when they all saluted him and asked what was the occasion of his coming he told them he came to sacrifice to God When therefore he had prepared the sacri fice he called Jesse and his sons to partake And when he saw his eldest son to be a tall and handsome man he guessed by his come liness that he was the person who was to be their future king But he was mistaken in judging about God s providence for when Samuel enquired of God whether he should anoint this youth whom he so much admired and esteemed worthy of the kingdom God said Men do not see as God seeth Thou indeed hast respect to the fine appearance of this youth and thence esteemed him worthy of the kingdom while I propose the kingdom as a reward not out of the beauty of bodies but of the virtue of souls and I enquire after one that is perfectly comely in that respect I mean one who is beautiful in piety right eousness fortitude and obedience for in them consists the comeliness of the soul f When God had said this Samuel desired Jesse to shew him all his sons So he made five others of his sons to come to him Of all which Eliab was the eldest Aminidab the second Shammah the third Nathaniel the fourth the fifth was called Rael and the sixth Asam And when the prophet saw that these were no way inferior to the eldest in their countenances he inquired of God which of them it was whom he chose for their king and when God said it was none of them he asked Jesse whether he had not some other sons besides these and when he said that he had one more named David but that he was a shepherd and took care of the flocks Samuel bade them call him immediately for that till he was come they could not possibly sit down to the feast Now as soon as his father had sent for David and he was come he appeared to be of a yellow complexion of a sharp sight and a comely person in other respecls also This is he said Samuel to himself whom it pleases God to make our king So he sat down to the feast and placed the youth under him and Jesse also with his other sons After which he took oil in the presence of David and anointedJ him and whispered him in the ear and acquainted him that God chose him to be their king and exhorted him to be righteous and obe dient to his commands for that by this means his kingdom would continue for a long time and that his house should be of great splen dour and celebrated in the world that he  1 Sam xv 33 t 1 Sam xvi 7 t Our translation says that Samuel anointed him in the midst of his brethren and for this it is pretended that as this unction was a solemn act and the only title which David had to the kingdom it was necessary to have it done in the presence of some witnesses for which pur pose none were more proper than those of his own family But it is plain from his brother Eliab s treating him after this 1 Sam xvii 28 that he was not privy to his being anointed king elect over God s people and therefore since the words will equally bear the sense of from the midst as well as in the midst of his brethren it is more reasonable to suppose that as this was the ceremony of his designation to the kingdom only few or none except his father perhaps were admitted to it And there was the less reason for witnesses upon this occasion because David never laid claim to the crown till after Saul s de cease and was then at two several times 1st when he was made king over the tribe of Judah and 2d when made king over all the tribes of Israel anointed publicly Calmet s and Patrick s Comment and Howell s History in he notes B AN 1106 201 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS should overthrow the Philistines and that against what nations soever he should make war he should be the conqueror and survive the tight and that while he lived he should enjoy a glorious name and afterwards trans mit it to his posterity So Samuel when he had given him these admonitions went away But the divine Eovver departed from Saul and removed to â avid who upon this removal of the divine spirit to him began to prophesy But as for Saul some strange and demoniacal disorders came upon him and brought upon him such suffocations as were ready to choke him For when the physicians could find no other remedy but this if any person could charm those passions by singing and playing upon the harp they advised them to enquire for such a one and to observe when these de mons came upon him and disturbed him and to take care that such a person might stand over him andf play on the harp and recite hymns to him Accordingly Saul did not delay but commanded them to seek out such a man And when a certain bystander said that he had seen in the city Bethlehem a son of Jesse who was yet no more than a child in age but comely and beautiful and in other respects one that was deserving of great regard who was skilful in playing on the harp and in singing hymns and an excellent soldier in war he sent to Jesse and desired him to take David away from the flocks and to send him to him for he had a mind to see him as having heard an advantageous cha racter of his comeliness and his valour So Jesse sent his son and gave him presents to carry to Saul And when he was come Saul was pleased with him and made him his armour bearer and held him in very great esteem for he charmed his passion and was the only physician against the trouble he had from the demons whenever it came upon him and this by reciting of hymns and playing upon the harp and bringing Saul to his right mind again However he sent to the father of the child and desired him to permit David to stay with him for that he was delighted with his company Which stay that he might not contradict Saul Jesse readily granted CHAP IX OF ANOTHER EXPEDITION OF THE PHILISTINES AGAINST THE HEBREWS UNDER THE REIGN OF SAUL AND OF THEIR DEFEAT BY DAVID SLAYING GOLIATH IN SINGLE COMBAT NOW the Philistines gathered themselves together again no very long time after ward and having assembled a great army they made war against the Israelites and having seized a place between Shochoh and Azekah J they there pitched their camp Saul also drew out his army to oppose them And by pitching his own camp on a certain hill he forced the Philistines to leave their former station and to encamp themselves upon such another hill over against that on which Saul s army lay so that a valley which was between the two hills on which they lay divided their camps asunder Now there came down a man out of the camp of the Philistines whose name was Goliath of the city Gath a man of vast bulk for he was of jj four cubits and a span in tallness Â and had  1 Sam xvi 14 t Spanheim takes notice here that the Greeks had such singers of hymns and that usually children or youth were chosen for that service As also that those called singers to the harp did the same that David did here i e join their own vocal and instrumental music together J Soccoth and Azekah lay to the south of Jerusalem and the east of Bethlehem about four leagues from the former and five from the latter and the ancient valley of Elah must consequently lie not far distant from them though later travellers place it at no more than a league s distance from Jerusalem Calmef s Commentary B i Six in the Hebrew four in the Septuagint Â The words in the text are â Wliose height was six cubits and a span so that taking a cubit to be twenty inches and a half and a span to be three inches and a little more the whole will amount to about twelve feet and a half A stature above as tall again as usual The lowest computation of the cubit however brings it to near ten feet which is the standard that we have set it at though it must not be dissembled that both the Septuagint and Josephus have reduced it to little more than eight feet which badly comports with the weight and vastness of his armour though it might suit their design perhaps in accommodating their account to the credibility of their Heathen readers But be that as it will several authors to shew this vast size of the man not to be beyond the bounds of probability have written ex prqfesso de gigant ibus among whom Hermannus Conringius in his book De antiquo statu Holmstadii and in another De habitu cor porum Germanorum have demonstrated that the ancient Germans were of a vast size even as Cassar De bello Gall testifies of them by calling them cimmani orporum magnitudine homines men of huge greatness of body Nay even Josephus himself who is quoted for denying the existence of giants furnishes us with an argument in 202 book ti ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS about him weapons suitable to the largeness of his body for he had a breast plate on that weighed five thousand shekels He had also a helmet and greaves of brass as large as you would naturally suppose might cover the limbs of so vast a body His spear was also such as was not carried like a light thing in his right hand but he carried it as lying on his shoulders He had also a lance of six hundred shekels and many followed him to carry his armour Wherefore this Goliath stood between the two armies as they were in battle array and sent out a loud voice and said to Saul and to the Hebrews I will free you from fighting and from dangers For what necessity is there that your army should fall and be afflicted Give me a man of you that will fight with me and he that conquers shall have the reward of the conqueror and determine the war for these shall serve those others to whom the conqueror shall belong And certainly it is much better and more prudent to gain what you desire by the hazard of one man than of all When he had said this he retired to his own camp But the next day he came again and used the same words and did not leave off for forty days together to challenge the enemy in the same words till Saul and his army were therewith terrified while they put themselves in array as if they would fight but did not come to an engagement Now while this war between the Hebrews and the Philistines was going on Saul sent away David to his father Jesse and con tented himself with those three sons of his whom he had sent to his assistance and to be partners in the dangers of the war And at first David returned to feed his flocks but after no long time he came to the camp of the Hebrews being sent by his father to carry provisions to his brethren f and to know what they were doing while Goliath came again and challenged them and re proached them that they had no man of valour among them that durst come down and fight him Now as David was talking with his brethren about the business for which his father had sent him he heard the Philistine reproaching and abusing the army and had indignation at it and said to his brethren I am ready to fight a single combat with this adversary Hereupon Eliab and his elder brother reproved him and said that he spake too rashly and improperly for one of his age and bade him go to his flocks and to his father So he was abashed at his brother s words and went away but still spake to some of the soldiers that he was willing to fight with him that challenged them And when they had informed Saul what was the resolution of the young man the king sent for him to come to him And when the king asked what he had to say he their behalf when he gives us an account of some bones of a prodigious size which were found in Hebron as Acosta in his history of the Indies lib 1 c 10 makes mention of bones of an incredible bigness and of a race of giants of such a height that an ordinary man could scarce reach their knees Le Gere s and Patrick s Comment Calmet s Dictionary under the word Goliath and Dis of the Giants B  The words in which Goliath s challenge is expressed are these Why are you come out to set your battle in array Am I not a Philistine and you servants to Saul Choose you a man for you and let him come down to me If he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if J prevail against him and kill him then ye shall be our servants and serve us 1 Sam xviii 8 Anti quity furnishes us with examples of several such like zombats as Goliath here proposes but with none more remarkable than that between the Horatii and Curiatii related by Livy lib 1 c 23 In which case as Gro tius expresses himself Be jure belli et pads lib 2 c 23 though the champions perhaps cannot with all the inno cence imaginable engage in the combat yet their re spective states may at least allow of it as a less evil as an expedient whereby a decision is made without the effu sion of much blood or any considerable loss on either side which of the two nations shall have the dominion over the other Strabo says he makes mention of this as an ancient custom among the Greeks and iEneas appeals to the Latins whether it is not highly just and equitable that he and Tumus should determine the controversy between them even in this manner But whether there was any combat stipulated to be decisive of the quarrel between the two contending nations it is certain that this speech of Goliath s was a mere bravado proceeding from a high opinion he had of his own matchless strength as if he had been the whole support of the nation which was to stand or fall together with him For that he had no authority from the prince of the Philistines to make any such decla ration is evident from the event since so far were the Philistines from yielding themselves slaves to the He brews upon the death of this champion that thry made the best of their way into their own country and there defended themselves and fought many battles with them afterwards Saurin s Dissert vol 4 Dissert 32 and Patrick s and Le Clerc s Comrrent B t In those days it was customary for men to serve their king and country in the wars at their own expense and therefore Jesse sent a supply of provisions to such of his sons as were in the service but since he had other sons at home while David was chiefly in he fields it seems to be by a divine direction that he sent him from the sheep upon this errand B  â i ririiZi piivtf jwa s i s Â â j 7T77Cr An 1106 203 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS replied O king be not cast down nor afraid for I will depress the insolence of this adversary and will go down and fight with him and will bring him under me as tall and as great as he is till he shall be suffi ciently laughed at and thy army shall get great glory when he shall be slain by one that is not yet of man s estate neither fit for fighting nor capable of being intrusted with the marshalling an army or ordering a battle but by one that looks like a child and is really no older in age than a child Now Saul wondered at the boldness and alacrity of David but durst not presume on his ability by reason of his age but said he must on that account be too weak to fight with one that was skilful in the art of war I undertake this enterprise said David in dependance of God s being with me for I have experienced already of his assistance For I once pursued after and caught a lion that assaulted my flocks and took away a lamb from me and I snatched the lamb out of the wild beast s mouth and when he leaped upon me with violence I took him by the tail and dashed him against the ground In the same manner did I avenge myself of a bear also And let this adversary of ours be esteemed like one of these wild beasts since he has a long while reproached our army and blasphemed our God who yet will re duce him under my power Saul prayed that the end might be by God s assistance not disagreeable to the alacrity and boldness of the child and said Go thy way to the fight So he put about him his breast plate and girded on his sword and fitted the helmet to his head and went away But David was burdened with his armour for he had not been exercised to it nor had he learned to walk with it So he said Let this armour be thine O king who  1 Sam xvii 32 t It is highly probable that this was a general practice with idolaters who supposing themselves secure of the favour and protection of their deities concluded that their enemies must necessarily be the objects of their displea â nre and vengeance Hence anticipating the certainty of divine wrath upon them they cursed and devoted them to destruction So did the Philistines act towards David And so the Romans used to do saying â Dii deaeque te perdant B  This mode of speaking and challenging was very common with the Orientals Homer gives the same voL I â NOS 17  18 art able to bear it but give me leave to fight as thy servant and as I myself desire Ac cordingly he laid by the armour and taking his staff with him and putting five stones out of the brook into a shepherd s bag and having a sling in his right hand he went towards Goliath But the adversary seeing him come in such a manner disdained him and jested upon him as if he had not such weapons with him as are usual when one man fights against another but such as are used in driving away and avoiding of dogs and said Dost thou take me not for a man but a dog to which he replied No not for a doe but for a creature worse than a dog This provoked Goliath to anger who thereupon cursed him by the name of God t and threatened to give his flesh to the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the air to be torn to pieces by them To whom David answered  Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a breast plate but I have God for my armour in coming against thee who will destroy thee and all thy army by my hands for I will this day cut off thy head and cast the other parts of thy body to the dogs J and all men shall learn that God is the protector of the He brews and that our armour and our strength is in his providence and that without God s assistance all other warlike preparations and power are useless So the Philistine being retarded by the weight of his armour when he attempted to meet David in haste came on but slowly as despising him and depended upon it that he should slay him who was both unarmed and a child also without any trouble at all But the youth met his antagonist being accompanied with an invisible assistant who was no other than God himself And taking one of the stones that he had out of the haughty air to his heroes and it was doubtless a copy of the manners and hyperbolical speeches of the times Thus he makes one say to another Bold as thou art too prodigal of breath Approach and enter the dark gates of death II vi 177 B I I The dexterity with which the sling may be used as an offensive weapon is surprising It

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS brook and had put into his shepherd s bag and fitted it to his sling he slang it against the Philistine The stone fell upon his fore head and sank into his brain insomuch that Goliath was stunned and fell upon his face So David ran and stood upon his adversary as he lay down and cut off his head with his own sword for he had no sword himself And upon the fall of Goliath the Philistines were beaten and fled for when they saw their champion prostrate on the ground they were afraid of the issue of their affairs and resolved not to stay any longer but com mitted themselves to an ignominious and in decent flight and thereby endeavoured to save themselves from the danger they were in But Saul and the entire army of the He brews made a shout and rushed upon them and slew a great number of them and pur sued the rest to the borders of Gath and to the gates of Ekron So that there were slain of the Philistines thirty thousand and twice as many wounded Saul then returned to their camp and pulled their fortification to Eieces and burnt it But David carried the ead of Goliath into his own tent and dedi cated his sword to God at the tabernacle f CHAP X of saul s envv at david s brilliant success and of the marriage of that conqueror with the king s daughter NOW the women were an occasion of Saul s envy and hatred to David For they came to meet their victorious army with cymbals and drums and all demonstrations of joy and sang thus the wives said Saul hath slain his many thousands of the Philis tines The virgins replied David hath slain his ten thousands Now when the king heard them singing thus and that tie had himself the smallest share in their com mendations and that the greater number the ten thousands were ascribed to the young man and when he considered there was nothing more wanting to David after such applause but the kingdom he began to be afraid and suspicious of David Accordingly he removed him from the station he was in before for he was his armour bearer which out of fear seemed to him much too near a station for him and so he made him captain over a thousand and bestowed on him a post better indeed in itself but as he thought more for his own security For he had a mind to send him against the enemy and into battle as hoping he would be slain in such danger ous conflicts But David had God going along with him whithersoever he went and accordingly he greatly prospered in his undertakings and it was visible that he had mighty successes insomuch that Saul s daughter who was still a virgin fell in love with him and her affec tion so far prevailed over her that it could not be concealed and her father became acquainted with it Now Saul heard this gladly as intending to make use of it for a snare against David and he hoped that it would prove the cause of destruction and of hazards to him So he told those that in formed him of his daughter s affection that he would willingly give David the virgin in mar riage and said I

his Descript de l Arabie p 263 where a son of an Arab chief kills his father s enemy and rival and according to the custom of the Arabs cuts off his head and carries it in triumph to his father In a note he adds  cutting off the head of a slain enemy and carrying it in triumph is an an cient custom Xenophon remarks that it was practised by theChalybes Retreat of the ten thousand lib iv Hero dotus

bare hundred of the foreskins of the Philistines but six hundred of their heads The Septuagint has one hundred foreskins but the Syriac and Arabic two hundred Now that these were not fore skins with other copies but heads with Josephus s copy seems somewhat probable from 1 Sam xxix 4 where all copies say that it was with the heads of such Philistines that David might reconcile himself to his master Saul And if Josephus s copy be right there against all the rest I should also prefer it before the rest here especially as so often repeated in the number six hundred instead of one hundred in

would immediately set about it and so perish by the Philistines and his designs about him would succeed to his mind as he should be freed from him and get him slain not by himself but by another man So he gave order to his servants to try how David would relish this proposal of mar rying the damsel Accordingly they began to say to him that king Saul loved him as well as did all the people and that he was de sirous of his affinity by marriage of this damsel To which he gave this answer Seemeth it to you a light thing to be made the king s son in law it does not seem to me especially when I am one of a family that is low and without any glory or honour Now when Saul was informed by his servants what answer David had made he said  Tell him that I do not want any money nor dowry from him which would be rather to set my daughter to sale than to give her in mar riage but I desire only such a son in law as hath in him fortitude and all other kinds of virtue of which I perceive David is pos sessed and my desire is to receive of him on account of his marrying my daughter neither gold nor silver nor that he should bring such wealth out of his father s house but only some revenge on the Philistines and indeed six hundred of their heads than which a more desirable or a more glorious present could not be brought me and I had much rather obtain this than any of the accustomed dowries for my daughter viz that she should be married to a man of that character and to one who had a testimony as having con quered his enemies When these words of Saul were brought to David he was pleased with them and sup posed that Saul was really desirous of this affinity with him So that without bearing to deliberate any longer or casting about in his mind whether what was proposed was pos sible or was difficult or not he and his com panions immediately set upon the enemy and went about doing what was proposed as the condition of the marriage Accordingly be cause it was God who made all things easy and possible to David he slew many of the Philistines and cut off the heads of six hun dred of them and came to the king and by shewing him these heads of the Philistines required that he might have his daughter in marriage Accordingly Saul having no way of getting off his engagements as thinking it a base thing either to seem a liar when he promised him this marriage or to appear to have acted treacherously by him in putting him upon what was in a manner impossible in order to have him slain he gave him his daughter Michal in marriage CHAP XI op david s deliverance from saul s machinations by the affection of jonathan and the contrivance of michal SAUL was not disposed to persevere long in the state wherein he was for when he saw that David was in great esteem both with God and with the multitude he was afraid And being not able to conceal his fear con cerning his kingdom and his life to be de prived of either of which was a very great calamity he resolved to have David slain and commanded his son Jonathan and his most faithful servants to kill him But Jona than wondered at his father s change with re lation to David that it should be made to so great a degree from shewing him no small good will to contrive how to have him killed Now because he loved the young man and reverenced him for his virtue he informed him of the secret charge his father had given and what was his intentions concerning him However he advised him to take care and be absent the next day for that he would salute his father and if he met with a favour able opportunity he would discourse with him about him and learn the cause of his disgust and shew how little ground there was for it and that for it he ought not to kill a man that had done so many good things for the multitude and had been a benefactor to himself on account of which he ought in reason to obtain pardon had he been guilty of the greatest crimes He also promised to inform him of Saul s resolution Accordingly David complied with such advantageous ad vice and kept himself out of the king s sight On the next day Jonathan came to Saul as soon as he saw him in a cheerful disposition  1 Sam xviii 27 Tt2 206 BOOK â ¼ ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and began to introduce a discourse about David What unjust action O father either little or great said he hast thou found so exceptionable in David as to induce thee to order us to slay a man who hath been a great advantage to thy own preservation and of still greater punishment to the Philistines a man who hath delivered the people of the Hebrews from reproach and derision which they underwent for forty days together when he alone had courage to sustain the challenge of the adversary and after that brought as many heads of our enemies as he was ap pointed to bring and had as a reward for the same my sister in marriage Insomuch that his death would be very sorrowful to us not only on account of his virtue but on ac count of the nearness of our relation for thy daughter must be injured at the same time that he is slain and must be obliged to ex perience widowhood before she can come to enjoy any advantage from their mutual con versation Consider these things and change thy mind to a more merciful temper and do not mischief to a man who in the first place hath done us the great kindness of preserving thee For when an evil spirit and demons had seized upon thee he cast them out and procured rest to thy soul from their incursions and in the second place he hath avenged us of our enemies For it is a base thing to forget such benefits So Saul was pacified with these words and sware to his son that he would do David no harm for a righteous dis course proved too hard for the king s anger and fear So Jonathan sent for David and brought him good news from his father that he was to be preserved He also conducted him to his father and David continued with the king as formerly About this time itf was that upon the Phi listines making a new expedition against the Hebrews Saul sent David with an army to fight with them and joining battle with them he slew many and after his victory he re turned to the king But his reception by Saul was not as he expected upon such suc cess for he was grieved at his prosperity because he thought he would be more dan gerous to him by having acted so gloriously But when the demoniacal spirit came upon him and put him into disorder and disturbed him he called for David into his bed chamber wherein he lay and having a spear in his hand he ordered him to charm him with playing on his harp J and with singing hymns which when David did at his command he with great force threw the spear at him But David being aware of it before he came avoided it and fled to his own house and abode there all that day But at night the king sent officers and commanded that he should be watched till the morning lest he should get quite away that he might come into the judgment hall and so might be delivered up and condemned and slain But when Michal David s wife understood what her father designed she came to her husband as having small hopes of his deliverance and as greatly concerned about her own life also for she could not bear to live in case she was deprived of him And she said Let not the sun find thee here when it rises for if it do that will be the last time it will see thee Fly therefore while the night may afford thee opportunity and may God lengthen it for thy sake for if my father find thee thou art a dead man So she let him down by a cord out of the

a goat s liver and when her father as soon as it was day sent to seize David she said to those that were there that he had not been well during that night and shewed them the bed cover and made them believe by the leaping of the liver which caused the bed clothes to move also that David breathed like one that was asthmatic So when those that were sent told Saul that David had not been well in the night he ordered him to be brought in that condition for he intended to kill him Now when they came and unco vered the bed and found out the woman s contrivance they told it to the king And when her father complained that she had saved his enemy and had put a trick upon himself she invented this plausible defence and said that when he threatened to kill her she lent him her assistance for his preser vation out of fear for which assistance she ought to be forgiven because it was not done of her own free choice but out of necessity For said she  I do not suppose that thou wast so zealous to kill thy enemy as thou wast that I should be saved Accordingly Saul forgave the damsel But David when he had escaped his danger came to the pro phet Samuel at Ramah and told him what snares the king had laid for him and how he was very near to death by Saul throwing a spear at him although he had been no way guilty with relation to him nor had he been cowardly in his battles with his enemies but had succeeded well in them all by God s assistance which thing was indeed the cause of Saul s hatred to David When the prophet was made acquainted with the unjust proceedings of the king he left the city Ramah and took David with him to a certain place called Naioth t and there he abode with him But when it was told Saul that David was with the prophet he sent soldiers to him and ordered them to take him and bring him to him And when they came to Samuel and found there a congre gation of prophets they became partakers of the Divine Spirit and began to prophesy Which when Saul heard of he sent others to David who prophesying in like mariner as did the first he again sent others which third sort prophesying also at last he was angry and went thither in great haste him self But when he was just by the place Samuel before he saw him made him pro phesy also And when Saul came to him he was disordered in mind and under the vehement agitation of a spirit and putting off his garments he fell down and lay on the ground all that day and night in the presence of Samuel and David And David went thence and came to Jona than the son of Saul and lamented to him what snares were laid for him by his father and said that though he had been guilty of no evil nor had offended against him yet he was very zealous to get him killed Here upon Jonathan exhorted him not to give credit to such suspicions nor to the calumnies of those that raised those reports if there were any that did so but to depend on him and take courage for that his father had no such intentions since he would have acquainted him with that matter and take his advice had it been so as he used to consult with him in common when he acted in other affairs But David sware to him that so it was and he desired him rather to believe him and to provide for his safety than to despise what  Since the modern Jews have lost the signification of the Hebrew word here used Cebir and since the Septu agint as well as Josephus render it the liver of the goat and since this rendering and Josephus s account are here so much more clear and probable than those of others it is most unaccountable that our commentators should hesi tate about its true interpretation t 1 Sam xix 18 J It seems that these violent agitations of Saul were no other than demoniacal and that the same demon which used to seize him since he was forsaken of God and which the divine hymns and psalms which were sung to the harp by David used to expel was now in a judicial way brought upon him not only in order to disappoint his intentions against innocent David but to expose him to the contempt of all that saw him or heard of his agitations such violent and wild agitations being never observed in the true pro phets when they were under the inspiration of the Spirit of God Our other copies which say the Spirit of God came upon him seem not so right here as Josephus s copy which mentions nothing of God at all Nor does Josephus seem to ascribe this impulse and ecstacy of Saul s to any other than his own demoniacal spirit which on all accounts appears the most probable Nor does the former description of Saul s real inspiration by the Divine Spirit 1 Sam x 9â 12 Antiq VI 4 which was before he was become wicked well agree with the description before us II What is meant by Saul s lying down naked all that day and all that night 1 Sam xix 24 and whether any more than his laying aside his royal apparel or upper garments as Josephus seems to understand it is by no means certain 208 book yr ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he with great sincerity told him that he would believe what he said when he should either see him killed himself or learn it upon inquiry from others and that the reason why his father did not tell him of these things was that he knew of the friendship and affec tion that he bore towards him When Jonathan found that this intention of Saul s was so well attested he asked him what he would have him do for him to which David replied I am sensible that thou art willing to gratify me in every thing and pro cure me what I desire Now to morrow is the new moon and I was accustomed to sit down then with the king at supper If it seem good to thee I will go out of the city and conceal myself privately there And if Saul inquire why I am absent tell him that f am gone to my city Bethlehem to keep a festival with my own tribe and add this also that thou gavest leave so to do And if he say as is usually said in the case of friends that are gone abroad it is well that he went then assure thyself that no latent mischief or enmity may be feared at his hands But it he answer otherwise that will be a sure sign that he hath some design against me Ac cordingly thou shalt inform me of thy father s inclinations and that out of pity to my case and out of thy friendship for me as instances of which friendship thou hast vouchsafed to accept the assurances of my love to thee and to give the like assurances to me that is those of a master to his servant But if thou discoverest any wickedness in me do thou prevent thy father and kill me thyself f But Jonathan heard those last words with indignation and promised to do what he de sired of him and to inform him if his father s answer implied any thing of a melancholy nature and any enmity against him And that he might the more firmly depend upon him he took him out into the open field into the pure air and sware that he would neglect nothing that might tend to his preservation J and he said I appeal to that God who as thou seest is diffused every where and knoweth this intention of mine before I ex plain it in words as the witness of this my covenant with thee that I will not leave off to make frequent trials of the purpose of my father till I learn whether there be any lurking distemper in the most secret parts of his soul and when I have learnt it I will not conceal it from thee but will discover it to thee whether he be gently or peevishly dis posed For this God himself knows that I pray he may always be with thee for he is with thee now and will not forsake thee but will make thee superior to thine enemies whether my father be one of them or whether 1 myself be such Do thou only remember what we now do and if it happen that I die preserve my children alive and requite what kindnesses thou hast now received to them When he had thus sworn he dismissed David bidding him to go to a certain part of that plain where he used to perform his exercises For as soon as he knew the mind of his father he would come thither to him with one ser vant and If said he I shoot three darts at the mark and then bid my servant carry those three darts away for they are before him know thou that there is no mischief to be feared from my father but if thou hearest me say the contrary expect the contrary treatment from the king However thou shalt gain security by my assistance and shalt by no means suffer any harm But see that thou dost not forget what I have desired of thee in the time of thy prosperity and be serviceable to my children Now David when he had received these assurances from Jonathan went to the place appointed On the next day which was the new moon the king when he had purified himself as the custom was came to supper and when there sat by him his son Jonathan on his right hand and Abner the captain of his host on the other hand he saw David s seat empty but said nothing supposing that he had not puri fied himself and so could not be present  1 Sam xx 3 t 1 Sam xx 8 J Various ceremonies have been used on these occa sions When treaties were made either of a private or public nature such usages were observed as were of established authority or tignificantly important The Scythians had a peculiar method of forming their treaties Herodotus 1 iv c 70 relates that they first poured wine into a large earthen vessel and then the contracting parties cutting their arms with a knife let some of their blood run into the wine and stained likewise their armour therewith After which they themselves and all that were present drank of that liquor making the strongest imprecations against the person that should violate the treatv B It 1 Sam xx 22 AN 1102 209 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS But when he saw that he was not there on the second day of the month he inquired of Jonathan why the son of Jesse did not come to the supper and the feast neither the day before nor that day Jonathan replied that he was gone according to the agreement be tween them to his own city where his tribe kept a festival and that by his permission that he also invited him to come to their sacrifice and said Jonathan If thou wilt give me leave I will go thither for thou knowest the good will that I bear him And then it was that Jonathan understood his father s hatred to David and plainly saw his entire disposition For Saul could not restrain his anger but reproached Jonathan and called him the son of a runagate and an enemy and said he was a partner with David and his assistant and that by this behaviour he shewed he had no regard to himself or to his mother and would not be persuaded that while David remained alive their king dom was not secure to them Yet did he bid him send for him that he might be punished And when Jonathan said in answer What hath he done that thou wilt punish him Saul no longer contented himself to express his anger in bare words but snatched up his spear and leaped upon him and was desirous to kill him He did not indeed do what he intended because he was hindered by his friends but it appeared plainly to his son that he hated David and greatly desired to despatch him insomuch that he had almost slain his son with his own hands on his ac count  The king s son rose hastily from supper and being then unable to admit any thing into his mouth for grief he wept all night both because he had himself been near de struction and because the death of David was determined But as soon as it was day he went out into the plain that was before the city as going to perform his exercises but in reality to inform his friend what dis position his father was in towards him as he had agreed to do And when Jonathan had done what had been thus agreed he dis missed his servant that followed him to re turn to the city but he himself went into the desert and came into his presence and com muned with him So David appeared and fell at Jonathan s feet and bowed down to him and called him the preserver of his soul But he lifted him up from the earth and they mutually embraced one another and made a long greeting and that not without tears They also lamented their age and that fa miliarity which envy would deprive them of and that separation which must now be ex pected which seemed to them no better than death itself So recollecting themselves at length from their lamentation and exhorting each other to be mindful of the oaths they had mutually sworn they parted CHAP XII of David s flight

of by him and came to the city Nob tof Ahimelech the priest who when he saw him coming alone and neither a friend nor a servant with him he wondered at it and desired to learn the cause why there was nobody with him To which David answered that the king had commanded him to do a certain thing that was to be kept secret to which if he had a mind to know so much he had no occasion for any one to accompany him However said he  I have ordered my servants to meet me at such and such a place So he desired him to let him have somewhat to eat and that in case he would supply him he would act the part of a friend and be assisting to the business he was now about And when he had obtained what he desired he also asked him whether he had any weapons with  l Sam xx 42 t Whether this Ahimelech of the family of Ithamar or Abiathar of the same family were the Jewish high priest when David came to Nob see my dissertation at the end of my Essay on the Revelation of St John at large pag 884â 289 Josephus believed that Ahimelech was then the high priest which seems contrary to our Saviour s affirmation Mar ii 25 26 I mean this unless there were in effect two high priests at the same time the one of the family of Eleazar and the other of that of Ithamar the one Ahimelech the other Abiathar and that our Saviour esteemed Abiathar to be so most pro perly which is not impossible to be supposed 210 BOOK Yt ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him either sword or spear Now there was at Nob a servant of Saul s by birth a Syrian whose name was Doeg one that kept the king s mules The high priest said that he had no such weapon but he added Here is the sword of Goliath which when thou hadst slain the Philistine thou didstf dedi cate to God When David had received the sword he fled out of the country of the Hebrews into that of the Philistines over which Achish reigned And when the king s servants knew him and he was made known to the king himself the servants informing him that he was that David who had killed many ten thousands of the Philistines David was afraid lest the king should put him to death and that he should experience that danger from him which he had escaped from Saul so he pretended to be distracted and mad letting his spittle run out of his mouth and doing other actions before the king of Gath which might make him believe that they proceeded from such a distemper Accordingly the king was very angry at his servants that they had brought him a madman J and gave order that they should eject David immediately out of the city When David had escaped in this manner out of Gath he came to the tribe of Judah and abode in a cave by the city of Adullam Then it was that he sent to his brethren and informed them where he was who then came to him with all their kindred and as many others as were either in want or in fear of king Saul came and made a body together and told him they were ready to obey his orders They were in all four hundred Whereupon he took courage now such a force and assistance was come to him So he removed hence and came to the king of the Moabites and desired him to entertain his parents in his country while the issue of his affairs were in such an uncertain condition The king granted him his favour and payed great respect to David s parents all the time they were with him As for himself upon the prophet s com manding him to leave the desert and go into the portion of the tribe of Judah and abide  Edomite in the Hebrew Syrian in the Septuagint t Antiq vi 9  1 Sam xvi 15 there he complied and coming to the city Hareth which was in that tribe he remained there Now when Saul heard that David had been seen with a multitude about him he fell into no small disturbance and trouble But as he knew that David was a bold and cou rageous man he suspected that somewhat ex traordinary would appear from him and that openly also which would make him weep and put him into distress So he called toge ther his friends and his commanders and the tribe from which he was himself derived to the hill where his palace was and sitting upon a place called Aroura his courtiers that were in dignities and the guards of his body being with him he spake thus to them you that are men of my own tribe I conclude remem ber the benefits that I have bestowed upon you that I have made some of you owners of land and made you commanders and be stowed posts of honour upon you and set some of you over the common people and others over the soldiers I ask you there fore whether you expect greater donations from the son of Jesse for I know that you are all inclined towards him even my own son Jonathan is of that opinion and persuades you to be of the same For I am not unac quainted with the oaths and covenants that are between him and David and that Jona than is a counsellor and an assistant to those that conspire against me and none of you are concerned about these things but you keep silence and watch to see what will be the result When the king had concluded his speech not one of the rest of those that were present made any answer but Doeg the Syrian Â who fed his mules said that he saw David when he came to the city Nob to Ahimelech the high priest and that he learned future events by his prophesying that he received food from him and the sword of Goliath and was conducted by him with security whither he desired to go Saul therefore sent for the high priest and for all his kindred and said to them what terrible or ungrateful thing hast thou suffered from me that thou hast received the son of Jesse and hast bestowed on him both food and weapons when he was contriving to get II About an 1099 Â Or Edomite Air 1099 211 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the kingdom and farther why didst thou de liver oracles to him concerning futurity for thou couldst not be unacquainted that he had fled away from me and that he hated my family But the high priest did not at tempt to deny what he had done but con fessed boldly that he had supplied him with those things not to gratify David but Saul himself and he said  I did not know that he was thy adversary but a servant of thine who was very faithful to thee and a captain over a thousand of thy soldiers and what is more than these thy son in law Men do not choose to confer such favours on their adver saries but on those who are esteemed to bear the highest good will and respect to them Nor is this the first time that I pro phesied for him but have done it at other times as well as now And when he told me that he was sent by thee to perform some thing in great haste if I had furnished him with nothing that he desired I should have thought it was rather in contradiction to thee than to him Wherefore do not thou enter tain any ill opinion of me nor do thou have a suspicion of what I then thought an act of humanity from what is now told thee of David s attempts against thee for I did to him as to thy friend and son in law and cap tain of a thousand and not as to thine adver sary The high priest s defence however had no effect upon Saul for his fear was so pre valent that he could not give credit to any apology that was very just So he commanded his armed men to kill him and all his kindred But as they durst not touch the high priest but were more afraid of disobeying God than the king he ordered Doeg the Syrian to kill  Eighty five Hebrew Three hundred and five Septuagint t Nob was not a city allotted to the priests nor had the prophets that we know of any particular cities allotted to them It seems the tabernacle was now at Nob and probably a school of the prophets was here also It was full two days journey on foot from Jerusalem The num ber of priests here slain in Josephus is 385 and but 85 in our Hebrew copies yet are they 305 in the Septuagint I prefer Josephus s number the Hebrew having I sup pose only dropped the hundreds the other the tens This city Nob seems to have been the chief or perhaps the only seat of the family of Ithamar which here perished according to God s former terrible threatenings to Eli 1 Sam ii 27â 36 iii 11â 18 J 1 Sam xxii 20 voL I â NOS 17  18 them Accordingly he took to his assistance such wicked men as were like himself and slew Ahimelech and his family which were in all three hundred and eighty five Saul also sent men to Nob f the city of the priests and slew all that were there without sparing either women or children or any other age and burnt it Only there was one son of Ahimelech whose name was Abiathar who escaped J However these things came to pass as God had foretold to Eli the high priest when he said that his posterity should be destroyed on account of the transgressions of his two sons Now Saul by perpetrating so barbarous a crime and murdering the whole pontifical family by having no pity for the infants nor reverence for the aged and by the over throwing the city also which God had chosen for the property and support of the priests and prophets which were there and had ordained as the only city allotted for the edu cation of such men gives all to understand and consider the disposition of men that while they are private persons and in a low condition because it is not in their power to indulge nor to venture upon what they wish for they are equitable and moderate and pursue nothing but what is just and bend their whole minds and labours that way then it is that they have this belief about God that he is present to all the actions of their lives and that he does not only see the actions that are done but clearly knows those thoughts also whence their actions arise But when once they are advanced into power and au thority they put offall such notions and as if they were no other than actors upon a theatre they lay aside their disguised parts II We have here an admirable reflection of Josephus s concerning the general wickedness of men in great au thority and the danger they are in of rejecting that regard to justice and humanity to divine providence and the fear of God which they either really had or pretended to have while they were in a lower condition It can never be too often perused by kings and great men nor by those who expect to obtain such elevated dignities among man kind See the like reflections of our Josephus s VII 1 at the end and VIII 10 at the beginning also XIII 7 about the middle They are to the like purport with one branch of Agur s prayer One thing have I required of thee  deny me not before I die give me not riches lest I be full and deny thee and say who is the Lord Prov xxx 7 8 9 Uu 212 BOOK VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and manners and take up boldness insolence and a contempt of both divine and human laws And that at a time when they espe cially stand in need of piety and righteous ness because they are then peculiarly ex posed to envy and all they think and say are in the view of all men then it is that they become so insolent in their actions as though God saw them no longer or were afraid of them because of their power And whatso ever it is that they are either afraid of by the rumours they hear or they hate by inclination or love without reason these seem to them to be authentic firm and true and pleasing both to man and to God But as to what would come hereafter they have not the least regard to it They raise those to honour indeed who have been at a great deal of pains for them and after that honour they envy them and when they have brought them unto high dignity they do not only de prive them of what they had obtained but on that very account of their lives also and that on wicked accusations and such as on account of their extravagant nature are in credible They also punish men not for such actions as deserve condemnation but from calumnies and accusations without examina tion and this extends not only to such as de serve to be punished but to as many as they are able to kill This reflection is openly confirmed from the example of Saul the son of Kish who was the first king who reigned after our aristocracy and government under the judges and that by his slaughter of three hundred priests and prophets on occasion of his suspicion about Ahimeleoh and by the additional wickedness of the overthrow of their city and this as if he were endeavouring in some sort to render the tabernacle desti tute both of priests and prophets which en deavour he shewed by slaying so many of them and not suffering the very city be longing to them to remain lest others might exceed them But Abiathar the son of Ahimelech who alone could be saved out of the family of priests slain by Saul fled to David and in formed him of the calamity that had befallen their family and of the slaughter of his fa ther David replied that he was not unap prised of what would follow with relation to them when he saw Doeg there for he had then a suspicion that the high priest would be falsely accused by him to the king and he blamed himself as having been the cause of this misfortune But he desired him to stay there and abide with him as in a place where he might be better concealed than any where else chap xm of david s generosity in repeatedly sparing the life of saul when opportunities offered for his de struction and of the death of samuel and nabal ABOUT this time David heard that the Philistines had made an inroad into the country of Keilah f and robbed it So he offered himself to fight against them if God when he should be consulted by the prophet would grant him the victory And when the prophet said that God gave the signal of vic tory he made a sudden onset upon the Phi listines with his companions and he shed a great deal of blood and carried ofTtheir prey and staid with the inhabitants of Keilah till they had securely gathered in their corn and their fruit However it was told Saul that David was with the men of Keilah for what had been done and the great success that had attended him were not confined among the people where the things were done but the fame of it went all abroad and came to the hearing of others and both the fact as it stood and the author of the fact were carried to the king s ears Then was Saul glad when he heard that David was in Keilah and he said  God hath now put him into my hands since he hath obliged him to come into a city that hath walls and gates and bars So he commanded all the people to set upon Keilah suddenly and when they had besieged and taken it to kill David But when David per ceived this and learned of God that if he stayed there the men of Keilah would deliver him up to Saul he took his four hundred men and retired into a desert that was over a city called Engaddi So when the king heard he was fled away from the men of Keilah he left off his expedition against him J Then David removed thence and came to  1 Sam Mii 23 t 1 Sam xxiii 1 et seq l 1 Sam xxiii 13  aN 1099 1 213 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS a certain place called the New Place be longing to Ziph Where Jonathan the son of Saul came to him and saluted him and exhorted him to be of good courage and to hope well as to his future condition and not to despond at his present circumstances for that he should be king and have all the forces of the Hebrews under him but told him that such happiness uses to come with great labour and pains They also took oaths that they would all their lives long continue in good will and fidelity one to another and David called God to witness as to what exe cration he had made upon himself if he should transgress his covenant and should change to a contrary behaviour So Jona than left him there having rendered his cares and fear somewhat lighter and returned home Now the men of Ziph to gratify Saul informed him that David abode with them and assured him that if he would come to them they would deliver him up for that if the king would seize on the straits of Ziph David could not escape to any other people So the king commended them and confessed that he had reason to thank them because they had given him information of his enemy and he promised that it should not be long ere he would requite their kindness He also sent men to seek for David and to search the wilderness wherein he was resolving to follow them in person Accordingly they went before the king to search for David and used endeavours not only to shew their food will to Saul by informing him where is enemy was but to evince the same more plainly  by delivering him up into his power But a failure attended the unjust and wicked desires of these men who while they under went no hazard by not discovering such an ambition of revealing this to Saul yet did they falsely accuse and promise to deliver up a man beloved of God and one that was unjustly sought for to be put to death and who might otherwise have lain concealed and this out of flattery and expectation of gain from the king For when David was apprised of the malignant intentions of the men of Ziph and of the approach of Saul he left the straits of that country and fled to the great rock that was in the wilderness of Maon Hereupon Saul hastened to pursue him thither For as he was marching he learned that David was gone away from the straits of Ziph and Saul removed to the other side of the rock But the report that the Philistines had again made an incursion into the country of the Hebrews called Saul ano ther way from the pursuit of David when he was ready to be caught for he returned back again to oppose those Philistines who were naturally their enemies as judging it more necessary to avenge himself of them than to continue the pursuit of a single enemy and to overlook the ravage that was made in the land By this means David unexpectedly escaped out of the danger he was in and came to the straits of Engedi And when Saul had driven the Philistines out of the land there came some messengers who told him that David abode within the bounds of Engedi So he took three thousand chosen men that were armed and hastened towards him And when he was not far from those places he saw a deep and hollow cave by the way side It was open to a great length and breadth and there it was that David with his four hundred men were concealed Saul having occasion to enter here alone was seen by one of Da vid s companions and he that saw him said that David had now by God s providence an opportunity of avenging himself of his adver sary and advised him to cut off his head and so deliver himself out of that tedious wander ing condition and the distress he was in David accordingly arose up and cut off the skirt of Saul s garment but he soon repented of what he had done and said it was not right to kill him that was his master and one whom God had thought worthy of the kingdom f  The name of this place Kaivij or the New Place as it is both in the Septuagint and Josephus 1 Sam xxii 15 is justly supposed by Dr Hudson to have risen from a different reading of the Hebrew word Bahadesa in the new place instead of that in our present Hebrew Baho resa in the wood Which was the original reading can hardly now be determined Only two of the best copies may well be preferred to one copy which is not so good t If it be asked how David could do this without Saul s perceiving it the answer might be that this possibly might be some upper loose garments which Saul might put off and lay aside at some distance from him upon this occasion and that as there were several rooms or par ticular cells in these large caverns which might have se cret passages from one to another Saul at the mouth of one of these cells might lay down his upper garment U u 2 214 fBOOK VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS For that although he were wickedly dis posed yet was it not lawful to touch his life But when Saul had left the cave David cried aloud and desired Saul to hear him Here upon the king turned his face and David according to custom prostrated himself be fore the king and said O king thou oughtest not to hearken to wicked men nor to such as forge calumnies nor gratify them so far as to believe what they say nor to entertain suspicions of such as are thy best friends but to judge of the disposition of all men by their actions For calumny deludes men but their own actions are a clear de monstration of their kindness Words indeed in their own nature may be either true or false but actions expose intentions nakedly to our view By these therefore it would be well for thee to believe me as to my regard to thee and to thy house and not to believe those who frame such accusations against me as never came into my mind nor are possible to be executed and to this farther by pur suing after my life and have no concern either day or night but how to murder me which thing I think thou dost unjustly prosecute For how is it that thou hast embraced this false opinion as if I had a desire to kill thee or how canst thou escape the crime of im piety towards God when thou wishest thou couldst kill and deemest thine adversary a man who had it in his power this day to avenge himself and to punish thee but would not do it nor make use of such an oppor tunity which if it had fallen out to thee which David perceiving and knowing all the passages of the place might go some secret way and cut off some small part of it Nor could the noise which David s motion made be well heard by Saul because it must have been drowned by a much greater noise which Saul s army waiting for him at the month of the cave may be supposed to make Poole s Annotations B  Whence this determination of the ancients is derived I cannot tell t 1 Sam xxiv 22 I An 1098 B C II The Jews are of opinion that Samuel died only four months before Saul but by the generality of Christian chronologers he is supposed to have died about two years before the death of that prince and in the ninety eighth year of his age twenty of which had been spent in the government of Israel though Sir John Marsham will have it no more than sixteen before Saul s inauguration after which he lived about eighteen He was at first interred at Ramah but in the time of the Emperor Arcadius his body was transported from Palestine to Constantinople against me thou hadst not let it slip For when 1 cut off the skirt of thy garment I could have done the same to thy head So he shewed him the piece of his garment and thereby made him agree to what he said to be true and added I certainly have ab stained from taking a just revenge upon thee yet art not thou ashamed to prosecute me with unjust hatred May God do justice and determine about each of our dispositions Saul was amazed at the strange deliverance he had received and being greatly affected with the moderation and disposition of the young man he groaned and when David had done the same the king answered  1 have the justest occasion to groan for thou hast been the author of good to me as I have been the author of calamity to thee And thou hast demonstrated this day that thou possessest the righteousness of the ancients who determined that men ought to save their enemies though they caught them in a desert place I am now persuaded that God re serves the kingdom for thee and that thou wilt obtain the dominion over all the Hebrews Give me then assurances upon oath that thou wilt not root out my family nor out of re membrance of what evil I have done thee destroy my posterity but save and preserve my house So David sware as he desired and sent Saul back to his own kingdom But he and those that were with him went up to the straits of Masteroth f About this timeJ Samuel the prophet died He was a man whom the Hebrews honoured and as St Jerom informs us received both by the clergy and laity with a joy unspeakable and honours almost in finite He was indeed while he lived an excellent governor and through his whole administration above vanity corruption or any private views Those that at tend to his life may observe that he was modest without meanness mild without weakness firm without obstinacy and severe without harshness or as the author of Eccle siasticus has recorded his actions and consecrated this eulogy to his memory Samuel the prophet of the Lord says he beloved of the Lord established a kingdom and anointed princes over his people Py the law of the Lord he judged the congreti ntion and the Lord had respect unto Jacob By bis faithfulness he was found a true prophet and by bis word be was known to be faithful in vision He called upon the mighty God when his enemies pressed upon him on every side when he offered the sucking lamb and the Lord thundered from heaven and with a great noise made his voice to be heard He destroyed the rulers of the Syrians and all the princes of the Philistines Before his long sleep he made pro ak 1099 215 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in an extraordinary degree for that lament ation which the people made for him during a long time manifested his virtue and the affection which they bore him as also did the solemnity and concern that appeared about his funeral and about the complete observance of all his funeral rites They buried him in his own city Ramah and wept for him a very great number of days not looking on it as a sorrow for the death of another man but as that in which they were individually concerned He was a righteous man and gentle in his nature and on that account he was very dear to God Now he governed and presided over the people alone after the death of Eli the high priest t twelve years andJ eighteen years together with Saul the king and thus we have finished the history of Samuel There was a man that was a Ziphite of the city Malum who was rich and had a vast number of cattle for he had a dock of three thousand sheep and another of a thousand goats Now David had charged his associates to preserve these flocks from damage and to do them no mischief neither out of covetous ness nor because they were in want nor be cause they were in the wilderness and so could not easily be discovered but to esteem freedom from injustice above all other mo tives and to look upon the touching of what belonged to another man as a horrible crime and contrary to the will of God Such were the instructions he gave thinking that the favours he granted this man were bestowed on one that deserved to have such care taken of his affairs This person was Nabal a harsh man and of a very wicked life being like a cynic in the course of his behaviour but still had obtained for his wife a woman of good character wise and handsome To this Nabal therefore David sent ten of his at tendants at the time when he sheared his sheep and by them saluted him and also wished he might do what he now did for many years to come but desired him to make him a present of what he was able to give him since he must have learned from his shepherds that he had done them no injury but had been their guardians a long time while he continued in the wilderness and be assured he should never repent of giving any thing to David When the messengers had declared their errand to Nabal he accosted them after an inhuman and rough manner for he asked them who David was And when he heard that he was the son of Jesse  Now is the time said he  that fugitives grow in solent and make a figure and leave their masters When they told David this he was wroth and commanded four hundred armed men to follow him and left two hun dred to take care of the stuff for he had already six hundred and went against Nabal he also swore that he would utterly destroy the whole house and possessions of Nabal for that he was grieved not only that he had proved ungrateful without making any return for the humanity he had shewn him but that he had also reproached them and used ill language when he had received no cause of disgust Hereupon one of those that kept the flocks of Nabal said to his mistress that when David sent to her husband he had received no civil answer but on the contrary very re proachful language while yet David had taken extraordinary care to keep his flocks testations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed and after his death he prophesied and shewed the king his end Eccles xlvi 13 c But besides the things that are recorded of this prophet in the first book of Samuel there are some other passages concerning him in the first book of Chronicles as That he enriched the tabernacle with several spoils which he took from the enemies of Israel during his administration chap xxvi 28 That he assisted in regulating the distribution of the Levites which David afterwards prescribed for the service of the temple chap ix 22 And lastly That he wrote the History of David in conjunction with the prophets Nathan and Gad but as he was dead before David came to the throne this can be meant only of the beginning of that history which by the other two prophets might be continued and con cluded There is great probability indeed that he com posed the twenty four first chapters of the first book of Samuel which contain the beginning of David s life and several historical facts wherein he himself had a large share but as for the latter part of it it was impossible for him to write it because in the beginning of the 2Eth chapter there is no mention made of his death B  1 Sam nr 1 t From an 1128 to 1116 j From an 1116 to 1098 II The number of men that came first to David are dis tinctly in Josephus and in our common copies but 400 When he was at Keilah still but 400 both in Josephus and the Septuagint but 600 in our Hebrew copies 1 Sam xxiii 13 See xxx 9 10 Now the 600 there mentioned are here intimated by Josephus to have been so many onlj by an augmentation of 200 afterward which I suppose js the true solution of this seeming disagreement 216 book VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS from harm and what had passed would prove very pernicious to his master When the servant had said this Abigail for that was the wife s name saddled her asses and loaded them with all sorts of presents and without telling her husband any thing of what she was about for he was not sensible on account of his drunkenness she went to David She was then met by David as she was descending a hill for he was coming Wainst Nabal with the four hundred men hen the woman saw him she leaped from her ass and fell on her face and bowed down to the ground and intreated him not to bear in mind the words of Nabal since he knew that he resembled his name Now Nabal in the Hebrew tongue signifies folly So she apologized by saying that she did not see the messengers whom he sent Forgive me therefore said she and thank God who hath hindered thee from shedding human blood For so long as thou keepest thyself innocent he will avenge thee of wicked men For those miseries which await Nabal will fall upon the heads of thine enemies Be thou gracious to me and think me so far worthy as to accept these presents and out of regard to me remit that wrath and anger which thou hast against my husband and his house For mildness and humanity become thee especially as thou art to be our king Accordingly David accepted her presents and said O woman it was no other than God s mercy which brought thee to us to day For otherwise thou hadst never seen another day I havingf sworn to destroy Nabal s house this very night and to leave alive not one of you who belonged to a man that was wicked and ungrateful to me and my companions But now hast thou prevented me and sea sonably mollified my anger as being thyself under the care of God s providence But as for Nabal although for thy sake he now escape punishment he will not always avoid justice for his evil conduct which on some other occasion will be ruin When David had said this he dismissed the woman And when she came home and found her husband feasting with a great com pany and oppressed with wine she said nothing to him about what had happened but on the next day when he was sober she told him all the particulars and made his whole body to appear like that of a dead man J by her words and by that grief which arose from them So Nabal survived only ten days and then died And when David heard of his death he said that God had justly avenged him of this man for that Nabal died by his own wickedness and had suffered punishment on his account while he had kept his own hand clean At which time he under stood that the wicked are persecuted by God that he does not overlook any man but bestows on the good what is suitable to them and inflicts a deserved punishment on the  Here we may perceive how Josephus nay how Abigail herself would understand the not avenging our selves but heaping coals of fire on the head of the inju rious Prov xxv 21 22 Rom xii 20 not as we com monly do now of melting them into kindness but of leaving them to the judgment of God to whom vengeance belongeth Deut xxxii 35 Ps xciv 1 Heb x 30 and who will take vengeance on the wicked And since all God s judgments are just and all fit to be executed and all at length for good of the persons punished I incline to think that to be the meaning of this phrase of heaping coals of fire on their heads So also as it seems to me do the Apostolical Constitutions understand it I 2 t We imy note here that how sacred soever an oath was esteemed among the people of God in old times as I have fully shewn in my Scripture Politics p 54â 65 they did not think it obligatory where the action was plainly unlawful For so we see it was in this case of David who although he had sworn to destroy Nabal and his family yet does he here and 1 Sam xxv 32 33 31 bless God for preventing his keeping this oath and from shedding of blood as he had sworn to do J The words in the original are  He became a stone but our translation has wisely supplied the particle at which should always be done when the scripture affirms something of another that is not absolutely of the same nature We may observe however that this manner of expression is very common among profane authors Thus Ovid brings in Ariadne expressing her grief and astonish ment at the loss of Theseus who had left her in the island Dia Aut mare prospiciens in saxo frigida sedi Quamque lapis seges tarn lapis ipsa fui The like expression is used of Hecuba when she saw the dead body of her son Polydorus duroque simillima saxo Torpet But in the case of Niobe who is said to be turned into a statue of stone Cicero in his Tusculan Questions ob serves that this fable only represents her perpetual silence in mourning and accordingly Josephus tells us of Nabal that when his wife told him of the danger he had escaped he was struck with such an astonishment that he fell into a dead numbness all over his body of which he soon died Le Clerc s Comment and Dm De statu salis 6 II 1 Sam xxv 38 AN 217 1097 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS wicked So he sent to Nabal s wife and in vited her to come to him to live with him and to be his wife Whereupon she replied to those that came that she was not worthy to touch his feet However she came with all her servants and became his wife having received that honour on account of her wise and righteous course of life and also partly on account of her beauty Now David had a wife before whom he married from the city Abesar For as to Michal the daughter of king Saul who had been David s wife her father had given her in marriage to Phalti the son of Laish who was of the city Gallim After this came certain of the Ziphites and told Saul that David was come again into their country and that if he would afford them his assistance they could catch him So he came to them with three thousand armed men and upon the approach of night he pitched his camp at a certain place called Hachilah But when David heard that Saul was coming against him he sent spies and bade them let him know to what part of the country Saul was already come And when they told him that he was at Hachilah he concealed his going away from his own com panions and came to Saul s camp having taken with him Abishai his sister Zeruiah s son and Ahimelech the Hittite Now Saul was asleep and the armed men with Abner their commander lay round about him in a circle Hereupon David entered into the king s tent but he did neither kill Saul though he knew where he lay by the spear that was stuck down by him t nor did he give leave to Abishai who would have killed him and was strongly inclined so to do For he said it was a horrid crime to kill one that was ordained king by God although he were a wicked man for that he who gave him the dominion would in time inflict punishment upon him so he restrained his eagerness But that it might appear to have been in his f ower to have killed him when he refrained rom it he took his spear and the cruse of water which stood by Saul without being perceived by any in the camp who were all asleep and went securely away having per formed every thing among the king s attend ants that the opportunity afforded and his boldness encouraged him to do So when he had passed over the brook and ascended to the top of a hill whence he might be suffi ciently heard he cried aloud to Saul s sol diers and to Abner their commander and awakened them out of their sleep and called both to him and to the people Hereupon the commander asked who it was that called him to whom David replied  It is I the son of Jesse whom thou makest a vagabond But what is the matter dost thou that art a man of so great dignity and of the first rank in the king s court take so little care of thy master s person and is sleep of more conse quence to thee than his preservation this negligence deserves death and punishment ought to be inflicted on thee who didst not perceive when a little while ago some of us entered into thy camp nay as far as to the king himself If thou look for the king s spear and his cruse of water thou wilt learn  1 Sam xxv 44 t Carrying a long pike before a company of Arabs is a token that an Arab Sheekh or prince is there the fixing of it likewise near a person of authority points out his dig nity Thus Josephiis giving an account of David s en tering the camp of Saul when that prince and his people were fast asleep informs us that notwithstanding the op portunity he did no hurt to Saul though he well knew where he slept by the spear which was fixed near him and that he suffered not Abishai to slay him then though he would fain have done it English readers generally suppose that every man had his spear stuck into the ground at his head but Josephus supposes that circum stance distinguished the royal sleeping place from that of every body else which it would not have done if it had not been something peculiar to Saul distinguishing him from his officers and people It was it should seem then a customary distinction in the timo of Josephus and he thought it also an usage is m ient as the time of Saul Perhaps too this describing Saul as known by the spear I may intimate that he slept with his face covered being laid on the ground in the open air Thus de la Roque describes the Bedouin Arabs of the Holy Land though in general they live under tents yet sometimes he says they sleep in their clothes in summer time on the ground only covering their body and face with their aba or outer garment Voy dans la Pal c 12 p 176 Josephus then in all probability supposes this expedition was un dertaken in the time of summer and that Saul s face was muffled up so as rather to be known by the spear than by his countenance in a night sufficiently light to have distinguished him had he not been so covered It seems indeed to be the common practice of the Eastern people to sleep with their faces covered according to Niebuhr and he supposes that Europeans would find the benefit of it if they would adopt the same usage the dews and some winds being found to be very hurtful Descript de VArahie p 9 Harrier s Observations on Scripture vol i p 96 Clarke s Edition B 218 book VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS what a mighty misfortune was ready to over take you in your very camp without your knowing of it Now when Saul knew David s voice and understood that when he had him in his power while he was asleep and his guards took no care of him yet did he spare him when he might justly have cut him off he said that He owed him thanks for his preservation and exhorted him to be of good courage and not to be afraid of suffering any mischief from him any more and to return to his own home for he was now persuaded that he did not love himself so well as he was beloved by him that he had driven away him that could guard him and had given many demonstrations of his good will that he had forced him to live so long in a state of banishment and in great fears of his life des titute of his friends and his kindred While still he was often saved by him and fre quently received his life again when he was evidently in danger of perishing So David bade them send for the spear and the cruse of water and take them back adding that God would be the judge of both their dispo sitions and of the actions that flowed from the same for he knows said he that when it was this day in my power to have killed thee I abstained from it Saul having thus escaped the hands of David twice returned to his royal palace and his own city But David was airaid if he staid there he should be caught by Saul So he thought it better to go up into the land of the Philistines Accordingly he came with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish the king of Gath which was one of their five cities Now the king received both him and his men and gave them a place to inhabit He had with him also his two wives Ahinoam and Abigail and he dwelt in Gath But when Saul heard this he took no farther care about sending to him or going after him because he had been twice in a manner caught by him while he was himself endea vouring to catch him However David had no mind to continue in the city of Gath but desired the king that since he had received him with such humanity he would grant him  1 Sam xxvi 23 t This farther account is not I think found in Jose phus s present works J A year and four months in the Hebrew and Septua another favour and bestow upon him some place in that country for his habitation for he was ashamed by living in the city to be grievous and burdensome to him So Achish gave him a certain village called Ziklag which David and his sons were fond of when he was king and reckoned it to be their pe culiar inheritance But about those matters we shall give the reader farther informationf elsewhere â Now the time that David dwelt in Ziklag in the land of the Philistines was fourJ months and twenty days And now he privately attacked these Geshurites and Amalekites that were neighbours to the Phi listines and laid waste their country and took much prey of their beasts and camels and then returned home But David ab stained from the men as fearing they should discover him to king Achish Yet did he send part of the prey to him as a free gift And when the king inquired whom they had attacked when they brought away the prey he said those that lay to the south of the Jews and inhabited in the plain whereby he per suaded Achish to approve of what he had done for he hoped that David had fought against his own nation and that now he should have him for his servant all his

the city Shunem whence they might gather themselves together and sud denly attack the Hebrews Then did Achish the king of Gath desire David to assist them with his armed men against the Hebrews This he readily promised and said that the time was now come wherein he might requite him for his kindness and hospitality So the king promised to make him the keeper of his gint See 1 Sam xxvii 7 and xxix

promise of honour and confi dence he made on purpose to increase his zeal for his service Now Saul the king of the Hebrews had cast out of the country the fortune tellers the necromancers and all such as exercised the like arts excepting the prophets But when he heard the Philistines were already come and had pitched their camp very near to the city Shunem situate in the plain he hastened to oppose them with his forces And when he was come to a certain mountain called Gilboa he pitched his camp over against the enemy But when he saw the enemy s army he was greatly troubled because it appeared to him to be numerous and superior to his own and he inquired of God by the pro phets concerning the battle that he might know beforehand what would be the event And when God did not answer him Saul was under a still greater dread and his courage fell foreseeing as was but reasonable to sup pose that mischief would befall him now God was not there to assist him Yet did he bid his servants to inquire for some woman that was a necromancer and called up the souls of the dead that so he might know whether his affairs would succeed to his mind For this sort of necromantic women who bring up the souls of the dead do by them foretel future events to such as desire them And one of his servants told him that there was such a woman in the city Endor but she was known to nobody in the camp Here upon Saul put off his royal apparel and took two of those servants whom he knew to be most faithful to him and came to Endor to the woman and intreated her to act the part of a fortune teller and to bring up such a soul to him as he should name But the woman op posed his motion and said she did not de spise the king who had banished this sort of fortune tellers and that he did not do well himself when she had done him no harm to endeavour to lay a snare for her and to dis cover she exercised a forbidden art in order to procure her to be punished Saul how ever sware that nobody should know what she did and that he would not tell any one else what she foretold but that she should incur no danger As soon therefore as he had induced her by this oath to fear no harm he bade her bring up to him the soul of Samuel She not knowing who Samuel was called him out of Hades When he appeared and the woman saw one that was venerable and of a divine form she was in disorder and being astonished at the sight she said Art not thou king Saul for Samuel had informed her who he was When he had owned that to be true and had asked her whence her disorder arose she said that she saw a certain person ascend who in his form was like to a god And when he bade her tell him what he resembled in what habit he appeared and of what age he was she told him he was an old man and of a glorious personage and had on a sacerdotal mantle So the king discovered by these signs that he was Samuel and he fell down upon the ground and saluted and worshipped him And when the soul of Samuel asked him why he had disturbed him and caused him to be brought up he lamented the necessity he was under for he said his enemies pressed heavily upon him that he was in distress what to do in his present circum stances that he was forsaken of God and could obtain no prediction of what was coming neither by prophets nor by dreams And these were the reasons why he had re course to him Butf Samuel seeing the end of Saul s life was come said It is in vain for thee to desire to learn of me any thing farther when God hath forsaken thee How ever hear what I say â David is to be king and to finish this war with good success and thou art to lose thy dominion and thy life because thou didst not obey God in the war with the Amalekites and hast not kept his  1 Sara zxviii 14 t This history of Saul s consultation not with a witch as we render the Hebrew word here but with a necro mancer as the whole history shews is easily understood especially if we consult the recognitions of Clement 1 5 11 13 at large and more briefly and nearer the days of Samuel Ecclus xlvi 20 Samuel prophesied after his death and shewed the king his end and lift up his voL I â NOS 19 Jj 20 voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the wicked ness of the people Nor does the exactness of the ac complishment of this prediction the very next day permit us to suppose any imposition upon Saul in the present history For as to all modern hypotheses against the natural sense of such ancient and authentic histories 1 consider them of very small value or importance Xx 220 book VI ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS commandments as I foretold to thee while I was alive Know therefore that the people shall be made subject to their enemies and that thou with thy sons shall fall in the battle to morrow and thou s halt then be with me in Hades When Saul had heard this he could not speak for grief but fell down on the floor Whether it were from the sorrow that arose upon what Samuel had said or from his emptiness for he had taken no food the fore Soing day aitd night he easily fell quite own And when with difficulty he had re covered himself the woman would force him to eat begging this of him as a favour on account of her concern in that dangerous in stance of fortune telling which it was not lawful for her to have done because of the fear she was under of the king while she knew not who he was yet did she undertake it and go through with it On which account she intreated him to admit that a table and food might be set before him that he might recover his strength and so get safe to his own camp And when he opposed her mo tion and entirely rejected itT by reason of his anxiety she forced him and at last persuaded him to it Now she had one calf that she was very fond of and one that she took a great deal of care of and fed it herself for she was a woman that got her living by the labour of her own hands and had no other possession but that one calf This she killed and made ready its flesh and set it before hi servants and himself So Saul returned to the camp while it was yet night Now it is but just tof commend the gene rosity of this woman because when the king had forbidden her to use that art whence her circumstances were improved and when she had never seen the king before she still did not remember to his disadvantage that he had condemned her sort of learning and did not refuse him as a stranger and one that she had no acquaintance with but she had com passion upon him and comforted him and exhorted him to do what he was greatly averse to and offered him the only creature she had as a poof woman and that earnestly and with great humanity while she received no requital for her kindness nor hunted after any future favour from him for she knew he was to die Whereas men are naturally either ambitious to please those that bestow benefits upon them or are very ready to serve those from whom they may receive some advantage It would be well therefore to imitate the ex ample of this woman and to do kindness to all such as are in want and to think that nothing is better nor more becoming than such a general beneficence nor what will sooner render God favourable and ready to bestow good things upon us And so far may suffice to have spoken concerning this woman But I shall speak farther upon another sub ject which will afford me the opportunity of discoursing on what is for the advantage of cities people and nations and suited to the taste of good men and will encourage them all in the prosecution of virtue and is capable of shewing them the method of acquiring glory and an everlasting fame and of im printing on the kings of nations and the rulers of cities great inclinations and diligence bi doing well as also of encouraging them to undergo dangers and to die for their coun tries and of instructing them how to dispose all the most terrible adversities And I have a fair occasion offered me to enter on such a discourse by Saul the king of the Hebrews For although he knew what was coming upon him and that he was to die immediately by the prediction of the prophet he did not re solve to fly from death nor so far to indulge the love of life as to betray his own people to the enemy of to bring disgrace on the royal dignity But exposing himself as well as all his family to dangers he thought it a brave thing to fall together with them as he was fighting for his subjects and that it was betteF his sons should die thus shewing their courage than to leave them to their uncertain conduct afterwards while instead of succes sion and posterity they gained commendation and a lasting name Such an one alone seems to me to be a just a courageous and a pru dent man and when any one has arrived at these dispositions or shall hereafter arrive at  I Sam xjviii 19 t These great commendations of this necromantic wo man of Endor and of Saul s martial courage when yet he Vnew he should die in the battle are somewhat unusual digressions in Josephus They seem to me extracted from some speeches or declamations of his composed for merly in the way of oratory that lay by him and which he thought fit to insert upon this occasion an 1096 221 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them he is the man who ought to he by all honoured with the testimony of a virtuous or courageous man For as to those that go out to war with hopes of success and that they shall return safe supposing they should have performed some glorious action I think those do not well who call these valiant men as so many historians and other writers who treat of them are wont to do although I confess those do justly deserve some commendation also But those only may be styled coura geous and bold in great undertakings and despisers of adversities who imitate Saul For as for those that do not know what the event of war will be as to themselves and though they do not faint in it but deliver themselves up to uncertain futurity and are tossed this way and that way this is not so very eminent an instance of a generous mind although they happen to perform many great exploits But when men s minds expect no good event but they know beforehand they must die and that they must undergo that death in the battle also after this neither to be affrighted nor to be astonished at the ter rible fate that is coming but to go directly upon it when they know it beforehand this it is that I esteem the character of a man truly courageous Accordingly this Saul did and thereby demonstrated that all men who de sire fame after they are dead are so to act as they may obtain the same This especially concerns kings who ought not to think it enough in their high station that they are not wicked in the government of their subjects but to be more than moderately good to them 1 could say more than this about Saul and his courage the subject offering matter suf ficient but that I may not appear to run out improperly in his commendation I return again to that history from which I made this digression Now when the Philistines had pitched their camp and had taken account of their forces according to their nations kingdoms and governments king Achish came last of all with his own army After whom came David with his six hundred armed men And when the commanders of the Philistines saw him they asked the king whence those Hebrews came and at whose invitation He an swered that it was David who was fled away from his master Saul and he had en tertained him when he came to him and that now he was willing to make him this re quital for his favours and to avenge himself upon Saul and so was become his confede rate The commanders however complained that he had taken him for a confederate who was an enemy and gave him counsel to keep him away lest he should unawares do his friends a great deal of mischief by enter taining him For that he afforded him an opportunity of being reconciled to his master by doing mischief to the army They there upon desired him out of a prudent foresight of this to send him away with his four hun dred armed men to the place he had given him for his habitation For this was that David whom the virgins celebrated in their hymns as having destroyed many ten thou sands of the Philistines When the king of Gath heard this he thought they spake well so he called David and said to him  As for myself I can bear witness that thou hast shewn great diligence and kindness about me and on that account it was that I took thee for my confederate However what I have done does not please the commanders of the Philistines Go therefore within a day s time to the place I have given thee without suspecting any harm and there keep my country lest any of our enemies should make an incursion upon it which will be one part of that assistance I expect from thee So David returned to Ziklag as the king of Gath bid him But it happened that while he was gone to the assistance of the Philistines the nations of the Amalekites had made an in cursion and taken Ziklag before and had burnt it and when they had taken a great deal of other prey out of that place and out of the other parts of the Philistines country they departed Now when David found that Ziklag was laid waste and that it was all spoiled and that his own wives and the wives of his com panions with their children were made cap tives he presently rent his clothes weeping and lamenting together with his friends And indeed he was so cast down with these mis fortunes that at length tears themselves failed him He was also in danger of being stoned to death by his companions who were greatly afflicted at the captivity of their wives and children for they laid the blame upon him Xx2 222 book VI ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS of what had happened But when he had recovered from his grief and had raised up his mind to God he desired the high priest Abiathar to put on his sacerdotal garments and to inquire of God and to prophesy to him whether God would grant that if he pursued after the Amalekites he should over take them and save their wives and their children and avenge himself on the enemies and when the high priest bade him pursue after them he marched apace with four hun dred men after the enemy And when he was come to a certain brook called Besor and had met with an Egyptian who was almost dead with want and famine for he had continued wandering about without food in the wilderness three days he first of all gave him refreshments and then asked to whom he belonged and whence he came The man told him he was an Egyptian by birth and was left behind by his master be cause he was so sick and weak that he could not follow him He also informed him that he was one of those that had burnt and plun dered not only other parts of Judea but Ziklag also So David made use of him as a guide to find out the Amalekites and when he had overtaken them as they lay scattered about on the ground some at dinner some disordered and inebriated with wine and in their fruition of the spoils and their prey he fell upon them on the sudden and made a great slaughter For they were naked and expected no such thing but had betaken themselves to drinking and feasting and so they were all easily destroyed Now some of them that were overtaken as they lay at the table were slain in that posture Others of them were slain as they were drinking to one another in their cups and some of them when their satiety had made them fall asleep And for so many as had time to put on all their armour they slew them with the sword with no less ease than they did those that were naked And for the partizans of David they continued also the slaughter from the first hour of the day to the evening so that there was not above four hundred of the Amalekites left and they only escaped by getting upon their dromedaries and camels Accordingly David recovered not only all the  1 Sam xxx 1 other spoils which the enemy had carried away but his wives also and the wives of his companions But when they were come to the place where they had left the two hun dred men who were not able to follow them but were left to take care of the stuff the four hundred men did not think fit to divide among them any other parts of what they had gotten or of the prey since they did not accompany them but pretended to be feeble and did not follow them in the pursuit of the enemy but said they should be contented to have safely recovered their wives Yet did David pronounce that this opinion of theirs was evil and unjust and that when God had granted them such a favour that they had avenged themselves on their enemies and had recovered all that belonged to them selves they should make an equal distribu tion of what they had gotten to all because the rest had tarried behind to guard their stuff And from that time this law obtained among them â that those who guarded the stuff should receive an equal share with those that fought in the battle f Now when David was come to Ziklag he sent portions of the spoils to all that had been familiar with him and to his friends in the tribe of Judah And thus ended the affairs of the plundering of Ziklag and of the slaughter of the Amalekites Now upon the Philistines joining battle there followed a sharp engagement and the Philistines became the conquerors and slew a great number of their enemies But Saul the king of Israel and his sons fought coura geously and with the utmost alacrity as knowing that their entire glory lay in nothing else but dying honourably and exposing themselves to the utmost danger from the enemy for they had nothing else to hope for So they brought upon themselves the whole power of the enemy till they were encom passed round and slain but not before they had killed many of the Philistines Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan Abinadab and Malchishua And when these were slain the multitude of the Hebrews were put to flight and all was disorder confusion and slaughter upon the Philistines pressing in upon them But Saul himself fled having a strong body of soldiers about him and upon the Philis t 1 Sam xxx 25 a 1096 223 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tines sending after them those that threw javelins and shot arrows he lost all his com pany except a few As for himself he fought with great bravery and when he had re ceived so many wounds that he was unable to bear up or to oppose any longer and yet was not able to kill himself he bade his armour bearer draw his sword and run him through before the enemy should take him alive But his armour bearer not daring to kill his master he drew his own sword and placing himself over against its point he threw himself upon it and when he could neither run it through him nor by leaning against it make the sword pass through him he turned round and asked a certain young man that stood by who he was and when he understood that he was an Amalekite he desired him to force the sword through him because he was not able to do it with his own hands and thereby to procure him such a death as he desired 1 his the young man did accordingly and he took the golden bracelet that was on Saul s arm and his royal crown that was on his head and ran away And when Saul s armour bearer saw that he was slain he killed himself Nor did any of the king s guards escape but they all fell upon the mountain Gilboa But when those Hebrews that dwelt in the valley beyond Jordan and those who had their cities in the plain heard that Saul and his sons were fallen and that the multitude about them were destroyed they left their own cities and fled to such as were best fortified And the Philistines finding those cities deserted came and dwelt in them On the next day when the Philistines came to strip their enemies that were slain they got the bodies of Saul and of his sons and stripped them and cut off their heads And they sent messengers all about their country to acquaint them that their enemies were fallen And they dedicated their armour in the temple of Astarte but hung their bodies on crosses at the walls of the city of Beth shan which is now called Scythopolis But when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard that they had dismembered the dead bodies of Saul and of his sons they deemed it so horrid a thing to overlook this barbarity and to suffer them to be without funeral rights that the most courageous and hardy among them and indeed that city had in it men that were very stout both in body and mind journeyed all night and came to Bethshan and approached the enemies wall and taking down the bodies of Saul and of his sons they carried them to Jabesh while the enemy were neither powerful nor bold enough to hinder them because of their great courage So the people of Jabesh wept all in general and buried their bodies in the best place in their country which was named Aroura and they observed a public mourning for them seven days with their wives and children beating their breasts and lamenting the king and his sons without either tasting drink or meat till the evening To this end did Saul come according to the prophecy of Samuel because he disobeyed the commandments of God f about the Amale kites and on the account of his destroying the family of Ahimelech the high priest with Ahimelech himself and the city of the high priests Now Saul when he had reigned eigh teen years J while Samuel was alive and after his death two ended his life in this manner  This way of speaking in Josephus of fasting seven 1 lys without meat or drink is almost like that of St Paul s Acts xzvii 33 This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing and as the nature of the thing and the impos sibility of strictly fasting so long require us here to un derstand both Josephus and the sacred author of this history 1 Sam xxxi 13 from whom he took it of only fasting till the evening so must we understand St Paul either that this was really the fourteenth day that they had taken nothing till the evening or else that this was the fourteenth day of their tempestuous weather in the Adriatic sea as verse 27 and that on this fourteenth daj alone they had continued fasting and had takon nothing before the evening The mention of their long absti nence verse 21 inclines me to believe the former ex plication to be the truth and that the case was then for a fortnight what it was here for a week that they kept all those days entirely as fasts till the evening but not longer See Judg xx 26 xxi 2 1 Sam xiv 24 2 Sam i 12 Antiq VII 7 t 1 Chron x 13   From an 1114 to 1096 B C  224 BOOK VII ANTIQUITIES OF

BETWEEN THE ADHERENTS OF DAVID AND ISHBOSHETH IN WHICH ASAHEL AND ABNER WERE SLAIN THIS battle happened on the same day whereupon David was come back to Ziklag after he had overcome the Amalekites Now when he had been already two days at Ziklag there came to him the man who slew Saul he had escaped out of the battle which the Israelites had with the Philistines and had his clothes rent and ashes upon his head And when he made his obeisance to David he inquired of him whence he came He replied from the battle of the Israelites and informed him that the result of it was unfortunate many ten thousands of the Is raelites having been cut off and Saul toge ther with his sons slain He also said that he could well give him this information be cause he was present at the victory gained over the Hebrews and was with the king when he fled Nor did he deny that he had himself slain the king when he was ready to be taken by the enemy and himself exhorted him to that act because when he was fallen on his sword his wounds had made him so weak that he was not able to kill himself He also produced demonstrations that the king was slain which were the golden brace lets that had been on the king s arms and his  2 Sam i 13 lb t Though David after Saul s demise had a right to the kingdom by virtue of God s designation yet as God had no where declared at what time he was make use of this right he would not enter into possession nor take the crown which he had taken away from Saul s dead body and had brought them to him So David having no longer any room to ques tion the truth of what he said but seeing most evident marks that Saul was dead he rent his garment and continued all that day with his companions in weeping and lamen tation This grief was augmented by the con sideration of Jonathan the son of Saul who had been his most faithful friend and the occasion of his deliverance He also evinced such great virtue and such great kindness for Saul as not only to take his death to heart though he had been frequently in danger of losing his life by his means but to punish him that slew him For when David had said to him that he was become his own accuser as the very man who had slain the king and when he had understood that he was the son of an Amalekite he commanded him to be slain He also committed to wri ting some lamentations and funeral com mendations of Saul and Jonathan which have continued to my own age When David had paid these honours to the king he left off his mourning and inquired of God by the prophet t which of the cities of the tribe of Judah he would bestow upon him to dwell in God answered that he be stowed upon him Hebron J so he left Ziklag and came to Hebron and took with him his two wives and his armed men Whereupon all the people of

inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead had buried Saul and his sons honourably he sent to them and commended them and took what they had done kindly and promised to make them amends for their care of those that were dead and at the same time he informed them that the tribe of Judah had chosen him for their king But as soon as Abner the son of Ner who was general of Saul s army and a very active and good natured man knew that the king and Jonathan and his two other sons were fallen in battle he hastened into the camp and taking away with him the remaining son of Saul whose name was Ishbosheth he passed over to the land beyond Jordan and ordained him king over the whole multitude excepting the tribe of Judah f and made hiÂ royal seat in a place called in our own lan guage Mahanaim J but in the language of the Grecians The Camps From whence Abner made haste with a select body of soldiers to fight with such of the tribe of Judah as were disposed to it for he was angry that this tribe had set up David for their king But Joab whose father was Suri and his mother Ze ruiah David s sister who was general of David s army met him according to David s appointment He had with him aia brethren Abishai and Asahel and also all David s armed men Now when he met Abner at a certain fountain rn the city Gibeon he pre pared to fight And when Abner said to him that he had a mind to know whether of them had the more valiant soldiers it was mutually agreed that twelve soldiers on each side should fight together So those that were chosen out by both generals for the fight came between the two armies and throwing their lances one against the other they dreHf their swords and catching one another by the head they held one another fast and ran each other s swords into their groins until they all as it were by mutual agreement perished together When these were fallen the rest of the army came to an obstinate en gagement and Abner s men were beaten and when they were beaten Joab did not leave off pursuing them but he pressed upon them and excited the soldiers to follow them closely and not to grow weary of killing them His brethren also pursued them with great alacrity and especially the younger Asahel who was the most eminent of them He was very famous for his swiftness of foot for he couhi not e ily be too hard for men but is re ported to Krave over ron a horse when they had a raee together This Asahel ran vio lently after Abner and would not turn in the least out of the straight way either to one side or to the other Hereupon Abner turned back and attempted artfully to avoid his violence Sometimes he bade him leave off the pursuit and take the armour of one of his soldiers and sometimes when he could not persuade him so to do he exhorted him to restrain himself and not to pursue him any longer lest he should force him to kill him and he should then not be able to look his brother in the face But when Asahel would not admit of any persuasion but still con tinued to pursue him Abner smote him with his spear as he held it in his flight and by a back stroke gave him a deadly wound so that he died immediately But those that were who espoused David s interests it whs a very commodious city for him to make the place of his residence at this juncture as being not insensible that the determination of the metropolis in his favour would be of great Weight to influence the whole tribe And accordingly we find that he was soon invested with the sovereignty thereof For the men of Judah suith the text came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah 2 Sam ii 4 The History of the lift of King David vol 2 B  2 Sam ii 4 t 2 Sam u 9  This was a place in the tribe of Gad which had its name from the appearance of an host of angels to Jacob as he came with his family and all his substance to Padan aram Gen xxxii 1 and the reasons for Abner s retreat ing hither in the beginning of the new king s reign were that he might secure the people on that side of Jordan and especially the gallant inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead who were great lovers of Saul and attached to his family that he might prevent he Philistines from falling upon the king whom fie had under his protection in the infancy of his reign and chiefly that he might be at a great distance from David have the new king more absolutely under his command and a better opportunity of raising recruits among the people not only brave and courageous hot very well affected to the cause which He had espoused Cal met s Commentary and Pool s Annotations P  The expression in the Bible

the dead body and left off the pursuit of the enemy However both Joab himself and his brother Abishai ran past the corpse and making their anger at the death of Asahel an occasion of greater zeal against Abner they went on with incredible haste and alacrity and pursued Abner to a certain place called Ammah it was about sunset Then did Joab ascend a certain hill as he stood at that place having the tribe of Ben jamin with him whence he took a view of them and of Abner also Hereupon Abner cried aloud and said that it was not fit that they should irritate men of the same nation to fight so bitterly one against another that as for Asahel his brother he was himself in the wrong when he would not be advised by him not to pursue him any farther which was the occasion of his death So Joab con sented to what he said and accepted his words as an excuse about Asahel and called his soldiers back with the sound of the trumpet as a signal for their retreat and thereby put a stop to any farther pur suit After which Joab pitched his camp there that night But Abner marched all night and passed over the river Jordan and came to Ishbosheth Saul s son to Mahanaim On the next day Joab counted the dead men and took care of all their funerals Now there were slain of Abner s soldiers about three hundred and sixty but of those of David nineteen besides Asahel whose body Joab and Abishai carried to Bethle hem And when they had buried him in the sepulchre of their fathers f they came to David to Hebron From this time therefore there began an intestine war which lasted a great while in which the followers of David grew stronger in the dangers they underwent and the servants and subjects of Saul s sons did almost every day become weaker About this time t David was become the father of six sons born of as many mothers The eldest was by Abinoam and he was called Amnon the second was Daniel by his wife Abigail the name of the third was Ab salom by Maachah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur the fourth he named Ado nijah by his wife Haggith the fifth was She phatiah by Abitail and the sixth he called Ithream by Eglah Now while this intestine war went on and while the subjects of the two kings came frequently to action it was Abner general of the host of Saul s son who by his prudence and the great interest he had among the multitude made them all con tinue with Ishbosheth And indeed it was a considerable time that they continued of his party But afterwards Abner was blamed and an accusation was laid against him that he had taken indecent liberties with Rispah the daughter of Aiah and Saul 3 concubine Â so when he was complained of by Ishbosheth he was very uneasy and angry at it because he had not justice done him by Ishbosheth to whom he had shewn the greatest kind ness He therefore threatened that he would transfer the kingdom to David and demon strated that he did not rule over the people beyond Jordan by his own abilities and wisdom but by his warlike conduct and fidelity in leading his army So he sent ambassadors to Hebron and desired that David would give him security upon oath that he would esteem him his companion and friend upon condition that he should persuade the people to leave Saul s son and to choose him king of the whole country And when David had made that league with Abner for he was pleased with this message to him he desired that he would  It ought here to be noted that Joab Abishai and Asahel were all David s nephews the sons of his sister Zeruiah as 1 Chron ii 16 and that Amasa was also his nephew by his other sister Abigail v 17 t 2 Sam ii 32 t An 1090 II An 1089 Â What notion the world at this time had of marrying any royal relirt is evident from the case of Adonijah whom Solomon put to death for desiring but to ask for Abisbag one of David s concubines though he had era ployed Bath sheba the king s mother to he his inter cessor and was himself his brother 1 Kings ii 17 It may be said perhaps that Adonijah was at this time as piring at the throne which Solomon perceiving took occasion from this his request to fall out with him and prevent it But however this be a general rule it was not among the Jews only but among other nations that no private person should presume to marry the king s widow for this made him appear as a rival and competitor for the crown Calmet i Comment B an 1089 227 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS give this as the first mark of performance of the present league that he might have his wife Michal restored to him as her whom he had purchased with great hazards and with those six hundred heads of the Philistines which he had brought to Saul her father So Abner took Michal from Phalli el who was then her husband and sent her to David Ishbosheth himself affording him his assist ance for David had written to him that of right he ought to have his wife restored to him Abner also called together the elders of the multitude the commanders and cap tains of thousands and spake thus to them that He had formerly dissuaded them from their own resolution when they were ready to forsake Ishbosheth and to join themselves to David that however he now gave them leave so to do if they had a mind to it for they knew that God had appointed David to be king of all the Hebrews by Samuel the prophet and had foretold that he should punish the Philistines and finally overcome them Now when the elders and rulers heard this and understood that Abner was come over to those sentiments about the public affairs which they were of before they changed their measures and came in to David When these men had agreed to Ab ner s proposal he called together the tribe of Benjamin for all of that tribe were the guards of Ishbosheth s body and spake to them to the same purpose And when he saw that they did not in the least oppose what he said but resigned themselves up to his opinion he took about twenty of his friends and came to David in order to re ceive himself security upon oath from him For we may justly esteem those things to be firmer which every one of us do by ourselves than those which we do by another He also gave him an account of what he had said to the rulers and to the whole tribe of Ben jamin And when David had received him in a courteous manner and had treated him with great hospitality for many days Abner when he was dismissed desired permission to bring the multitude with him that he might deliver up the government to him when David himself was present and a spectator of what was done When David had sent Abner away Joab he general of his army came immediately to Hebron and when he had understood that Abner had been with David and had parted with him a little before under an agreement that the government should be delivered up to David he feared lest David should place Abner who had assisted him to gain the king dom in the first rank of dignity especially since he was a shrewd man in other respects in understanding affairs and in managing them artfully as proper seasons should re quire and that he should himself be put lower and be deprived of the command of the army so he took a knavish and a wicked course In the first place he endeavoured to calumniate Abner to the king exhorting him to have a care of him and not to give atten tion to what he had engaged to do for him because all he did tended to confirm the government to Saul s son that he came to him deceitfully and with guile and was gone away in hopes of gaining his purposes by this management But when he could not thus persuade David nor saw him at all exas perated he betook himself to a project bolder than the former He determined to kill Abner and in order thereto he sent some messengers after him to whom he gave in charge that when they should overtake him they should recall him in David s name and tell him that he had somewhat to say to him about his affairs which he had not remembered to speak of when he was with him Now when Abner heard what the mes sengers said for they overtook him in a cer tain place called Bisera which was distant from Hebron twenty furlongs he suspected none of the mischief which was befalling him and came back Hereupon Joab met him in the gate and received him in the kindest manner as if he were Abner s most benevo lent acquaintance and friend for such as un dertake the vilest actions in order to prevent the suspicion of any private mischief do fre quently make the greatest pretence to what good men do sincerely So he took him aside from his own followers as if he would speak to him in private and brought him into a void place of the gate having himself nobody with him but his brother Abishai then he drew his sword and smote him in the groin upon which Abner died by this treachery of voL r NOS 19  20  2 Sam iii 27 Yy 228 book vir ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Joab s which as he said himself was in way of punishment for his brother Asahel whom Abner smote and slew as he was pursuing after him in the battle of Hebron but as the truth was out of fear of his losing his com mand of the army and his dignity with the king and lest he should be deprived of those advantages and Abner should obtain the first rank in David s court By these exam ples any one may learn how many and how great instances of wickedness men will ven ture upon for the sake of getting money and authority and that they may not fail of either of them For as when they are desirous of obtaining the same they acquire them by ten thousand evil practices so when they are afraid of losing them they get them con firmed by practices much worse than the former As if no other calamity so terrible could befall them as the failure of acquiring so exalted an authority or as the loss of it after its acquisition and long enjoyment And since this last would be the heaviest of all afflictions they all of them contrive and ven ture upon the most difficult actions out of fear of losing the same But let it suffice that I have made these short reflections upon that subject When David heard that Abner was slain it grieved his soul and he called all men to witness with stretching out his hand to God and crying out that he was not a partaker in the murder of Abner and that his death was not procured by his command or approbation He also wished the heaviest curses might fall upon him that slew him and upon his whole house and he devoted those that had assisted him in this murder to the same penalties on its account For he took care not to appear to have had any hand in this murder contrary to the assurances he had given and the oaths he had taken to Abner However he com manded all the people to weep and lament this man and to honour his dead body with the usual solemnities that is by rending their garments and putting on sackcloth and that this should be the habit in which they should go before the bier He also followed it him self with the elders and those that were rulers lamenting Abner and by his tears demonstrating his good will to him while he was alive and his sorrow for him now he was dead and that he was not taken off with his consent So he buried him at Hebron in a magnificent manner and indited funeral ele gies for him he also stood first over the monument weeping and caused others to do the same Nay so deeply did the death of Abner disorder him that his companions could by no means persuade him to take any food but he affirmed with an oath that he would taste nothing till the sun was set This procedure gained him the good will of the multitude for such as had an affection for Abner were highly gratified with the respect he paid him when he was dead and the observance of that faith he had plighted to him which was shewn in his vouchsafing him all the usual ceremonies as if he had been his kinsman and friend and not suffering him to be neglected and injured with a dishonour able burial as if he had been his enemy Insomuch that the entire nation rejoiced at the king s gentleness and mildness of dispo sition every one being ready to suppose that the king would have taken the same care of them in the like circumstances which they saw he shewed in the burial of Abner And indeed David principally intended to gain a good reputation and therefore he took care to do what was proper in this case whence none had any suspicion that he was the author of Abner s death He also said to the multi tude that he was greatly troubled at the death of so good a man and that the affairs of the Hebrews had suffered great detriment by being deprived of him who was of so great abilities to preserve them by his excellent advice and by the strength of his hands in war But added he  that God who hath  a regard to all men s actions will not suffer this man Joab to go off unrevenged But know ye that I am not able to do any thing to these sons of Zeruiah Joab and Abishai who have more power than I have But God will requite their insolent attempts upon their own heads And this was the fatal con clusion of the life of Abner CHAP II OF THE MURDER OF ISHBOSKETH BY THE TREACHERY OF HIS FRIENDS AND OF DAVID S ACCESSION TO THE WHOLE KIN iDOM w HEN Ishbosheth the son of Saul had heard of the death of Abner he took  2 Sam iii 39 A T 229 1089 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS it to heart to be deprived of a man that was of his kindred and had indeed given him the kingdom and Abner s death very much trou bled him Nor did he himself survive any long time but was treacherously set upon by the sons of Rimmon Baanah and Rechab and was slain by them For these being of a family of the Benjamites and of the first rank among them thought that if they should slay Ishbosheth they should obtain large presents from David and be made com manders by him or at least should have some other trust committed to them So when they once found him asleep at noon in an upper apartment when none of his guards were there and when the woman that kept the door was not watching but was fallen asleep also partly on account of the labour she had undergone and partly on account of the heat of the day these men went into the room in which Ishbosheth Saul s son lay asleep and slew him they also cut off his head and took their journey all that night and the next day as supposing themselves fleeing from those that they had injured to one that would accept of this action as a favour and would afford thein security So they came to He bron and shewed David the head of Ishbo sheth and presented themselves to him as his well wishers and such as had killed one that was his enemy and antagonist Yet David did not approve of what they had done as they expected but said to them â Vile wretches you shall immediately re ceive the punishment you deserve Did not you know what vengeance I executed on him that murdered Saul t and brought me his crown of gold and this while he who perpe trated that action did it as a favour to him that he might not be caught by his enemies or do you imagine that I am altered in my disposition and suppose that I am not the same man I then was but am pleased with men that are wicked doers and esteem your vile actions when you are become murderers of your master as grateful to me when you have slain a righteous man upon his bed who never did evil to any body and treated you with great good will and respect wherefore you shall suffer the punishment due on his account and the vengeance I ought to inflict upon you for killing Ishbosheth and for sup posing that I should take his death kindly at your hands for you could not lay a greater blot on my honour than the making such a supposal When David had said this he tormented them with all sorts of torments and then put them to death and he bestowed all accustomed rites on the burial of the head of Ishbosheth and laid it in the grave of Abner J When these things were brought to this conclusion all the principal men of the He brews came to David to Hebron with the heads of thousands and other rulers and de livered themselves up to him putting him in mind of the good will they had borne to him in Saul s life time and the respect they then had not ceased to pay him when he was cap tain of a thousand as also that he was chosen of God by Samuel the prophet he and his sons declaring besides how God had fiven him power to save the land of the lebrews and to overcome the Philistines Whereupon he received kindly their alacrity on his account and exhorted them to con tinue in it for that they should have no reason to repent of being thus disposed to him So when he had feasted them and treated them kindly he sent them out to bring all the people to him Upon which there came to him about six thousand and eight hundred armed men of the tribe of Judah who bare shields and spears of their weapons for these  2 Sam iv 7 t It may seem a little strange that these two ruffians were not discouraged by David s punishing the Amalekite for killing of Saul and by the detestation he had publicly shewn of Joab s baseness in murdering Abner but the former of these cases they might think was not parallel to theirs because Saul was anointed king by God s imme diate direction whereas Ishbosheth having never had such sacred unction was no more than an usurper and as for the latter they might think that David s conduct in relation to Abner s death proceeded from art and policy rather than any serious dislike to the tiling itself and in this opinion they might the rather be confirmed when they saw Joab instead of being punished continuing in the very same post and power that he had before PooVs Annotations B t 2 Sam iv 12 I This may be a true observation of Josephus s that Samuel by command from God entailed the crown on David and his posterity for no farther did that entail ever reach

rest of the tribe of Judah had ordained David for their king There came also seven thousand and one hundred out of the tribe of Simeon out of the tribe of Levi came four thousand and seven hundred having Jehoiada for their leader After these came Zadok the high priest with twenty two captains of his kindred Out of the tribe of Benjamin the armed men were four thousand but the rest of the tribe continued still expecting that some one of the house of Saul should reign over them Those of the tribe o Ephraim were twenty thousand and eight hundred and these mighty men of valour and eminent for their strength Out of the half tribe of Ma nasseh came eighteen thousand of the most potent men Out of the tribe of Issachar came two hundred who foreknew what was to come hereafter but of armed men twenty thousand Of the tribe of Zebulun fifty thou sand chosen men This was the only tribe which came universally in to David and all these had the same weapons with the tribe of Gad Out of the tribe of Naphtali the emi nent men and rulers were one thousand whose weapons were shields and spears and the tribe itself followed after being in a manner t innumerable Out of the tribe of Dan there were of chosen men twenty seven thousand and six hundred Out of the tribe of Asher were forty thousand Out of the two tribes that were beyond Jordan and the rest of the tribe of Manasseh such as used shields and speais and head pieces and swords were a hundred and twenty thousand The rest of the tribe also made use of swords This multitude  ame together to Hebron to David with a great quantity of corn wine and all other sorts of food and established David in his kingdom with one consent And when the people had feasted and rejoiced three days in Hebron David and all the peo ple removed and came to Jerusalem CHAP III OF THE SIEGE AND REDUCTION OF JERUSALEM BY KIN DAVID WHO EXPELLED THE CANAANITF S AND BROUGHT IN THE JEWS NOW the Jebusites who were the inha bitants of Jerusalem and were by ex traction Canaanites shut their gates and placed their blind lame and maimed persons upon the wall in way of derision of the king J and said that the very lame them selves would hinder his entrance into it This they did out of contempt of his power and as depending on the strength of their walls David was hereby enraged and began the siege of Jerusalem and employed his utmost diligence and alacrity therein as intending by the taking of this place to demonstrate his power and to intimidate all others that might be of the like evil disposition towards him So he took the lower city by force but lhe j  These words of Josephus concerning the tribe of Is sachar who foreknew what was to come hereafter are best paraphrased by the parallel text 1 Chron xii 32 Who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do i e Who had so much knowledge of astro nomy as to make calendars for the Israelites that they might keep their festivals and plough and sow and gather in their harvests and vintage in due season t Thirty seven thousand 1 Chron xii 34 J The blind and the lame says Luther upon this place were the idols of the Jebusites which to irritate David they set upon their walls as their patrons and protectors and these they call blind and lame sarcastically and with respect to David s opinion as if they had said  These gods of ours whom ye Israelites reproach as blind and lame and so unable to direct or defend us will secure us against you and to your cost make you find that they are neither blind nor lame but have eyes to watch for us and hands to fight against you so that you must conquer and subdue them before you take this place But this interpretation seems to be a little too metaphorical and lorced for which reason we have rather chosen the con struction which Josephus lib vii cap 2 puts upon this passage viz that they imagined their fortress to be 00 impregnable that by way of contempt they told David that their very blind and lame would be able to defend it against him and all his forces and this is a sense so extremely plain and obvious that the renowned liochart wonders why any man of learning should seek for any other The only exception to it is that these blind and lame which were rather objects of compassion are said to have been extremely hated by David But we may observe that David here retorts the sarcasm upon them The lame and blind i e those who are said to defend the place and who as they pretended were to be only the lame and the blind And these were hateful to David because they had wickedly and insolently defied the ar mies of the living God Pool s Annotations Patrick s and Le Here s Comment B II What our other copies say of Mount Sion as alone properly called the city of David 2 Sam v 6â 9 and of this its siege and conquest now by David Josephus ap plies to the whole city Jerusalem though including the citadel also By what authority we do not now know perhaps after David had united them together or joined the citadel to the lower city Josephus esteemed them as one city However this notion seems to be confirmed by what the tame Josephus says concerning David s and roanx as 1088 231 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS citadel held out still Whence it was that the king knowing that the proposals of dig nities and rewards would encourage the sol diers to greater actions promised that he who should first go over the ditches that were be neath the citadel and should ascend to the citadel itself and take it should have the command of the entire people conferred upon him So they all were ambitious to ascend and thought no pains too great in order to ascend thither out of their desire of the chief command However Joab the son of Ze ruiah prevented the rest and as soon as he was got up to the citadel cried out to the king and claimed the chief command When David had cast the Jebusites out of the citadel he rebuilt Jerusalem and named it the city of David and abode there all the time of his reign But for the time that he reigned over the tribe of Judah only in He bron it was seven years and six months Now when he had chosen Jerusalem to be his royal city his affairs did more and more pros per by the providence of God who took care that they should improve and be augmented t Hiram also the king of the Tyrians sent ambassadors and made a league of mutual friendship and assistance with him He also sent him presents cedar trees and mechanics and men skilful in building and architecture that they might build him a royal palace at Jerusalem Now David made buildings round about the lower city he also joined the cita del to it and made it one body and when he had encompassed all with walls he appointed Joab to take care of them It was David therefore who first cast the Jebusites out of Jerusalem and called it by his own name the city of David For under our forefather Abraham it was called Salem or  Solyma But after that time some say that Homer mentions it by that name of Solyma For he named the temple Solyma according to the Hebrew language which denotes secu rity Now the whole time from the warfare under Joshua our general against the Ca naanites and from that war in which he over came them and distributed the land among the Hebrews nor could the Israelites ever cast the Canaanites out of Jerusalem until this time when David took it by siege this whole time was five hundred and fifteen years I shall now make mention of Araunah who was a wealthy man among the Jebusites but was not slain by David in the siege of Jeru salem because of the good will he bore to the Hebrews and a particular benignity and affection which he had to the king himself which I shall take a more seasonable oppor tunity to speak of a little afterwards Now David married other wives over and above those which he had before he had also con cubines The sons which he had were in number eleven whose names wereÂ Amnon Emnos Eban Nathan Solomon Jeban Elien Phalna Ennaphen Jenae Eliphale and a daughter Tamar Nine of these were born other kings of Judah s sepulchres which as the authors of the Books of Kings and Chronicles say were in the city of David so does Josephus still say they were in Jerusalem Tbe sepulchre of David seems to have been a known place in the several days of Hyrcanus of Herod and of St Peter Antiq XIII 8 XIV 7 Acts ii 29 Now no such royal sepulchres have been found about Mount Sion but are found close by the north wall of Jerusalem Which I suspect to be therefore these very sepulchres See the note on chap 15 In the mean time Josephus s explication of the lame and the blind and the maimed as set to keep this city or citadel seems to be the truth and gives the best light to that history in our Bible Mr Ottiua truly observes ap Havercamp p 305 that Jose phus never mentions Mount Sion by that name as taking it for an appellative as I suppose and not for a proper name He still either styles it the citadel or the upper city Nor do I see any reason for Mr Ottius s evil sus picions about this procedure of Josephus s  From An 1095 to 1088 B C t 2 Sam v 10 J Some copies of Josephus have here Solyma or Sa lem and others Hierosolyma or Jerusalem The latter best agrees to what Josephus says elsewhere of tbe War VI 10 that this city was called Solyma or Salem before the days of Melchisedec but was by him called Hieroso lyma or Jerusalem I rather suppose it to have been so called after Abraham had received that oracle Jehovah Jireh the Lord will see or provide Gen xxii 14 The latter word Jireh with a little alteration prefixed to the old name Salem Peace will be Jerusalem And since the expression God will see or rather God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering verse 8 is there said to have been proverbial till the days of Moses this seems to me the most probable derivation of that name which will then denote that God would provide peace by that Lamb of God which was to take away the sins of the world However that which is put into double brackets can hardly be supposed the genuine words of Josephus as Dr Hudson well judges I Chap xiii Â This number eleven and most of these names differ greatly from those in 1 Chron iii 1â 9 232 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS of legitimate wives but the two last of con cubines And Tamar had the same mother with Absalom CHAP IV Â t david s further success against the Philistines HIS REMOVAL OF THE ARK TO JERUSALEM AND HIS DE SIRE TO BUILD A TEMPLE WHEN the Philistines understood that David was made king of the Hebrews they made war against him at Jerusalem And when they had seized upon that valley which is called The valley of the Giants and fa a place not far from the city they pitched their camp there But the king of the Jews who never permitted himself to do any thing without prophecy and the command of God and without depending on him as a security for the time to come bade the high priest foretell to him what was the will of God and what would be the event of this battle And when he foretold that he should gain the vic tory and the dominion he led out his army against the Philistines and when the battle was joined he came himself behind and fell upon the enemy suddenly and slew some of them and put the rest to flight And let no one suppose that it was a small army of the Philistines that came against the Hebrews as guessing so from the suddenness of their defeat and from their having performed no action that was worth recording from the slowness of their march and want of courage but let him know that all Syria and Phoenicia with many other nations besides them and those warlike nations also came to their as sistance and had a share in this war Which thing was the only cause why when they had been so often conquered and had lost so many ten thousands of their men they still came upon the Hebrews with greater armies Nay indeed when they had so often failed of their purpose in these battles they came upon Da vid with an army three times as numerous as before and pitched their camp on the same spot of ground as before The king of Israel therefore inquired of God again concerning the event of the battle and the high priest prophesied to him that he should keep his army in the groves called the Groves of Weeping which were not far from the ene mies camp and that he should not move nor begin to fight till the trees of the grove should be in motion without the winds blow ing but as soon as these trees moved and the time foretold to him by God was come he should without delay go out to gain what was already prepared an evident victory For the several ranks of the enemies army did not sustain him but retreated at the first onset whom he closely followed and slew them as he went along and pursued them to the city Gaza which is the limit of their country After this he spoiled their camp in Which he found great riches and he also destroyed their gods When this had proved the event of the bat tle David thought proper upon a consultation with the elders and rulers and captains of thousands to send for those that were in the flower of their age out of all his countrymen and out of the whole land and withal for the priests and the Levites in order to their going to Kirjathjearim to bring up the ark of God out of that city and to carry it to Jerusalem and there to keep it and offer before it those sacrifices and those other honours with which God used to be well pleased For had they done thus in the reign of Saul they had not undergone any great misfortunes at all So when the whole body of the people were come together as they had resolved to do the king came to the ark which the priests brought out of the house of Aminadab and laid it upon a new cart and permitted their brethren and children to draw it together with the oxen Before it went the king and the whole multitude of the people with him sing ing hymns to God and making use of all sorts of songs usual among them accompanied with the sounds of musical instruments and with dancing and singing of psalms as also with the sounds of trumpets and of cymbals  It deserves here to be remarked that Saul very rare ly and David very frequently consulted God by Urim and that David aimed always to depend not on his own prudence or abilities but on the divine direction con trary to Saul s practice See the note on III 8 And when Saul s daughter Michal laughed at David s dancing before the ark 2 Sam vi 16 c it is probable she did so because her father S ml did not use to pay such regard to that ark to the Urim there inquired by or to God s worship before it and because she thought it beneath the dignity of a king to be so re ligious AiV 233 1083 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and so they brought the ark to Jerusalem But as they came to the threshing floor of Chidon a place so called Uzzahf was slain by the anger of God For as the oxen shook the ark he stretched out his hand and would needs take hold of it Now because he was not a priest and yet touched the ark God struck him dead Hereupon both the king and the people were displeased at the death of Uzzah and the place where he died is called the Breach of UzzahJ unto this day So David was afraid and supposing that if he received the ark to himself into the city he might suffer in the like manner as Uzzah had suffered who upon his barely putting out his hand to the ark died in the manner already mentioned he did not receive it to himself into the city but he took it aside unto a certain place belonging to a righteous man whose name was Obededom who was by his family a Levite and deposited the ark with him And it remained there three entire months This augmented the house of Obed edom and conferred many blessings upon it and when the king heard what had befallen Obededom how he was become of a poor man in a low estate exceeding happy and the object of envy to all those that saw or in quired after his houseThe took courage and hoping that he should meet with no misfortune thereby he transferred the ark to his own house j the priests carrying it while seven companies of singers who were set in that order by the king went before it and while he himself played upon the harp and joined in the music Â insomuch that when his wife Michal the daughter of Saul saw him so do ing she laughed at him But when they had brought in the ark they placed it under the tabernacle which David had pitched for it and he offered costly sacrifices and peace offerings and treated the whole multitude and dealt both to the women and the men and the infants a loaf of bread and a cake and another cake baked in a pan with a por tion of the sacrifice So when he had thus feasted the people he sent them away and returned to his own house But when Michal his wife the daughter of Saul came and stood by him she wished him all other happiness and intreated that what ever he should farther desire to the utmost possibility might be given by God and that he might be favourable to him Yet did she blame him that so great a king as he was should dance after an unseemly manner and  1 Chron xiii 9 t Josephus seems to be partly in the right when he observes here that Uzzah was no priest though perhaps he might be a Levite and was therefore struck dead for touching the ark contrary to the law and for which pro fane rashness death was the penalty by that law Numb iv 15 20 See the like before VI 1 It is not impro bable that the putting this ark in a cart when it ought to have been carried by the priests or Levites as it was presently here in Josephus so carried from Obededom s house to David s might be also an occasion of the anger of God on that breach of the law See Numb iv 15 1 Chron xv 13 t 2 Sam vi 8 1 Chron xv 13 ft It is supposed by some that this bringing back of the ark was appointed to be one of the great festivals and the reason why David might summon so many of his principal ministers and officers to accompany him in the expedition might be to possess the young people who perhaps had heard little or nothing of the ark by reason of its having been absent so long with a mighty veneration for it when they saw the king and so many of the chief nobility waiting on it with such a variety of music and such public declarations of joy Miller s His tory of the Church Â Strabo teHs us that it was customary among the Greeks as well as other nations to use music and dancing in the processions before their gods lib 10 Callima chus mentions the chori and dancings of the youth at the altar of Apollo Plato observes that among the Egyptians all kinds of music songs and dances were consecrated to their gods De Legibus 1 3 And even Lucian De Saltatione expressly says that among the ancients no ceremonial of religion no expiation no atonement was accounted rightly accomplished without dancing So that David was far from being singular in his behaviour upon this occasion nor was his behaviour in this particular any disparagement to his regal dignity His dancing i e his moving in certain serious and solemn measures suited to music of the same character and tendency was an ex ercise highly conducive to the purposes of piety and his mixing with the public festivities of his people was a con descension as Tacitus relates of Augustus the Roman emperor not unbecoming the greatest monarch Policy taught Augustus to put himself upon a level with his sub jects in the public rejoicings piety taught David that all men are upon a level in the solemnities of religion So that David was not singular in his behaviour upon this occasion Patrick s Commentary and The History of the Life of King David vol 2 B  The words of Michal wherein she upbraids David are these â How glorious was the king of Israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the hand maids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shame lessly uncovereth himself 2 Sam vi 20 At first read ing they seem to intimate that David in his dancing had exposed his naked body and acted some way or othei immodestly But these words we are to consider were spoken in a fit of passion and when Michal was minded to aggravate matters for it is not to be doubted but that 234 book tii ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in his dancing uncover himself among the servants and the handmaidens But he re plied that he was not ashamed to do what was acceptable to God who had preferred him before her father and before all others that he would play frequently and dance without any regard to what the hand maidens and she herself thought of it So this Michal who was David s wife had no children however when she was afterward married to him to whom Saul her father had given her for at this time David had taken her away from him and had her him self she bare five children But con cerning those mattersf I shall discourse in a proper place Now when the king saw that his affairs grew better almost every day by the will of God he thought he should offend him if while he himself continued in houses made of cedar such as were of great height and had the most curious works of architecture in them he should overlook the ark while it was laid in a tabernacle and he was desirous to build a temple to God as JMoses had predicted such a temple should be built And when he had discoursed with Nathan the prophet about these things and had been encouraged by him to do whatsoever he had a mind to do as having God with him and his helper in all things he was thereupon the more ready to set about that building But God appeared to Nathan that night and commanded him to say to David that he took his purposes David kept himself within the bounds of modesty how joyous soever he might be It was a command which God gave the Israelites that they should rejoice in their feasts Deut xii 7 but then their joy was not to be las civious or petulant but pious and moderate In the case before us David was in the more immediate presence of God and about a very sacred business and therefore it is incongruous to think that he would commit any thing immodest And that he could not expose his nakedness as his wife would insinuate is evident from his having not only an ephod on but being clothed with a robe of fine linen besides his usual under garments 1 Chron xv 27 and therefore though his putting off his regal robes might give some occasion to Michal s expression of his uncovering himself yet it must be owned that this op probrious term proceeded from nothing but the overflow ing spleen of a proud passionate woman Calmefs and Patrick Commentaries B  Hence correct our other copies 2 Sam vi 23 t This is now wanting I Josephus here informs us that according to his un derstanding of the sense of his copy of the Pentateuch and his desires kindly since nobody had be fore now thought of building him a temple although upon his having such a notion he would not permit him to build him that tem ple because he had made many wars and was defiled with the slaughter of his ene mies that however after his death in his old age and when he had lived a long life there should be a temple built by a son of his who should take the kingdom after him and should be called Solomon whom he pro mised to provide for as a father provides for his son by preserving the kingdom for his son s posterity and delivering it to them but that if he sinned he would still punish him with diseases and barrenness of land When David understood this from the pro phet and was overjoyed at this knowledge of the sure continuance of the dominion to his posterity and that his house should be splen did and very famous he came to the ark and fell down on his face and began to adore God and to return thanks to him for all his benefits as well for those that he had already bestowed upon him in raising him from a low state and from the employment of a shepherd to so great dignity of dominion and glory as for those also which he had promised to his posterity and besides for that providence which he had exercised over the Hebrews in procuring them the liberty they enjoyed And when he had said thus and had sung a hymn of praise to God he went his way Moses had himself foretold the building of the temple which yet is no where that I know of in our present copies And that this is not a mistake set down by him unwarily appears by what he observed before IV 8 how Moses foretold that upon the Jews future disobedi ence their temple should be burnt and rebuilt and that not once only but several times afterwards See also Josephus s mention of God s former commands to build such a temple presently chap xiv contrary to our other copies or at least to our translation of the Hebrew 2 Sam vii 6 7 1 Chron xyii 5 6 II Josephus seems in this place with our modern in terpreters to confound the two distinct predictions which God made to David and to Nathan concerning the build ing him a temple by one of David s posterity the one belonging to Solomon the other to the Messiah the dis tinction between which is of the greatest consequence to the Christian religion and of which I have largely treated in my Boyle s Lectures from p 247â 272 To which discourse I must here refer the inquisitive reader See also Antiq VII 13 and chap xiv AN 1080 235 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP V op david s successes against the Philistines and the moabites and the kings op sophene and of damas cus the syrians and the idumeans of his league with the king op hamath and his gratitude for the friendship of jonathan A LITTLE while after this David con sidered that he ought to make war against the Philistines and not see any indo lence permitted in his management that so it might prove as God had foretold to him that when he had overthrown his enemies he should leave his posterity to reign in peace So he called together his army and charged them to be ready and prepared for war and when he thought that all things were in a good state he removed from Jerusalem and came against the Philistines and when he had overcome them in battle and had cut off a great part of their country and united it to the country of the Hebrews he transferred the war to the Moabites And when he had overcome two parts of their army in battle he took the remaining part captive f and imposed tribute upon them to be paid annu ally J He then made war against Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Sophene and when he had joined battle with him at the river Euphrates he destroyed twenty thou sand of his footmen and about seven thousand of his horsemen He also took a thousand of his chariots and destroyed the greatest part of them and ordered that no more thanÂ one hundred should be kept Now when Hadad king of Damascus and of Syria heard that David fought against Hadadezer who was his friend he came to his assistance with a powerful army in hopes to rescue him but when he had joined battle with David at the river Euphrates he failed of his purpose and lost a great number of his soldiers for there were slain of the army of Hadad twenty thousand and all the rest fled Nicolaus also of Damascus makes mention of the king in the fourth book of his histories where he speaks thus A great while after these things had happened there was one of that country whose name was Hadad who was become very potent He reigned over Damascus and the other parts of Syria ex cepting Phoenicia He made war against  About an 1081 t There is no small obscurity in the words of the text which are these â He smote Moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even in two lines measured he to put to death and with one line to keep alive Which words seem to allude to a custom among the kings of the east when they were thoroughly incensed against any nation viz to make the captives all come together in one place and prostrate themselves upon the ground that being divided into two parts as it were with a line their conqueror might appoint which part he pleased either for death or life which was some times determined by casting of lots Some are of opinion that David made three lots or parts of these Moabites two of which he ordered to be slain and one part only to be kept alive The reason of this severity against this miserable people the Rabbins assure us was because they had slain his parents and brethren whom he hod committed to the custody of the king of Moab during his exile But of the reality of this motive there is no manner of appearance and since this execution which David in flicted may relate either to the whole nation or the army only to clear David from the imputation of too much cruelty we should rather conceive it of the third or half part at most of the army Le Clerks and Calmefs Com mentaries B  2 Sam viii 2 II Whether Syria Zobah 2 Sam iii 8 1 Chron xviii 3â 8 be Sophene as Josephus here supposes which yet Ptolomy places beyond Euphrates as Dr Hudson ob serves here  whereas Zobah was on this side  or whether Josephus was not here guilty of a mistake in his geog raphy I cannot certainly determine voL I â NOS 19  20 Â David s reserving only 100 chariots for himself out of 1000 he had taken from Hadadezer was most probably done in compliance with the law of Moses which forbade the king of Israel to multiply horses to himself Deut xvii 16 One of the principal uses of horses in Judea at that time being for drawing their chariots see Jo seph Antiq V 1 and Bp Sherlock s discourse on that subject  It deserves here to be remarked that this Hadad being a very great king was conquered by David whose posterity yet for several generations were called Ben hadad or the son of Hadad till the days of Hazael whose son Adar or Ader is also in our Hebrew copy 2 Kings xiii 24 written Benhadad but in Josephus Adad or Adar And strange it is that the son of Hazael said to be such in the same text and in Josephus IX 8 should still be called the son of Hadad I would therefore here correct our Hebrew copy from Josephus s which seems to have the true reading Nor does the testimony of Nicolaus of Damascus produced in this place by Josephus seem to be faultless when it says that he was the third of the Ha dads or second of the Benhadads who besieged Samaria in the days of Ahab He must rather have been the seventh or eighth if there were ten in all of that name as we are assured there were For testimony makes all the Hadads or Benhadads of the same line and to have immediately succeeded one another Whereas Hazael was not of that line nor is he called Hadad or Benhadad in any copy And note that from this Hadad in the days of David to the beginning of Hazael were near 200 years according to the most exact chronology of Josephus Zz 236 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS David king of Judea and tried his fortune in many battles and particularly in the last battle at Euphrates wherein he was beaten He seems to have been the most excellent of all their kings in strength and manhood Besides this he says of his posterity that after his death they succeeded one another in his kingdom and in his name where he thus speaks When Hadad was dead his posterity reigned for ten generations each of his successors receiving from his father his dominion and his name as did the Ptolemies in Egypt But the third was the most pow erful of them all and was willing to avenge the defeat his forefather had received so he made an expedition against the Jews and laid waste the city which is now called Sa maria Nor did he err from the truth For this is that Hadad who made the expedition against Samaria in the reign of Ahab king of Israel concerning whom we shall speak in due place hereafter Now when David had made an expedition against Damascus and the other parts of Syria and had brought it all into subjection and had placed garrisons in the country and appointed that they should pay tribute he returned home He also dedicated to God at Jerusalem the golden quivers and the en lire armour which the guards of Hadad used to wear which Shishak the king of Egypt took away when he fought with David s grandson Rehoboam with a great deal of other wealth which he carried out of Jeru salem However these things will come to be explained in their proper places hereafter Now as for the king of the Hebrews he was assisted by God who gave him great success in his wars and he made an expedition against the best cities of Hadadezer Betah and Machon So he took them by force and laid them waste Therein was found a very great quantity of gold and silver besides that sort of brass which is said to be more valuable than gold Of which brass Solomon made that large vessel which was called the brazen sea and those most curious lavers when he built the temple of God But when the king of Hamath was informed of the ill success of Hadadezer and had heard of the ruin of his army he was afraid on his own account and resolved to make a league of friendship with David before he should come against him So he sent to him his son Joram and professed that he owed him thanks for fighting against Hadadezer who was his enemy and made a league with him of mutual assistance and friendship He also sent him presents vessels of ancient workmanship both of gold silver and brass So when David had made this league of mu tual assistance with Toi for that was the name of the king of Hamath and had re ceived the presents he sent him he dismissed his son with that respect which was due on both sides But then David brought those presents that were sent by him as also the rest of the gold and silver which he had taken of the cities of the nations whom he had con quered and dedicated them to God Nor did God give victory and success to him only when he went to the battle himself and led his own army but he gave victory to Abishai the brother of Joab general of his forces f over the Idumeans and by him to David when he sent him with an army into Idumea For Abishai destroyed eighteen thousand of them in the battle Whereupon the king of Israel placed garrisons through all Idumea and received the tribute of the country and of every head among them Now David was in his nature just and made his determina tions with regard to truth He had for the general of his whole army Joab and he made Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud recorder He also appointed Zadok of the family of Phineas to be high priest together with Abi athar for he was his friend He also made Seisan the scribe and committed the com mand over the guards of his body to Benaiah J  1 Chron xviii 9 10 t By this great victory over the Idumeans or Edomites the posterity of Esau and by the consequent tribute paid by that nation to the Jews were the prophecies delivered to Rebecca before Jacob and Esau were born and by old Isaac before his death

as had at other times bestowed benefits upon him He therefore gave order that inquiry should be made whether any of Jonathan s lineage were living to whom he might make return of that familiar acquaint ance which Jonathan had had with him and for which he was still debtor And when one of Saul s freed men was brought to him who was acquainted with those of his family that were still living he asked him whether he could tell him of any one belonging to Jonathan that was now alive and capable of a requital of the benefits he had received from Jonathan the man replied that a son of his was remaining whose name was Me phibosheth but that he was lame of his feet for that when his nurse heard that the father and grandfather of the child were fallen in the battle she snatched him up and fled away and let him fall from her shoulders and his feet were lamed So when he had learned where and by whom he was brought up he sent messengers to Machir to the city Lodebar for with him was the son of Jona than brought up and sent for him to come to him So when Mephibosheth came to the king he fell on his face and worshipped him But David encouraged him and bid him be of good cheer and expect better times So he gave him his father s house and all the estate which his grandfather Saul was in pos session of and bade him come and diet with him at his own table and never to be absent one day And when the youth had wor shipped him on account of his words and gifts given to him he called for Ziba and told him that he had given the youth his father s house and all Saul s estate He also ordered that Ziba should cultivate his land and take care of it and bring him the profits of all to Jerusalem Accordingly David brought him to his table every day and be stowed upon the youth Ziba and his sons who were in number fifteen and his servants who were in number twenty When the king had made these appointments and Ziba had worshipped him and promised to do all that he had bidden him he went his way So that this son of Jonathan dwelt at Jerusalem and dieted at the king s table and had the same care that a son could claim taken of him He also had himself a son Micha  whom he named CHAP VI OF THE WAR WAGED AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND ITS HAPPY CONCLUSION ABOUT thist time died Nahash king of the Ammonites who was a friend of David s J And when his son had succeeded _ his father in the kingdom David sent ambas sadors to him to comfort him and exhorted him to take his father s death patiently and to expect that he would continue the same kindness to himself which he had shewed to his father But the princes of the Ammonites took this message in evil part and not as David s kind disposition gave reason to take it and they excited the king to take it and said that David had sent men to spy out the country and what strength it had under the pretence of humanity and kindness They further advised him not to give heed to David s words lest he should be deluded by him and so fall into an inconsolable calamity Accordingly Nahash s son the king of the Ammonites thought these princes spake what was more probable than the truth would admit and so abused the ambassadors that quently must be received into the inmost confidence For whether the office of a Lord Chancellor was con sistent with the constitution of the Jewish state a modern author seems to doubt History of the Life of King David vol 2 B  1 Chron viii 34 t About an 1078 B C I What the particular benefits which David had re ceived from Nahash were we are no where told in Scrip ture but some of the Jews say that he fled to him when he durst stay no longer with Achish king of the Philistines and that he received him very kindly others that he entertained his relations when the king of Moab to whom he had committed them slew some of them but the most likely opinion is that as he was a bitter enemy to Saul who had given him a great overthrow he for that very reason became a friend to David when he per ceived how Saul persecuted him and thereupon might send him relief and assistance and perhaps offer him pro tection in his kingdom Patrick s Commentary B Zz2 238 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS were sent after a very harsh manner For lie shaved the one half of their beards and cut off one half of their garments and sent his answer not in words but in deeds When the king of Israel saw this he had indignation at it and shewed openly that he would not overlook this injurious and contumelious treatment but would make war with the Ammonites and would avenge this wicked treatment of his ambassadors on their king So that king s intimate friends and com manders understanding that they had violated their league and were liable to be punished for the same made preparations for war they also sent a thousand talents to the Syrian king of Mesopotamia and endeavoured to prevail with him and fShobach to assist them for that pay Now these kings had twenty thousand footmen They also hired the king of the country called Maacah and a fourth king by name Ishtob which last had twelve thousand armed men David was under no consternation at this confederacy nor at the forces of the Ammon ites But putting his trust in God because he was going to war in a just cause on ac count of the injurious treatment he had met with he immediately sent Joab J the captain of his host against them with the flower of his army Joab pitched his camp by Rabbath the metropolis of the Ammonites whereupon the enemy came out and set themselves in array not all of them together but in two bodies For the auxiliaries were set in array in the plain by themselves but the army of the Ammonites at the gates over against the Hebrews When Joab saw this he opposed one stratagem against another and chose out the most hardy part of his men and set them in opposition to the king of Syria and the kings that were with him and gave the other part to his brother Abishai and bade him set them in opposition to the Ammonites and said to him in case he should see that the Syrians distressed him and were too hard for him he should order his troops to turn about and assist him and he said that he himself would do the same to him if he saw him in the like distress from the Ammonites So he sent his brother be fore and encouraged him to do every thing courageously and with alacrity which would teach them to be afraid of disgrace and to fight manfully And so he dismissed him to fight with the Ammonites while he fell upon the Syrians And though they made a strong opposition for a while Joab slew many of them and compelled the rest to betake them selves to flight which when the Ammonites saw and were withal afraid of Abishai and his army they staid no longer but imitated their auxiliaries and fled to the city So Joab when he had thus overcome the enemy returned with great glory to Jerusalem to the king This defeat did not still induce the Ammon ites to be quiet nor to own those that were superior to them to be so But they sent to Chalaman the king of the Syrians beyond Euphrates and hired him for an auxiliary He had Shobach for the captain of his host with eighty thousand footmen and ten thou   This was one of the greatest indignities that the malice of man could invent in those countries where all people thought their hair so great an ornament that some would rather have submitted to die than part with it What a foul disgrace and heavy punishment this was ac counted in ancient times we may learn from Nicholaus Damascenus as mentioned by Stobaeus tit 42 who says that among the Indians the king commanded the greatest offenders to be shaven as the heaviest punish ment that he could inflict upon them and to the like pur pose Plutarch in Agesil tells us that whenever a soldier among the Lacedemonians was convicted of cow ardice he was obliged to go with one part of his upper lip shaved and the other not Nay even at this day no greater indignity can be offered to a man of Persia than to cause his beard to be shaved and therefore Taver nier in his travels relates the story that when the Sophi caused an ambassador of Arenge zebe s to be used in this manner telling him that he was not worthy to wear a beard the emperor even in the manner as David here did most highly resented the affront that was done to him in the person of his ambassador And as shaving David s ambassadors was deservedly accounted a grievous affront so the cutting off half the beard which made them look still more ridiculous was a great addition to it where beards were held in great veneration and where long habits down to the heels were worn especially by persons of distinction without any breeches or drawers the cutting their garments even to the middle thereby to expose their nakedness was such a brutal and shameless insult as would badly become a man of David s martial spirit and just sentiments of honour to have tamely passed by Patrick s and Calmet s Commentaries B t Josephus took this Shobach and Ishtob mentioned presently to be the names of princes or captains and not of countries as they stand in the present Hebrew and Septuagint copies Which is in the right 1 cannot deter mine J

to make war with them no longer by his generals but passed over the river Jordan himself with all his army and when he met them he joined battle with them and slew forty thousand of their footmen and seven thousand of their horsemen He also wounded Shobach the general of Chalaman s forces who died of that stroke But the people of Mesopotamia upon such a conclu sion of the battle delivered themselves up to David and sent him presents Who at winter time returned to Jerusalem but at the beginning of the spring he sent Joab the captain of his host to fight against the Ammonites who over ran all their country and laid it waste and shut them up in their metropolis Rabbah and besieged them therein CHAP VII of david s adultery with bathsheba and his murder op her husband uriah for which he was reproved by nathan BUT David fell now into a very grievous sin though he were otherwise naturally a righteous and a religious man and one that firmly observed the laws of our fathers For when late in an evening he took a view round him from the roof of his royal palace t where he used to walk at that hour he saw a wo man washing herself in her own house J She was one of extraordinary beauty and therein surpassed all other women Her name was Bathsheba So he was overcome by that wo man s beauty and was not able to restrain his desires but sent for her and lay with her Hereupon she conceived and sent to the king that he should contrive some way for conceal ing her sin for according to the laws of their fathers she who had been guilty of adultery ought to be putÂ to death So the king sent for Joab s armour bearer from the siege who was the woman s husband and his name was Uriah And when he was come the king inquired of him about the army and about the siege and when he made answer that all their affairs went according to their wishes the king took some portions of meat from his supper and gave them to him and bade him go home to his wife and take his rest with her Uriah did not do so but slept near the king with the rest of his armour bearers When the king was informed of this he asked him why he did not go home to his house and to his wife after so long an absence which is the natural custom of all men when they come from a long journey He replied that it was not right while his fellow soldiers and the general of the army slept upon the ground in the camp and in an enemy s coun try that he should go and take his rest with his wife When he had thus replied the king ordered him to stay there that night that he might dismiss him the next day to the general So the king invited Uriah to supper and after a cunning and dexterous manner supplied him  An 1076 t The manner of building in all eastern countries was to have their houses flat roofed with a terrace

was very angry at him and wrote to Joab and commanded him to punish Uriah for he told him that he had offended him and he suggested to him the manner in which he would have him fmnished that it might not be discovered that le was himself the author of this punishment For he charged him to set him over against that part of the enemy s army where the at tack would be most hazardous and where he might be deserted and be in the greatest jeopardy for he bade him order his fellow soldiers to retire out of the fight When he had written thus and sealed the letter with his own seal he gave it to Uriah to carry it to Joab When Joab had received it and upon reading it understood the king s pur pose he set Uriah in that place where he knew the enemy would be most troublesome to them and gave him for his partners some of the best soldiers in the army and said that he would also come to their assistance with the whole army that if possible they might break down some part of the wall and enter the city And he desired him to be glad of the opportunity of exposing himself to such great pains and not to be displeased at it since he was a valiant soldier and had a great reputation for his valour both with the king and with his countrymen And when Uriah undertook the work he was set upon with alacrity he gave private orders to those who were to be his companions that when they saw the enemy make a sally they should  It may be thought perhaps that Uriah suspected something of his wife s adultery and therefore resolving that it should be discovered would not be persuaded to go down to his house but if he did he certainly acted the part of a trusty servant when he would not open the king s letter to know what was in it though upon sup position that he suspected his criminal commerce with his wife he had reason to expect no good This puts one naturally in mind of the story of Bellerophon s car rying letters from Proetus to his father in law Jobates king of Lycia with an order to kill him from whom it came into a proverb to carry Bellerophon s letter or a death warrant against one s self according to that passage in Plautus Aha Bellerophontem jam tuus me fecit filius Egomet tabellas detuli ut vincirer Bacchid For the fable of Uriah and Bellerophon are so very much alike that the fable of the latter seems to be founded leave him When therefore the Hebrews made an attack upon the city the Ammonites were afraid that the enemy might prevent them and get up into the city and this at the very place whither Uriah was ordered so they exposed their best soldiers to be in the fore front and opened their gates sud denly and fell upon the enemy with great vehemence aftd ran violently upon them When those that were with Uriah saw this they all retreated backward as Joab had previously directed but Uriah as ashamed to run away and leave his post sustained the violence of the onset and slew many of the enemy but being encompassed round and caught in the midst of them he was slain t and some other of his companions were slain with him When this was done Joab sent messengers to the king and ordered them to tell him that he did what he could to take the city soon but that as they made an assault on the wall they had been forced to retire with great loss And bade them if they saw the king was angry at it to add that Uriah was slain also When the king had heard this of the messen gers he said That they did wrong when they assaulted the wall whereas they ought by undermining and other stratagems of war to endeavour the taking of the city especially when they had before their eyes the example of JAbimelech the son of Gideon who would needs take the tower in Thebez by force and was killed by a large stone thrown at him by an old woman and although he was a man of great prowess he died ignominiously by the dangerous manner of his assault that they upon the story of the former Bellerophon who as some scholiasts think should be read Boulepheron a council carrier was a stranger at the court of Proetus as Uriah being a Hittite was at the court of David He declined the embraces of Sthenboea as Uriah did the bed of Bath sheba and was for that reason sent to Jobates general of Proetus s army with letters which contained a direc tion to put him to death as Uriah was sent to Joab David s general By Jobates he was sent with a small guard upon an attack in which it was intended he should be slain as Uriah was by Joab to that in which he fell The main of the history is the same in both the similitude of Jobates and Joab s name is very remarkable and the variation in the whole only lies in some such or namental embellishments as might well be expected in a poetical composition Calmet s Commentary and the His tory of the Life of King David B t 2 Sam xi 17 J Judges ix 56â 65 an 1076 241 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS should remember this accident and not come near the enemy s wall for that the best me thod of making war with success was to call to mind the accidents of former wars and what good or bad success had attended them in the like dangerous cases that so they might imitate the one and avoid the other But when the king was in this disposition the messenger told him that Uriah was slain also whereupon he was pacified So he bade the messenger go back to Joab and tell him that this misfortune was no other than what was common among mankind and that such was the nature and such the accidents of war that sometimes the enemy would have suc cess therein and sometimes others but he ordered him to go on still in his care about the siege that no ill accident might befall him in it hereafter that they should raise bulwarks and use machines in besieging the city and when they had got it to overturn its very foundation and to destroy all the in habitants Accordingly the messenger car ried the king s message with which he was charged and made haste to Joab Bath sheba the wife of Uriah when she was in formed of the death of her husband mourned for him many days But when her mourning was over and the tears which she shed lor Uriah were dried up the king took her to wife and a son was born to him by her With this marriage God was not well pleased f but was angry at David And he appeared to Nathan the prophet in his sleep and complained of the king Now Nathan was a prudent man and considering that kings when they fall into a passion are guided more by that passion than by justice he re solved to conceal the threatenings that pro ceeded from God and made a good natured discourse to him and this after the following manner desiring that the king would give him his opinion in the following case Â â There were said he two men inhabiting  How long widows were to mourn for their husbands there is no express precept in the law but the usual time for common mourners was no more than seven days and we cannot suppose that Bathsheba was much longer con sidering the reason we have to apply to her the words of Lucan Lachrymas non sponte cadentes Kffudit geinitusque expressit pectore laeto B t According to the Jewish doctors it was utterly un lawful for any to marry another man s wife in case he had delilcd her before The canonical law declares such marriages null and void as are contracted between an adulterous man and a woman that was partner with him in the crime and though the law of Moses does not ex pressly forbid them yet we may not thence infer that they were permitted among the Jews For these rea sons some have thought that this marriage of David and Bathsheba was null and invalid but others upon better grounds have supposed that though there were many cri minal circumstances attending it yet these did not vacate its effect and in short though it ought not to have been done yet being done the marriage was good and the children which were afterwards born were legitimate CalmeCs and Patrick s Commentaries B  We learn little more of this great man in the sacred writings but that he was David s prophet intimate coun sellor and historiographer Josephus says of him that he was a polite and a prudent man one who knew how to temper the severity of wisdom with sweetness of man ners And Grotius compares him to Manius Lepidus of whom Tacitus says that he had a talent of turning away Tiberus s mind from those cruel purposes to which the vile flattery of others inclined him and was at the same time in equal favour and authority with him Nathan certainly knew the art of reproving kings with authority and yet without giving offence So far from that he grew in his prince s favour and estimation as long as he lived insomuch that David as tradition tells us called one son after his name and committed another even his beloved Solomon to his care and tuition The History of the Life of King David vol iii B  2 Sam xii 1â 15 Â There is a passage of Seneca Epist 59 where he treats of the style fit for philosophic writing which suits so well with this parable of Nathan s that I choose to give it in his own words as a fit preamble to the short comment which follows of it Invenio inquit imagines quibus si quis nobis uti vetat et poetis illas solis judicat esse con cessas neminem mihi videtur ex antiquis legisse apnd quos nondum captabatur plausibilis oratio Illi qui simpliciter et demonstrandsB rei causa loquebantur parabolis refertt sunt quas existimo necessarias non ex eadem causa qua poetis sed ut imbecillitatis nostra adminicula sint et ut discentem et audientem in rem prassentem addueant For parables like histories wherein we have no concern are heard with more attention and are so contrived as to give no offence even though they provoke the man to whom they are addressed to condemn himself There were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor And the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds as David had many wives and concubines with whom he might have been well satisfied without violating another man s bed but the poor had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up Bath sheba very likely was the only wife that Uriah had with whom he was highly pleased and delighted and she very probably with him till David s temptations had perverted her mind And it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter Nathan in his resemblance cannot be said to have surpassed the truth considering how fond many persons were anciently not only of lambs but of several other creatures which they suffered to eat with them at their tables and lie with them in their beds and Uiut 242 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the same city the one of them was rich and the other poor the rich man had a great many flocks of cattle of sheep and of kine but the poor man had but one ewe lamb This he brought up with his children and let her eat her food with them and he had the same natural affection for her which any one might have for a daughter Now upon the coming of a stranger to the rich man he would not vouchsafe to kill any of his own flocks and thence regale his friend but he sent for the poor man s lamb and took her away from him and made her ready for food and thence feasted the stranger This discourse troubled the king exceedingly and he denounced to Nathan that this was a wicked man who could dare to do such a thing and it was but just that he should re store the lamb fourfold and be punished with death for it also Upon this Nathan im mediately said that he was himself the man who ought to suffer those punishments and that by his own sentence for that it was he who had perpetrated this great and horrid crime He also revealed to him the anger of God who had made him king over the army of the Hebrews and lord of all the nations and those many and great nations round about him who had formerly delivered him out of the hands of Saul and had given him such wives as he had justly and legally mar ried and now this God was despised by him and affronted by his impiety when he had married and now had another man s wife and by exposing her husband to the enemy had really slain him that God would inflict punishments upon him on account of those instances of wickedness that his own wives should be violated by one of his sons and that he should be treacherously supplanted by the same son and that although he had per petrated his wickedness secretly yet should that punishment which he was to undergo be inflicted publicly upon him and also that the child which was born to him of Bathsheba should soon die When the king was troubled at these messages and sufficiently confound ed and said with tears and sorrow that he had sinned for he was without controversy a pious man and guilty of no sin at all in his whole life excepting those in the matter of Uriah God had compassion on him and was reconciled to him and promised that he would preserve him both nis life and his kingdom For he said that seeing he re pented of the things he had done he was no longer displeased with him So Nathan when he had delivered this prophecy to the king returned home However God sent a dangerous distemper upon the child that was born to David of the wife of Uriah At which the king was trou bled and did not take any food for seven days t although his servants almost forced him to take it but he clothed himself in a black garment and fell down and lay upon the ground in sackcloth intreating God for the recovery of the child for he vehemently loved the child s mother But when on the seventh day the child was dead the king s servants durst not tell him of it as supposing that when he knew it he would still less ad mit of food and other care of himself by reason of his grief at the death of his son since when the child was only sick he so greatly afflicted himself and grieved for him But when the king perceived that his servants were in disorder and seemed to be affected as those are who are very desirous to conceal something he understood that the child was dead and when he had called one of his ser vants to him and discovered that it was so he even at this day it is a custom in Arabia which is con tiguous to Judea to have one of the finest lambs in the flock brought up in the house and fed with the children And there came a traveller to the rich man this de notes David s straggling appetite which he suffered to wander from his own home and to covet another man s wife and of this appetite the Jewish doctors have this ob servation that in the beginning it is but a traveller but in time it becomes a guest and in conclusion is the master of the house And he spared to take of his own flock and his own herds wherewith he might have satisfied his appetite but took the poor man s lamb and dressed it for the wayfaring man that was come to him Most commentators here take notice that Nathan did not go so far in the parable as to say any thing of the rich man s killing the poor man This certainly would have made the resemblance more complete but it is therefore omit ted that David might not so readily apprehend Nathan s meaning and so be induced unawares to pronounce a sentence of condemnation upon himself whereupon the prophet had a fair opportunity to shew him that if the rich man who took away the poor man s lamb deserved death according to his own judgment how much more did he deserve it who had not only taken another man s wife but caused him to be slain likewise by the enemies of Israel Patrick s Commentary B  Exod xxii 1 t See the note on VI

surprised his kindred and servants while he did nothing of this when the child was sick but did it all when he was dead Whereupon having first begged leave to ask him a question they be sought him to tell them the reason ot this conduct He then called them unskilful peo ple and instructed them how he had hopes of the recovery of the child while it was alive and accordingly did all that was proper for him to do as thinking by such means to ren der God propitious but that when the child was dead there was no longer any occasion for grief which was then to no purpose When he had said this they commended the king s wisdom and understanding He then went unto Bathsheba his wife and she con ceived and bare a son and by the command of Nathan the prophet called his name Solo mon But Joab sorely distressed the Ammonites in the siege by cutting off their waters and depriving them of other means of subsistence till they were in the greatest want of drink and meat for they depended only on one small well of water and this they durst not drink of too freely lest the fountain should entirely fail So he wrote to the king and informed him thereof and persuaded him to come himself and take the city that he might have the honour of the victory Upon this letter of Joab s the king accepted of his good will and fidelity and took with him his army and came to the destruction of Rahab and when he had taken it by force he gave it to his soldiers to plunder it But he himself took the king of the Ammonites crown whose weight was a talent of gold f and it had in its middle a precious stone called a sardonyx which crown David ever after wore on his own head He also found many other ves sels in the city and those both splendid and of great price but as for the men he Jtormented them and then destroyed them And when he had taken the other cities of the Ammonites by force he treated them after the same manner CHAP VIII OF THE VIOLATION OF TAMAR BV HER BROTHER AMNON THE REVENGE OF ABSALOM

handsome insomuch that she surpassed all the most beautiful women She had the same mother with Absalom Now Amnon David s eldest son fell in love with her and being not able to obtain his desires on ac count of the custody she was under his grief preyed upon him so much that he grew lean and his colour was changed Now there was one Jonadab a kinsman and friend of his who discovered his passion for

talent of gold was but about seven pounds weight Nor could Josephus well estimate it higher since he here says that David wore it on his head perpetually J Whether Josephus saw the words of our other copies 2 Sam xii 31 and 1 Chron xx 3 that David put the inhabitants or at least the garrison of Rabbah and of the other Ammonite cities which he besieged and took un der or cut them with saws and under or with harrows of iron and under or with axes of iron and made them pass through the brick kiln is not here directly expressed If he saw them as is most probable he did he certainly expounded them of tormenting these Ammonites to death who yet were none of those seven nations of Canaan whose wickedness had rendered them incapable of mercy Otherwise I should be inclined to think that the meaning at least as the words are in Samuel might only be this that they were made the lowest slaves to work in sawing timber or stone in harrowing the fields in hewing VOL I â NOS 21 k 22 timber in making and burning bricks and the like hard services but without taking away their lives We never elsewhere that I remember meet with such methods of cruelty in putting men to death in all the Bible or in any other ancient history Nor do the words in Samuel seem naturally to refer to any such thing II Virgins of the blood royal were kept secluse in apart ments separate from the commerce of men into which not only strangers but even their own fathers were not permitted to enter Amnon however at some time or other had seen the beautiful Tamar or otherwise he could not have conceived so strong a passion for her Upon some certain ceremonial occasions indeed it was customary for the young women to walk out and shew themselves but considering their close confinement at other times it was hardly possible for Amnon to find an opportunity of declaring his passion much more of grati fying it and therefore out of pure despair he pined himself into a consumption Calmet s Commentary B 3 A 244 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tell him what was the cause of it however he said that he guessed it arose from the passion of love Amnon confessed that he was in love with a sister of his who had the same father with himself So Jonadab sug gested to him by what method and contri vance he might obtain his desires For he persuaded him to counterfeit sickness and bade him when his father should come to him to beg of him that his sister might come and minister to him for if that were done he should be better and should quickly recover from his distemper So Amnon lay down on his bed and pretended to be sick as Jona dab had suggested And when his father came and inquired how he did he begged of him to send his sister to him Accordingly he presently ordered her to be brought to him and when she was come Amnon bade her make cakes for him and fry them in a pan and do it all with her own hands be cause he should take them better from her than from any one else So she kneaded the flour in the sight of her brother and made him cakes and baked them in a pan and brought them to him But at that time he would not taste them but gave order to his servants to send all that were there out of his chamber because he had a mind to repose himself free from tumult and disturbance As soon as what he had commanded was done he desired his sister to bring his supper to him into the inner parlour which when the damsel had done he took hold of her and endeavoured to persuade her to lie with him Hereupon the damsel cried out and said Nay brother do not force me nor be so wicked as to transgress the laws and bring upon thyself the utmost confusion Curb this thy unrighteous and impure lust from which our house will get nothing but reproach and disgrace She also advised him to speak to his father about this affair as he might pro bably permit him to marry her This she said as desirous to avoid her brother s vio lent passion at present But he would not yield to her but inflamed with love and blinded with the vehemency of his passion he forced his sister But as soon as Amnon had gratified his desires he hated the object of them and giving her reproachful words bade her rise up and be gone And when she said that this was a more injurious treat ment than the former because now he had forced her he would not let her stay with him till the evening but bid her go away in the day time and while it was light that she might meet with people that would be wit nesses of her shame he commanded his ser vant to turn her out of his house Hereupon she was sorely grieved at the injury and vio lence that had been offered her f and rent her loose coat for the virgins of old time wore such loose coats tied at the hands and let down to the ankles that the inner coats might not be seen and sprinkled ashes on her head and went up the middle of the city crying out and lamenting for the vio lence that had been offered her Now Ab salom her brother happened to meet her and asked her what sad thing had befallen her that she was in that plight and when  Interpreters seem to be at a great loss to find out the reason why Amnon s love to his sister should so soon be converted into such a hatred as to make him act so rudely so brutally towards her but it is no uncommon thing for men of violent and irregular passions to pass from one extreme to another The shame which accom panies every base action the remorse and repentance and many bad consequences that immediately pursue it make a recoil in every man s temper and therefore it is no wonder that a libidinous young man who would not Â pare so much as his own sister should after fruition and when the ardour of his lust was satisfied be seized with a contrary passion and hate the object he loved so much before when he came coolly to compare the pleasure and the sin together the shortness of the one and the hei nousness of the other He hated his sister when he should have hated himself and as this outrageous treat ment made it impossible for his guilt to be concealed so God seems to have abandoned him to the tumult of his intemperate mind on purpose to make this punishment of David s adultery more flagrant and

245 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS she told him he comforted her and desired her to be quiet and to take all patiently and not to esteem her being corrupted by her brother as an injury So she yielded to his advice and left off crying out and disco vering the force offered her to the multitude And she continued as a widow with her brother Absalom a long time When David knew this he was grieved at the actions of Amnon But because he had an extraordinary affection for him for he was his eldest son he was compelled not to af flict him But Absalom watched for a conve nient opportunity of revenging this crime for he thoroughly hated him Now the second year after this wicked affair was over and Absalom was about to shear his own sheep at Baalhazor a city in the portion of Ephraim he besought his father as well as his bre thren to come and feast with him But when David excused himself as not being willing to be burdensome Absalom desired he would however send his brethren whom he did send accordingly Then Absalom charged his servants that when they should see Amnon disordered and drowsy with wine and he should give them a signal they should fear nobody but kill him When they had done as they were com manded the rest of his brethren were asto nished and alarmed for themselves So they immediately got on horseback and rode away to their father f But somebody prevented them and told their father that they were all slain by Absalom Whereupon he was overcome with sorrow as for so many of his sons that were destroyed at once and by this consideration that it was their brother that appeared to have slain them he aggra vated his sorrow for them So he neither inquired what was the cause of this slaughter nor stayed to hear any thing else which yet it was but reasonable to have done when so very great and by that greatness so in credible a misfortune was related to him He rent his clothes and threw himself upon the ground and there lay lamenting the loss of all his sons both those who as he was in formed were slain and of him that slew them But Jonadab the son of his brother Shimeah intreated him not to indulge his sorrow so far for as to the rest of his sons he did not be lieve they were slain for he found no cause for such a suspicion But he said it might deserve inquiry as to Amnon For it was not unlikely that Absalom might venture to kill him on account of the injury he had offered to Tamar In the mean time a great noise of horses and a tumult of some people that were coming excited their attention They were the king s sons who were fled away from the feast So their father met them as they were in their grief and he himself grieved with them But it was more than he expected to see those his sons again whom he had a little before heard to have perished However there were tears and groans on both sides they lamenting their brother who was killed and the king lamenting his son who was killed also but Absalom fled to Geshur to his grandfather by his mother s side who was king of that country and he remained with him three whole years Now David had a design to send to Ab salom  not that he should come to be punished but that he might be with him For the effects of his anger were abated by length of time It was Joab the captain of his host that chiefly persuaded him so to do For he suborned a woman that was stricken in age to go to the king in mourning apparel Â who said to him that two of her sons had some  2 Sam xiii 20 t 2 Sam xiii 29 j 2 Sam iii 3 II About an 1068 B C Â The art and contrivance of this widow of Tekoah s speech is very remarkable When the woman of Te koah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said Help O king And the king said to her What aileth thee And she said I am indeed a widow woman and my husband is dead and thy hand maid had two sons and the two strove together in the 6eld and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him and behold this family is risen against thy handmaid and they say Deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal that is left i e deprive me of the little comfort of my life which remains and is as it were a coal buried in the ashes and leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth 2 Sam xiv 4 c Now the scope of all this speech was to frame a case as like to David s as she could devise that by prevailing with him to determine it in her favour he might be convinced how much more reasonable it was to preserve Absalom But how plausible soever the likeness might be there was a wide difference be tween her case and his for her son as she pretended was slain in a scuffle with his brother whereas Amnon 3A2 246 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS difference between them and that in the progress of that difference they came to an open quarrel and that one was smitten by the other and was dead and she desired him to interpose in this case and to save this her son from her kindred who were very zealous to have him that had slain his brother put to death that so she might not be farther de prived of the hopes she had of being taken care of in her old age by him and that if he would hinder this slaughter of her son by those that wished for it he would do her a great favour because the kindred would not be restrained from their purpose by any thing else than by the fear of him And when the king had given his consent to what the woman had begged of him she made this reply I owe thee thanks for thy benignity to me in pitying my old age and preventing the loss of my only remaining child But in order to assure me of this thy kindness be first reconciled to thine own son and cease to be angry with him For how shall I persuade myself that thou hast really bestowed this favour upon me while thou thyself continuest after the like manner in thy wrath to thine own son For it is a foolish thing to add wilfully another to thy dead son while the death of the other was brought about without thy consent The king now perceived that this pretended story was a fabrication devised by Joab and when upon inquiry of the old woman he understood it to be so in reality he called for Joab and told him he had obtained what he requested according to his own mind and he bade him bring Absalom back for he was not now displeased but had already ceased to be angry with him So Joab bowed himself down to the king and went immediately to Geshur and brought Absalom with him to Jerusalem However the king sent a message to his son beforehand as he was coming and com manded him to retire to his own house for he was not yet in such a disposition as to think fit to see him Accordingly upon the father s command he avoided coming into his presence and contented himself with the respects paid him by his own family only Now his beauty was not impaired either by the grief he had been under or by the want of such care as was proper to be taken of a king s son for he still surpassed all men in the tallness of his stature and was more eminent in a fine appearance than those that dieted the most luxuriously And indeed such was the thickness of the hair of his head that it was with difficulty he was polled every eighth day and his hairf weighed two hun dred shekels which are five pounds How ever he dwelt in Jerusalem two years and became the father of three sons and one beautiful daughter which daughter Reho boam the son of Solomon took to wife after wards and had by her a son named Abijah But Absalom sent to Joab and desired him to pacify his father towards him and to be seech him to give him leave to come to see him and speak with him But when Joab neglected so to do he sent some of his own servants and set fire to the field that adjoined to him which thing when Joab understood he came to Absalom and accused him of what he had done and asked him the reason why he did so Absalom replied  I have found out this stratagem that might bring thee to me while thou hast taken no care to was taken off by a premeditated murder he was slain in the field where there were no witnesses whether the fact was wilfully done or no whereas all the king s sons saw Amnon barbarously murdered by his brother And lastly he was her only son by whom alone she could hope to have her husband s name perpetuated whereas David s family was in no danger of being extinct even although he had given up Absalom to justice But there was a great deal of policy in not making the similitude too close_and visible lest the king should perceive the drift pf the woman s petition before she had obtained a grant of pardon for her son and came to make the application to the king And though upon her making the applica tion the king might have argued the disparity of the two oases yet he thought proper to wave this and admit her reasoning to be good because he was as desirous to have Absalom recalled as were any of his subjects Patrick s Commentary B  2 Sam xiv 21 t Of this weight of Absalom s hair how in twenty or thirty years it might well amount to two hundred shekels or to somewhat above six pounds avoirdupois see the Literal Accomplishment of Prophecies p 77 78 But a late very judicious author thinks that the Septuagint meant not its weight but its value was two hundred she kels Dr Wall s critical notes on the Old Testament upon 2 Sam xiv 26 It does not appear what was Jose phus s opinion He sets the text down honestly as he found it in his copies Only he thought that at the end of days when Absalom polled and weighed his hair was once a week  2 Chron xi 20 AH 1064 24 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS perform the injunction I laid upon thee which was to reconcile my father to me And I really beg it of thee now thou art here to pacify my father as to me since I esteem my coming hither to be more grievous than my banishment while my father s wrath against me continues Joab was hereby persuaded and pitied the distress that Ab salom was in and became an intercessor with the king for him And when he had discoursed with his father he soon brought him to that amicable disposition towards Ab salom that he presently sent for him to come to him And when he had cast himself down upon the ground and begged for the forgive ness of his offences the king raised him up and promised to forget what he had formerly done CHAP IX OF THE INSURRECTION OF ABSALOM AGAINST DAVID AND THE DEATH OF AHITHOFHEL NOW Absalom upon this success with the king procured to himself many horses and chariots and that in a little time He had also fifty armour bearers that were about him and he came early every day to the king s palace and spake what was agreeable to such as came for justice and lost their causes as if that happened for want of good counsellors about the king or perhaps be cause the judges mistook in that unjust sen tence they gave Whereby he gained the good will of all the populace He told them that had he but such authority committed to him he would distribute justice to them in a most equitable manner When he had made himself so popular among the multitude he thought he had already the good will of the people secured to him J But when four years had passed since his father s reconcili ation he came to him Â and besought him to give him leave to go to Hebron and pay a sacrifice to God because he vowed it to him when he fled out of the country So when David had granted his request he went thither and great multitudes came running together to him for he had sent to a great number so to do Among them came Ahithophel the Gilonite a counsellor of David s and two hundred men of Jerusalem who knew not his intentions but were sent for as to a sacrifice So he was appointed king by all of them which he ob tained by this stratagem As soon as this news was brought to David and he was in formed of what he did not expect from his son he was affrighted at this impious and bold undertaking and wondered that he was so far from remembering how his offence had lately been forgiven him that he undertook much worse and more wicked enterprises first to deprive him of that kingdom which was given him of God and secondly to take away his own father s life He therefore re solved to fly to the parts beyond Jordan So he called his most intimate friends together  2 Sam xiv 33 t It is an observation of Plato that when any one in tends to make himself a tyrant in a popular state he no sooner enters on the government but po

courage and gallantry of civility and courtesy young and wonderfully beautiful descended from kings both by his father s and mother s side and prodigal enough of large and magnificent pro mises if ever he came to be king a character not unlike that of Turnus in Virgil Hunc decus egregium formae movet atque juventae Hunc atavi reges hunc claris dextera factis JEneid lib 7 B  This is one of the best corrections that Josephus s copy affords us of a text that in our ordinary copies is grossly corrupted They say that this rebellion of Ab salom was forty years after what went before of his re conciliation to his father whereas the series of the his tory shews it could not be more than four years after it as here in Josephus whose number is directly confirmed by that copy of the Septuagint version whence the Ar menian translation was made which gives us the same small number of four years Dr Wall also notes that four of the MSS of the Vulgate have the same small number Which indeed I think ought without dispute to be allowed the right reading Â About an 1064 248 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and communicated to them all that he had heard of his son s madness he then com mitted himself to God to judge between them about all their actions and left the care of his royal palace to his ten concubines and went away from Jerusalem being willingly accompanied by the rest of the multitude who went hastily away with him and particularly by those six hundred armed men who had been with him from his first flight in the days of Saul But he persuaded Abiathar and Zadok the high priests who had determined to go away with him as also all the Levites who were with the ark to stay behind as hoping God would deliver hhn without its removal but he charged them to let him know privately how all things went on And he had their sons Ahimaaz the son of Zadok and Jonathan the son of Abiathar for faithful ministers in all things But Ittai the Gittite went out with him whether David would let him or not for he would have persuaded him to stay and on that account he appeared the more friendly to him But as he was as cending the Mount of Olives barefoot and all his company were in tears it was told him that Ahithophel was with Absalom This hearing augmented his grief and he besought God earnestly to alienate the mind of Absalom from Ahithophel for he was afraid that he should persuade him to follow his pernicious counsel for he was a prudent man and very sharp in seeing what was advantageous When David had ascended to the top of the mountain he took a view of the city and prayed to God with abundance of tears as having already lost his kingdom And here it was that a faithful friend of his whose name was Hushai met him When David saw him with his clothes rent and having ashes all over his head and in lamentation for the great change of affairs he comforted him and exhorted him to leave off grieving Nay at length he besought him to go back to Ab salom and appear as one of his party and to endeavour to learn the most secret thoughts of his mind and to contradict the counsels of Ahithophel f for that he could not do him so much good by being with him as he might by being with Absalom So he was prevailed on by David and left him and came to Jeru salem whither Absalom himself came also a little while afterward J When David was gone a little farther there met him Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth whom he had sent to take care of the pos sessions which had been given him as the son of Jonathan the son of Saul with a couple of asses laden with provisions and desired him to take as much of them as he and his followers stood in need of And when the king asked him where he had left Mephibosheth he said he had left him in Jerusalem expecting to be chosen king in the present confusions in remembrance of the benefits Saul had conferred upon them At this the king had great indignation and gave to Ziba all that he had formerly be stowed on Mephibosheth for he determined that it was much fitter that he should have them than the other At which Ziba greatly rejoiced When David was at a place called Ba hurim there came out a kinsman of Saul s whose name was Shimei and threw stones at him and gave him reproachful words and as his friends stood about the king and pro tected him he persevered still more in his reproaches and called him  A bloody man and the author of all sorts of mischief He  This man might be of the ancient race of the Arch ites descendants from Canaan of whom Moses speaks Gen x 17 but since the name of these ancient people is differently written I should rather think that this addi tional name was given him from the place of his nativity viz Archi a town situated on the frontiers of Benjamin and Ephraim to the West of Bethel Josh xvi 2 B t The Jews are of opinion that Ahithophel was in censed against David and therefore ready to go over to the adverse party because he had abused Bathsheba whom they take to have been his grand daughter because she was the daughter of Eliam 2 Sam xi 3 and Ahitho phel had a son of that name 2 Sam xxiii 34 for this reason they imagine that he advised Absalom to lie with his father s concubines that he might be repaid in kind though the Scripture assigns another viz that he and his father might thereby become irreconcileable enemies Pool s Annotations B J 2 Sam xv 37 II Whether this man had been a personal sufferer in the fall of Saul s family or what else had exasperated him against David it no where appears but it seems as if he had conceived some very heinous offence against him when neither the presence of a king nor the terror of hia guards could restrain him from throwing stones and bitter speeches at him And it looks as if the king were fallen into the utmost contempt when one private man could think of venting his malice at him in so gross a manner with impunity Howell s Hist in the notes B an 1064 249 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS bade him also to go out of the land as an impure and accursed wretch and he thanked God for depriving him of his kingdom and causing him to be punished for what injuries he had done to his master Saul and this by the means of his own son Now when they were all provoked against him and angry at him and particularly Abishai who had a mind to kill Shimei David restrained his anger Let us not said he bring upon ourselves another fresh misfortune to those we have already for truly I have not the least regard nor concern for this dog that raves at me I submit myself to God by whose permission this man treats me in such a wild manner Nor is it any wonder that I am obliged to undergo these abuses from him whde I experience the like from an impious son of my own But perhaps God will have some commiseration upon us if it be his will to overcome them So he went on his way without troubling himself with Shimei who ran along the other side of the mountain and threw out his abusive language plentifully But when David was come to Jordan he allowed those that were with him to refresh themselves for they were weary When Absalom and Ahithophel his coun sellor were come to Jerusalem with all the people David s friend Kushai came to them And when he had worshipped Absalom he withal wished that his kingdom might last a long time and continue for all ages but when Absalom said to him  How comes this that he who was so intimate a friend of my father s and appeared faithful to him in all things is not with him now but hath left him and is come over to me Hushai s answer was very pertinent for he said We ought to follow God and the multitude of the people while these therefore my lord and master are with thee it is fit that I should follow them For thou hast received the kingdom from God I will therefore if thou believest me to be thy friend shew the same fidelity and kindness to thee which thou know est 1 have shewn to thy father f Nor is there any reason to be in the least dissatisfied with the present state of affairs for the kingdom is not transferred into another but remains still in the same family by the son s receiving it after his father This speech Sersuaded Absalom who before suspected ushai And now he called Ahithophel and consulted with him what he ought to do He persuaded him to go in unto his father s con cubines for he said By this action the people will believe that thy difference with thy father is irreconcileable and will thence fight with great alacrity against thy father for hitherto they are afraid of taking up open enmity against him out of an expectation that you will be reconciled again Accordingly Absalom was prevailed on by this advice and commanded his servants to pitch him a tent upon the top of the royal palace in the sight of the multitude and he went in and lay with his father s concubines Now this came to pass according to the prediction ofJ Nathan when he prophesied and signified to him that his son would rise up in rebellion against him And when Absalom had done what he was advised to by Ahithophel he desired his advice in the second place about the war against his father Now Ahithophel only asked him to let him have ten thousand chosen men and he promised he would slay his father and bring the soldiers back again in safety and he said that the kingdom would be then firm to him when David was dead but not otherwise Absalom was  The words of David upon this occasion are So let him curse because the Lord hath said unto him Curse David Let him alone let him curse for the Lord hath bidden him not that God commanded it by his word for that severely forbids cursing Exod xxii 28 nor moved him to it by his Spirit for neither was that possible be cause God tempteth no man James i 13 But the meaning is that the secret providence of God did over rule and determine him so to do i e God did not put any wickedness into Shimei a heart for he had of himself an heart full of malignity and venom against David but only left him to his own wickedness took away that common prudence which would have restrained him from so dan gerous an action directed his malice that it should be exercised against David rather than any other man and brought him into so distressed a condition that he might seem a proper object of his scorn and contempt which is enough to justify the expression The Lord hath bidden him in the same manner that we read of his commanding the ravens 1 Kings xvii 4 and sometimes inanimate creatures Psal cxlvii 15 18 The short is David looked upon Shimei as an instrument in God s hands and therefore took all his abuses patiently out of a conscious ness of his sinfulness and a reverence to that Deity who had brought him so low as to deserve the insults of the vile Benjamite Pool s Annotations B t 2 Sam xvi 19 J 2 Sam xii 11 250 BOQIVfl ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS pleased at this advice and called for Hushai David s friend for so did he style him and informing him ot the opinion of Ahithophel he asked farther what was his opinion con cerning that matter now he was sensible that if Ahithophel s counsel was followed David would be in danger of being seized and slain So he attempted to introduce a contrary opinion and said Thou art not acquainted O king with the valour of thy father and of those that are now with him that he had made many wars and hath always come off victorious Though probably he now abides in the camp for he is very skilful in stratagems and in foreseeing the deceitful tricks of his enemies yet will he leave Lis own soldiers in the evening and will either hide himself in some valley or will place an ambush at some rock so that when our army joins battle with him his soldiers will retire for a little while but will come upon us again as encouraged by the king s being near them and in the mean time your father will 6hew himself suddenly in the time of the battle and will infuse courage into his own people when they are in danger but bring consternation to thine Consider therefore my advice and reason upon it and if tbou canst but acknowledge it to be the best reject the opinion of Ahithophel Send to the entire country of the Hebrews and order them to come to fight with thy father And do thou thyself take the army and be thine own general in this war and do not trust its management to another Then expect to conquer him with ease when thou overtakest him openly with his few partisans but hast thyself many ten thousands who will be de sirous to demonstrate their diligence and alacrity And if thy father shall shut himself up in some city and bear a siege we will overthrow that city by machines of war and by undermining it When Hushai had said this he obtained his point against Ahitho phel for his opinion was preferred by Ab salom before the others However it was no other than God who made the counsel of Hushai appear best to the mind of Absalom So Hushai hastened to the high priests Zadok and Abiathar and told them the opinion of Ahithophel and his own and that the resolution was taken to follow this latter advice He therefore bade them send to David and tell him of it and to inform him of the counsels that had been taken and to desire him to pass quickly over Jordan lest his son should change his mind and make haste to pursue him and to prevent him and seize upon him before he should be iu safety Now the high priests had their sons concealed in a proper place out of the city that they might carry news to David of what was transacted Accordingly they sent a maid servant whom they could trust to them to carry the news of Absalom s counsels and ordered them to signify the same to David with all speed So they made no delay but taking along with them their father s injunc tions became pious and faithful ministers and judging that quickness and alacrity was the best mark of faithful service they made haste to meet with David But certain horsemen saw them when they were two furlongs from the city and informed Absalom of them who immediately sent home to take them But when the sons of the high priest perceived this they turned out of the road to a village called Bahurim There they desired a certain woman to hide them and afford them security Accordingly she let the young men down by a rope into a well and laid fleeces of wool over them and when those that pursued them came to her and asked her whether she saw them she did not deny that she had seen them for that they stayed with her some time but she  This reflection of Josephus s that God brought to nought the dangerous counsel of Ahithophel and directly infatuated wicked Absalom to reject it which infatuation is what the Scripture styles the judicial hardening the hearts and blinding the eyes of men who by their former voluntary wickedness have justly deserved to be de stroyed and are thereby brought to destruction is a very just one Nor does Josephus ever puzzle himself or perplex his readers with subtle hypotheses as to the manner of such judicial infatuations hy God while the justice of them is generally so obvious That peculiar manner of the divine operations or permissions or the means God makes use of in such cases is often impene trable by us Secret things belong to the Lord our God but those things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of his law Deut xxix 29 Nor have all the subtiltietn of the moderns so far as I see given any considerable light in this and many other similar points of difficulty relating either to divine or human operations See also the Notes on V 1 and IX 4 an 1064 Â 1 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS said they then went their ways and she fore told that if they would follow them directly they would catch them But when after a long pursuit they could not catch them they came back again And when the woman saw those men were returned and that there was no longer any fear of the young men being caught by them she drew them up by the rope and bid them go on their journey Accordingly they used great diligence in the prosecution of that journey and came to David and informed him accurately of all the counsels of Absalom So he commanded those that were with him to pass over Jordan while it was night and not to delay at all on that account But Ahithophel on the rejection of his ad vice got upon his ass and rode away to his own country Gilon and calling his family together he told them distinctly what advice he had given Absalom and since he had not been persuaded by it he should certainly perish and this in no long time and that David would overcome him and return to his kingdom again So he said it was better that he should take his own life away with freedom and magnanimity than oppose him self to be punished by David in opposition to whom he had acted entirely for Absalom When he had discoursed thus to them he went into the innermost room of his house and hanged himself And this was the death of Ahithophel who was self condemned And when his relations had taken him down from the halter they took care of his funeral Now as for David he passed over Jordan as we have said already and came to Mahanaim a very fine and strong city and all the chief men of the country received him with great pleasure both out of the shame they had that he should be forced to flee away from Jerusalem and out of the respect they bare to him while he was in his former prosperity These were  2 Sam xvii 23 t The son of Ainmiel of Lodebar Hebrew and Sep tuagint J In 2 Sam xv 18 we read that All the Gittites six hundred men which came after him viz David from Gath passed on before the king but who these Gittites were it is hard to determine because we have no men tion made of them in any other part of Scripture Some imagine they were natives of Gath who taken with the fame of David s piety and happy success came along Barzillai the Gileadite Siphar the ruler among the Ammonites and Machirf the principal man of Gilead these furnished him with plentiful provisions for himself and his followers insomuch that they wanted no beds nor blankets for them nor loaves of bread nor wine Nay they bought them a great many cattle for slaughter and afforded them what furniture they wanted for their re freshment when they were weary and for food with plenty of other necessaries CHAP X of Absalom s defeat and death WHILST David and his adherents were in this situation Absalom got together a vast army of Hebrews to oppose his father and passed therewith over the river Jordan and sat down not far off Mahanaim in the country of Gilead He appointed Amasa to be captain of all his host instead of Joab his kinsman His father was Ithra and his mo ther Abigail Now she and Zeruiah the mo ther of Joab were David s sisters But when David had numbered his followers and found them to be about four thousand he resolved not to tarry till Absalom attacked him but set over his men captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and divided his army into three parts one part he committed to Joab the next to Abishai Joah s brother and the third to Ittai J David s companion and friend but one that came from the city Gath And when he was desirous of fighting himself among them his friends would not let him and their refusal was founded upon very wise reasons For said they  if we be conquered when he is

rather think that they were men of Jewish extract but had this additional name from their flying unto David probably under the conduct of Ittai while he was at Gath and accompanying him ever after not only in the time of Saul s persecution of him but even after his accession to the united kingdoms of Judah and Israel Patrick s Commentary B 3B  252 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS enemy will naturally suppose that he hath another army with him So David was pleased with this advice and resolved to tarry at Mahanaim And as he sent his friends and commanders to the battle he desired them to shew all possible alacrity and fidelity and to bear in mind what advantages they had received from him which though they had not been very great yet had they not been quite inconsiderable and he begged of them to spare the young man Absalom lest some mischief should befall himself if he should be killed And thus did lie send out his army to the battle and wished them victory therein Then did Joab put his army in array over against the enemy in the great plain where he had a wood behind him Absalom also brought his army into the field to oppose him Upon the joining of the battle both sides per formed great actions the one side exposing themselves to the greatest hazards and using their utmost alacrity that David might re cover his kingdom and the other being no way deficient either in doing or suffering that Absalom might not be deprived of that kingdom and to be brought to punishment by his father for his impudent attempt against him Those also that were the most nu merous were solicitous that they might not be conquered by those few that were with Joab and with the other commanders be cause that would be the greatest disgrace to them while David s soldiers strove greatly to overcome so many ten thousands as the enemy had with them Now David s men were conquerors as superior in strength and skill in war So they followed the others as they fled away through the forests and valleys and some they took prisoners and many they slew and more in the flight than in the battle f for there fell about twenty thousand that day But all David s men ran violently upon Absalom for he was easily known by his beauty and stature He was himself also afraid lest his enemies should seize him So he got upon the king s mule and fled But as he was carried along with violence and a great motion as he being himself light he entangled his hair in the large spreading bough of a knotty tree and there he hung after a surprising manner And as for the beast it went on swiftly as if his master had been still upon his back But he hanging in the air upon the boughs was left to his ene mies Now when one of David s soldiers saw this he informed Joab of it and when the general said that if he had shot at and killed Absalom he would have given him fifty shekels he replied  I would not have killed my master s son if thou wouldest have given me a thousand shekels especially when he desired that the young man might be spared in the hearing of us all But Joab made him shew him where it was that he saw Ab salom hang Whereupon he shot him to the heart and slew him J and Joab s armour bearers stood round about the tree and pulled down his dead body and cast it into a great chasm that was out of sight and laid a heap of stones upon him till the cavity was filled up and had the appearance of a grave  2 Sam xviii 5 t The expression in the text is The wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured 2 Sam xviii 8 which some think was occasioned by their falling into pits pressing one another to death in strait places creeping into lurking holes and there being starved to death or otherwise devoured by wild beasts which met them in their flight But the most easy and simple meaning of the passage is that there were more slain in the wood than in the field of battle The field of battle was a plain with a wood contiguous to it and therefore when Absalom s army was put to the rout and betook themselves to the wood for refuge their pursuers made a greater slaughter of them there than they otherwise would have done because they could not run away so fast in the wood as they might have done in the open field Patrick s Commentary B  2 Sam xviii 14 II In the description of the Holy Land some geogra phers tell us that this heap of stones remained even to their days and that all travellers as they passed by it were wont to throw a stone to add to the heap in detesta tion of his rebellion against his father For though it be came a custom among the Greeks to raise a heap of stones in the place where any great person was interred as a monument of honour and respect yet it is plain that none of David s army intended any honour to Absalom s memory in accumulating stones upon him nor can we think that David himself though too fond of this rebel son made any alteration afterwards in the form of his burial for fear of enraging the people against him Some however are of a quite contrary opinion viz that David who lamented him with such excess removed him from this pit in order to have him laid in the sepulchre be longing to the kings or perhaps somewhere about the place where the monument which goes under his name and even to this day is shewn to travellers was dug in a rock It is a litUe chamber wrought with a chisel out of one piece of rock which stands at some distance from the rest of the mountain and is a square of eight paces from an 1064 253 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Then Joab sounded a retreat and recalled his soldiers from pursuing the enemy s army in order to spare their countrymen Now Absalom had erected for himself a marble pillar in the king s dale two furlongs distant from Jerusalem which he named Ab salom s Hand saying that if his children were killed his name would remain by that pillar For he had three sons and one daughter named Tamar as we said before who when she was married to David s grand son Rehoboam bare a son f Abijah by name who succeeded his father in the kingdom But of these we will speak in a part of our history which will be more proper But after the death of Absalom they every one returned home Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok the high priest went to Joab and desired he would permit him to go and tell David of this vic tory and to carry him the good news that God had afforded his assistance and his pro vidence to him However he did not grant this request but said to him Wilt thou that hast always been the messenger of good news now go and acquaint the king that his son is dead so he desired him to desist He then called Cushi and committed the business to him that he should tell the king what he had seen But when Ahimaaz again desired to let him go as a messenger and as sured him that he would only relate what concerned the victory but not concerning the death of Absalom he gave him leave to go to David Now he took a nearer road than the former did for nobody knew it but himself and he came before Cushi Now as David was sitting between the gates J and waiting to see when somebody would come to him from the battle one of the watchmen saw Ahimaaz running and before he could discern who he was he told David that he saw somebody coming to him who said he was a good messenger A little while after he informed him that another messenger fol lowed him Whereupon the king said that he was also a good messenger But when the watchman saw Ahimaaz and that he was already very near he gave the king notice that it was the son of Zadok the high priest who came running So David was very glad and said he was a messenger of good tidings and brought him such news from the battle as he desired to hear While the king was saying thus Ahimaaz appeared and worshipped the king And when the king inquired about the battle he said he brought him the good news of victory and dominion And when he had inquired what he had to say concerning his son he said that he came away on the sudden as soon as the enemy was defeated but that he heard a great noise of those that pursued Absalom and that he could learn no more because of the haste he made when Joab sent him to inform him of the victory But when Cushi was come and had wor shipped him and informed him of the victory he asked him about his son who replied May the like misfortune befall thine ene mies as hath befallen Absalom That word did not permit either himself or his soldiers to rejoice for the victory though it was very great but David went up to the highest part of the city and wept for his son and beat his breast tearing the hair off his head and out to out The inside of this chamber is all plain but the outside is adorned with some pilasters of the same kind of stone The upper part or covering is made in the form of a conic pyramid pretty high and large with a kind of flower pot on its top The pyramid is composed of several stones but the monument itself is square and all cut out of one block In the time of Josephus the monument which was said to be Absalom s was nothing more than one marble pillar widely different from what at present goes under his name and which therefore must be accounted a more modern building Le Gere s and Patrick s Commentaries and Calmet s Dictionary under the word Absalom B  Commentators have observed the justice of God in bringing Absalom to a condign punishment and such a kind of death as was ordained by the law for offences like unto his For whereas in the first place he was hanged as it were this was declared by the law to be an accursed death Deut xxi 23 and was afterwards in some mea sure stoned this was the particular kind of death that the law prescribed for a stubborn and rebellious son Deut xxi B t 2 Chron xi 20 J Those that take a view of my description of the gates of the temple will not be surprised at this account of David s throne both here and 2 Sam xviii 24 that it was between two gates or portals Gates being in cities as well as at the temple large open places with a portal at the entrance and another at the exit between which judicial causes were heard and public consultations held as it is well known from several places of Scripture 2 Chron xxxi 2 Psal ix 14 exxvii 5 Prov i 2J viii 3 34 xxxii 23 and often elsewhere II Since David was now in Mahanaim and in the open 3B2 254 book tu ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW tormenting himself and crying out O my son I wish that I had died myself and ended my days with thee for he was of a tender natural affection and had extraordinary compassion for this son in particular But when the army and Joab heard that the king mourned for his son they were ashamed to enter into the city in the habit of conquerors but they all came in as cast down and in tears as if they had been defeated Now while the king covered himself and griev ously lamented his son Joab went to him and comforted him and said O my lord the king thou art not aware that thou layest a blot on thyself by what thou now doest for thou seemest to hate those that love thee and undergo dangers for thee nay to hate thyself and thy family and to love those that are thy bitter enemies and to desire the company of those who have been justly slain For had Absalom obtained the victory and firmly settled himself in the kingdom there had been none of us left alive but all of us beginning with thyself and thy children had miserably perished while our enemies had not wept for us but rejoiced over us and punished even those that lamented our mis fortunes And thou art not ashamed to do this in the case of one that has been thy bitter enemy who while he was thine own son hath proved so wicked to thee Leave off therefore thy unreasonable grief and come abroad to thy soldiers and return them thanks for the alacrity they shewed in the flight For I myself will this day per suade the people to leave thee and to give the kingdom to another if thou continuest to do thus and then I shall make thee grieve bitterly and in earnest Joab s speaking thus made the king leave off his sorrow and brought him to the consideration of his af fairs So he changed his habit and exposed himself in a manner fit to be seen by the mul titude and sat at the gates Whereupon all the people heard of it and ran togethert and saluted him CHAP XI OF DAVID S REINSTATEMENT IN THE KINGDOM HIS RECO N CIUATION WITH SHIMEI AND ZIBA AND HIS AFFECTION TO BARZILLA1 THE REBELLION AND DEATH OF SHEBA T TOW those Hebrews that had been with _ _ Absalom and had retired out of the battle when they were all returned home sent messengers to every city to put them in mind of what benefits David had bestowed upon them and of that liberty which he had procured them by delivering them from many and great wars But they complained that whereas they had ejected him out of his kingdom and committed it to another governor who was already dead they did not now beseech David to leave off his anger at them and to become friends with them and as he used formerly to do to resume the care of their affairs and to take the king dom again This was often told to David and this notwithstanding David sent to Za dok and Abiathar the high priest that they should speak to the rulers of the tribe of Judah after the following manner that it would be a reproach upon them to permit the other tribes to choose David for their king before their tribe and this while they were akin to him and of the same common blood He commanded them also to say to Amasa the captain of their forces that whereas he was his sister s son he had not persuaded the multitude to restore the king dom to David That he might expect from him not only a reconciliation for that was already granted but that supreme command of the army also which Absalom had be stowed upon him Accordingly the high priests when they had discoursed with the rulers of this tribe and said what the king had ordered them persuaded Amasa to undertake the care of his affairs So he persuaded that tribe to send ambassadors immediately to beseech him to return to his own kingdom The same did all the Israelites at the like persuasion of Amasa place of that city gate which seems still to have been built the highest of any part of the wall and since our other copies say he went to the chamber over the gate 2 Sam xviii 33 I think we ought to correct our pre sent reading of Josephus and for city should read gate i e instead of the highest part of the city should say the highest part of the gate Accordingly we find David presently in Josephus as well as in our other copies 8 Sam six 8 sitting as before in the gate of this city  2 Sam xix 2 3 t 2 Sam xix 8 AW 255 1064 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When the ambassadors came to David he went to Jerusalem and the tribe of Judah was the first that came to meet him at the river Jordan and Shimei the son of Gera came with a thousand men which he brought with him out of the tribe of Benjamin and Ziba the freed man of Saul with his sons fifteen in number and with his twenty ser vants All these as well as the tribe of Ju dah laid a bridge of boats over the river that the king and those that were with him might with ease pass over it Now as soon as he was come to Jordan the tribe of Judah saluted him Shimei also came upon the bridge and took hold of his feet and prayed him to forgive him what he had offended and not to be too bitter against him nor to think fit to make him the first example of severity under his new authority but to consider that he had repented of his failure of duty and had taken care to come first of all to him While he was thus intreating the king and moving him to compassion Abishai Joab s brother said Shall not this man die for that he hath cursed the king whom God hath appointed to reign over us But David turned himself and said Will ye never leave off ye sons of Zeruiah Do not 1 pray raise new troubles and sedi tions among us now the former are over for I would not have you ignorant that I this day begin my reign and therefore swear to remit to all offenders their punishments and not to animadvert on any one that has sin ned Be thou therefore O Shimei of good courage and do not at all fear being put to death f So he worshipped him and went on before him Mephibosheth also Saul s grandson met David clothed in a mean garment and having his hair thick and neglected for after David was fled away he was in such grief that he had not polled his head nor had he washed his clothes as dooming himself to undergo such hardships upon occasion of the change of the king s affairs Now he had been unjustly calumniated to the king by Ziba his steward When he had saluted the king and worshipped him the king began to ask him why he did not go out of Jerusalem with him and accompany him during his flight He replied that this piece of injustice was owing to Ziba be cause when he was ordered to get things ready for his going out with him he took no care of it but regarded him no more than if he had been a slave And indeed said he had I had my feet sound and strong I had not deserted thee for I could then have made use of them in my flight But this is not all the injury that Ziba has done me as to my duty to thee my lord and master but he hath calumniated me besides and told lies about me of his own invention But I know thy mind will not admit of such calumnies but is righteously disposed and a lover of truth which it is also the will of God should prevail For when thou wast in the greatest danger of suffering by my grand father and when on that account our whole family might justly have been destroyed thou wast moderate and merciful and didst then especially forget all those injuries when if thou hadst remembered them thou hadst the power of punishing us for them But thou hast judged me to be thy friend and hast set me every day at thine own table nor have I wanted any thing which one of thine own kinsmen of greatest esteem with thee could have expected When he had said this David resolved neither Jjto punish Me phibosheth nor to condemn Ziba as having  2 Sam xix 15 t 2 Sam xix 23 J The words in the text are that He had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day that the king departed 2 Sam xix 24 These were some of the instances wherein the Jews were wont to express their mourning and they are here men tioned by the historian as evidence of the falsehood of Ziba s information against his master since no one who nesdected himself to this degree could be supposed am bitious of a crown Not dressing his feet may signify either not cutting his toe nails or his not washing his feet which the Jews were accustomed very frequently to do because of the bad smell which was natural to them as well as the Arabians and some other nations and therefore his omission of this could not but make him offensive to himself Not trimming his beard was letting its hair grow negligently and without any order For the manner of the Jews was to cut the hair from the lip upwards and what grew likewise on the cheek but what was on the chin and so backwards to the ear that they suffered to grow and not washing his clothes must denote his putting on no clean linen but wearing the same shirt all the while Calmef s and Patrick s Commentaries B II By David s disposal of half Mephibosheth s estate to Ziba one would imagine that he was still dissatisfied and doubtful whether Mephibosheth s story were entirely true Nor does David now invite him to diet with him 256 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS belied his master but said to him that as he had before granted all his estate to Ziba because he did not come along with him so he now promised to forgive him and ordered that the one half of his estate should be re stored to him Whereupon Mephibosheth said Nay let Ziba take all it suffices me that thou hast recovered thy kingdom But David desired Barzillai the Gileadite that great and good man and one that had made a plentiful provision for him at Maha naim and had conducted him as far as Jor dan to accompany him to Jerusalem for he promised that he would treat him in his old age with all manner of respect and would take care of and provide for him But Bar zillai was so desirous to live at home that he intreated him to excuse him from attendance on him and said that his age was too great to enjoy the pleasures of a court since he was fourscore years old and was making provi sion for his death and burial So he desired him to gratify him with this request and dis miss him for that he had no relish of his meat or his drink by reason of his age and that his ears were too much shut up to hear the melody of musical instruments such as all those that live with kings delight in When he intreated for this so earnestly the king said I dismiss thee but thou shalt grant me thy son Chimham and upon him will I be stow all sorts of good things So Barzillai left his son with him and worshipped the king and wished him a prosperous conclusion of all his affairs according to his own mind and then returned home But David came to Gilgal having about him half the people  of Israel and the whole tribe of Judah Now the principal men of the country came to Gilgal to David with a great multitude and complained of the tribe of Judah that they had come to him in a private manner whereas they ought all conjointly and with one and the same intention to have given him the meeting But the rulers of the tribe of Judah desired them not to be displeased if they had been prevented by them â For said they we are David s kinsmen and on that account we the rather took care of him and loved him and so came first to him yet have we not by our early coming received any gifts from him which might give you who came last any uneasiness When the rulers of the tribe of Judah had said this the rulers of the other tribes were not satisfied but said farther O brethren we cannot but wonder at you when you call the king your kinsman alone whereas he that hath received from God the power over all of us in common ought to be esteemed a kinsman to us all for which reason the whole people have elevent parts in him and you but one part We also are elder than you J Wherefore you have not done justly in coming to the king in this private and concealed manner While the rulers were thus disputing a certain wicked man named Sheba the son of Bichri of the tribe of Benjamin stood in the midst of the multitude and cried aloud We have no part in David nor inheritance in the son of Jesse And when he had used these words he blew a trumpet and declared war against the king And they all left David except the tribe of Judah who staid with him and settled him in his royal palace at Jerusalem But as for his concubines with whom his son Absalom had accompanied he removed them to another house and ordered those that had the care of them to make a plentiful provision for them but he came not near them any more He also appointed Amasa for the captain of his forces and gave him the same high office which Joab before had and he commanded him to gather to gether out of the tribe of Judah as great an army as he could and to come to him within as he did before but only forgives him if he had been at all guilty Nor is this odd way of mourning that Me phibosheth made use of here and 2 Sam six 24 wholly free from suspicion and hypocrisy If Ziba neglected or refused to bring Mephibosheth an ass of his own on which he might ride to David it is hard to suppose that so great a man as he was should not be able to procure some other beast for the same purpose  2 Sam xix 30 t I clearly prefer Josephus s reading here when it supposes eleven tribes including Benjamin to be on one side and the tribe of Judah alone on the other since Benjamin in general had been still fonder of the house of Saul and less firm to David hitherto than any of the rest and so cannot be supposed to be joined with Judah at this time to make it double especially when the fol lowing rebellion was headed by a Benjamite See 2 Sam xx 2â 4 J Reubel Simeon and Levi were elder than Judah Gen xxix 32â 35  2 Sam xx 2 an 1064 257 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS three days that he might deliver to him his entire army and might send him to fight against Sheba the son of Bichri Now while Amasa was gone out and made some delay in gathering the army together and so was not yet returned on the third day the king said to Joab It is not fit we should make any delay in this affair of Sheba lest he get a numerous army about him and be the occasion of greater mischief and hurt our affairs more than did Absalom himself Do not thou therefore wait any longer but take such forces as thou hast at hand and that old fbody of six hundred men and thy brother Abishai with thee and pursue after our enemy and endeavour to fight him wheresoever thou canst overtake him Make haste to prevent him lest he seize upon some fenced cities and cause us great labour and pains before we take him So Joab resolved to make no delay but taking with him his brother and those six hundred men and giving orders that the rest of the army which was at Jerusalem should follow him he marched with great speed against Sheba And when he was come to Gibeon which is a village forty furlongs dis tant from Jerusalem Amasa brought a great army with him and met Joab Now Joab was girded with a sword and had his breast plate on and when Amasa came near him to salute him he took particular care that his sword should fall out as it were of its own accord So he took it up from the ground and while he approached Amasa who was then near him as though he would kiss him he took hold of Amasa s beard with his other hand smote him in his belly when he did not foresee it and slew him This impious and altogether profane action JoabÂ did to a good young man and his kinsman and one that had done him no injury and this out of jealousy that he would obtain the chief command of the army and be equal in dignity with him self about the king And for the same cause it was that he killed Abner But as to that former wicked action the death of his brother Asahel which he seemed to revenge afforded him a decent pretence and made that crime a pardonable one but in this murder of Amasa there was no such covering for it Now when Joab had killed this general he pursued after Sheba having left the dead body in the care of a person who was ordered to proclaim aloud to the army that Amasa was justly slain and deservedly punished â But said he if you be for the king fol low Joab his general and Abishai Joab s brother But because the body lay in the road and all the multitude came running to it and as is usual with the multitude stood wondering a great while at it he that guarded it removed it thence and carried it to a certain place that was very remote from the road and there laid it and covered it with his garment When this was done all the people followed Joab Now as he pur sued Sheba through all the country of Israel one told him that he was in a strong city called Abel bethmaachah Hereupon Joab went thither and set about it with his army and cast up a bank round it arid ordered the soldiers to undermine the walls and to over throw them And since the people of the city did not admit him he was greatly dis pleased at them Now there was a woman of small account and yet both wise and intelligent who seeing  Abishai 2 Sam xx 6 But I prefer Josephus s copy t Cherethites and Pelethites Heb and Septuagint 2 Sam xx 7 J It was an ancient custom among the Grecians to take the person to whom they had any address to make by the dim or beard Antiquis Graeciae in supplicando mentem attingere moverat says Pliny lib II c 45 and even to this day the Turks in their salutations do very frequently take one another by the beard vide Theve not s Travels c 22 The Arabians have a great regard to the beard The wives kiss their husbands

Father or Bii Brother as the author of the Voyage to the East Indies relates Vide Peter de Falles s Travels B II 2 Sam xx 10 Â So insolent was Joab become upon the presumption that David durst not punish him that as he ventured upon the bloody fact so he imagined that though the sieht of Amasa s dead body might stop the march of those that came by it yet upon its being given out that he was again become their general their love for him was such that they would not scruple to follow him Patrick s Commentary B  It seems not unlikely that this woman was a go 258 BOOK VJI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS her native city lying at the last extremity ascended upon the wall and by means of the armed men called for Joab and when he came to her she said God ordained kings and generals of armies that they might cut off the enemies of the Hebrews and introduce an universal peace among them but thou art endeavouring to overthrow and depopulate a city of the Israelites which hath been guilty of no offence But he replied God con tinue to be merciful unto me I am disposed to avoid killing any one of the people much less would I destroy such a city as this and if they will deliver me up Sheba the son of Bichri who hath rebelled against the king I will raise the siege and withdraw my army from the place Now as soon as the woman heard what Joab said she desired him to intermit the siege a little while for that he should have the head of his enemy thrown out to him presently So she went down to the citizens and said to them Will you be so wicked as to perish miserably with your children and wives for the sake of a vile fel low and one whom nobody knows And will you have him for your king instead of David who has been so great a benefactor to you and oppose your city alone to such a mighty and strong army So she prevailed with them and they cut off the head of Sheba and threw it into Joab s army When this was done the king s general sounded a retreat and raised the siege And when he was come to Jerusalem he was again appointed to be general of all the people The king also constituted Benaiah captain of the guards and of the six hundred men and set Adoiam over the tribute and Sabathes and Achilaus over the records He also made Sheva die scribe and appointed Zadok and Abiathar to be the high priests CHAP XII OF THE DELIVERANCE OF THE HEBREWS FROH A FAMINE WHEN THE GIBEONITES HAD CAUSED PUNISHMENT TO BE INFLICTED FOR THOSE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN SLAIN AND OF THE GREAT ACTIONS l ERFORMED AGAINST THK PHILISTINES BY DAVID AND HIS ADHERENTS AFTER this J when the country was greatly afflicted with a famine David besought God to have mercy on the people and to discover to him what was the cause of it and how a remedy might be found for that distemper The prophetsÂ answered that God would have the Gibeonites avenged whom Saul was so wicked as to betray to slaughter and had not observed the oath which Joshua the general and the senate had sworn to them and that if the king would permit such vengeance to be taken for those that were slain as the Gibeonites should desire God would be reconciled to them and free the multitude from their mise ries As soon therefore as David understood this he sent for the Gibeonites and asked verness in this city for though that office was most com monly occupied by men yet there want not instances of women as in the case of Deborah Judg iv 4 and Queen Athaiiah 2 Kings xi who have been employed in the administration of civil affairs If she was invested with any such authority she was the properest person to de sire a parley with the general and good reason she had to desire it because she knew the present temper and fear of the citizens and soldiers viz that considering the imminent danger they were in they were generally de sirous of peace and restrained from it only by Sheba s power and authority Pool s Annotations In the be ginning of this woman s speech to Joab there is some thing that seems both abrupt and obscure They were wont to speak in old time saying They should surely ask counsel at Abel and so they ended the matter 2 Sam xx 18 according to this translation the sense of the word is â This city which thou art about to destroy is no mean and contemptible one but so honourable and considerable for its wisdom and the wise people in it that when any difference did arise among any of the neighbouring places they used proverbially to say We will ask the opinion and advice of the men of Abel about it and we will stand to their arbitration and so all parties were satisfied and disputes ended So that her words according to this sense are a high commendation of the city of Abel for its being a place time out of mind very eminent for the wisdom and prudence of its inhabit ants But there is another translation in the margin ol our Bible which seems to be more natural and makes the woman speak in this manner â M When the people saw thee lay siege to the city they said Surely he will ask if we will have peace for the law prescribes that he should offer peace to strangers much more then to Ismelitish cities and if he would once do this we should soon bring things to an amicable agreement for we are peaceable people and faithful to our prince So that according to this interpretation the woman both modestly reproved Joab for the neglect of his duty and artfully engaged him in the performance of it Patrick s Com mentary and Pool s Annotations B  2 Sam xx 22 t Cherethites and Pelethites 2 Sam xx 23 I Jehoshaphat the son of Aliud Heb and Septuagint 2 Sam xx 24

recover the earth to bring forth its fruits as usual and to free it from the drought so that the country of the He brews flourished again A little afterward the king made war against the Philistines and when he had joined battle with them and put them to flight he was left alone as he was in pursuit of them and when he was quite tired down he was seen by one of the enemy his name was fAchmon the son of Araph and of the sons of the giants He had a spear the handle of which weighed three hundred shekels a breast plate of chain work and a sword He turned back and ran violently to slay David their enemy s king for he was quite tired out with labour But Abishai Joab s brother appeared at this juncture and protected the king with his shield as he lay down and slew the enemy Now the multitude was very uneasy at these dangers of the king and that he was very near to be slain And the rulers made him swear that he would no more go out with them to battle lest he should come to some great misfortune by his courage and boldness and thereby deprive the people of the bene fits they now enjoyed by his means and of those that they might hereafter enjoy by his living among them When the king heard that the Philistines were assembled atJ the city Gazara he sent an army against them when Sibbechai the Hittite one of David s most courageous men behaved himself so as to deserve great com mendation for he slew many of those that boasted they were the posterity of the giants and vaunted themselves highly on that ac count and he thereby was the occasion of victory to the Hebrews After this the Phi listines made war again and when David had sent an army against them Nephan his kinsman fought in a single combat with the stoutest of all the Philistines and slew him and put the rest to flight many of them also were slain in the battle Now a little while afterward the Philistines pitched their camp at a city which lay not far off the bounds of the country of the Hebrews They had a man who was six cubits high and had on each of his feet and hands one more toe and finger than men naturally have Now the person who was sent against them by David out of his army was Jonathan the son of Shimea who fought this man in single combat and slew him and as he was the person who gave the turn to the battle he gained the greatest reputation for courage therein This man also vaunted himself to be of the giants But after this fight the Philistines made war no more against the Israelites And now David being freed from wars and dangers and enjoying a profound peace composed songs and hymns to God of severa sorts of metre some of those which he made were trimeters and some were pentameters  Those probably who had been most active in the slaughter of the Gibeonites t Ishby the son of Ob 2 Sam xxi 16  About an 1059 This shews that in the opinion of Josephus David composed the Book of Psalms not at several times be fore as their present inscriptions frequently imply but generally at the latter end of his life or after his wars were over Nor does Josephus nor the authors of the known books of the Old and New Testaments nor the Apostolical Constitutions seem to have ascribed any of them to any other author than to David himself How ever he must observe here that as Josephus says Antiq H 16 that the song at the Red Sea Exod xv 1â 21 was composed by Moses in the hexameter tune or metre as also Antiq IV 8 that the song of Moses Deut xxxii 1â 43 was an hexameter poem so does he say that the Psalms of David were of various kinds of metre and VOL I â NOS 21  22 particularly that they contained trimeters and pentame ters Antiq VII 12 all which implies that he thought these Hebrew poems might be best described to the Greeks and Romans under those names and characters of Hexameters Trimeters and Pentameters Now it ap pears that the instruments of music that were originally used by the command of king David and Solomon and were carried to Babylon at the captivity of the two tribes were brought back after that captivity as also that the singers and musicians who survived that cap tivity came back with those instruments Ezra ii 41 vii 24 Nehem vii 44 Joseph Antiq XI 3 4 5 and that this music and these instruments at the temple could not but be well known to Josephus a priest belonging to that temple who accordingly gives us a short description of three of the instruments Antiq VII 12 and gives us a distinct account that such psalms and hymns were sung in his days at that temple Antiq XX 9 So that 3C 260 BOOK YÂ ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he also made instruments of music and taught the Levites to sing hymns to God both on the Sabbath day and on the other festivals Now the construction of the instruments was thus the viol was an instrument of ten strings played upon with a bow The psaltery had twelve musical notes and was played upon by the fingers The cymbals were broad and large instruments and were made of brass And so much shall suffice respecting these instruments that the readers may not be wholly unacquainted with their nature Now all the men that were about David were men of courage Those that were most illustrious and famous of them for their ac tions were thirty eight Of five of whom I will only relate the performances For these will suffice to make manifest the virtues of the others also for these were powerful enough to subdue countries and conquer great na tions First therefore was Jessai the son of Achimaas who frequently leaped upon the troops of the enemy and did not leave off fighting till he overthrew fnine hundred of them After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo who was with the king at Arasam this man when once the Israelites were under a consternation at the multitude of the Phi listines and were running away stood alone and fell upon the enemy and slew many of them till his sword clung to his hand by the blood he had shed and till the Israelites seeing the Philistines retire by his means came down from the mountains and pursued them and at that time won a surprising victory while Eleazar slew the men and the multitude followed and spoiled the dead bodies The third was Sheba the son of Ilus Now this man when in the wars against the Philistines they pitched their camp at a place called JLehi and when the Hebrews were again afraid of their army Josephus s authority is beyond exception in these matters Nor can any hypotheses of the moderns that do not agree with Josephus s characters be justly supposed the true metre of the ancient Hebrews Nor is there I think any other original authority now extant to be opposed to these testimonies before us That the ancient music of the Hebrews was very complete also and had in it great variety of tunes is evident by the number of their mu sical instruments and by the testimony of another most authentic witness Jesus the son of Sirach Ecclus i 18 who says that at the temple in bis days the singers sang and did not stay he stood alone as an army and a body of men And some of them he overthrew and some who were not able to abide his strength and force he pursued These are the works of the hands and of fighting which these three performed Now at the time when the king was once at Jerusalem and the army of the Philistines came upon him to fight him David went up to the top of the citadel as we have already said to inquire of God concerning the battle while the enemy s camp lay in the valley that extends to the city Bethlehem which is Ijtwenty furlongs distant from Jerusalem Now David said to his companions We have excellent water in my own city espe cially that which is in the pit near the gate wondering if any one would bring him some of it to drink but he said that he had rather have it than a great deal of money When these three men heard what he said they ran away immediately and burst through the midst of their enemies camp and came to Bethlehem and when they had drawn the water they returned again through the ene mies camp to the king insomuch that the Philistines were so surprised at their boldness and alacrity that they were quiet and did no thing against them as if they despised their small number But when the water was brought to the king he would not drink it saying that it was brought by the danger and blood of men and that it was not proper on that account to drink it but he poured it out to God and gave him thanks for the salvation of the men Next to these was Abishai Joab s brother who in one day slew Â six hundred The fifth was Benaiah by lineage a priest for being challenged by two eminent men in the country of Moab he overcame them by his valour Moreover there was an Egyptian who was of a vast bulk and challenged him yet did he when praises with their voice with great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody  Thirty seven Heb and Septuagint t Eight hundred 2 Sam xxiii 8 J See the note on V 8 II Bethlehem is here said to be but twenty furlongs from Jerusalem whereas it is well known to be about forty eight This must be an error of the copies not of Josephus himself who must have known that distance too well to err above one half in its measure Â Three hundred Heb and Septuagint AN 261 1059 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he was unarmed kill him with his own spear which he threw at him for he caught him by force and took away his weapons while he was alive and fighting and slew him with his own weapons One may also add this to the aforemen tioned actions of the same man either as the principal of them in alacrity or as resem bling the rest When God sent a snow a lion slipped and fell into a certain pit and because the pit s mouth was narrow it was evident he would perish being inclosed with the snow So when he saw no way to get out and save himself he roared When Be naiah heard the wild beast he went towards him and coming at the noise he made he went down into the mouth of the pit and smote him as he struggled with a stake that lay there and immediately slew him The other thirty three were also like these in valour   f s CHAP XIII OF THE ENUMERATION OF THE PEOPLE BY DAVID S COM MAND AND THE SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS OF THE DIVINE DISPLEASURE NOWf king David was desirous to know how many ten thousands there were of the people but J forgot the command of Moses who told them beforehand that if the multitude were numbered they should pay half a shekel to God for every head Accord ingly the king commanded Joab the captain of his host to go and number the whole mul titude But when he said there was no ne cessity for such a numeration he was not persuaded to countermand it but enjoined him to make no delay but to go about the numbering of the Hebrews immediately So Joab took with him the heads of the tribes and the scribes and went over the country of the Israelites and took notice how nu merous the multitude were and returned to Jerusalem to the king after nine months and twenty days And he gave in to the king the number of the people without the tribe of Benjamin for he had not yet numbered that tribe nor the tribe of Levi for the king re pented of his having sinned against God Now the number of the rest of the Israelites was nine hundred thousand men who were able to bear arms and go to war But the tribe of Judah by itself was four hundred thousand Â Now when the prophets had signified to David that God was angry at him he began to intreat he would be merciful to him and forgive his sin But God sent Nathan the prophet to propose to him the choice of three things Whether he would have famine come upon the country for seven years or would have a war and be subdued three months by his enemies or whether God should send a pestilence and a distemper upon the Hebrews for three days But as he was fallen to a fatal choice of great mise ries he was in trouble and sorely confounded And when the prophet had said that he must of necessity make this choice and had  2 Sam xxiii 20 t About an 1058 J The words of God by Moses Exod xxx 12 suffi ciently justify the reason here given by Josephus for the great plague mentioned in this chapter When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord when thou numberest them that there be no plague amongst them when thou numberest them Nor indeed could David s or the Sanhedrim s neglect of exe cuting this law at this enumeration excuse the people who ought still to have brought their bounden oblation of half a shekel a piece with them when they came to be numbered And I am inclinable to suppose that the great reason why nations art so constantly punished by and with wicked kings and governors is this that they almost con stantly comply with them in their neglect of or disobe dience to the divine laws and suffer those divine laws to go into disuse or contempt in order to please those wicked ikings and governors and that they submit to several wicked political laws and commands of those kings and governors instead of the righteous laws of God which all mankind ought ever to obey let their kings and governors say what they please to the contrary this preference of human before divine laws seeming to me the principal character of idolatrous or antichristian nations Accord ingly Josephus well observes IV 8 that it was the duty of the people of Israel to take care that their kings when they should have them did not exceed their proper limits of power and prove ungovernable by the laws of God which would certainly be a most pernicious thing to their divine settlement Nor do I think that negligence pe culiar to the Jews those nations which are called Chris tian are sometimes indeed very solicitous to restrain their kings and governors from breaking the human laws of their several kingdoms but without the like care for re straining them from breaking the laws of God Whe ther it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto men more than to God judge ye Acts iv 19 We ought to obey God rather than men v 29 II Eight hundred thousand 2 Sam xxiv 9 Â Five hundred thousand 3C2 262 OOOT ftl ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ordered him to answer quickly that he might declare what he had chosen to God the king reasoned with himself that in case he should ask for famine he would appear to do it for others and without danger to himself since he had a great deal of corn hoarded up that in case he should choose to be overcome by his enemies for three months he would appear to have chosen war because he had valiant men and strong holds and that therefore he feared nothing there from so he chose that affliction which is common to kings and to their subjects and in which the fear was equal on all sides and said that it was much better to fall into the hands of God than into those of his enemies When the prophet had heard this he de clared it to God who thereupon sent a pes tilence and a mortality upon the Hebrews Now the miserable disease was one indeed but it carried them off by ten thousand causes and occasions which those that were afflicted could not understand for one died upon the neck of another and the terrible malady seized them before they were aware and brought them to their end suddenly Some gave up the ghost immediately with very great pains and bitter grief and some were worn away by their distempers and had nothing remaining to be buried but as soon as ever they fell were entirely macerated some were choked and greatly lamented their case as being also stricken with a sudden darkness and some there were who as they were burying a relation fell down dead without finishing the rites of the funeral Now there perished of this disease which began with the morning and lasted till the hour of dinner seventy thousand f Nay the angel stretched out his hand over Jerusalem as sending this terrible judgment upon it But David had put on sackcloth and lay upon the ground intreating God and begging that the distemper might now cease and that he would be satisfied with those that  Whence Josephus took these distinct and melancholy accounts of the particular symptoms and miserable methods of dying in this terrible pestilence we cannot now tell our other copies affording us no such account t 2 Sam xxiv 15 t Six hundred shekels of gold 1 Chron xxi 26 11 The mountain of the house or mount Moriah by Mr Maundrell s measures page 105 was about five hun dred and seventy one cubits wide and about nine hun had already perished And when the king looked up into the air and saw the angel carried along thereby unto Jerusalem with his sword drawn he said to God that he might justly be punished who was their shepherd but that the sheep ought to be preserved as not having sinned at all and he implored God that he would send his wrath upon him and upon all his family but spare the people When God heard his supplication he caused the pestilence to cease and sent Gad the prophet to him and commanded him to go up immediately to the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite and build an altar there to God and offer sacrifices When David heard that he did not neglect his duty but made haste to the place appointed him Now Araunah was threshing wheat and when he saw the king and all his servants coming to him he ran to him and worshipped him He was by his lineage a Jebusite but a particular friend of David s and for that cause it was that when he overthrew the city he did him no harm as we have already in formed the reader Now Araunah inquired Wherefore is my lord come to his servant He answered to buy of him the threshing floor that he might therein build an altar to God and offer a sacrifice Araunah replied that he freely gave him both the threshing floor and the ploughs and the oxen for a burnt offering and he besought God gra ciously to accept his sacrifice The king said that he took his generosity and magna nimity kindly and accepted his good will but he desired him to take the price of them all for that it was not just to offer a sacrifice that cost nothing And When Araunah said he might do as he pleased he bought the threshing floorJ for nfty shekels And when he had built an altar he performed divine service and brought a burnt offering and offered peace offerings With these God was pacified and became gracious to them again dred and eighty cubits long thirty five acres which if it all belonged to Araunah might well be worth those six hundred shekels of gold or 1251 which we have 1 Chron xxi 25 and a small part of it with the oxen and instru ments would be much more worth than those fifty shekels of silver 5l 18s which we have 2 Sam xxiv 24 and here So that the larger number in the Chronicles is in all probability the true number aN 1058 263 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now it happened that Abraham came and offered his eon Isaac for a burnt offering at that very place and when the youth was ready to have his throat cut a ram appeared on a sudden standing by the altar which Abraham sacrificed in the stead of his son as we have before related Now when king David saw that God had heard his prayer and had graciously accepted of his sacrifice he resolved to call that place the altar of all the people and to build a temple to God there Which words he uttered very appo sitely to what was to be done afterward for God sent the prophet to him and told him that there should his son build him an altar CHAP XIV OF THE GREAT PREPARATIONS MADE BY DAVID FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD AND HIS APPOINTMENT OF SOLOMON TO REIGN UPON ADONIJAH S ATTEMPT TO OAIN THE KINGDOM AFTER the delivery of this prophecyf the king commanded the strangers to be numbered and they were found to be one hundred and eighty thousand Of these he appointed eighty thousand to be hewers of stone and the rest of the multitude to carry stones and of them he set over the workmen three thousand and Jfive hundred He also prepared a great quantity of iron and brass for the work with many large cedar trees the Tyrians and Sidonians sending them to him for he had sent to them for a supply of those trees And told his friends that these things were now prepared that he might leave materials ready for the building of the temple to his son who was to reign after him and that he might not have them to seek then when he was very young and by reason of his age unskilful in those matters but might have them lying by him and so might the more readily complete the work So David called his son Solomon and charged him when he had received the kingdom j to build a temple to God and said I was willing to build God a temple myself but he prohibited me because I was polluted with blood and wars but he hath foretold that Solomon my youngest son should build him a temple and should be called by that name Over whom he hath promised to take the like care as a father takes over his son and that he would make the country of the Hebrews happy under him and that not only in other respects but by giving it peace and freedom from wars and from internal seditions which are the greatest of all blessings Since therefore thou wast ordained king by God himself before thou wast born endeavour to render thyself worthy of this his providence as is in other instances so particularly in being religious and courageous Keep thou also his com mands and his laws which he hath given us by Moses and do not permit others to break them Be zealous also to dedicate to God a temple which he hath chosen to be built under thy reign Nor be thou affrighted by the vastness of the work nor set about it timorously For I will make all things ready before I die And take notice that there are already Â ten thousand talents of gold and a hundred talents of silver collected together I have also laid together brass and iron without number and an immense quantity of timber and of stones Moreover thou hast many thousand stone cutters and carpenters And if thou shalt want any thing farther do thou add somewhat of thine own Wherefore if thou performest this work thou wilt be acceptable to God and have him for thy patron David also farther exhorted the rulers of the people to assist his son in this building and to attend to the divine service  What Josephus adds here whether from his copy of 2 Sam xxiv 25 or of 1 Chron xxvi 26â 30 or from other places belonging to David s history of which already VII 4 is very remarkable that this mount Moriah was not only the very place where Abraham offered up his ton Isaac long ago but that God had foretold to David by a prophet that here his son should build him a temple which is not directly in any of our other copies though very agreeable to what was in them particularly in 1 Chron xxi 26 28 and xxii 1 to which place I refer the reader t About an 1057 Three hundred 1 Kings v 16 This power of naming a successor was here assumed by David and for some time afterwards as it appears by the story of his grandson Rehoboam was continued in the Jewish state It was a privilege that in after ages was granted to several good princes but among the Israel ites it did not prevail long because the constitution of other nations to which the Israelites affected to conform themselves was different Pool s Annotations and Pat rick s Commentary B Â Of the quantity of gold and silver expended in the building of Solomon s temple and whence it arose see the description of the temples chap 13 And of the distinct parts of that temple see the other chapters of that descrip tion thereto belonging 264 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS when they should be free from all their mis fortunes for that by this means they should enjoy instead of them peace and a happy settlement with which blessings God re wards such men as are religious and righ teous He also gave orders that when the temple should be built they should put the ark therein with the holy vessels and he assured them that they ought to have had a temple long ago if their fathers had not been negligent of God s commands who had given it in charge that when they had got the pos session of this land they should build him a temple Thus did David discourse to the governors and to his son David was now in years and his body by length of time was become cold and be numbed insomuch that he could get no heat by covering himself with many clothes And when the physicians came together they agreed that a beautiful virgin chosen out of the whole country should sleep by the king s side and that this damsel would communicate heat to him and be a remedy against his numbness Now there was found in the city one woman of superior beauty her name was Abishag who sleeping with the king did communicate warmth to him But of this woman we shall speak more presently â â cÂ J Now the fourth son of David was a beau tiful young man and tall born to him off Haggith his wife He was named Adonijah and was in his disposition like to Absalom and exalted himself as hoping to be king and told his friends that he ought to take the government upon him He also prepared many chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him J When his father saw this he did not reprove him nor restrain him from his purpose nor did he go so far as to ask wherefore he did so Now Adonijah had for his assistants Joab the captain of the army and Abiathar the high priest And the only persons that opposed him were Zadok the high priest and the prophet Nathan and Be naiah who was captain of the guards and Shimei David s friend with all the other most mighty men Now Adonijah had pre pared a supper out of the city near the foun tain that was in the king s paradise and had invited all his brethren except Solomon and had taken with him Joab the captain of the army and Abiathar and the rulers of the tribe of Judah but had not invited to this feast Zadok the high priest Nathan the pro phet nor Benaiah the captain of the guards nor any of those of the contrary party This matter was told by Nathan to Bathsheba Solomon s mother that Adonijah was king and that David knew nothing of it and he advised her to save herself and her son Solomon and to go by herself to David and say to him that he had indeed sworn that Solomon should reign after him but that in the mean time Adonijah had already taken the kingdom He said that he the prophet himself would come after her and when she had spoken thus to the king would confirm what she had said Accordingly Bathsheba agreed with Nathan and went in to the king and worshipped him and when she had de sired leave to speak with him she told him all things in the manner that Nathan had suggested to her and related what a supper Adonijah had made and who they were whom he had invited as his intimate friends She also said that all the people had their eyes upon him to know whom he would choose for their king She desired him also to consider how after his departure Ado nijah if he were king would slay her and her son Solomon Now as Bathsheba was speaking the keepers of the king s chambers tol him that Nathan desired to see him And ygheii  It is the observation of Galen in his fifth book Of the Powers of Simple Medicines that nothing so effectually procures heat and health as the application of any thing young to the stomach the advice of David s physicians therefore was not amiss but it had been sinful advice and such as he could not have followed had not this young woman whom he took to bed with him been his concubinary wife In those days such wives were al lowable and that she served him in this capacity is very manifest from the account we have of her in Scripture for whereas it is said that the king knew her not this cer tainly implies that he might have had carnal knowlÂ dge of her without sin or scandal whereas it is said that lay in his bosom this phrase every where in Scripts denotes what was the sole privilege of a wife concubi e Gen xvi 5 Deut xiii 6 Nor can we imagine v J Adonijah s desiring her in marriage had been so hein s a crime in Solomon s account had she not been the kir g s wife and he by this means had designed to revive  pretensions to the crown Pool s Annotations B t 2 Sam iii 4 J About an 1058 an 1057 265 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the king had commanded that he should be admitted he came in and asked him whether he had ordained Adonijah to be king and delivered the government to him or not for that he had made a splendid supper and in vited all his sons except Solomon as also that he had invited Joab the captain of the host and Abiathar the high priest who were feasting with applauses and many joyful sounds of instruments and wishing that the kingdom might last for ever But said Nathan he hath not invited me nor Zadok the high priest nor Benaiah the captain of the guards And it is but fit that all should know whether this be done by thy approba tion or not When Nathan had said thus the king commanded that they should call Bathsheba to him for she had gone out of the room when the prophet came And when Bathsheba was come David said I swear by Almighty God that thy son Solomon shall certainly be king as I formerly swore and that he shall sit upon my throne this very day So Bathsheba worshipped him and wished him a long life and the king sent for Zadok the high priest and Benaiah the cap tain of the guards and when they were come he ordered them to take with them Nathan the prophet and all the armed men about the palace and to set his son Solomon upon the king s mule and so carry him out of the city to the fountain called Gihon f and to anoint him there with the holy oil and to make him king This he charged Zadok the high priest and Nathan the prophet to do and commanded them to follow Solomon through the midst of the city and to sound the trutn pets and wish aloud that Solomon the king might sit upon the royal throne for ever that so all the people might know that he was ordained king by his father He also gave Solomon a charge concerning his go vernment to rule the whole nation of the He brews and particularly the tribe of Judah righteously And when Benaiah had prayed to God to be favourable to Solomon they set Solomon upon the mule4 and brought him out of the city to the fountain and anointed him with the oil and brought him into the city again with acclamations and wishes that his kingdom might continue a long time And when they had introduced him into the king s house they set him upon the throne Whereupon all the people betook themselves to make merry and to celebrate a festival dancing and delighting themselves with musical pipes till both the earth and the air echoed with the multitude of the instruments of music Now when Adonijah and his guests per ceived this noise they were in disorder and Joab the captain of the host said he was not pleased with these echoes and the sound of these trumpets And when supper was set be fore them nobody tasted of it but they were all very thoughtful what should be the mat ter Then Jonathan the son of Abiathar the high priest came running to them and when Adonijah saw the young man gladly and said to him that he was a good messenger he de clared the whole matter about Solomon and the determination of king David Hereupon both Adonijah and all his guests rose hastily from the feast and every one fled to their  In 2 Sam vii 12 God had promised David by Na than that he would set upon his throne a son that should proceed from him which plainly signified that none of his sons already born were to be the person and in 1 Chron xxii 9 c he declared by the same prophet that after his father Solomon should reign and build him a house This Adonijah could not but know and there fore his setting himself against the decree of heaven made his sin the greater Patrick s Commentary B t Some commentators are of opinion that Gihon was the same with the fountain of Siloam but this is a gross mistake since Gihon was manifestly to the west and Siloam to the east of Jerusalem There is little or no certainty likewise in the notions of some Rabbins who pretend that in ancient times kings were always anointed by the side of a fountain by way of good omen or that the perpetual running of the stream might be an emblem of the perpetuity of the king s reign In the history of Saul who was their first king and of David who was three times anointed we find no mention made of any spring or fountain As these fountains however were places of great concourse for there were not many in Jerusalem the chief reason we may imagine why David ordered Solomon to be anointed at one of these was that the thing might be done as publicly and in the presence of as many spectators as possible Patrick s Commentary B J All the rest of David s sons were wont to ride upon mules when they went abroad 2 Sam xiii 29 but Dnvid had a mule peculiar to himself and the mounting Solo mon upon it was a sufficient declaration in his favour For as it was capital according to Maimonides to ride upon the king s mule or sit on his throne or handle hit sceptre without his order so on the contrary to have the honour to ride upon the king s horse by his appoint ment was accounted the highest dignity among the Per sians as appears by the story of Mordecai in the book of Esther Calmet s Commentary B I I 1 Kings i 40 266 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS own homes Adonijah also as afraid of the king for what he had done became a sup plicant to God and took hold of the horns of the altar which were prominent It was also told Solomon that he had so done and that he desired to receive assurances from him that he would not remember the injury he had done and not inflict any severe punishment for it Solomon answered very mildly and prudently that he forgave him this his offence but said withal that if he were found in any attempt for new innova tions he would be the author of his own Eunishment So he sent to him and raised im up from the place of his supplication And when he was come to the king and had worshipped him the king bade him go away to his own house and have no suspicion of any harm and desired him to shew himself a worthy man as what would tend to his own advantage But David being desirous of ordaining his son king of all the people called together their rulers to Jerusalem with the priests and the Levites And having first numbered the Levites he found them to be thirty eight thousand from thirty years old to fifty Out of which he appointed twenty three thousand to take care of the building of the temple and out of the same six thousand to be judges of the people and scribes four thousand for porters to the house of God and as many for singers to sing to the instruments which David had prepared He divided them also into courses and when he had separated the priests from them he found of these priests twenty four courses sixteen of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar and he ordained that one course should minister to God eight days from sabbath to sabbath And thus were the courses distributed by lot in the presence of David and Zadok and Abiathar the high priests and of all the rulers And that course which came up first was written down as the first and accordingly the second and so on to the twenty fourth And this partition hath remained to this day He also made twenty four parts of the tribe of Levi and when they cast lots they came up in the same manner for their courses of eight days He also honoured the posterity of Moses and made them the keepers of the treasures of God and of the donations which the kings dedicated He also ordained that all the tribe of Levi as well as the priests should serve God night and day as Moses had enjoined them After this he divided the army into twelve parts with their leaders and captains of hun dreds and commanders Now every part had twenty four thousand which were ordered to wait on Solomon by thirty days at a time from the first day till the last with the cap tains of thousands and captains of hundreds He also set rulers over every part such as he knew to be good and righteous men He set others also to take care of the treasures aud of the villages and of the fields and of the beasts When David had ordered all these offices after the manner before mentioned he called the rulers of the Hebrews and their heads of tribes and the officers over the seve ral divisions and those that were appointed over every work and every possession and standing upon a high pulpit he said to the multitude My brethren and my people I would have you know that I intended to build a house for God and prepared a large quan  There is no precept in the law to make the altar a privileged place but in conformity to the customs of other nations the Jews seem to have done it Other nations had certainly this custom as appears from that passage in Virgil Talibus orabat dictis arasque tenebat JEneid 6 And it seems not unlikely that as the people when they came into the land of Canaan had cities appointed by God whereunto the manslayer might fly so while they continued in the wilderness the camp of the Levites might serve for the same purpose Nay from the words in Exodus xxi 14 where God orders the wilful murderer to be taken from his altar that he may die it seems un questionably true that even in the land of Canaan the aitar continued a sanctuary for those who fled unto it but then the question is to what altar Adonijah fled 1 Whe ther to the brazen one which Moses made and which was now at Gibeon or that which his father had lately erected in the threshing floor of Araunah It is expressly said 1 Kings i 50 that he caught hold of the horns of the altar but we can hardly suppose say some that the altar in the threshing floor which was run up in such haste with stones and turf was made in that figure But what should hinder us from supposing that as David had built a place for the reception of the ark of the covenant on Mount Sion he had likewise built there an altar for the oblation of the daily sacrifices in the exact form of the original one that was then at Gibeon and that it was to this altar and neither of the others that Adonijah betook himself for refuge Le Gere s Patrick s and Calmet s Commentaries 6 AN 267 1057 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tity of gold and a hundred thousand talents of silver But God prohibited me by the prophet Nathan because of the wars I had on your account and because my right hand was polluted with the slaughter of our ene mies But he commanded that my son who was to succeed me in the kingdom should build a temple for him Now therefore since you know of the twelve sons whom Jacob our forefather had Judah was appointed to be king and that I was preferred before my six brethren and received the government from God and that none of them were uneasy at it so I do also desire that my sons be not seditious one against another now Solomon has received the kingdom but to bear him cheerfully for their lord as knowing that God hath chosen him For it is not a grievous thing to obey even a foreigner as a ruler if it be God s will but it is natural to rejoice when a brother hath obtained that dignity since the rest partake of it with him And I pray that the promises of God may be ful filled and that this happiness which he hath promised to bestow upon king Solomon over all the country may continue therein for all time to come And these promises O son will be firm and come to a happy end if thou shewest thyself to be religious and a righteous man and an observer of the laws of thy country But if not expect adversity upon thy disobedience to them Now when the king had said this he left off but gave the description and pattern of the building of the temple in the sight of them all to Solomon of the foundations and of the chambers inferior and superior how many they were to be and how large in height and in breadth as also he determined the weight of the golden and silver vessels moreover he earnestly excited him with his words to use the utmost alacrity about the work he exhorted the rulers also and par ticularly the tribe of Levi to assist him both because of his youth and because God had chosen him to take care of the building of the temple and of the government of the king dom He also declared to them that the work would not be very laborious to them because he had prepared for it many talents of gold and more of silver with timber and  2 Sam xii 11 Psal xviii 10 voL I â NOS 23  24 a great many carpenters and stone cutters and a large quantity of emeralds and all sorts of precious stones and he said that even now he would give of the proper goods of his own dominion two hundred talents and three hundred other talents of pure gold for the most holy place and for the chariot of God the cherubim which are to stand over and cover the ark Now when David had done speaking there appeared great alacrity among the rulers and the priests and the Levites who now contributed and made great and splendid promises for a fu ture contribution For they undertook to bring in of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drachms f and of silver ten thousand talents and many thousand talents of iron And if any one had a precious stone he brought it to be put among the treasures of which Jehiel one of the pos terity of Moses had the care Upon this occasion all the people rejoiced as in particular did David when he saw the zeal and forward ambition of the rulers and the priests and of all the rest and he began to bless God with a loud voice calling him the father and parent of the universe and the author of human and divine things with which he had adorned Solomon the patron and guardian of the Hebrew nation and of its happiness and of that kingdom which he had given his son Besides this he prayed for happiness to all the people and to Solomon his son a sound and a righteous mind in all sorts of virtue and then he commanded the multitude to bless God Upon which they all fell down upon the ground and wor shipped him They also gave thanks to David on account of all the blessings which they had received ever since he had taken the kingdom On the next day he presented sacrifices to God a thousand bullocks and as many lambs which they offered for burnt offerings They also offered peace offerings and slew many ten thousand sacrifices and the king feasted all day together with all the people and they anointed Solomon a second time with the oil and appointed him to be king and Zadok to be the high priest of the whole multitude And when they had brought Solomon to the royal palace and had set him t Staters 3D 268 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS upon his father s throne they were obedient from that day CHAP XV OF THE CHARGE WHICH DAVID GAVE TO HIS SON SOLOMON AT THE APPROACH OF HIS DEATH AND OF THE MATERIALS HE LEFT HIM FOR BUILDING A TEMPLE A LITTLE afterward David fell into a distemper by reason of his age and perceiving that he was near to death he called his son Solomon and discoursed to him thus I am now O my son going to my grave and to my fathers which is the common way which all men that now are or that shall be hereafter must go From which way it is no longer possible to return and to know any thing that is done in this world I therefore exhort thee while I am still alive though already very near to death in the same manner as I have formerly said in my advice to thee to be righteous towards thy subjects and religious towards God who hath given thee thy kingdom to observe his commands and his laws which he hath sent us by Moses and neither do thou out of fa vour nor flattery allow any lust or passion to weigh with thee to disregard them for if thou transgressest his law thou wilt lose the favour of God and thou wilt turn away his providence from thee in all things But if thou behave thyself so as I exhort thee thou wilt preserve our kingdom to our family and no other house will bear rule over the He brews but we ourselves for all ages Be thou also mindful of the transgression of Joab f the captain of the host who hath slain two generals out of envy and those righteous and good men Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether whose death do thou avenge as shall seem good to thee since Joab hath been too hard for me and more potent than myself and so hath escaped punishment hitherto I also commit to thee the son of Barzillai the Gileadite whom in order to gratify me thou shalt have in great honour and take great care of For we have not done good to him first but we only repay that debt which we owe his father for what he did to me in my flight There is also Shimei the son of Gera of the tribe of Ben jamin who after he had cast many reproaches upon me when in my flight I was going to Mahanaim met me at Jordan and received assurances that he should then suffer nothing Do thou now seek out for some just occasion and punish him When David had given these admonitions to his son respecting public affairs and about those whom he knew to deserve punishment he died having lived seventy years J and reigned seven years and six months in He bron over the tribe of Judah and thirty three years in Jerusalem over all the country This man was of an excellent character and was endowed with all virtues that were de sirable in a king and in one that had the preservation of so many tribes committed to him For he was a man of valour in a very extraordinary degree and went readily and first of all into dangers when he was to fight for his subjects as exciting the soldiers to action by his own labours and fighting for them and not by commanding them in a des potic way He was also of very great abili ties in apprehension of present and future circumstances when he was to manage any affairs He was prudent moderate and kind  An 1056 t David is here greatly blamed by some for recom mending Joab and Shimei to be punished by Solomon if he could find a proper occasion after he bad borne with the first a long while and seemed to have pardoned the other entirely which Solomon executed accordingly â Yet do I not discern any fault either in David or Solomon in these cases Joab s murder3 of Abner and Amasa were very barbarous and could not properly be forgiven either by David or Solomon For a dispensing power in kings for the crime of wilful murder is warranted by no law of God nay is directly against it every where Nor is it in the power of men to grant such a prerogative to any of their kings Though Joab was so nearly related to David and so potent in the army under a warlike administration that David durst not himself put him to death as he says here and 2 Sam iii 39 and xix 7 Shimei s cursing the Lord s anointed and this without any just cause was the highest act of treason against God and his anointed king and justly deserved death And though David could for give treason against himself yet had he done no more in the case of Shimei than promised him that he would not then on the day of his return and re inauguration or upon that occasion himself put him to death 2 Sam xix 22 and he swore to him no farther verse 23 as the words are in Josephus than that he would Dot then put him to death which he performed Nor was Solomon under any obligation to spare such a traitor J From an 1126 to 1056 B C an 1056 269 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to such as were under any calamities he was also righteous and humane which are good qualities peculiarly fit for kings nor was he guilty of any offence in the exercise of so great an authority but in the business of the wife of Uriah He also left behind him greater wealth than any other king either of the Hebrews or of other nations ever did He was buried by his son Solomon in Je rusalem with great magnificence and with all the other funeral pomp which kings used to be buried with moreover he had immense wealth buried with him f the vastness of which may be easily conjectured by what I shall now say Jfor a thousand and three hundred years afterwards Hyrcanus the high priest when he was besieged by Antiochus that was called the Pious the son of Deme trius and was desirous of giving him money to get him to raise the siege and draw offhis army and having no other method of raising the money opened one room of David s se pulchre and took out three thousand talents and gave part of that sum to Antiochus and by this means caused the siege to be raised Nay many years afterward Herod the king opened another room and took away a great deal of money and yet neither of them came at the coffins of the kings themselves for their bodies were buried under the earth so  1 Kings ii 10 1 Chron xxix 26â 30 t Among several nations indeed it was customary to bury along with the princes and other great men various things of value that they took delight in while they lived The Egyptians were used to this and about their mum mies are frequently found very precious ornaments When Alexander the Great had Cyrus s tomb opened there was found therein a bed of gold a very rich table drinking cups and many fine vestments but notwith standing all this several learned men look upon this whole account of Josephus as a mere fable For to what purpose say they did Solomon bury all this treasure under ground when he had so much occasion for it when he was forced to borrow money of the king of Tyre and burthen his people with so many heavy taxes to supply his excessive expenses How came it that the other kings of Judah who were frequently put to the necessity of stripping the temple of its precious furniture to satisfy their greedy enemies never once adventured to lay hold on this treasure How came it to escape the hands of the Chaldeans and other nations that so often had the plundering of Jerusalem Or why should Hyrcanus vio late this depositum which his predecessors esteemed more sacred than the holy vessels of the Lord These are questions that cannot easily be resolved and what is a farther confutation of this story in that very book from whence Josephus is supposed to have taken it it is never once said that Hyrcanus broke open David s tomb The words of that spurious author are that  Hyrcanus while he was besieged by Antiochus opened a treasure chamber which belonged to some of David s descendants and that after he had taken a large sum of money out of it he still left a great deal in it and sealed it up again but this is quite a different thing and has no manner of relation to the sepulchre of David As to the real sepulchre of David it is certain that it was always held in great vene ration among the Jews It was in being in St Peter s time for so he tells the people Acts ii 29 Dio in Adriani vita informs us that part of it was fallen down in the emperor Adrian s reign St Jerom relates that he himself used frequently to go and pray at it and modern travellers as we took notice before describe some magnificent monuments hewed in a rock not far from Jerusalem which are doubtless very ancient but they themselves do not agree that they were the sepul chres of the kings of Judah It was somewhat unaccount able however that the place of this prince s sepulchre which both the Chaldeans and the Romans when they took Jerusalem thought proper to spare should now be so entirely lost that we cannot find the least remains of it But though Providence has so ordered it that the place of David s sepulchre should not at present be known yet there does not want an eternal monument of his most ex cellent genius The Book of Psalms which for the most part was composed by him does publish the glory of its author more than the most pompous eulogies and the author of Ecclesiasticus chap xlvii 2 c has conse crated an epitaph to his memory which is more durable than either marble or brass â As the fat is taken away from the peace offering so was David chosen out of the people of Israel He played with lions as with kids and with bears as with lambs he slew a giant when he was young and took away reproach from the people for he called upon the most high Lord and he gave strength to his right hand to slay this mighty warrior and to set up the horn of his people So the people honoured him with ten thousands and praised him in blessings of the Lord for he destroyed the enemies on every side and brought to nought the Philistines his adversaries â In all his works he praised the Holy One most high and blessed the Lord with words of glory â He set singers also before the altar that by their voices they might make sweet melody and daily sing praises in their songs He beau tified their feasts and set their solemn times in perfect order â The Lord took away his sons and exalted his horn for ever he gave him a covenant of kings and a throne of glory in Israel Calmefs Commentary and his Dictionary under the word David B J Instead of 1300 years we are here by Josephus s own chronology to read 980 or at most in a round and large number 1000 years But as to some supposals as if the burial of such riches in or near to David s sepulchre were a thing incredible I cannot but wonder at great men when they oppose some vain conjectures against the most authentic evidence we have for these histories and that from the best contemporary authors See XIII 8 XVI 7 Of the War 1 2 and Authentic Records part I page 207 3D2 270 book VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS artfully that they did not appear to even those that entered into their monuments  I suppose those large and magnificent sepulchres in the north west now without but perhaps of old within the walls of Jerusalem and still called the sepulchres of the kings are those very sepulchres in which David and so many more kings of Judah were buried and in certain of whose rooms which are not a few these im mense riches might now be deposited and out of which vast sums were afterwards taken certainly by Hyrcanus and very probably by Herod the Great also See Antiq XIII 8 XVI 7 Sandys page 175 Thevenot part I lib II chap 40 Prideaux at the year 699 Maundrell page 75 76 77 and note on Antiq VII 3 and on XVII But so much shall suffice concerning these matters 11 with Authent Rec part I page 207 Dr Prideaux s objections are built chiefly on the supposal that this vast treasure put now into David s sepulchre must have been known all along afterwards whereas it is more probable it was not known till Hyrcanus in great distress disco vered it and took out 3000 talents Nor perhaps was it afterwards known that Hyrcanus had left any behind him till Herod prying about every where for money at length met with that remainder also and took it all away Sepul chres were of old looked upon as places so sacred and inviolable that treasures might be more safely trusted in them than in almost any other places ak 1056 271 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK VIII Containing an Interval of One Hundred and Sixty three Years FROM THE DEATH OP DAVID TO THE DEATH OP AHAB CHAP I of Solomon s conduct after he had received the KINGDOM WE have already treated of David and his virtue and of the benefits that he was the author of to his countrymen of his wars also and battles which he managed with success and then died an old man And when Solomon his son who was but a youth in age had taken the kingdom and whom David had declared while he was alive the lord of that people according to God s will when he sat upon the throne the whole body of the people made joyful accla mations to him as is usual at the beginning of a reign and wished that all his affairs might come to a blessed conclusion and that he might arrive at a great age and at the most happy state of affairs possible But Adonijah who while his father was livings attempted to gain possession of the government came to the king s mother Bath sheba and saluted her with great civility and when she asked him whether he came to her as desiring her assistance in any thing or not and bade him tell her if that were the case for that she would cheerfully afford it him he began to say that she knew herself that the kingdom was his both on account of his elder age and of the disposition of the multitude and that yet it was transferred to Solomon her son according to the will of God He also said that he was contented to be a servant under him and was pleased withthe present settlement But he desired  About 12 or 14 years old her to be a means of obtaining a favour from his brother to him and to persuade him to bestow on him in marriage Abishag who had slept by his father but was still a virgin So Bathsheba promised to afford him her assist ance and to bring this marriage about be cause the king would be willing to gratify him in such a thing and because she would press him to it very earnestly Accordingly he went away in great hopes of succeeding in this affair So Solomon s mother Went pre sently to her son to speak about what she had promised upon Adonijah s supplication to her And when her son came forward to meet her and embraced her and when he had brought her into the house where his royal throne was he sat thereon and bade them set another throne on the right hand for his mother When Bathsheba was set down she said O son grant me one re quest that I desire of thee and do not do any thing to me that is disagreeable or un grateful which thou wilt do if thou deniest me And when Solomon desired her to lay her commands upon him because it was agreeable to his duty to grant her every thing she should ask and complained that she did not at first begin her discourse with a firm expectation of obtaining what she de sired but had some suspicion of a denial she intreated him to grant that his brother Ado nijah might marry Abishag But the king was greatly offended at these words and sent away his mother saying that Adonijah aimed at great things and that he wondered she did not desire him to yield up the kingdom to him as to his elder brother 272 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS since she desired that he might marry Abi shag and that he had potent friends Joab the captain of the host and Abiathar the priest So he called for Benaiah the cap tain of the guards and ordered him to slay his brother Adonijah He also called for Abiathar the priest and said to him I will not put thee to death because of those hard ships which thou hast endured with my father and because of the ark which thou hast borne along with him but I inflict the following punishment upon thee because thou wast among Adonijah s followers and wast of his party Do not thou continue here nor come any more into my sight but go to thine own town and live on thine own fields and there abide all thy life for thou hast offended so greatly that it is not just thou shouldest re tain thy dignity any longer For the afore mentioned cause therefore it was that the house of Ithamar was deprived of the sacer dotal dignity as God had foretold to Eli the grandfather of Abiathar So it was trans ferred to the family of Phineas to Zadok Now those that were of the family of Phineas but lived privately during the time that the high priesthood was transferred to the house of Ithamar of which family Eli was the first that received it were these that follow Bnkki the son of Abishua the high priest his son was fJoatham Joatham s son was Meraioth Meraioth s son was JArophoeus Arophoeus s son was Ahitub and Ahitub s son was Zadok who was first made high priest in the reign of David Now when Joab the captain of his host had heard of the slaughter of Adonijah he was greatly afraid for he was a greater friend to him than to Solomon and suspecting not without reason that he was in danger on ac count of his favour to Adonijah he fled to the altar and supposed he might procure safety thereby to himself because of the king s piety towards God But when some told the king what Joab s supposal was he sent Benaiah and commanded him to raise him up from the altar and bring him to the judgment seat in order to make his defence However Joab said he would not leave the altar but would die there rather than in another place And when Benaiah had reported his answer to the king Solomon commanded him to cut off his head there Â and let him take that as a punishment for those two captains of his host whom he had wickedly slain and to bury his body that his sins might never leave his family but that himself and his father by Joab s death might be guiltless And when Benaiah had done what he was commanded to do he was himself appointed to be captain of the whole army The king also made Zadok high priest in the room of Abiathar whom he had removed But as to Shimei Solomon commanded that he should build him a house and stay at Jerusalem and attend upon him and should not have authority to go over the brook Ce dron and that if he disobeyed that command death should be his punishment He also threatened him so terribly that he compelled him to take an oath that he would obey Ac cordingly Shimei said that he had reason to thank Solomon for giving him such an injunc tion and added an oath that he would do as he bade him and leaving his own country he made his abode in Jerusalem ff But three  1 Kings ii 25 Zerahiah 1 Chron vi 6  Amariah 1 Chron vi 7 I This execution upon Joab as a murderer by slaying him even when he had taken sanctuary at God s altar is perfectly agreeable to the laws of Moses which enjoins that If a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with guile thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die Exod xxi 14 Â It was formerly very customary among princes to employ their officers or greatest confidants in such like executions Among the Romans the soldiers were always the persons who carried to prison to torture or to ex ecution such as were found guilty of any offence and this Tertullian makes an argument to dissuade Christians from engaging in their wars lest thereby they should be obliged to imprison punish or execute malefactors In Dan ii 24 we read that Nebuchadnezzar sent Arioch who was chief commander of his troops to destroy the wise men of Babylon because they could not interpret his dream and therefore we need less wonder that we find Solomon employing Benaiah the captain of his guard on the like office But whether he did not first drag Joab from the altar before he slew him for fear of polluting the holy place with blood or whether Solomon did not rather think fit to have him killed even at the altar and let all men see that no place though never so sacred should secure any man from the hand of justice commentators have not agreed Calmefs and Patrick s Comment B  1 Kings ii 35 tt Shimei as we read was a very powerful man When he came to meet king David and to beg pardon for his offence he had a thousand of his own tribe to accompany him 2 Sam xix 17 and therefore Solomon an 1052 273 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS years afterwards when he heard that two of hie servants were run away from him and were in Gath he went for his servants in haste and when he was come back with them the king perceived it and was much displeased that he had contemned his com mands and what was more had no regard to the oaths he had sworn to God So he called him and said Didst not thou swear never to leave nor to go out of this city to another Thou shalt not therefore escape punishment for thy perjury but I will punish thee thou wicked wretch both for this crime and for those wherewith thou didst abuse my father when he was in his flight that thou mayest know that wicked men gain nothing at last although they be not punished immediately upon their unjust practices but that in all the time wherein they think themselves secure because they have yet suffered nothing their punishment increases and is heavier upon them and that to a greater degree than if they had been punished immediately upon the commission of their crimes So Benaiah on the king s command slew Shimei CHAP II op Solomon s marriage his wisdom and riches and the assistance he obtained from hiram towards the building of the temple SOLOMON having settled himself firmly in his kingdom and having brought his enemies to punishment married the daughter of Pharaoh king of Egypt He also built the walls of JerusalemJ much larger and stronger than those which had been before and thenceforward he managed public affairs very peaceably Nor was his youth any hindrance in the exercise of justice the observance of the law or the remembrance of what charges his father had given him at his death but he discharged every duty with greater accuracy than might have been expected from such as are aged and of the greatest prudence He now resolved to go to Hebron and sacrifice to God upon the brazen altar that was built by Moses Accordingly he offered there a thousand burnt offerings And when he had done this he thought he had payed great honour to God For as he was asleep that very night God appeared to him and com manded him to ask of him some gifts which he was ready to bestow on him as a reward for his piety So Solomon asked of God what was most excellent and of the greatest worth in itself what God would bestow with the greatest joy and what it was most pro fitable for man to receive For he did not desire either gold silver or any other riches as a young man might naturally have done for these are the things that generally are es teemed by most men as alone of the greatest worth and of the best gifts of God But said he Give me O Lord a sound mind and a good understanding whereby I may speak and judge the people according to truth and righteousness With these peti tions God was well pleased and promised to give him all those things that he had not mentioned in his option riches glory victory over his enemies and in the first place un derstanding and wisdom and this in such a degree as no other mortal man neither kings nor ordinary persons ever had He also pro mised to preserve the kingdom to his posterity for a very long time if he continued righteous and obedient to him and imitated his father might think proper to confine him to the city of Jerusalem that being removed from the place where his family and interest lay to one where he was but a stranger and suf ficiently odious for his former ill treatment of the late king he might be incapable of raising any tumults or seditions and that being in this public theatre all his words and actions might be narrowly observed which considering his busy and wicked temper might give So lomon a fair advantage against him and as the manner of some is the very prohibition itself might probably inflame his desire to transgress it Pool s Annotations B  About an 1052 t 1 Kings iii 1 J This building the walls of Jerusalem soon after David s death illustrates the conclusion of the fifty first Psalm where David prays Build thou the walls of Jeru salem they being it seems unfinished or imperfect at that time See VIII 6 and 1 Kings ix 15 II Although both the Hebrew and the Septuagint say 1 Kings iii 4 5 and 2 Chron i 3 that the place whither Solomon now went to the tabernacle or great brazen altar was Gibeon and not Hebron as Josephus s copy had it yet is Josephus s copy confirmed by the vow of Absalom which was according to our common copies to be performed not at Gibeon but at Hebron 2 Sam xv 7 12 And since Gibeah or Gibeon denotes a hill or an elevation as Josephus elsewhere truly observes VI 3 the original text perhaps meant an elevated place at He bron See the very same difference between Gibeon in our copies Jeremiah xli 12 and Hebron in Josephus s x 9 which probably requires the very same reconcilia tion also 274 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in those things wherein he excelled When Solomon heard this from God he leaped out of his bed and when he had worshipped him he returned to Jerusalem and after he had offered great sacrifices before the tabernacle he feasted all his own family In those days a cause came before him in judgment which it was very difficult to find any end of And I think it necessary to ex plain the fact about which the contest was that such as peruse my writings may know what difficult cause Solomon was to deter mine and those that are concerned in such matters may take this sagacity of the king s for a pattern that they may the more easily give sentence about such questions There were two womervt who were harlots in the course of their lives that came to him of whom she that seemed to be injured began to speak first and said O king I and this other woman dwell together in one room Now it came to pass that we both bore a son at the same hour of the same day and on the third day this woman overlaid her son and killed it and then took my son out of my bosom and removed him to herself and as I was asleep she laid her dead son in my arms Now when in the morning I was desirous to give the breast to the child I did not find my own but saw this woman s dead child  1 Kings iii 15 t These two women are said in the text to be harlots but the Hebrew word as we took notice in the case of Rahab may equally signify a hostess or one who kept a house of public entertainment and that it is so to be taken here we have these reasons to presume that as all public prostitution was severely forbidden by the law Deut xxiii 17 women of this infamous character durst not have pre sented themselves before so just and so wise a king that women of this lewd behaviour seldom do become mothers of children and when they chance to have any are not so solicitous for their preservation but rather rejoice when they have got rid of them There is no reason to suppose then that these women were common harlots and yet it is generally thought that they were both un married persons and guilty of fornication because no mention is made of their husbands whose office it was if they had any to contest the matter for their wives Pool s Annotations and Calmtfs Commentary B I Solomon knew at once that the only sign that would discover the truth would be her affection and compas sion and tenderness for her child and therefore in order to distinguish between the two his business was to make trial of this and if we suppose that when he commanded the child to be divided he spake with a sedate counte nance and seeming earnestness as the true mother s pe tition to the king makes it apparent that he did then we lying by me for I examined it attentively and found it so to be Hence it was that I demanded my son and when 1 could not obtain him I have recourse my lord to thy assistance For since we were alone and there was nobody there that could convict her or affright her she cares for nothing but perseveres in an obstinate denial of the fact When this woman had spoken the king asked the other what she had to say in con tradiction to that story And when she had denied that she had done what was charged upon her and said that it was her child that was living and that it was her antagonist s child that was dead and when no one could devise what judgment could be given and the whole court were blind in their under standing and could not tell how to find out this riddle the king invented the following method of discovering it He bade them bring in both the dead and the living child and commanded one of his guards to fetch a sword and to cut both the children into two pieces that each of the women might have half the living and half the dead child Here upon all the people privately laughed at the king as no more than a youth But in the mean time the real mother of the living child cried out J that he should not do so but de may suppose farther not only the two women but all the people present with horror and admiration expecting the execution of the thing which when it ended in so just a decision quite contrary to what they looked for raised joy in every breast and gave a more advantageous commendation to the judge and yet Abarbinel the Jewish commentator thinks that all this was no great proof of Solomon s extraordinary wisdom nor could it beget that  fear or reverence which the text says 1 Kings iii 28  it procured to his person His opinion therefore is that Solomon made a discovery of the truth antecedent to this experiment that by observing the countenance the man ner of speech and all the motions of the women he dis cerned the secret of their heart and penetrated to the bottom of the business and that his commanding the child to be divided afterwards was only to notify to the company what he before had discovered However this be it may not be improper upon this occasion to mention an instance or two out of profane history of a singular address though much inferior to this in discovering such secrets as seemed to be past finding out To this purpose Suetonius in his life of Claudian chap 15 tell us how that emperor discovered a woman to be the mother of a young man whom she would not own for her son by commanding her to be married to him for the horror of committing incest obliged her to declare the truth and in like manner Diodorus Siculus relates how Ariopharnes king of the AN 1052 275 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS liver that child to the other woman as her own ibr she would be satisfied with the life of the child and with the sight of it although it were esteemed the other s child But the other woman was ready to see the child di vided and was even desirous that the first woman should be tormented When the king understood that both their words pro ceeded from the truth of their passions he adjudged the child to her who cried out for its preservation for that she was the real mother and he condemned the other as a wicked woman who had not only killed her own child but was willing to see her friend s child destroyed also Now the multitude looked on this determination as a great de monstration of the king s sagacity and wis dom and after that day attended to him as to one that had a divine mind Now the captainsf of Solomon s armies and officers appointed over the whole coun try were these Over the lot of Ephraim was Ures over the toparchy of Bethlehem was Dioclerus Abinadab who married Solo mon s daughter had the region of Dora and the sea coast under him The great plain was under Benaiah the son of Achilus who also governed

appointed Now the people of the Hebrews and particularly the tribe of Judah received a wonderful increase when they betook themselves to husbandry and the cultivation of their grounds For as they en joyed peace and had besides an unbounded fruition of the most desirable liberty every one was busy in augmenting the product of their own lands and making them worth more than they had formerly been The king had also other rulers who were over the land of Syria and of the Philistines which reached from the river Euphrates to Egypt and these collected his tributes of the nations Now these contributed to the king s table and to his supper every day thirty cori of fine flour and sixty of meal as also ten fat oxen twenty oxen out of the pastures and a hundred fat lambs all these were besides what were taken by hunting harts buffaloes birds and fishes which were brought to the king by foreigners every day Solomon had also so great a number of chariots that  the stalls of his horses for these chariots were forty thousand and besides these he had twelve thousand horsemen one half of which waited upon the king in Jerusalem and were dispersed abroad and dwelt in the royal vil lages But the same officers who provided for the king s expenses supplied also the fodder for the horses and still carried it the walls of Jerusalem and maintained more than usual above one hundred and fifty considerable men every day and that because the nation was then very poor at his own charges also without laying any burden upon the people Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep Also fowls were pre pared for me And once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine and yet for all this 1 required not the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this peo ple Nehem v 18 See the whole context v 14 19 Nor did the governor s usual allowance of forty shekels of silver a day v 15 amount to 51 a day nor to 1800 a year Nor does it indeed appear that under the judges or under Samuel the prophet there was any such public allowance to those governors at all Those great charges upon the public for maintaining courts came in with kings as God had foretold 1 Sam viii 11â 18 II Four thousand 2 Chron ix 25 which I suppose to be the true number 3 E 276 book vih ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to the place where the king abode at that time Now the sagacity and wisdom which God had bestowed on Solomon was so great that he exceeded the ancients insomuch that he was no way inferior to the Egyptians who are said to have been beyond all men in under standing nay indeed it is evident that their sagacity was very much inferior to that of the king s He also distinguished himself in wisdom above those who were most eminent among the Hebrews at that time for shrewd ness Those I mean were Ethan Heman Chalcol and Darda the sons of Mahol He also composed books of Odes and Songs in number a thousand and five and of Parables and Similitudes three thousand For he spake a parable upon every sort of tree from the hyssop to the cedar and in like manner also about beasts about all sorts of living crea tures whether upon the earth or in the seas or in the air For he was not unacquainted with any of their natures nor omitted in quiries about them but described them all like a philosopher and demonstrated his ex quisite knowledge of their several properties God also enabled him to learn that skill which expels demons f which is a useful science to men He composed such incantations also by which distempers are alleviated and left behind him the manner of using exorcisms by which they drive away demons so that they never return and this method of cure is of great force until this day For I have seen a certain man of my own country whose name was Eleazar releasing the people that were demoniacal in the pre sence of Vespasian and his sons and his captains and the multitude of his soldiers and the manner of the cure was this he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils and when the man fell down he adjured him to return into him no more making still mention of Solomon and reciting the incantations which he composed And when Eleazar would de monstrate to the spectators that he had such a power he set a little way offa cup or bason full of water and commanded the demon as he went out of the man to overturn it and thereby let the spectators know that he had left the man And when this was done the skill and wisdom of Solomon was shewn very manifestly For which reason it is that all men may know the vastness of Solomon s abilities and how he was beloved of God and that the extraordinary virtues of every kind with which this king was endowed may not be unknown to any people under the sun for this reason I say it is that we have proceeded to speak so largely of these mat ters Now Hiram king of Tyre when he heard that Solomon succeeded to his father s king dom was very glad for he was a friend of David s So he sent ambassadors to him  The several books which treated of the nature and virtue of animals as well as plants are supposed to have been lost in the Babylonish captivity but Eusebius as he is quoted by Anastatius informs us that king He zekiah seeing the abuse which his subjects made of Solomon s works by placing too much confidence in remedies which he prescribed and the natural secrets which he discovered thought proper to suppress them all Notwithstanding this since his time many books concerning the secrets of magic medicine and enchant ments have appeared under the name of this prince and several pieces have been quoted such as The Instructions of Solomon to his son Rehoboam The Testament of Solo mon The Books of the Throne of Solomon The Books of Magic composed by the demons under the name of Solomon The Clavicula or Key of Solomon The Ring of Solomon the Contradiction of Solomon c which were most of them very wicked and pernicious tracts to which the authors prefixed this great name to give them credit and sanction It is somewhat strange however that Josephus should inform us that Solomon composed books of enchantments and several manners of exorcisms or of driving away devils so that they could return no more and that he should farther assure us that himself had seen experiments of it by one Eleazar a Jew who in the presence of Vespasian his sons and the officers of his army cured several that were possessed Jewish Antiq lib 8 c 2 Calmef s Dictionary under the word Solomon B t Some pretended fragments of these books of conjura tions of Solomon are still extant in Fabricius s Cod Pseu depigr Vet Test page 1054 Though I entirely differ from Josephus in this opinion that such books and arts of Solomon were parts of that wisdom which was imparted to him by God in his younger days They must rather have belonged to such profane but curious arts as we find mentioned Acts xix 13 20 and had been derived from the idolatry and superstition of heathen wives and concu bines in his old age when he had forsaken God and God had forsaken him and given him up to demoniacal delusions Nor does Josephus s strange account of the root Baara Of the war VII 6 seem to be other than that of its magical use in such conjurations As for the following history it

the present happy state of affairs Upon which Solomon sent him an epistle the contents of which were as follows SOLOMON TO KING HIRAM Know thou that my father would have built a temple to God but was hindered by wars and continual expeditions for he did not leave off to overthrow his enemies till he made them all subject to tribute But I give thanks to God for the peace I at present enjoy and on that account I am at leisure and design to build a house to God For God foretold to my father that such a build ing should be erected by me Wherefore I desire thee to send some of thy subjects with mine to mount Lebanon to cut down timber for the Sidonians are more skilful than our people in cutting of wood As for wages to the hewers of wood I will pay whatever price thou shalt determine When Hiram had read this epistle he was pleased with it and wrote back this answer to Solomon â KING HIRAM TO KING SOLOMON It is fit to bless God that he hath com mitted thy father s government to thee who art a wise man and endowed with all virtues As for myself I rejoice at the condition thou art in and will be subservient to thee in all that thou sendest to me about For when my subjects have cut down many and large trees of cedar and cypress wood I will send them to sea and will order my subjects to make floats of them and to sail to what place soever of thy country thou shalt desire and leave them there After which thy subjects may carry them to Jerusalem But do thou take care to procure us corn for this timber which we stand in need of because we in habit an island f The copies of these epistles remain at this day and are preserved not only in our books but among the Tyrians also insomuch that  These epistles of Solomon and Hiram are those in 1 Kings v 3â 9 and as enlarged in 2 Chron ii 2â 16 but here given us by Josephus in his own words They are also extant in Eusebius s Praeparat Evangel IX 33 but greatly disguised by Eupolemus from whom Eusebius had those copies Which Eupolemus for a heathen knew a considerable deal of Jewish affairs though in a very imperfect manner Nor are his other accounts of Jewish history to be compared with the more accurate ones in Josephus t What Josephus here puts into his copy of Hiram s epistle to Solomon and repeats afterwards chap v that Tyre was now an island is not in any of the three other copies that in the Kings that in the Chronicles or that in Eusebius out of Eupolemus Nor is it any other I suppose than his own conjectural paraphrase For when I many years ago inquired into this matter I found the itate of this famous city and of the island whereupon it stood to have been different at very different times in somuch that the accurate Mr Reland who much laboured at it was not able to clear the difficulties thereto relating See his Palestina tom ii page 1046â 1056 The result of my inquiries into this matter is in my Essay on the Old Test Append page 226 227 and with the addition of some later improvements stands thus â that the best tetimonies hereto relating imply that Palaetyras or oldest Tyre was no other than that most ancient smaller fort or city Tyre situate on the continent and mentioned Josh xix 29 out of which the Canaanite or Phoenician inha bitants were driven into a large island that lay not far off in the sea by Joshua that this island was then joined to the continent at the present remains of Palastyrus by a neck of land over against Solomon s cisterns still so called and the city s fresh water probably was carried along in pipes by that neck of land and that this island was therefore in strictness no other than a peninsula having villages in its fields Ezek xxvi 6 and a wall about it Amos i 10 and the city was not of so great reputation as Sidon for some ages that it was attacked both by sea and land by Salmanassar as Josephus informs us out of Menander IX 14 and came to be the metropolis of Phoe nicia and was afterwards taken and destroyed by Nebu chadnezzar according to the numerous Scripture Prophe cies thereto relating Isa xxiii Jer xxv 22 â xxvii 3 â xlvii 4 Ezek xxvi xxvii xxviii and that there were remains of that destruction in heathen authors also extant in the days of Josephus though now lost X 11 that seventy years after that destruction by Nebuchadnezzar this city was in some measure revived and rebuilt Isa xxiii 17 18 but that as the prophet Ezekiel had foretold Isa xxvi 3 4 5 14 xxvii 34 the sea arose higher than before till at last it overflowed not only the neck of land but the main island or peninsula itself and destroyed that old and famous city for ever that how ever there still remained an adjoining smaller island once connected to old Tyre itself by Hiram which was after ward inhabited to which Alexander the Great with in credible pains raised a new bank or causeway and that it plainly appears from Mr Maundrell a most authentic eye witness that the old large and famous city on the original large island is laid now so generally under water that scarcely more than forty acres of it or rather of that adjoining small island remain at this day so that perhaps not above the hundredth part of the first island and city is now above water See Reland page 1049 1052 Marsh Chron page 539 and Maundrell s Travels page 50 This was foretold in the prophecies of Ezekiel and according to them as Mr Maundrell distinctly observes these poor remains of Old Tyre are now become like the top of a rock a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea Nor does Ovid pretend that the proper island on which Old Tyre stood is now visible 3E2 278 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS if any one would know the certainty about them he may desire of the keepers of the public records of Tyre to shew him them and he will find what is there set down to agree with what we have said I have said so much out of a desire that my readers may know that we speak nothing but the truth and do not compose a history out of some plausible relations which deceive men and please them at the same time nor attempt to avoid examination nor desire men to be lieve us immediately Nor are we at liberty to depart from speaking the truth which is the proper commendation of an historian and yet be blameless But we insist upon no admission of what we say unless we be able to maintain its truth by demonstration and the strongest vouchers Now king Solomon as soon as this epistle of the king of Tyre was brought him com mended the readiness and good will he de clared therein and repayed him in what he desired and sent him annually twenty thou sand cori of wheat and as many baths of oil Now the bath is equal to seventy two sexta ries He also sent him the same measure of wine So the friendship between Hiram and Solomon hereby increased more and more and they swore to continue it for ever And the king appointed a tribute to be laid on all the people of thirty thousand labourers whose work he rendered easy by prudently dividing it amongst them For he made ten thousand cut timber in mount Lebanon for one month and then come home and rest two months until the time when the other twenty thousand had finished their task at the appointed time And so afterwards it came to pass that the first ten thousand re turned to their work every fourth month And it was Adoram who was over this tri bute There were also of the strangers left by David who were to carry the stones and other materials seventy thousand and of those that cut the stones eighty thousand Of these three thousand and three hundred were rulers over the rest He also enjoined them to cut out large stones for the founda tions of the temple and that they should fit and unite them together in the mountain and so bring them to the city This was done not only by our own workmen but by those whom Hiram sent also CHAP III OF THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE SOLOMON began to build the temple in the fourth year of his reign f on the second month which the Macedonians call Artemisius and the Hebrews Jar five hun dred and ninety two years after the Exodus out of Egypt but one thousand and twenty two years from Abraham s coming out of Mesopotamia into Canaan and after the deluge one Jthousand four hundred and forty years and from Adam the first man who was created until Solomon built the temple there had passed in all three thousand one hun dred and two years Now that year on which the temple began to be built was already the twelfth year of the reign of Hiram but from the building of Tyre to the building of the temple there had passed two hundred and forty years Now therefore the king laid the founda tion of the templeÂ very deep in the ground  Adoniram 1 Kings i 14 t It may be asked why Solomon did not begin the building of the temple sooner and even in the first year of his reign since his father had left him a plan and all things necessary for the undertaking Abarbinel s an swer is â That Solomon would not make use of what his father had prepared but was resolved to build this temple all at his proper cost and charge He therefore put into the treasure of the Lord s house all that David had dedi cated to the work and to gather together as much gold and silver as was necessary to defray so vast an expense four years can be accounted no unreasonable time Nay even suppose that he had made use of the treasure which his father had amassed yet if the materials that his father had provided lav at a considerable distance and were left rude and unf i bioned it would cost all this time to form them into the exact symmetry wherein the Scripture re presents them before they were brought together espe cially considering that the very stones which made the foundation were very probably vast blocks of marble or porphyry 1 Kings v 17 and all

and such as would resist the force of time these were to unite themselves with the earth and become a basis for a sure foundation for that edifice which was to be erected they were to be so strong in order to sustain with ease those vast superstructures and precious or naments whose own weight was to be not less than the weight of those high and heavy buildings which the king designed to be very ornamental and magnificent They erected its entire body quite up to the roof of white stone Its height was sixty cubits its length was the same and its breadth twenty There was another building erected over it equal to it in its measures So that the entire alti tude of the temple was a hundred and twenty cubits Its front was to the east As to the porch they built it before the temple Its length was twenty cubits and it was so or dered that it might agree with the breadth of the house and it had twelve cubits in latitude and its height was raised as high as a hundred and twenty cubits He also built round about the temple thirty small rooms which might include the whole temple by their closeness to each other and by their number and outward position round it He also made passages through them that they might be come into one through another Every one of these rooms had five cubits in breadth and the same in length but in height twenty Above these were other rooms and others above them equal both in their mea sures and number so that these reached to a height equal to the lower part of the house for the upper part had no buildings about it The roof that was over the house was of cedar and each of these rooms had a roof of its own that was not connected with the other rooms but for the other parts there was a covered roof common to them all and built with very long beams that passed through the rest and through the whole building that so the middle walls being strengthened by the same beams of timber might be thereby made firmer But as for that part of the roof that was under the beams it was made of the same materials and was all made smooth and had ornaments proper for roofs and plates of gold nailed upon them And as he inclosed the walls with boards of cedar so he fixed on them plates of gold which had sculptures upon them so that the whole temple dazzled the eyes of such as entered by the splendour of the gold that was on every side Now the whole structure of the temple was made with great skill of polished stones and those laid together so very smoothly and harmoniously that there ap peared to the spectators no sign of any hammer or other instrument of architecture f but as if without any use of them the entire materials had naturally united themselves together that the agreement of one part with another seemed rather to have been natural than to have arisen from the force of tools upon them The king also had a fine contrivance for an ascent to the upper room over the temple and that was by steps in the thickness of its wall For it had no large door on the east end as the lower house had but the entrances were by the sides through very small doors He also overlaid the temple both within and without with boards of cedar that were kept close toge ther by thick chains so that this contrivance was in the nature of a support to the building Now when the king had divided the temple into two parts he made the inner house of but the many courte and offices that were about it made the whole a vast pile and the exqnisiteness of the art and the fewness of the artists that could be employed about it made a longer time requisite It must be owned however that considering all things Solomon made an extraordi nary despatch for if the building of Diana s temple at Ephesus employed all Asia for the space of two hundred years and no less than three hundred and sixty thousand men for twenty years together were taken up in erecting one pyramid as Pliny lib 36 c 12 affirms no rea sonable man can wonder that this temple was seven years and a half in building Pool s Annotations and Calmefs Commentary B  These small rooms or side chambers about the lower itixty cubits of the holy house seem to have been by Josephus s description in the three stories one above another no less than twenty cubits high a piece Other wise there must have been a large interval between one and the other that was over it and this with double floors the one of six cubits distance from the floor beneath it as 1 Kings vi 5 in the Septuagint and the other of no less than twenty cubits t See 1 Kings vi 7 J These several parts of the temple the Greeks are very careful to distinguish by different names What was properly the temple they called o vows and the courts and other parts of the temple to ispov Thus when Zar harias is said to have gone into the temple to burn in cense Luke i 9 which was done in the sanctum the word is vows but when it is said that Anna the prophetess    280 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS twenty cubits every way to be the most se cret chamber but he appointed that of fifty cubits to be the sanctuary And when he had cut a door place out of the wall he put therein doors of cedar and overlaid them with a great deal of gold that had sculptures upon it He also had veils of blue and purple and scarlet and the brightest and softest linen with the most curious flowers wrought upon them which were to be drawn before those doors He dedicated for the most secret place whose breadth was twenty cubits and its length the same two cheru bims of solid gold t the height of each of them was five cubits they had each of them two wings stretched out as far as five cubits wherefore Solomon set them up not far from each other that with one wing they might touch the southern wall of the secret place and with another the northern their other wings which joined to each other were a covering to the ark which was set between them But nobody can tell or even conjec ture what was the shape of the cherubims He also laid the floor of the temple with plates of gold And he added doors to the gate of the temple agreeable to the measure of the height of the wall but in breadth twenty cubits and on them fixed gold plates And in a word he left no part of the temple neither internal nor external but what was covered with gold He also had curtains drawn over these doors in like manner as they were drawn over the inner doors of the most holy place But the porch of the temple had nothing of that sort Now Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre whose name was Hiram He was by birth of the tribe of Naphthali on the mother s side but his father was JUr of the stock of the Israelites This man was skilful in all sorts of work but his chief skill lay in work ing of gold and silver and brass by whom were made all the mechanical works about the temple according to the will of Solomon Moreover this Hiram made two hollow pil lars whose outsides were of brass and the thickness of the brass was four fingers breadth and the height of the pillars was eighteen cubits and their circumference twelve cubits But there was cast with each of their chapiters lily work that stood upon the pillar and it was elevated five cubits round about which there was net work inter woven with small palms made of brass and covered with lily work To this also were hung two hundred pomegranates in two rows the one of these pillars he set at the entrance of the porch on the right hand and called it Jachin and the other at the left hand and called it Booz Solomon also cast a brazen sea Â whose departed not from the temple Luke i 37 i e lived in that part of the court of the Israelites which was appropri ated to religious women the Greek word is ispov And this observation holds good all through the New Testa ment La my De Tabern lib v c 5 B  This temple itself strictly so called had two stories The upper of which was raised quite above these little houses and their roofs for their roofs reached no higher than the top of the first story The second story which had no building adjoining to its side made a large room over the sanctuary and the holy of holies of equal dimen sions with them and it is no improbable opinion that this was the upper chamber in which the Holy Ghost was pleased to descend upon the Apostles in a visible manner This under room was appropriated to the pious laity as a place for them to come and pay their devotions in and therefore it seems very likely that the Apostles were here with other devout persons while the temple was full of Jews of all nations who were come to celebrate the feast of the Pentecost and that thereupon they below hearing the noise which was occasioned by the shaking of the place ran up to see the cause of it and to their great surprise found the Apostles distinguished from the other Jews about them both by the cloven tongues which sat upon each of them and by the several different languages that they spake Lamy s Introduction lib i c 4 B t Josephus says here that the cherubims were of solid gold and only of five cubits high while our Hebrew copies 1 Kings vi 23 28 say they were of the olive tree and the Septuagint of the cypress tree and only overlaid with gold and both agree they were ten cubits high I suppose the number is here falsely transcribed and that Josephus wrote ten cubits also  Josephus in almost all his present copies has Ovput instead of TupiK i e Ur instead of a Tyrian in our other copies 1 Kings vii 14 2 Chron ii 14 which words in the Greek are so alike that it is not improbable Josephus also wrote Tvpa and that he here agreed with the other copies II As for these two famous pillars Jachin and Booz their height could be no more than 18 cubits as here and 1 Kings vii 15 2 Kings xxv 17 Jer lii 21 Those 35 cubits in 2 Chron iii 15 being contrary to all rules of architecture It is supposed that a circumference of 12 cubits or a diameter of almost 4 cubits is also not agreeable to the rules of architecture But the contrary is shewn from Vitruvius and this proportion of 6 to 1 which is that of the pillars including the chapiter was the oldest and strongest of all proportions in architecture See the description of the temples chap xiii Â It is not to be doubted but that Solomon made all the utensils and ornaments of the temple proportionable both  AK 1050 281 Antiquities of the jews figure was that of a hemisphere this brazen vessel was called a sea tor its largeness for the laver was ten cubits in diameter and cast of the thickness of a palm Its middle part rested on a short pillar that had ten spirals round it and that pillar was a cubit in dia meter There stood round about it twelve oxen that looked to the four winds of heaven three to each wind having their hinder parts depressed that so the vessel might rest upon them which itself was also depressed round about inwardly Now this sea contained three thousand baths He also made ten brazen bases for so many quadrangular lavers the length of every one of these bases was five cubits the breadth four cubits and the height six cubits This vessel was partly turned and was thus contrived There were four small quadrangular pillars that stood one at each corner these had the sides of the base fitted to them on each quarter and they were parted into three parts every interval had a border fitted to support the laver upon which was engraven in one place a lion and in another place a bull and an eagle The small pillars had the same animals engraven that were on the sides The whole work was elevated and stood upon four cast wheels which had also naves and felloes and were a foot and half in diameter Any one that saw the spokes of the wheels how exactly they were turned and united to the sides of the bases and with what harmony they agreed to the felloes would wonder at them However their structure was this Certain shoulders of hands stretched out held the corners above upon which rested a short spiral pillar that lay under the hol low part of the laver resting upon the fore feet of the eagle and the lion which were adapted to them insomuch that those who viewed them would think that they were of one piece Between these were engravings of palm trees This was the construction of the ten bases He also made ten large round vessels which were the lavers themselves each of which contained fforty baths J for it had its height four cubits and its edges were as much distant from each other He also placed these lavers upon the ten bases that were called Mechonoth and he set five of the lavers on the left side of the temple which was that side towards the north wind and as many on the right side towards the south but looking towards the east The same eastern way he also set the sea Now he appointed the sea for washing the hands and the feet of the priests when they entered into the temple and were to ascend the al tar but the lavers to cleanse the feet and entrails of the beasts that were to be burnt offerings He also made a brazen altar whose length was twenty cubits its breadth the same and its height ten for the burnt oflerings He in number and richness to that of the edifice and yet Josephiu seems to have carried his account beyond all credibility when he tells us that there were 10 000 tables besides those of the shew bread 10 000 candle sticks besides those in the holy place 80 000 cups for drink offerings 100 000 basons of gold and double that number of silver when he tells us that Solomon caused to be made 1000 ornaments for the sole use of the high priest 10 000 linen robes and girdles for that of the common priests and 200 000 more for the Levites and musicians when he tells of 200 000 trumpets made ac cording to Solomon s direction with 200 000 more made in the fashion that Moses had appointed and 400 000 musical instruments of a mixed metal between gold and silver called by the ancients electrum Concerning all which we can only say that the text is either silent or contradicts this prodigious account Universal History lib i c 7 B  Four cubits Heb and Septuagint 1 Kings vii 27 t The round or cylindrical lavers of 4 cubits in dia meter and 4 in height both in our copies 1 Kings vii 38 39 and here in Josephus must have contained a great deal more than the 40 baths which are always assigned t hem Where the error lies is hard to say If for oou congii or baths we take homers which were but a tenth part of the bath or if in Josephus we take their dia meters only one third of their height by reading instead of tjctois to rpirov too stwv the measures would pretty well agree But both these conjectures are uncertain and unsupported Perhaps Josephus honestly followed his copies here though they had been corrupted and he was not able to restore the true reading In the mean time these 40 baths are probably the quantity contained in each laver since they went upon wheels and were to be drawn by the Levites about the court of the priests for the washings they were designed for and had they held much more they would have been too heavy to have been so drawn I Cori or Congii II Here Josephus gives us a key to his own language of right and left hand in the tabernacle and temple that by the right hand he means what is against our left when we suppose ourselves going up from the east gate of the courts towards the tabernacle or temple themselves and so vice versa Whence it follows that the pillar Jachin on the right hand of the temple was on the south against our left hand and Booz on the north against our right hand 282 book vra ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS also made aD its vessel of brass the pots and the shovels and the basoiis and besides these the snuffers and the tongs and all its other vessels he made of such brass as was in splendor and beauty like gold The king also dedicated a  great number of tables but one was large and made of gold upon which they set the loaves of God and he made ten thousand more that resembled them but were done after another manner upon which lay the vials and the cups those of gold were twenty thousand those of silver were forty thousand He also made ten thou sand candlesticks according to the command of Moses one of which he dedicated for the temple that it might burn in the day time according to the law and one table with loaves upon it on the north side of the tem ple over against the candlestick for this he set on the south side but the golden altar stood between them All these vessels were contained in that part of the holy house which was forty cubits long and were before the veil of that most secret place wherein the ark was to be set  The king also made eighty thousand pour ing vessels and a hundred thousand golden vials and twice as many silver vials Of golden dishes to offer kneaded fine flour at the altar there were eighty thousand and twice as many silver Of large basons also wherein they mixed fine flour with oil sixty thousand of gold and twice as many of silver Of the measures like those which Moses called the hin and the assaron t there were twenty thousand of gold and twice as many of silver The other censers in which they carried fire from the great altar to the little one within the temple were fifty thousand The sacerdotal garments which belonged to the high priest with the long robes the oracle and the precious stones were a thou sand But the crown upon which Moses wrote the name of God was only one and hath remained to this day 4 He also made ten thousand sacerdotal garments of fine linen with purple girdles for every priest and two hundred thousand trumpets ac cording to the command of Moses Also two hundred thousand garments of tine linen for the singers that were Levites And he made musical instruments and such as were invented for singing of hymns called IN a bis and Cinyrae psalteries and harps which were made ot electrum the finest brass forty thousand Solomon made all these things for the honour of God with great variety and mag nificence sparing no cost but using all pos sible liberality in adorning the temple and these things he dedicated to the treasure oi God He also placed a partition round about the temple winch in our own tongue we call Gison but it is called epiyxos by the Greeks and he raised it up to the height of three cubits and it was for the exclusion of the multitude from coming into the temple and shewing that it was a place that was free and open only for the priests  He also built beyond this court a temple whose figure was that of a quadrangle and erected for it great and broad cloisters this was entered by very high gates each of which had its front exposed to one of the four winds and were shut by golden doors Into this temple all the people entered that were distinguished from the rest by being pure and observant of the laws But he made that temple which was beyond this a wonderful one indeed and such as exceeds all description in words nay if I may so say is hardly be lieved upon sight For when he had filled up great valleys with earth which on ac count of their immense depth could not be looked on when you bended down to see them without pain and had elevated the ground four hundred cubits he made it to be on a level with the top of the mountain on which the temple was built and by this means the outermost temple which was ex posed to the air was Â even with the temple itself He encompassed this also with a  Of these prodigious and extravagant numbers see the description of the temple chap 13 t A tenth deal  Of the golden plate on the high priest s forehead that was in being in the days of Josephus and a century or two at least later See the note on III 7 U When Josephus here speaks of the court of the priests as inclosed and kept distinct from the rest of the temple he does not mean to exclude the Levites their brethren who all ministered to the priests in that court and ordinarily not elsewhere Â When Josephus here says that the floor of the outer most temple or court of the Gentiles was with vast labour raised to be even or of equal height with the floor of the an 1048 283 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS double row of cloisters which stood on high upon pillars of native stone while the roofs were of cedar and were polished in a manner proper for such high roofs but he made all the doors of this temple of silver CHAP IV or Solomon s removal of the ark into the temple his SUPPLICATION TO GOD AND PUBLIC SACRIFICES WHEN king Solomon had finished these large and beautiful buildings and had laid up his donations in the temple and all this in the interval of seven years and had given a demonstration of his riches and alac rity therein insomuch that any one who saw it would have thought it must have been an immense time ere it could have been finished and would have been surprised that so much should be finished in so short time he wrote to the rulers and elders of the Hebrews and ordered all the people to gather themselves together to Jerusalem f both to see the tenv pie which he had built and to remove the ark of God into it And when this invitation was every where carried abroad it was the seventh month before they came together which month is by our countrymen called Thisri but by the Macedonians Hyperbere taeus J The feast of tabernacles happened at the same time which was celebrated by the Hebrews as a most holy and eminent feast So they carried the ark and the taberna cleÂ which Moses had pitched and all the inner or court of the priests he must mean this in a gross estimation only for he and all others agree that the inner temple or court of the priests was a few cubits more elevated than the middle court the court of Israel and that much more was the court of the priests elevated several cubits above the outermost court since the court of Israel was lower than the one and higher than the other  The Septuagint says that they prepared timber and stones to build the temple for three years 1 Kings v 18 And although neither our Hebrew copy nor Josephus directly name the number of years yet do they both say the building itself did not begin till Solomon s fourth year and both speak of the preparation of materials be forehand 1 Kings v 18 Antiq VIII 5 and Josephus there intimates that it was for a considerable time before liand also There is no reason therefore to alter the Sep tuagint s number but we are to suppose three years to have been the just time of the preparation as I have done in my computation of the expenses in building that tem ple See its description chap 13 where the whole time is ten years and a half t 1 Kings viii 1 J This feast was appointed in commemoration of the children of Israel s dwelling in booths whilst they were in the wilderness and of the tabernacle which at that time was built where God promised to meet them to dwell among them and to sanctify the place with his glory and might therefore be well reckoned a very pro per season for the dedication of the temple which was to succeed in the tabernacle s place Bedford s Scripture Chronology lib vi c 2 B II The sacred history tells us that in this ark there was nothing save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb 1 Kings viii 9 and yet the author to the Hebrews affirms that in this ark was the golden pot that bad manna and Aaron s rod that budded as well as the tables of the covenant Heb ix 4 Now to reconcile tbis some imagine that before the ark had any fixed and settled place which is the time the apostle refers to all these tilings were included in it though it was chiefly intended for nothing but the tallies of the covenant but that when it was placed in the temple nothing was left in it but these two tables all the other things were de VOL I â NOS 23  24 posited in the treasury of the temple where the book of the law as we read in 2 Chron xxxiv 14 was found in the days of king Josias Others however pretend that in the time of the Apostle i e towards the end of the Jewish commonwealth Aaron s rod and the pot of manna were really kept in the ark though in the days of Solo mon they were not But this answer would be more solid and satisfactory if he knew for certain that in the time of the Apostle the ark of the covenant was really in the sanctuary of the temple which Herod built whereas Josephus De Bello Jud lib vi c 6 tells us expressly that when the Romans destroyed the temple there was nothing found in the Holy of Holies Calmet s Com mentary B Â But the question is what tabernacle whether that which Moses made and was then at Gibeon 2 Chron i 3 or that which was made by David and was then at Je rusalem To end this dispute some have imagined that both these tabernacles were at this time carried into the temple and laid up there that all danger of superstition and idolatry might thereby be avoided and that no wor ship might be performed any where but only at the house which was dedicated to God s service but it is observed by others that the convenience which David made for the reception of the ark was never called the tabernacle of the covenant it was no more than a plain tent set up in some large room of the royal palace until a more proper receptacle could be provided for it but the tabernacle that was at Gibeon was the same that so journed so long in the wilderness The tent was the same the curtains the same and the altar the same that was made by Moses or at least if there was any alteration in it as things of this nature could hardly subsist so very long without some repair the reparation was always made according to the original model and with as little deviation as possible It is not to be doubted then but that the Mosaic tabernacle is the tabernacle here intended which for the prevention of schism and to make the tem ple the centre of devotion was now taken down and repo sked in the treasury or storehouse where it continued until the time that Jerusalem was taken by the Chaldeans when Jeremiah as Josephus informs us Jewish Antiq lib viii c 2 was admonished by God to take it and the ark and the altar of incense and hide them in some 3F 284 book Vllf ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS vessels that were for ministration to the sa crifices of God and removed them to the temple The king himself and all the peo ple and the Levites went before rendering the ground moist with sacrifices and drink offerings and the blood of a great number of oblations and burning an immens quantity of incense and this till the circumambient air was so full of these odours that it met in a most agreeable manner persons at a great distance and was an indication of God s pre sence and of his habitation with them in this newly built and consecrated place For they did not grow weary either of singing hymns or of dancing until they came to the temple And in this manner did they carry the ark But when they should transfer it into the most sacred place the rest of the multitude went away and only those priests that car ried it set it between the two cherubims which embracing it with their wings for so were they framed by the artificer covered it as under a tent or a cupola Now the ark contained nothing but those two tables of stone that preserved the ten commandments which God delivered to Moses in Mount Sinai and which were engraven upon them But they set the candlestick and the table and the golden altar in the temple before the most secret place in the very same places wherein they stood till that time in the taber nacle So they offered up the daily sacrifices But for the brazen altar Solomon set it be fore the temple over against the door that when the door was opened it might be ex posed to sight and the sacred solemnities and the richness of the sacrifices might be thence seen And all the rest of the vessels they gathered together and put them within the temple Now as soon as the priests had put all things in order about the ark and were gone out a thick cloud came down and spread it self after a gentle manner into the Jtemple such a cloud it was as was diffused and tem perate not such a rough one as we see full of rain in the winter season This cloud so darkened the place that one priest could not discern another but it afforded to the minds of all a visible image and glorious secret place from whence it is doubted whether they have ever yet been removed for fear of profanation Patrick s and Calmet s Commentaries B  This solemn removal of the ark from Mount Sion to Mount Moriah at the distance of almost three quarters of a mile confutes that notion of the modern Jews and of many Christians also as if those two were one and the same mountain for which there is I think very little foundation t The number of sacrifices which upon this occasion are said to be offered was two and twenty thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep 1 Kings viii 63 but we must not suppose that these were offered all on one day much less on one altar The continuance of this meeting was for fourteen days seven in the feast of tabernacles and seven in that of the dedication and be cause the brazen altar before the door of the temple was not sufficient to receive all these sacrifices Solomon by a special license from God ordered other altars to be erected in the court of the priests and perhaps in other places which were to serve only during this present so lemnity when such a vast number of sacrifices were to be offered for at other times no other altar was allowed but this brazen one which Moses had made It is no bad ob servation however of Josephus lib viii c 2 that during the oblation of so many sacrifices the Levites took care to perfume the air with the fragrancy of incense and sweet odours to such a degree that the people were sensible of it at a distance otherwise the burning of so many beasts at one time must have occasioned an offensive smell Patrick s Commentary B J 1 Kings viii 10 II When Moses had finished the tabernacle according to the pattern which God had shewed him and set it all up it is said that a cloud covered the tent of the congre gation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle so that Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the con gregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle Exod xl 34 35 And therefore when the temple was finished and the ark brought into the sanctuary God gave the like indication of his presence and residence there Hereby he testified his acceptance of the building and furnishing of the tem ple as a service done to his name and hereby he de clared that as the glory of the ark that sacred symbol of his presence had been long eclipsed by its frequent removes and mean habitations so now his pleasure was that it should be looked upon with the same esteem and veneration as when Moses conducted it into the taber nacle For this cloud we must know was not a heavy thick opaque body such as is engendered in the air and arises from vapours and exhalations but a cloud that was dark and luminous at the same time whose darkness was awful and majestic and whose internal part was bright and refulgent darting its rays upon occasion and exhibiting its light through its obscurity so that ac cording to its different phasis or position it became to the Israelites a pillar of a cloud by day to screen them from the heat and at night a pillar of fire to give them light Exod xiii 21 Whatever it was that constituted this strange appearance it is certain this mixture of light and darkness was looked upon as a symbol of the divine presence for so the Scripture has informed us that He who dwelleth in light that is inaccessible made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him with dark water and thick clouds to cover him Psal xviii 11 Calmefs Commentary B AN 285 1048 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS appearance of God s having descended into this temple and of his having pitched his tabernacle therein So these men were in tent upon this thought But Solomon rose up for he was sitting before and used such words to God as he thought agreeable to the divine nature to receive and fit for him to give for he said Thou hast an eternal house O Lord and such a one as thou hast created for thyself out of thine own works we know it to be the heaven the air the earth and the sea which thou pervadest nor art thou contained within their limits I have indeed built this temple to thee and thy name that from thence when we sacrifice and perform sacred operations we may send our prayers up into the air and may con stantly believe that thou art present and art not remote from what is thine own For neither when thou seest and hearest all things nor now when it pleases thee to dwell here dost thou leave off the care of all men but rather thou art very near to them all and especially thou art present to those that address themselves to thee whe ther by night or by day When he had thus solemnly addressed himself to God he turned his discourse to the multitude and strongly represented the power and provi dence of God to them How he had shewn all things that were to come to pass to David his father as many of those things had already come to pass and the rest would certainly come to pass hereafter And how he had given him his name and told to David what he should be called before he was born and foretold that when he should be king after his father s death he should build him a temple which since they saw accom plished according to his prediction he re quired them to bless God and by believing him from what they had seen accomplished never to despair of any thing that he had pro mised for the future in order to their happi ness or suspect that it would not come to pass When the king had spoken thus he looked again towards the temple and lifting up his right hand to the multitude he said It is not possible by what men can do to return sufficient thanks to God for his benefits be stowed upon them for the Deity stands in need of nothing and is above any such re quital But so far as we have been superior O Lord to other animals by thee it becomes us to bless thy majesty and it is necessary for us to return thee thanks for what thou hast bestowed on our house and on the He brew people For with what other instru ments can we better appease thee when thou art angry at us or more properly preserve thy favour than with our voice which as we have it from the air so do we know that by that air it ascends upwards towards thee I therefore ought myself to return thee thanks thereby in the first place concerning my father whom thou hast rained from obscurity unto so great glory and in the next place concerning myself since thou hast performed all that thou promisedst unto this very day And I beseech thee for the time to come to afford us whatsoever thou O God hast power to bestow on such as thou didst esteem and to augment our house for all ages as thou hast promised to David my father to do both in his life time and at his death that our kingdom should continue and that his posterity should successively receive it to ten thousand generations Do not therefore fail to give us these blessings and to bestow on my children that virtue in which thou delightest And besides all this I humbly beseech thee that thou wilt let some portion of thy Spirit come down and inhabit in this temple that thou mayest appear to be with us upon earth As to thyself the entire heavens and the immensity of the things that are therein are but a small habi tation for thee much more is this poor temple But I intreat thee to keep it as thine own house from being destroyed by our enemies for ever and to take care of it as thine own possession If this people be found to have sinned and be thereupon afflicted by thee with any plague because of their sin as with dearth pestilence or any other affliction which thou usest to inflict on those that transgress any of thy holy laws and if they fly all of them to this temple be seeching thee to deliver them then do thou hear their prayer as being within this house and have mercy upon them and deliver them from their afflictions Nay moreover this help is what I implore of thee not for the Hebrews only when they are in distress but when any shall come hither from any ends of the world and shall return from their sins 3F2 286 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and implore thy pardon do thou then pardon them and hear their prayer For hereby all shall learn that thou wast pleased with the building of this house and that we are not ourselves of an unsociable nature nor behave ourselves like enemies to such as are not of our own people but are willing that thy assistance should be communicated to all men in common and that they may have the enjoyment of thy benefits bestowed upon them When Solomon had said this and had cast himself upon the ground and worshipped a long time he arose up and brought sacrifices to the altar and when he had filled it with unblemished victims he evidently discovered that God had with pleasure accepted of all that he had sacrificed to him for there came a fire running out of the air and rushed with Violence upon the altar in the sight of all and caught hold of and consumed the sacri fices Now when this divine appearance was seen the people supposed it to be a demon stration of God s abode in the temple and were pleased with it and fell down upon the ground and worshipped Upon which the king began to bless God and exhorted the multitude to do the same as now having sufficient indication of God s favourable dis position to them and to pray that they might always have the like indications from him and that he would preserve in them a mind pure from all wickedness in righteousness and religious worship and that they might continue in the observance of those precepts which God had given them by Moses be cause by that means the Hebrew nation would be so happy and indeed the most blessed of all nations among all mankind He exhorted them also to be mindful that by what methods they had obtained their present good things by the same they must preserve them to themselves and make them greater and more than they were at present For that it was not sufficient for them to suppose they had received them on account of their piety and righteousness but that they had no other way of preserving them for the time to come for it is not so great a thing for men to acquire somewhat which they want as to preserve what they have acquired and to be guilty of no sin whereby it may be hurt So when the king had spoken thus he dis solved the congregation but not till he had completed his oblations both for himself and for the Hebrews insomuch that he sacrificed twenty two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep For then it was that the temple did first taste of the victims and all the Hebrews with their wives and children feasted therein Nay besides this the king then observed splendidly and mag nificently the feast of tabernacles before the temple for fourteen days and he then feasted together with all the people When all these solemnities were performed and nothing was omitted that concerned the divine worship the king dismissed them and they every one went to their own homes giving thanks to the king for the care he had taken of them and the works he had done for them and praying to God to preserve Solomon to be their king for a long time they also took their journey home with re joicing and singing hymns to God And in deed the pleasure they enjoyed took away the sense of the pains they all underwent in their journey home So when they had brought the ark into the temple and had seen its greatness and had been partakers of the sacrifices that had been offered and of the festivals that had been solemnized they returned to their own cities But a dream that appeared to the king in his sleep in formed him that God had heard his prayers and that he would not only preserve the temple but would always abide in it that is in case his posterity and the whole multi tude would be righteous And for himself if he continued obedient to the admonitions of his father God would advance him to an immense degree of dignity and happiness so that then his posterity should be kings of that country of the tribe of Judah for ever But that still if he should be a betrayer of the ordinances of the law and forget them and turn away to the worship of strange gods he would cut him off by the roots and would neither suffer any remainder of his family to continue nor would watch over the people of Israel nor preserve them any longer from afflictions but would utterly destroy them with wars and misfortunes would cast them out of the land which he had given their fathers and make them sojourners in strange lands and deliver that temple which was aN 1048 287 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS now built to be burnt and spoiled by their enemies and that city to be utterly over thrown by the hands of their enemies and make their miseries proverbial and such as should hardly be credited for their stupen dous magnitude till their neighbours when they should hear of them should wonder at their calamities and earnestly inquire for the occasion why the Hebrews who had been before advanced by God to such wealth and glory should be then so hated by him and that the answer that should be made by the remainder of the people should be by con fessing their sins and their transgression of the laws of their country  CHAP V OF THE ROYAL PALACE ERECTED BV KING SOLOMON AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE RIDDLES SENT HIM BV HIRAM AFTER the building of the temple which we have before said was finished in seven years the king laid the foundation of his palace which he did not finish under thirteen years For he was not equally zealous in the building of this palace as he had been about the temple For although that was a great work and re quired wonderful application yet God for whom it was made so far co operated there with that it was finished in the aforemen tioned number of years But the palace which was a building much inferior in dignity to the temple both on account that its mate rials had not been so long beforehand pre pared and on account that this was only a habitation for kings and not for God it was longer in finishing However this building was raised so magnificently as suited the happy state of the country of the Hebrews and of the king thereof But it is necessary that I describe the entire structure and dis position of the parts that so those who pe ruse this book may thereby make a conjec ture and as it were have a prospect of its magnitude This house was a large and curious edifice which Solomon built for hearing causes and taking cognizance of suits It was sufficiently capacious to contain a great body of men who would come together to have their causes determined It was a hundred cubits long fifty broad and thirty high supported by quadrangular pillars which were all of cedar but its roof was according to the JCo rinthian order with folding doors and their adjoining pillars of equal magnitude each fluted with three cavities which building was at once firm and very ornamental There was also another house so ordered that its entire breadth was placed in the middle It was quadrangular and its breadth was thirty cubits having a temple over against it raised upon many pillars in which temple there was a large and magnificent room wherein the king sat in judgment To this was joined another house that was built for his queen There were other smaller edifices for diet and for sleep after public matters were over and these were all floored with boards of cedar Some of these Solomon built with stones of ten cubits and lined the walls with other stones that were of great value such as are dug out the earth for the ornaments of temples and to make fine prospects in royal palaces and which make the mines whence they are dug famous Now the contexture of the curious workmanship of these stones was in three rows but the fourth row was adorned with sculptures which represented trees and all sorts of plants with the shades that arose from their branches and leaves that hung down from them These trees and plants covered the stone that was beneath them and their leaves were wrought so pro digiously thin and subtile that you would  1 Kings ht 1â 9 t 1 Kings vii 1â 12 J This mention of the Corinthian ornaments of archi tecture in Solomon s palace by Josephus seems to be here set down by way of prolepsis For although it ap pears to me that the Grecian and Roman most ancient orders of architecture were taken from Solomon s temple as from their original patterns yet it is not so clear that the last and most ornamental order the Corinthian was so ancient Although what the same Josephus says Of the War V 5 that one of the gates of Herod s temple was built according to the rules of this Corinthian order is no way improbable that order being without dispute much older than the reign of Herod However upon some trial 1 confess I have not hitherto been able fully to understand the structure of this palace of Solomon s either as described in our Bibles or even with the addi tional help of this description here by Josephus So I add no more notes about it Only the reader may easily observe with me that the measures of this first building in Josephus 100 cubits long and 50 cubits broad are the very same with the area of the court of the taber nacle of Moses and just half an Egyptian aroura or acre 288 book viit ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS think they were in motion But the other part up to the roof was plastered over and as it were embroidered with colours and pictures He built other edifices for plea sure as also very long cloisters and those situate in an agreeable part of the palace and among them a most noble dining room for feastings and full of such furniture as so fine a room ought to have for the conveniency of the guests and where all the vessels were made of gold Now it is very hard to reckon the magnitude and the variety of the royal apartments how many rooms there were of the largest sort how many of a bigness infe rior to those and how many that were sub terraneous and invisible the curiosity of those that enjoyed the fresh air and the groves for the most delightful prospect for the avoiding the heat and the covering of their bodies In a word Solomon made the whole building entirely of white stone and cedar wood and gold and silver He also adorned the roofs and the walls with stones set in gold and beautified them in the same manner as he had beautified the temple of God with the like stones He also made himself a large throne of ivory constructed as a seat of justice and having six steps to it On every one of which stood on each end of the step two lions two other lions standing above also but at the sitting place of the throne hands came out and received the king and when he sat backward he rested on a half bullock that looked towards his back but still all was fastened together with gold When Solomon had completed all this in ftwenty years time because Hiram king of Tyre had contributed a great deal of gold and more silver to these buildings as also cedar wood and pine wood he rewarded Hiram with rich presents corn he sent him also year by year and wine and oil which were the principal things he stood in need of because he inhabited an island as we have already said And besides these he granted him twenty cities of GalileeJ that lay not far from Tyre which when Hiram went to and viewed and did not like the gift he sent word to Solomon that he did not want such cities as they were And after that time those cities were called the land of Cabul which name if it be interpreted according to the language of the Phoenicians denotes what does not please Moreover the king of Tyre Ijsent sophisms and enigmatical sayings to Solomon and desired he would return their solutions Now so sagacious and under standing was Solomon that none of these problems were too hard for him but he con quered them all by his reasonings and disco vered their hidden meaning and brought it  1 Kings x 18 t From an 1052 to 1032 B C J It 13 an express injunction which God gives the Israel ites that the land wherein the people had a right by divine lot and himself a right as being the sole proprietor thereof was not to be sold or alienated for ever Lev xxv 23 How then could Solomon without violating this law pretend to give Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee Now to this some have replied that Solomon did not give Hiram a property and perpetual right to those cities but only assigned him the possession of them for a time until the debt which he had contracted for the several supplies he had from him while he was building the temple was satisfied Others think that upon supposition that these cities were inhabited by Israelites Solomon did not give Hiram as indeed he could not their particular posses sions but only his own royalties over them which he might justly do and all the profits he received from them which according to the taxes then imposed 1 Kings xii 4 were not inconsiderable But there is no reason for these far fetched solutions when the Scripture expressly tells us that these cities were not in the territories of Israel nor inhabited at that time by the Israelites 2 Chron viii 2 They were indeed some of them conquered by the king of Egypt who gave them to Solomon as a portion with his daughter and others by Solomon himself who as Seidell observes De Jure Nat et Gen lib vi cap 16 had  a right to dispose of those lands which he had con quered in voluntary war without the consent of the senate And this may be one reason why he gave these rather than other cities because these were certainly in his own power to give when others perhaps were not A learned author upon this subject has given a quite different turn to the sense of the passage For his opinion is that Hiram did not return these cities because he thought them not good enough but because he was unwilling to receive so large a remuneration for the few good offices he had done Solomon and was minded rather that his favours of this kind should be all gratuitous He therefore makes the word Cabul which is the name that Hiram gives to the country where these cities stood a title of respect and not of contempt for he derives it from the Hebrew Chebes which signifies a bond or chain intimating that these two neighbouring kings had mutually bound themselves in a bond of friendship Solomon by giving and Hiram by returning the cities now under consideration This is very pretty but it is carrying the point of generosity in the king of Tyre a little too high in my opinion considering his acceptance of if not express stipulation for such a quantity of corn and oil in lieu of the timber which he sent Solomon 1 Kings v 10 11 Patrick s and Le Clerks Commentaries and Pool s Annotations B I I About an 1030 AN 1030 289 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to light Menander also one who translated the Tyrian archives out of the dialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language makes mention of these two kings where he says When Abibalus was dead his son Hiram received the kingdom from him who when he had lived fifty three years reigned thirty four He raised a bank in a large place and dedicated the golden pillar which is in Ju piter s temple He also went and cut down materials of timber out of the mountain called Li ban us for the roofs of temples and when he had pulled down the ancient temples he both built the temple of Hercules and that of Astarte and he first set up the temple of Hercules in the Peritius he also made an expedition against the Euchii or Titii who did not pay their tribute and when he had subdued them to himself he returned Under this king there was Abdemon a youth in age who always conquered the difficult roblems which Solomon king of Jerusa em commanded him to explain Dius also made mention of him where he says When Abibalus was dead his son Hiram reigned He raised the eastern parts of the city higher and made the city itself larger He also joined the temple of Jupiter which before stood by itself to the city by raising a bank in the middle between them and he adorned it with donations of gold More over he went up to mount Libanus and cut down materials of wood for the building of the temples He says also that Solomon who was then king of Jerusalem sent rid dles to Hiram and desired to receive the like from him but that he who could not solve them should pay money to him that did solve them and that Hiram accepted the conditions and when he was not able to solve the riddles he paid a great deal of money for his fine But that he afterward did solve the proposed riddles by the means of Abdemon a man of Tyre and that Hiram proposed other riddles which when Solo mon could not solve he paid back a great deal of money to Hiram This is it which Dius wrote CHAP VI OF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF JERUSALEM THE ERECTION OF THE OTHER CITIES BY SOLOMON J HIS SUBJUGATION OF SOME OF THE CANAANITES AND HIS ENTERTAINMENT OF THE QUEEN OF EGYPT AND ETHI0TIA NOWf when the king saw that the walls of Jerusalem stood in need of being better secured and made stronger for he thought the walls that encompassed Jerusa lem ought to correspond with the dignity of the city he both repaired them and made them higher with great towers upon them he also built cities which might be counted among the strongest Hazor and Megiddo and the third Gezer which had indeed be longed to the Philistines but Pharaoh the king of Egypt had made an expedition against it and besieged it and taken it by force when he had slain all its inhabitants he utterly overthrew it and gave it as a present to his daughter who had been mar ried to Solomon For this reason the king rebuilt it as a city that was naturally strong and might be useful in wars and the muta tions of affairs that sometimes happen More over he built two other cities not far from it Beth horon was the name of one of them and Baalath of the other He also built other cities that lay conveniently for these in order to the enjoyment of pleasures and delicacies in them such as were naturally of good tem perature of the air and agreeable for fruits ripe in their proper seasons and well watered with springs Nay Solomon went as far as the desert above Syria and possessed himself of it and built there a very large city which was distant two days journey from the upper Syria and one day s journey from Euphrates and six long days journey from Babylon the great Now the reason why this city lay so remote from the parts of Syria that are inha bited is this that below there is no water to be had and that it is in that place only that there are springs and pits of water When he had therefore built this city and encom passed it with very strong walls he gave it the name of Tadmor J and that is the name  Pr bably the Tyrians t About an 1025 J Tadmor which by the Greeks is called Palmyra is situated in the wilderness of Syria upon the borders of Arabia Deserta inclining towards the Euphrates Jo sephus places it two days journey from the upper Syria one day s journey from the Euphrates and six days journey from Babylon and the reason he gives why So lomon was inclined to build a city in this place was be cause in all the country round about there was no such 290 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS it is called by at this day among the Syrians but the Greeks name it Palmyra Now Solomon the king was at this time engaged in building these cities But if any inquire why all the kings of Egypt from Menes who built Memphis and was many years earlier than our forefather Abraham until Solomon where the interval was more than one thousand three hundred years were called Pharaohs and took it from one Pharaoh that lived after the kings of that interval I think it necessary to inform them of it and this in order to cure their ignorance and to make the occasion of that name manifest Pharaoh in the Egyptian tongue signifies fa king But I suppose they made use of other names from their childhood but when they were made kings they changed them into the name which in their own tongue denoted their authority For thus it was also that the kings of Alexandria who were called formerly by other names when they took the kingdom were named Ptolemies from their first king The Roman emperors also were from their nativity called by other names but are styled Caesars their empire and their dignity im posing that name upon them and not suf fering them to continue those names which their fathers gave them I suppose also that Herodotus of Halicarnassus when he said there were Jthree hundred and thirty kings of Egypt after Menes who built Memphis did therefore not tell us their names because they were in common called Pharaohs For when after death there was a queen reigned he calls her by her name Nicaule as thereby declaring that while the kings were of the male line and so admitted of the same name while a woman did not admit the same he therefore set down that her name which she could not naturally have As for myself I have discovered from our own books that after Pharaoh the father in law of Solomon no other king of Egypt did any longer use that name and that it was after that time when the queen of Egypt and Ethiopia came to Solomon concerning whom we shall inform the reader presently But I have now made mention of these things that I may prove that our books and those of the Egyptians agree together in many things King Solomon subdued to himself the rem nant of the Canaanites that had not befo re submitted to him those I mean that dwelt in mount Lebanon and as far as the city Ha math and ordered them to pay tribute He also chose out of them every year such as were to serve him in the meanest offices and to do his domestic works and to follow husbandry For none of the Hebrews were thing as a well or fountain but in this spot only to be found If we may guess by the ruins which later tra vellers give us the description of this city was certainly one of the finest and most magnificent in the east and it is somewhat surprising that history should give us no account either when or by whom it was reduced to the sad condition wherein it lies at this day But the true reason for his building this town in so desolate a place was the commodiousness of its situation to cut off all commerce between the Syrians and Mesopotamians and to prevent their caballing and conspiring together against him as they had done against his father David Le Clerc s Commentary If the reader is desirous to know the pre sent state of this ruinated city he may find it related in the Philosophical Transactions for October 1C95 in a letter from Dr Halifax to Dr Bernard or in Well s Geography of the Old Testament vol iii who has bor rowed it from thence B  It is a well known and very true observation of Am raianus Marcellinus near the beginning of his XlVth book that the Greek and Roman names of places were never among the natives of Syria which is the reason why most places retain their adopted original names at this day This is in effect the note of Mr Mnundrell page 53 and is perfectly agreeable to Josephus s observa tion here We have an account of the wonderful remains of this Tadmor or Palmyra in our Philosophical Transac tions No 318 to which I refer the reader t This signification of the name of Pharaoh appears to be true And Mr Reland himself says Piouro in the Coptic tongue is a king which the Greeks would pro nounce afaw What Josephus adds presently that in his copy no king of Egypt was called Pharaoh after Solomon s father in law does hardly agree with our copies which have long afterwards the names of Pha raoh Necho and Pharaoh Hophrn 2 Kings xxiii 29 Jer xliv 30 besides the frequent mention of that name in the Prophets However Josephus in his own speech to the Jews Of the War V 9 speaks of Nechao who was also called Pharaoh as the name of that king of Egypt with whom Abraham was concerned of which name Nechao yet we have elsewhere no mention till the days of Josiah but only of Pharaoh And indeed it must be confessed that in this chapter we have more mistakes made by Josephus and those relating to the kings of Egypt and to that Queen of Egypt and Ethiopia whom he supposes to have come to see Solomon than almost any where else in all his Antiquities and which are particularly taken notice of by Bochart in his Phaleg II 26 of the occasions of which mistakes I cÂ n give DO account  Of

employments Nor was it reasonable that when God had brought so many nations under their power they should depress their own people to such mean offices of lite rather than those na tions While the Israelites were concerned in warlike affairs and were in armour and set over the chariots and the horses rather than leading the life of slaves He also ap pointed five hundred and fifty rulers over those Canaanites who were reduced to such domestic slavery who received the care of them from the king and instructed them in those labours and operations wherein he wanted their assistance The king also built many ships in the Egyptian bay of the Red Sea in a certain place called Eziongeber but now called Berenice and not far from the city Eloth This country belonged formerly to the Jews and became useful for shipping from the donations of Hiram king of Tyre For he sent a sufficient number of men thither for pilots and such as were skilful in navigation to whom Solomon gave this command that they should go along with his stewards to the land that was of old called fOphir but now the Aurea Chersonesus which belongs to India to fetch him gold And when they had gathered four hundredJ talents together they returned to the king There was then a woman queen of Egypt and Ethiopia she was inquisitive in phi losophy and one that on other accounts also was to be admired When this queen heard of the virtue and prudence of Solomon she had a great mind to see him and the re Eorts that went every day abroad induced er to come to him she being desirous to be satisfied by her own experience and not by a bare hearing for reports thus heard are likely enough to comply with a false opinion while they wholly depend on the credit of the relators so she resolved to come to him and that especially in order to have a trial of his wisdom while she proposed questions of very great difficulty and in treated that he would resolve their hidden meaning Accordingly she came to Jerusa lem with great splendour and rich furniture for she brought her camels laden with gold with several sorts of sweet spices and with precious stones Now upon the king s kind reception of her he both shewed a great de sire to please her and easily comprehending in his mind the meaning of the curious ques tions she propounded to him he resolved them sooner than any body could have ex pected So she was amazed at the wisdom of Solomon and discovered that it was more excellent upon trial than what she had heard by report beforehand In particular she was surprised at the fineness and largeness of his royal palace and not less so at the good order of the apartments for she observed that the king had therein shewn great wis dom But she was beyond measure asto nished at the house which was called Â the forest of Lebanon as also at the magnificence of his daily table and the circumstances of its preparation and ministration with the ap parel of his servants that waited and the skilful and decent management of their at tendance Nor was she less affected with those daily sacrifices which were offered to God and the careful management which the Priests and Levites used about them When she saw this done every day she was in the greatest admiration imaginable insomuch that she was not able to contain the surprise  About an 1024 t What Josephus affirms here that Ophir or as his and the Septuagint copies spell it Sophir was the same with the Aurea Chersoaesus or rather with the adjoining island of Taprobane now called Ceylon is the very pro bable opinion of the great Bochart Canaan I 46 But it is yet not so certain as to be agreed to by all others See the note on IX 1 Four hundred and twenty 1 Kings ix 28 That this queen of Sheba was a queen of Sabaea in South Arabia and not of Egypt and Ethopia as Jose phus here asserts is I suppose now generally agreed And since Sabaea is well known to be a country near the sea in the south of Arabia Felix which lay south from Judea also and since our Saviour calls this queen voL I â NOS 25  26 the Queen of the South and says she came from the utmost parts of the earth Matt xii 42 Luke xi 31 which description agrees better to this Arabia than to Egypt and Ethiopia there is little occasion for doubting in this matter The common mistake which is much older than Josephus nay as old as the Septuagint version that Cush signified Ethiopia beyond Egypt which Bochart has fully proved to denote Arabia Phaleg IV 2 very probably misled Josephus into his hypothesis Â Whether Solomon s house of the forest of Lebanon were at Jerusalem or whether it were not rather at Bal bec between Libanns and Antilibanus may be doubted See for the latter interpretation Authent Rec vol II page 887 888 3G 292 BOOK Till ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS she was in but openly confessed how wonder fully she was affected For she proceeded to discourse with the king and thereby owned that she was overcome with admiration at the things before related and said All things indeed O king that come to our knowledge by report come with uncertainty as to our belief of them but as to those good things that to thee appertain both such as thou possessest 1 mean wisdom and prudence and the happiness thou hast from thy kingdom certainly the fame which came to us was no falsity it was not only a true report but it related thy happiness after a much lower manner than I now see it to be before my eyes For as for the report it only attempted to persuade our hearing but did not so make known the dignity of the things themselves as does the sight of them and being present among them I indeed who did not believe what was reported by reason of the multi tude and grandeur of the things I inquired about do see them to be much more nu merous than they were reported to be Ac cordingly I esteem the Hebrew people as well as thy servants and friends to be happy who enjoy thy presence and hear thy wisdom every day continually One would therefore bless God who hath so loved this country and those that inhabit therein as to make thee king over them Now when the queen had thus demon strated how deeply the king had affected her she made that disposition known by certain presents For she gave him twenty talents of gold and an immense quantity of spices and precious stones They say also that we possess the froot of that balsam â which our country still bears by this wo man s gift Solomon also repaid her with many good things and principally by be stowing upon her what she chose of her own inclination for there was nothing that she desired which he denied her And as he was very generous and liberal in his own temper so did he shew the greatness of his soul in bestowing upon her what she her self desired of him So when this queen of Egypt and Ethiopia had obtained what we have already given an account of and had again communicated to the king what she brought with her she returned to her own kingdom J CHAP VII of Solomon s immense riches his love of strange women the subsequent rebellion of ader and je roboam and the death of solomon ABOUT the same time there were brought to the king from the Aurea Chersonesus a country so called precious stones and pine trees and these trees he made use of for supporting the temple and the palace as also for the materials of musi cal instruments the harps and the psalteries that the Levites might make use of them in their hymns to God The wood which was brought to him at the time was larger and liner than any that had ever been brought before But let no one imagine that these pine trees were like those which are now so named and which take their denomination from the merchants who so call them that they may procure them to be admired by those that purchase them For those we speak of were to the sight like the wood of the fig tree but were whiter and more shining Â Now we have said thus much that nobody may be ignorant of the difference be  A hundred and twenty Hebrew and Septuagint which I suppose to be the true number t Some blame Josephus for supposing that the balsam tree might be first brought out of Arabia or Egypt or Ethiopia into Judea by this queen of Sheba since seve ral have said that of old no country bore this precious balsam but Judea Yet as my learned friend Mr Barker suggested to me from Bochart s Phaleg II 26 it is not only false that this balsam was peculiar to Judea but both Egypt and Arabia and particularly Sabxa had it which last was that very country whence Josephus if understood not of Ethiopia but of Arabia intimates this queen might bring it first into Judea This Bochart proves from Agatharchides Diodorus Siculus and Arte midorus in Strabo Nor are we to suppose that the queen of Sabaea could well omit such a present as this balsam tree would be esteemed by Solomon in case it were then almost peculiar to her own country Nor is the mention of balsam as carried by merchants and sent as a present to Judea by Jacob to the governor of Egypt Gen xxxvii 15 and xliii 11 to be alleged to the con trary since what we there render balm or balsam de notes rather that turpentine which we now cull turpentine of Chio or Cyprus the juice of the turpentine tree than this precious balsam This last is also the same word that we elsewhere render by the like mistake balm of Gilead It should be rendered the turpentine of Gilead Jer

genuine pine tree Now the weight of gold that was brought the king was six hundred and sixty six talents not including what was brought by the merchants nor what the toparchs and kings of Arabia gave him in presents he also cast two hundred targets of gold each of them weighing six hundred shekels He also made three hundred shields every one weighing three pounds of gold and he had them carried and put into that house which was called the forest of Lebanon He also made cups of gold and of precious stones for the entertainment of his guests and had them adorned in the most curious manner and he contrived that all his other furniture of vessels should be of gold for there was nothing then to be sold or bought for silver For the king had many ships which lay upon the sea at Tarsus these he commanded to carry out all sorts of merchandise unto the remotest nations by the sale of which silver and gold were brought to the king and a great quantity of ivory and Ethiopians and apes and they finished their voyage going and returning in three years time Accordingly there went a great fame all round the neighbouring countries which pro claimed the virtue and wisdom of Solomon insomuch that all the kings were desirous to see him as not giving credit to what was re ported on account of its being most incre dible they also demonstrated the regard they had for him by the presents they made him For they sent him vessels of gold and silver and purple garments and many sorts of spices and horses and chariots and as many mules for his carriages as they could find proper to please the king s eyes by their strength and beauty This addition that he made to those chariots and horses which he had before from these that were sent him augmented the number of his chariots by above four hundred for he had a thousand before f and augmented the number of his horses by two thousand for he had twenty thousand before These horses also were so much exercised in order to their making a fine appearance and running swiftly that no others could upon the comparison appear either finer or swifter but they were at once the most beautiful of all others and their swiftness was incomparable also Their riders were a farther ornament to them being in the first place young men in the most delightful flower of their age and emi nent for their stature far taller than other men They had also very long hair hanging down and were clothed in garments of Tyrian purple They had also dust of gold every day sprinkled on their hair so that their heads sparkled with the reflection of the sun s beams from the gold The king himself rode upon a chariot in the midst of these men who were still in armour and had their bows fitted to them He had on a white garment and used to take his progress out of the city in the morning There was a cer tain place about fifty furlongs distant from Jerusalem which is called JEtham very pleasant in fine gardens and abounding with rivulets of water Thither did he use to go out in the morning sitting on high in his chariot Now Solomon had a divine sagacity in all who perhaps brought elephants out of India or at least took care to have a great deal of i ory imported from thence for in after ages we read of ivory beds and ivory palaces c At this time however it was every whit as precious as gold and therefore we must not sup pose that this throne of Solomon s was entirely overlaid with gold for then it might as well be made of wood but only in particular places that so the mixture of gold and ivory which gave a lustre to each other might make the throne look more beautiful The like to this the text says there was not made in any kingdom 1 Kings x 20 and perhaps it was so in those days but in after ages we read that the throne of the Parthian kings was of gold encompassed with four golden pillars beset with precious stones and that the Persian kings sat in judgment under a golden vine and other trees of gold the bunches of whose grapes were made of several sorts of precious stones Patrick s Commentary B  About an 1018 t 1 Kings x 26 J Whether these fine gardens and rivulets of Etham about six miles from Jerusalem whither Solomon rode so often in state be not those alluded to Eccles ii 5 6 where he says he made him gardens and orchards and planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits he made him pools of water to water the wood that bringeth forth trees and to the finest part whereof he seems to allude when in the Canticles be compares his spouse to a garden enclosed to a spring shut up to a fountain sealed chap iv 12

rivers of Etham which Providence once dried up in a miracu lous manner Psal Ixxiv 15 in the Septuagint and Con stitut Apost VIII 12 page 402 I cannot say 3G2 294 tiO Ott VFtt ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS things and was very diligent and studious to have things done after an elegant manner So he did not neglect the care of the ways but he laid a causeway of black stone along the roads that led to his royal city of Jeru salem both to render them easy for travel lers and to manifest the grandeur of his riches and government He also parted his chariots and set them in a regular order that a certain number of them should be in every city still keeping a few about him and those cities he called the cities of his chariots And the king made silver so plen tiful in Jerusalem as stones in the street and so multiplied cedar trees in the plains of Judea which did not grow there before that they were like the multitude of common sycamore trees He also ordained the Egyp tian merchants that brought him their mer chandise to sell him a chariot with a pair of horses for fsix hundred drachmae of silver and he sent them to the kings of Syria and to those kings that were beyond Euphrates But although Solomon was become the most glorious of kings and the best beloved of God and had exceeded in wisdom and riches those that had been rulers of the He brews before him yet did he not persevere in this happy state till he died But he for sook the observance of the laws of his fathers and came to an end no way suitable to our foregoing history of him He grew mad in his love of women and laid no restraint on himself in his lusts Nor was he satisfied with the women of his own country alone but he married many wives out of foreign nations J Sidonians and Tyrians Ammonites and Edomites and he transgressed the laws of Moses which prohibited Jews from mar rying any but those that were of their own people He also began to worship theiÂ gods which he did in order to the gratifica tion of his wives and out of bis affection fop them This very thing our legislator sus pected and so admonished us beforehand that we should not marry women of other countries lest we should be entangled with foreign customs and apostatize from our ownj lest we should leave off to honour our own God and should worship their idols But Solomon was fallen headlong into unreason able pleasures and regarded not those ad monitions For when he bad married seven hundred wives Â the daughters of princes and of eminent persons and three hundred con cubines and these besides the king of Egypt s daughter he soon was governed by them till he came to imitate their practices He was forced to give them this demonstration of his kindness and affection to them to live according to the laws of their countries And as he grew into years and his reason  1 Kings x 27 t Two thousand four hundred shekels or 2851b J Notwithstanding the vast multitude of wives that Solomon had the Scriptures make mention of no more than three children this son and two daughters that are spoken of 1 Kings iv 11 15 and what is strange in the beginning of his story it takes no notice as usually it does of his mother s nation or family though in the con clusion of it 1 Kings xiv 21â 31 it twice reminds us that she was an Ammonitess by birth and that her name was Naamah Rehoboam was born in the first year of his father s reign and was therefore much about forty one when he entered upon the government but he was an unskilful and imprudent man and therefore made a very false step at his first accession to the throne The author of Ecclesiasticus gives us no advantageous character of him when he terms him A man void of understanding wJro turned the people away with his counsel chap xlvii 23 Nay his own son makes but a faint apology for him when he tells the people that he was young young in understanding and tender hearted and could not with stand his enemies 2 Chron xiii 7 and therefore some have imagined that his father Solomon had him in his thoughts when he said in his Preacher I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun because I was to leave it to a man that should come after me And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I havfe laboured This also is vanity chap it 18 19 Calmet s and Patrick s Commentaries B II About an 999 B C Â These 700 wives or the daughters of great men and the SOO concubines the daughters of ignoble make 1000 in all and are I suppose those very 1000 women intr mated elsewhere by Solomon himself when he speaks of his not having found one good woman among that very number Eccles vii 28  Pharaoh s daughter is generally supposed to have been a proselyte to the Jewish religion and therefore Solomon in marrying her incurred no fault but in mar rying so many women besides and these of a different religion he committed two sins against the law one in multiplying wives and another in marrying those of strange nations who still retained their idolatry And therefore the wise son of Sirach amidst all the encomiums that he heaps upon Solomon could not forget this heinous iniquity and terrible flaw in his character â Thou didst bow thy loins to women and by thy body thou wast brought into subjection Thou didst stain thine honour and pollute thy seed so that thou broushtest wrath upon thy children and wast grieved for thy folly Eccles xlvii 19 20 Patrick s Commentary B mr 1016 295 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS became weaker by the length of time it was not sufficient to recall to his mind the institu tions of his own country so he still more and more contemned his own God and continued to regard the gods that his marriages had in troduced Nay before this happened he sinned and fell into an error about the ob servance of the laws when he made the images of brazen oxen that supported the brazen sea and the images of lions about his own throne for these he made although it was not agreeable to piety so to do And this he did notwithstanding that he had his father as a most excellent and domestic pat tern of virtue and knew what a glorious character he had left behind him because of his piety towards God Nor did he imitate David although God had twice appeared to him in his sleep and exhorted him so to do There came therefore a prophet to him who was sent by God and told him that his wicked actions were not concealed from God and threatened him that he should not long rejoice at what he had done that in deed the kingdom should not be taken from him while he was alive because God had promised to his father David that he would make him his successor but that he would take care that this should befall his son when he was dead Not that he would withdraw all the people from him but that he would give ten tribes to a servant of his and leave only two tribes to David s grandson for his sake because he loved God and for the sake of the city Jerusalem wherein he would have a temple When Solomon heard this he was grieved and greatly confounded upon this change of almost all that happiness which had made him to be admired into so bad a state Nor had there much time passed after the prophet had foretold what was coming before God raised up an enemy against him whose name was Hadad f who took the following occa sion of his enmity to him He was a child of the stock of the Edomites and of the blood royal And when Joab the captain of David s host laid waste the land of Edom and de stroyed all that were men grown and able to bear arms for six months time this Hadad fled away and came to Pharaoh king of Egypt who received him kindly and as signed him a house to dwell in and a country to supply him with food And when he was grown up he loved him exceedingly inso much that he gave him his wife s sister whose name was Tahpenes to wife by whom he had a son who was brought up with the king s children When Hadad heard in Egypt that both David and Joab were dead he came to Pharaoh and desired that he would permit him to go to his own country The king asked what it was that he wanted and what hardships he had met with that he was so desirous to leave him and when he was often troublesome to him and intreated him to dismiss him he did not then do it But at the time when Solomon s affairs began to grow worse on account of his aforemen tioned transgressions and God s anger against him for the same Hadad by Pharaoh s per mission came to Edom and when he was not able to make the people to forsake Solomon for it was kept under by many garrisons and an innovation was not to be made with safety he removed thence and came into  Josephus is here certainly too severe upon Solomon who in making the cherubims and these twelve brazen oxen seems to have done no more than imitate the pat terns left him by David which were all given David by divine inspiration See my Description of the Temples chap x And although God gave no direction for the lions that adorned his throne yet does not Solomon seem therein to have broken any law of Moses For although the Pharisees and later Rabbins have extended the second commandment to forbid the very making of any image though without any intention to have it worshipped yet do not I suppose that Solomon so understood it nor that it ought to be so understood The making any other altar for worship but that at the tabernacle was equally forbidden by Moses Antiq IV 3 yet did not the two tribes and a half offend when they made an altar for a memorial only Josh xxii Antiq V 1 t Hadad was a young prince of the royal family of idumea who fled into Egypt when David conquered that country For David having obtained a signal victory under the conduct of Abishai who at that time com manded in chief sent Joab afterwards with an order to kill all the males that should be found in the land But Hadad had escaped into Egypt where finding favour in the eyes of the king he married his wife s sister and there settled But after the death of David he returned into Idumea and gave Solomon no small molestation Calmet s Com mentary B J Since the beginning of Solomon s evil life and adver sity was the time when Hadad who was born at least twenty or thirtv years before Solomon came to the crown in the days of David began to give him disturbance this implies that Solomon s evil life began early and continued very long which the multitude of his wives and concu bines does also imply I suppose he was not fifty years of age j 296 book nn ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Syria There he met with one Rezon who had run away from Hadadezer f king of Zobah his master and was become a robber in that country and joined friendship with him who had already a band of robbers about him So he went up and seized upon that part of Syria and was made king thereof He also made incursions into the land of Israel and did in it no small mischief and spoiled it and that in the life time of Solomon And such was the calamity which the Hebrews suffered by Hadad There was also one of Solomon s own nation that made an attempt against him Jeroboam the son of Nebat who had an ex pectation of rising from a prophecy that had been made to him long before He was left a child by his father and brought up by his mother and when Solomon saw that he was of an active and bold disposition he made him the curator of the walls which he built round about Jerusalem And he took such care of those works that the king approved of his behaviour and gave him as a reward for the same the charge over the tribe of Joseph And when about that time Jeroboam was once going out of Jerusalem a prophet of the city Shilo whose name was Ahijah met him and saluted him and when he had taken him a little aside to the place where there was no one present he rent the gar ment he had into twelve pieces and bade Jeroboam take ten of them saying  This is the will of God he will part the dominion of Solomon and give one tribe with that which is next it to his son because of the promise made to David for his succession and will give ten tribes to thee because Solomon hath sinned against him and delivered himself up to women and to their gods Seeing there fore thou knowest the cause for which God hath changed his mind and is alienated from Solomon be thou righteous and keep the laws because thou hast proposed to thee the greatest of all rewards for thy piety and the honour thou shalt pay to God namely to be as greatly exalted as thou knowest David to have been So Jeroboam was elevated by these words of the prophet and being a young manJ of warm temper and ambitious of greatness he could not be quiet And when he had so great a charge in the government and called to mind what had been revealed to him by Ahijah he endeavoured to persuade the people to forsake Solomon to make a dis turbance and to bring the government over to himself But when Solomon understood his intention and treachery he sought to catch him and kill him But Jeroboam was informed of it beforehand and fled to Shishak king of Egypt and there abode till the death of Solomon By which means he gained these two advantages to suffer no harm from Solomon and to be preserved for the kingdom So Solomon died when he was already an old man having reignedÂ eighty years and lived ninety four He  1 Kings xi 23 t When David made war against Hadadezer Rezon one of his generals escaped from the field of battle with the troops under his command and having lived for a little while hy plunder and robbery at length seized on Damascus and reigned there But his reign was not long For David took Damascus as well as the other parts of Syria and left it in subjection to his son Solomon till God was pleased to suffer this Rezon to recover Damascus and there re establish himself to the great disturbance of the latter part of Solomon s reign Calmef s Comment B SThis youth of Jeroboam when Solomon built the Is of Jerusalem not very long after he had finished his twenty years building of the temple and his own palace or not very long after the twenty fourth year of his reign 1 Kings ix 24 2 Chron viii 11 and his youth here still mentioned when Solomon s wickedness was become in tolerable fully confirm my former observation that such his wickedness began early and continued yery long See Eccltis xlvii 14 Had we this discourse of Jose phus s wherein he intended to enlarge on this part of Solomon s life which part is only in brief touched upon in our other copies 1 Kings xi and is wholly omitted in the books of Chronicles we had probably been more fully informed of this matter I How Solomon came to know what was thus transacted between Ahijah and Jeroboam alone is a question of no great difficulty For perhaps the prophet made no scruple to report what he delivered in the name of the Lord per haps Jeroboam himself being puffed up with this assu rance could not contain but told it to some of his confi dants who spread it abroad or perhaps his servants though they heard not the words the prophet spake yet seeing him rend the garment into twelve parts and give ten to him might speak of this strange and unaccountable action which Solomon as soon as he came to hear of it might easily understand because the same prophet very likely had told him but just before that the kingdom should be rent from him and given to his servant 1 Kings xiv 8

TRIBES UNDER JEROBOAM NOWf when Solomon was dead and his son Rehoboam who was born of an Ammonite wife whose name was Naamah had succeeded him in the kingdom the rulers of the multitude sent immediately into Egypt and recalled Jeroboam And when he was come to the city Shechem Rehoboam came thither also for he had resolved to declare himself king of the Israelites while they were there gathered together So the rulers of the people as well as Jeroboam came to him and said that he ought to relax and to be gentler than his father in the servi tude he had imposed on them because they had borne a heavyJ yoke and that then they should be better affected to him and be well contented to serve him under his moderate government and should do it more out of love than fear But Rehoboam told them they should come to him again in three days time when he would give an answer to their request This delay gave occasion to a present suspicion since he had not given them a favourable answer immediately flow ever they thought that his consultation about it afforded some hope of success Rehoboam now called his father s friends and advised with them what sort of answer he ought to give to the multitude Upon which they gave him the advice which be came friends and those that knew the tem per of such a multitude they advised him to speak in a way more popular than suited the grandeur of a king because he would thereby oblige them to submit to him with good will it being most agreeable to sub jects that their kings should be almost upon a level with them But Rehoboam rejected this good and profitable advice it was such at least at that time when he was to be made king God himself I suppose causing what was most advantageous to be contemned by him So he called for the young men who were brought up with him Â and told them what advice the elders had given him and bade them speak what they thought he ought to do So they advised him to give the lol lowing answer to the people for neither their youth nor God himself suffered them to discern what was best That his little finger should be thicker than his father s loins and if they had met with hard usage from his father they should experience much rougher treatment from him and if his father had chastised them with whips they must expect that he would do it with scorpions The king was pleased with this advice and  This

be of no value at all in his days chap x 21 but people are more sen sible of their pressures than of their enjoyments and feel the least burdens when they are most at ease It is observable however that among all their complaints they take no notice of Solomon s idolatry or the strange worship which he had introduced though this one would think should have been reckoned among the greatest of their grievances Patrick Commentary B Â It was a common custom among the kings of the east to have their sons educated among other young lords that were of the same age which as it created a generous spirit of emulation and both endeared the prince to the nobles and the nobles to the prince could not but tend greatly to the benefit of the public Sesostris the most famous prince that ever Egypt produced is said to have been educated this way And by the gallant youths that were his cotemporaries and fellow pupils it was that he afterwards did so many surprising actions The same custom was in use among the Persians as we may learn from the life of Cyrus and of Alexander the Great we are told that his father Philip had trained him up in his youth among those young noblemen who became his great captains in the conquest of all Asia So that Solo mon s method and design in the education of his son was wise and well concerted though it failed of success Calmet s Commentary B  That by scorpions is not here meant the small ani mals so called which were never used in corrections but either a shrub with sharp prickles like the stings 298 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS thought it agreeable to the dignity of his go vernment to give them such an answer Ac cordingly when the multitude was assembled to hear his answer on the third day all the people were in great expectation and very intent to hear what the king would say to them and supposed they should hear some what of a kind nature but he passed by his friends and answered as the young men had given him counsel Now this was done ac cording to the will of God that what Ahijah had foretold might come to pass By these words the people were struck as it were by an iron hammer and were so grieved as if they had already felt the effects of them and they had great indignation at the king and all cried out aloud and said We will have no longer any relation to David or his posterity f after this day and will only leave to Rehoboam the temple which his father built Nay they were so bitter and retained their wrath so long that when he sent Adoram who was over the tribute that he might pacify them and persuade them to forgive him if he had said any thing that was rash or grievous to them in his youth they would not hear it but threw stones at him and killed him When Reho boam saw this he thought himself aimed at by those stones with which the multitude had killed his servant and feared lest he should undergo the last of punishments in earnest So he got immediately into his chariot4 and fled to Jerusalem There the tribe of Judah and that of Benjamin ordained him for their king but the rest of the multitude forsook the sons of David from that day and ap pointed Jeroboam to be the ruler of their public affairs Upon this Rehoboam assem bled a great congregation of those two tribes that had submitted to him and was ready to take a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men out of the army and to make an expedi tion against Jeroboam and his people that he might force them by war to be his ser vants But he was forbidden of God by the prophet Shemaiah to go to war For that it was not just that brethren of the same country should fight against one another He also said that this defection of the mul titude was according to the purpose of God So he did not proceed in this expedition Â And now I will relate first the actions of Jeroboam the king of Israel and afterwards what are therewith connected the actions of Rehoboam the king of the two tribes By this means we shall preserve the order of the history unbroken When Jeroboam had built him a palace in the city Shechem he dwelt there He also built him another at a city called Penual And now the feast of tabernacles was approaching in a little time Jeroboam considered that if he should permit the multitude to go to wor ship God at Jerusalem and there to celebrate the festival they would probably repent of what they had done and be enticed by the temple and by the worship of God there performed and would leave him and return to their first king and if so he should run the risk of losing his own life So he made two golden heifers and built two little tem ples for them the one in the city Bethel and the other in Dan which last was the fffountains of the lesser Jordan and he put the heifers into both the little temples in of scorpions such as is our furze bush or else some terrible sort of whip of the like nature See Hudson s and Spenheim s Notes here and Mr Barker s parallel observations  1 Kings xii 13 t 1 Kings xii 16  This is the first time that we read of a king s riding in a chariot Saul David and Solomon rode in none but after the division of the kingdom mention is fre quently made of the use of them both by the kings of Judah and Israel Patrick Commentary B II This prophet was very well known in the reign of Rehoboam He is supposed to have wrote the annals of that prince and of what authority he was in Judah we may gather from this passage where he is said to have prevailed with the king and a hundred and four score thousand men to lay down their arms and return home merely by declaring that the division which had hap pened was the appointment and order of God Calmefs Commentary B Â 1 Kings xii 24  1 Kings xii 29 tt Whether these fountains of the lesser Jordan were near a place called Dan and the fountains of the greater near a place called Jor before their conjunction or whether there was only one fountain arising at the lake Phiala at first sinking under the ground then rising near the mountain Paneum and thence running through the lake Semochonites to the sea of Galilee and so far called the lesser Jordan is hardly certain even in Josephus him self though the latter account be the most probable See RelancPs Palestine tom I lib I c 41 43 However the northern idolatrous calf set up by Jeroboam was where little Jordan fell into great Jordan near a place called an 976 299 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the aforementioned cities And when he had called the ten tribes together over whom he ruled he made a speech to the people in these words I suppose my countrymen you know that every place hath God in it nor is there any determinate place in which he is but he every where hears and sees those that worship him On which account I do not think it right for you to go so long a journey to Jerusalem which is an enemy s city to worship him It was a man that built the temple I have also made two golden heifers dedicated to the same God and the one I have consecrated in the city Bethel and the other in Dan to the end that those of you who dwell nearest those cities may go to them and worship God there And I will ordain for you certain priests and Levites from among yourselves that you may have no want of the tribe of Levi or of the sons of Aaron But let him that is desirous among you of being a priest bring to God a bullock and a ram which they say Aaron the first priest brought also When Jeroboam had said this he deluded the people and caused them to revolt from the worship of their fore fathers and to transgress their laws This was the beginning of miseries to the He brews and the cause why they were over come in war by foreigners and so fell into captivity But we shall relate those things in their proper places hereafter When this feast of tabernacles was justf approaching JeroboamJ was desirousto ce lebrate it himself in Bethel as did the two tribes in Jerusalem Accordingly he built an altar before the heifer and undertook to be high priest himself So he went up to the altar with his own priests about him But when he was going to offer the sacrifices and the burnt offerings in the sight of all the people a prophet whose name was Jadon was sent by God and came to him from Je rusalem who stood in the midst of the mul titude and in the hearing of the king and directing his discourse to the altar said thus God foretells that there shall be a certain man of the family of David Josiah by name who shall slay upon thee those false priests that shall live at that time and upon thee shall burn the bones of those deceivers of the Eeople those impostors and wicked wretches towever that this people may believe these things shall come to pass I foretell a sign to them that shall also be fulfilled This altar shall be broken to pieces immediately and all the fat of the sacrifices that is upon it shall be poured upon the ground When the prophet had said this Jeroboam in a passion stretched out his hand and bade them lay hold of him But that hand which he stretched out was enfeebled and he was not able to pull it in again to him for it was become withered and hung down as if it were dead The altar also was broken to pieces and all that was upon it was poured out as the prophet had foretold should come to pass So the king understood that he was a man of veracity and had a divine foreknowledge and intreated him to pray unto God that he would restore his right hand Accordingly the prophet did pray to Daphnn as Josephus elsewhere informs us Of the War IV 1 See the note there  Lev viii 14 22 t An 975 J As the Jews had their feast of tabernacles on the fif teenth day of the seventh month so Jeroboam had a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month which he insti tuted of his own accord Some suppose indeed that as this feast was appointed by God to be observed after the gathering in of the fruits which might be sooner ripe in Jerusalem than in the northern parts of the country so Jeroboam might pretend that the eighth would be a bet ter time for it than the seventh because then they would every where be gathered Others imagine that he might have this farther design in the alteration of this month viz that the people of Judah when their own feast was over a month before at Jerusalem might have an oppor tunity to come to his if their curiosity led them But the plain cast is that he did every thing he could in oppo sition to the established religion and his chief intention voL I â NOS 25  26 was to alienate the people from Jerusalem Bedford s Scripture Chronology lib VI c 2 B  Who this prophet was commentators are not agreed The Jews would generally have it to have been Iddo but unless we may suppose that what is here related fell out in the latter end of Jeroboam s reign Iddo could not be the person because Iddo was alive in the days of Abijah son of Rehoboam whereas the prophet here spoken of died in a manner as soon as he had delivered this pro phecy Others therefore have thought that this prophet who came to rebuke Jeroboam was Ahijah the same who had foretold him of his exaltation to the crown of Israel But besides that Ahijah was alive after the time that this prophet was slain Ahijah was certainly a native of Shiloh and lived in Shiloh which is the tribe of Ephraim ana part of Jeroboam s dominions whereas it is expressly said of this prophet that he came from Judah So that there is no foundation so much as for a conjecture what the name of this man of God was Patrick s and Calmet i Commentaries B 3H 300 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS God to grant him that request So the king having his hand recovered to its natural state rejoiced at it and invited the prophet to sup with him But Jadon said he could not endure to come into his house nor to taste of bread or water in that city For that was a thing God had forbidden him to do as also to go back by the same way which he came but he said he was to re turn by another way So the king wondered at the abstinence of the man but was him self in fear as suspecting a change of his affairs for the worse from what had been said to him CHAP IX or jadon s return to bethel at the instigation of a FALSE PROPHET AND HIS AWFUL END J THE EFFECT OF THE LVINC PROPHET S ARGUMENTS ON THE MIND OF JEROBOAM C NOW there was a certain wicked man in that city who was a false prophet whom Jeroboam had in great esteem but he was deceived by him and his flattering words This man was then bed ridden by reason of the infirmities of old age How ever he was informed by his sons concerning the prophet that was come from Jerusalem and concerning the signs done by him and how when Jeroboam s right hand had been enfeebled at the prophet s prayer he had it revived again Whereupon he was afraid that this stranger and prophet should be in better esteem with the king than himself and obtain greater honour from him and he gave order to his sons to saddle his ass im mediately and make all ready that he might go out Accordingly they made haste to do what they were commanded and he got upon the ass and followed after the prophet And when he had overtaken him as he was resting himself under a thick and shady oak he at first saluted him but presently he com plained of him because he had not come into his house and partaken of his hospi tality And when the other said that God had forbidden him to taste of any one s pro vision in that city he replied Certainly God had not forbidden that I should set food before thee for I am a prophet as thou art and worship God in the same manner that thou dost and I am now come as sent by him in order to bring thee into mine house and make thee my guest Now Jadon gave credit to this lying prophet and returned back with him But when they were at din ner and were merry together God appeared to Jadon and said that he should sutler punishment for transgressing his commands and he told him what that punishment should be for he said that on his return he should meet with a lion by which he should be torn to pieces and be deprived of burial in the sepulchres of his fathers Which things came to pass as I suppose according to the will of God that so Jeroboam might not give heed to the words of Jadon as of one that had been convicted of lying However as Jadon was again going to Jerusalem a lion assaulted him and pulled him off the beast he rode on and slew him yet did he not at all hurt the ass but sat by him and kept him as also the prophet s body This continued till some travellers that saw it came and told it in the city to the false pro phet who sent his sons and brought the body unto the city and made a funeral for him at great expenses He also charged his sons to bury himself with him and said that all which he had foretold against that city and the altar and priests and false prophets would prove true f and that if he were bu ried with him he should receive no injurious  Why this prophet was forbid to eat or drink with the people of Bethel the reason is obvious because he was to have no familiarity with idolaters but why he should not return by the same way that he went is not so very evident There is a passage in Isaiah concerning Sen nacherib which helps as some think to elucidate this matter where God tells him that he would turn him back by the same way that he came Isaiah xxxvii 29 34 i e he should return home without doing any thing All his threats and all his great projects should have no effect against Jerusalem And in like manner when God com manded the prophet not to return by the same way it was at much as if he had said See that thou be constant and steadfast in executing the charge committed to thee let nothing hinder or divert thee but take abundant care that thou do thy business effectually But this construc tion is a little too much strained nor can I see why we may not say that God enjoined his prophet not to return by the same way lest Jeroboam or any other of the in habitants of Bethel either to satisfy their curiosity upon an occasion so uncommon or to do him some mischief for his severe denunciations against their altar and way ot worship might send men after him to bring him back Caltnefs and he Clerc t

prophet and had given that charge to his sons as he was a wicked and impious man he went to Jeroboam and said to him â Wherefore is it now that thou art disturbed at the words of this silly fellow And when the king related what had happened about the altar and about his own hand and gave him the names of a divine man and an excel lent prophet he endeavoured by a wicked trick to weaken that his opinion and by using plausible words concerning what had happened he aimed to injure the truth that was in them For he attempted to persuade him that his hand was enfeebled by the labour it had undergone in supporting the sacrifices and that upon its resting awhile it returned to its former nature again And that as to the altar it was but new and had borne an abundance of sacrifices and those large ones too and was accordingly broken to pieces and fallen down by the weight of what had been laid upon it He also in formed him of the death of him that had foretold those things and how he perished whence he concluded that he had not any thing in him of a prophet nor spake any thing like one When he had thus spoken he persuaded the king and entirely alienated his mind from God and from doing works that were righteous and holy and en couraged him to go on in his impious prac tices And accordingly he was to that degree injurious to God and so great a transgressor that he sought for nothing else every day but how he might be guilty of some new instances of wickedness and such as should be more detestable than what he had been so insolent as to do before And so much shall at present suffice to have said concerning Jeroboam CHAP X OF rehoboam s impiety and his punishment by shishak KINO OF EGYPT REHOBOAM t the son of Solomon who as we said before was king of the two tribes built strong and large cities Beth lehem Etam Tekoa Bethzur Shoco Adul lam J Ipan Maresha Ziph Adoraim La chish Azekah Zorah Aijalon and Hebron These he built first of all in the tribe of Judah He also built other cities in the tribe of Benjamin and walled them about and put garrisons in them all and captains and a great deal of corn and wine and oil and he furnished every one of them plentifully with other provisions that were necessary for sus tenance Moreover he put therein shields and spears for many thousand men The Eriests also that were in all Israel and the evites and if there were any of the multi tude that were good and righteous men they gathered themselves together to him having left their own cities that they might worship God in Jerusalem For they were not willing to be forced to worship the heifers which Jeroboam had made and they augmented the kingdom of Rehoboam for three years And after he had married a woman of his own kindred and had by her three children he married also another of his own kindred who was the daughter of Absalom by Tamar whose name was Maachah and by her he had a son whom he named Abijah He had also many other children by other wives but he loved Maachah above them all Now he had eighteen legitimate wives and thirty concubines and he had born to him twenty eight sons and threescore daughters but he appointed Abijah whom he had by Maachah to be his successor in the kingdom and intrusted him with the treasures and the strongest cities  How much a larger and better copy Josephus had in this remarkable history of the true prophet of Judea and his concern with Jeroboam and with the false prophet of Bethel than our other copies have is evident at first light The prophet s very name Jadon or as the Con stitutions call him Adonias IV 6 is wanting in our other copies and it is there with no little absurdity said that God revealed Jadon the true prophet s death not to himself as here but to the false prophet Of which see Essay on the Old Test page 74 75 Whether the par ticular account of the arguments made use of after all by the false prophet against his own belief in order to per suade Jeroboam to persevere in his idolatry and wicked ness and which it seems prevailed with him than which more plausible could not be invented was intimated in Josephus s copy or in some other ancient book cannot now be determined our other copies say not one word of it t An 974 X Gath 2 Chron xi 8 II Sixty 2 Chron xi 21 3H2 902 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now I cannot but think that the greatness of a kingdom and its change into prosperity often becomes the occasion of mischief and of transgression to men For when Reho boam saw his kingdom so much increased he went out of the right way into irreligious practices and despised the worship of God till the people themselves imitated his wicked actions For so it usually happens that the manners of subjects are corrupted at the same time with those of their governors which subjects then lay aside their own sober way of living as a reproof of their governors intemperate courses and follow their wick edness as if it were virtue For it is not possible to shew that men approve of the actions of their kings unless they do the same actions with them Agreeably whereto it now happened to the subjects of Reho boam for when he was grown impious and a transgressor himself they endeavoured not to offend him by resolving still to be righteous But God sent Shishak t king of Egypt to punish them for their unjust behaviour to wards him Concerning whom Herodotus was mistaken and applied his actions to Sesostris For this Shishak J in the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam made an expe dition into Judea with many thousand men For he had one thousand two hundred cha riots threescore thousand horsemen and four hundred thousand footmen These he brought with him and they were the greater part of them Libyans and Ethiopians Now therefore when he fell upon the country of the Hebrews he took the strongest cities of Rehoboam s kingdom without fighting and when he had put garrisons in them he came last of all to Jerusalem While Rehoboam and the multitude with him were shut up in Jerusalem by the army of Shishak and when they besought God to give them victory and deliverance they could not persuade God to espouse their cause but Shemaiah the prophet told them that Uod threatened to forsake them as they had themselves forsaken his worship YV hen they heard this they were in great consternation and seeing no way of deliverance they all earnestly set themselves to confess that God might justly overlook them since they had been guilty of impiety towards him and had let his laws lie in confusion So when God saw them in that disposition and that they acknowledged their sins he told the prophet he would not destroy them but that he would make them servants to the Egyptians that they might learn whether they would suffer less by serving men or God So when Shi shak had taken the city without fighting be cause Rehoboam was afraid and received him into it he spoiled the temple and emptied the treasures of God and those of the king and carried off innumerable thou sands of gold and silver and left nothing at all behind him He also took away the bucklers of gold and the shields which Solomon the king had made Nay he did not leave the golden quivers which David had taken from the king of Zobab and had dedicated to God And when he had thus done he returned to his own kingdom Now Herodotus of Halicarnassus mentions this expedition having only mistaken the king s name and in saying that he made war upon many other nations also and brought Syria of Palestine into subjection and took the men that were therein prisoners without fighting Now it is manifest that he intended to declare our nation was subdued by him for he saith that he left behind him pillars in the land of those that delivered themselves up to him without fighting and engraved upon them symbols of their effeminacy Now our king Rehoboam delivered up our city without fighting He says withal that  The  An 971 t It may seem something strange that Shishak who was so nearly allied to Rehoboam should come up against him and take his royal city but Rehoboam we must re member was not the son of Pharaoh s daughter and therefore no relation to Shishak But even had he been never so nearly related as kingdoms we know never marry so it is likely that Jeroboam who bad lived long in Egypt stirred him up to invade his rival and thereby he might establish himself in this new kingdom and for this reason it was that when the armies of Egypt had taken the fenced cities of Jiulah they returned without giving Jeroboam or his dominions any the least dis turbance Patrick s Commentary T I That this Shishak was not the same person with thÂ famous Sesostris as some have very lately in contradic tion to all antiquity supposed and that our Josephus did not take him to be the same as they pretend but that Sesostris was many centuries earlier than Shishak see Authent Records Part II page 1024 1025 1026 and the authors there cited II 1 Kings xiv 25 iw 968 303 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Ethiopians learned the rite of circumcision from the Egyptians with this addition that the Phoenicians and Syrians that live in Palestine confess that they learned it of the Egyptians Yet is it evident that no other of the Syrians that live in Palestine besides us alone are circumcised But as to such matters let every one speak what is agree able to his own opinion When Shishak was gone away king Re hoboam made bucklers and shields of brass t instead of those of gold J and delivered the same number of them to the keepers of the king s palace So instead of famous warlike expeditions and that glory which results from those public actions he reigned in great quietness though not without fear as being always an enemy to Jeroboam And he died when he had lived fifty seven years and reigned seventeen He was in his dis position a proud and a foolish man and lost part of his dominions by not hearkening to his father s friends He was buried at Jeru salem in the sepulchres of the kings And his son AbijahÂ succeeded him in the king dom and this in the eighteenth year of Je roboam s reign over the ten tribes It must be now our business to relate the affairs of Jeroboam and how he ended his life For he ceased not nor rested to be injurious to God but every day raised up altars upon high mountains and went on making priests out of the multitude CHAP XI OF THE DEATH OF JEROBOAM S SON JEROBOAM S DEFEAT BY ABIJAH HIS SUBSEQUENT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF HIS HOUSE BY BAASHA GOD was in no long time ready to return Jeroboam s wicked actions and the punishment they deserved upon his head and upon the heads of all his house And whereas a son of the king s lay sick at that time who was called Abijah he enjoined his wife to lay aside her robes and to take  Herodotus as here quoted by Josephus and as this passage still stands in his present copies Book II chap 104 affirms that the Phoenicians and Syrians in Pales tine which last are generally supposed to denote the Jews owned their receiving circumcision from the Egyp tians Whereas it is abundantly evident that the Jews received their circumcision from the patriarch Abraham Gen xvii 9â 14 Josh vii 22 23 as I conclude the Egyptian priests themselves did It is not therefore rery unlikely that Herodotus because the Jews had lived long in Egypt and came out of it circumcised did thereupon think they had learned that circumcision in Egypt and had it not before Manetho the famous Egyptian chronologer and historian who knew the his tory of his own country much better than Herodotus complains frequently of his mistakes about their affairs as does Josephus more than once in this chapter Nor indeed does Herodotus seem at all acquainted with the affairs of the Jews For as he never names them so little or nothing of what he says about them their country or maritime cities two of which he alone mentions Ca dytis and Jenysis proves true Nor indeed do there appear to have ever been any such cities on their coast See Essay on the Old Testament Appendix page 180 Reland s Palestine tom II lib iii page 668 669 670 and the note on XI 2 t This shews to what low condition the kingdom of Judnh was reduced These shields were a matter of state and grandeur and therefore it concerned them if they were able to have them of the same value that they were before And as they were carried before the king to the house of the Lord it seemed likewise to be a matter of relisjion that their value should not be diminished Now in making these three hundred shields we are told that three pounds of gold went to one shield I Kings x 17 Thus at four pounds per ounce or forty eight pounds sterling to the pound amounts to no more than 432 0O0Z and therefore it was a miserable case that they were reduced from so much wealth to so much poverty that neither reason of state nor religion could raise so small a sum on so great an occasion Bedford s Scripture Chro nology lib vi c 2 B  1 Kings xiv 27 II From an 976 to 959 B C Â An 959  Jeroboam might be for having his wife go to consult the prophet at Shiloh because this was a secret not to be entrusted with any body else  a secret which if it had been divulged might have endangered his whole government because if once his subjects came to understand that he himself had no confidence in the calves which he had set up but in any matter of importance had recourse to the true worshippers of God it is not to be imagined what an inducement this would have been for them to forsake these senseless idols and to return to the worship of the God of Israel whom they imprudently had forsaken The queen was then the only person he could have con fidence in As a mother he knew that she would he diligent in her inquiry and as a wife faithful in her re port but there were sundry reasons why ne might de sire her to disguise herself For though Shiloh lay within the confines of Ephraim yet there is sufficient ground to think that it was subject to the house of David and be longed to the kingdom of Judah It was certainly nearer Jerusalem than Shechem which Rehoboam had lately fortified and made his place of residence and therefore Jeroboam thought it not safe to venture his queen in a place that was under his rival s government without her puttins on some disguise He knew too tb tt the prophet Ahijah was greatly offended at him for the gross idolatry he had introduced and therefore he thought as justly he might that if the prophet perceived it to be his wife 304 book VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the garments belonging to a private person and to go to Ahijah the prophet for that he Was a wonderful man in foretelling future events it having been he who told him that he should be king He also enjoined her when she came to him to inquire concerning the child as if she were a stranger whether he should escape this distemper So she did as her husband bade her and changed her habit and came to the city Shiloh for there did Ahijah live But as she was going into his house his eyes being then dim with age God appeared to him and informed him that the wife of Jeroboam was come to him and what answer he should make to her inquiry Accordingly as the woman was coming into the house like a private person and a stranger he cried out Come in O thou wife of Jeroboam Why concealest thou thyself Thou art not concealed from God who hath appeared to me and in formed me that thou wast coming and hath given me in command what I shall say to thee So he said that she should go away to her husband and speak to him thus Since I made thee a great man when thou wast little or rather nothing and rent the kingdom from the house of David and gave it to thee and thou hast been unmindful of these benefits hast left off my worship hast made thee molten gods and honoured them I will in like manner cast thee down again and will destroy all thy house and make them food for the dogs and the fowls For a certain king is rising up by my appoint ment over all this people who shall leave none of the family of Jeroboam remaining The multitude also shall themselves partake of the same punishment and shall be cast out of this good land and shall be scattered into the places beyond Euphrates because they have followed the wicked practices of their king and have worshipped the gods that he made and forsaken my sacrifices Do thou O woman make haste back to thy husband and tell him this message But thou shalt then find thy son dead for as thou enterest the city he shall depart this life Yet shall he be buried with the lamen tations of all the multitude and be honoured with a general mourning he is the only inno cent person of Jeroboam s family When the prophet had foretold these events the woman went hastily away with a disordered mind and greatly grieved at the death of the child So she was in lamenta tion as she went along the road and mourned for the death of her son that was just at hand She was indeed in a miserable condition at the unavoidable approach of death and went apace but in circumstances very unfortunate because of her son for the greater haste she made she would the sooner see her son dead Yet was she forced to make such haste on account of her husband Accordingly when she was come back she found that the child had given up the ghost as the prophet had said and she related all the circumstances to the king Jeroboam however did not lay any of these things to heart but he brought together a very numerous army and made a warlike expedition against Abijah the son of Reho boam who had succeeded his father in the kingdom of the two tribes For he despised him because of his age But when he heard of the expedition of Jeroboam he was not affrighted at it but proved of a courageous temper of mind superior both to his youth and to the hopes of his enemy So he chose an army out of the two tribes and met Je roboam at a place called mount Zemaraim and pitched his camp near the others and prepared every thing necessary for the fight His army consisted of four hundred thousand but the army of Jeroboam was double that number Now as the armies stood in array ready for action and were just going to fight Abijah stood upon an elevated place and beckoning with his hand he desired the multitude and Jeroboam himself to hear first what he had to say And when silence was made he began to speak to this effect God consented that David and his posterity should be your rulers for all time to come and this you yourselves are not unacquainted with But I cannot but wonder how you should forsake my father and join yourselves he would either tell her nothing or make things much worse than they were The only way therefore to come at the truth was as he thought to do what he did

hath suf fered that punishment which God thinks due to him for what is past he will leave off the transgressions he hath been guilty of and the injuries he hath offered to him and which he hath still

not of religious worship Or is it the exceeding multitude of your army which gives you such good hopes yet certainly there is no strength in an army of many thou sands when the war is unjust For we ought to place our surest hope of success against our enemies in righteousness alone and in piety towards God Which hope we justly have since we have kept the laws from the beginning and have worshipped our own God who was not made by hands out of corruptible matter nor was he formed by a wicked king in order to deceive the multi tude but who is his own workmanship and the beginning and end of all things I therefore give you counsel even now to re pent and to take better advice and to leave off the prosecution of the war to call to mind the laws of your country and to reflect what it hath been that hath advanced you to so happy a state as you are now in This was the speech which Abijah made to the multitude But while he was still speaking Jeroboam sent some of his soldiers privately to surround him on certain parts of the camp that were not taken notice of And when he was thus within the compass of the enemy his army was affrighted and their courage failed them But Abijah encouraged them and exhorted them to place their hopes on God for that he was not encompassed by the enemy So they all at once implored the divine assistance while the priests sounded with the trumpets and they made a shout and fell upon their enemies and God brake the courage and cast down the force of their enemies and made Abijah s army superior to them For God vouchsafed them a won derful and very famous victory and such af slaughter was now made of Jeroboam s army as is never recorded to have happened in any other war whether it were of the Greeks or of the Barbarians for they overthrew and slew five hundred thousand of their enemies J and they took their strongest cities by force and spoiled them and besides those they did the same to Bethel and her towns and Jeshanah and her towns And after this defeat Jeroboam never recovered himself during the life of Abijah who yet did not long survive for he reigned but three years j and was buried in Jerusalem in the sepul  This

tribes God s high displeasure and indignation against idolatry and rebellion fully appeared the remainder were thereby seriously cautioned not to persist in them and a kind of balance or equilibrium was made between the ten and the two tribes for the time to come While otherwise the perpetually idolatrous and rebellious ten tribes would natu rally have been too powerful for the two tribes which were pretty frequently free both from such idolatry and rebellion Nor is there by consequence any reason to doubt the truth of this prodigious number slain upon so singular an occasion X 2 Chron xiii

children by fourteen wives and Asa his son succeeded in his kingdom and the young man s mother was Michaiah Under his reign the country of the Israelites enjoyed peace for ten years But Jeroboam the king of the ten tribes died when he had reigned twenty two years His son Nadab succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Asa and governed two years and resembled his father in impiety and wickedness In these two years he made an expedition against Gibbethon a city of the Philistines and continued the siege in order to take it but he was conspired against while he was there by a friend of his whose name was Baasha the son of Ahijah and was slain Baasha took the kingdom after the other s death and destroyed the whole house of Je roboam It also came to pass according as God had foretold that some of Jeroboam s kindred that died in the city were torn to pieces and devoured by dogs and that others of them that died in the field were torn and devoured by the fowls So the house of Je roboam suffered the just punishment of his impiety and of his wicked actions CHAP XII OF THE AFFAIRS OF ASA KINO OF JERUSALEM THE DE STRUCTION OF THE HOUSE OF BAASHA AND THE CON DUCT OF THE SUCCESSORS ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL NOW Asa the king of Jerusalem was an excellent character and had a regard to God and neither did nor designed any thing but what was consistent with the laws He made a reformation of his kingdom and cut off whatsoever was wicked therein and purified it from every impurity Now he had an army of chosen men that were armed with targets and spears out of the tribe of Judah three hundred thousand and out of the tribe of Benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fifty thousand But when he had reigned ten years Zerah t king of Ethiopia J made an expedition against him with a great army of nine hundred thousand footmen one hundred thousand horsemen and three hundred chariots and came as far as Mareshah Â a city that belonged to the tribe of Judah Now when Zerah had passed so far with his own army Asa met him and put his army in array over against him in a valley called Zepathan not far from the city And when he saw the multitude of the Ethio pians he cried out and besought God to give them the victory and that he might kill many thousands of the enemy For said he I depend on nothing else but that as sistance which I expect from thee which is able to make the fewer superior to the more numerous and the weaker to the stronger and thence it is alone that I ven ture to meet Zerah and fight him While Asa was speaking thus God gave him a signal victory and joining battle cheer fully on account of what God had foretold about it he slew a great many of the Etbio pians and when he had put them to flight he pursued them to the country of Gerar And when they left off killing their enemies they betook themselves to spoiling them for the city of Gerar was already taken and to spoiling their camp So that they carried off much gold and silver and a great deal of other prey and camels and cattle and flocks of sheep Accordingly when Asa and his army had obtained such a victory and such  From an 975 to 955 at eleven months to a year See Chron of the Old Testament page 16â 20 t The Scripture takes no notice of what was the cause of this war between Zerah and Asa nor are interpreters well agreed what the country was from whence this ene my came The country in the original is called Cush though we translate it Ethiopia Now there are three countries different from one another all called by the name of Cush 1 the land of Cush upon the river Gihon 2 Cush upon the eastern shore of the Red Sea and 3 Cush situated above Thebais and in Upper Egypt It is very probable then that the country here spoken of must not be Ethiopia properly so called because we can hardly imagine how an army of a million of men should be permitted to march through Egypt as they must have done to invade Judea without some opposition and therefore the country must be the land of Cush which lay in Arabia Petraea upon the east shore of the Red Sea and at the extremity to the point of that sea inclining towards Egypt and Judea And whereas some have made a doubt how so small a country could have pro duced so large an army it is no hard matter to suppose that a great part of the array might perhaps have been mercenaries Calmest Commentary on

their journey a little and be gan to say to them that the reason why they had obtained this victory from God was that they had shewn themselves righteous and religious men and had done every thing ac cording to the will of God that therefore if they persevered therein God would grant that they should always overcome their ene mies and live happily but if they left off his worship all things would fall out on the con trary and the time should come wherein no true prophet should be left in their whole multitude nor a priest who should deliver a true answer from the oracle but their cities should be overthrown and their nation scat tered over the whole earth and live the life of strangers and wanderers So he advised them while they had time to be good and not to deprive themselves of the favour of God When the king and the people heard this they rejoiced and all in common and every one in particular took great care to behave themselves righteousry f The king also sent some to take care that those in the country should observe the laws I now return to Baasha king of the mul titude of the Israelites who slew Nadab the son of Jeroboam and retained the go vernment He dwelt J in the city Tirzah having made that his habitation and reigned twenty four years He became more wicked and impious than Jeroboam or his son for he did a great deal of mischief to the multitude and was injurious to God The prophet Jehu was therefore sent to tell him beforehand that his whole family should be destroyed and that God would bring the same miseries on his house which had brought that of Je roboam to ruin because when he had been made king by him he had not requited his kindness by governing the multitude righ teously and religiously which things in the first place tended to their own happiness and in the next place were pleasing to God that he had imitated this very wicked king Jeroboam and although that man s soul had perished yet did he express to the life his wickedness and he said that he should therefore justly experience the like calamity with him since he had been guilty of the like wickedness But Baasha though he heard beforehand what miseries would be fall him and his whole family for their inso lent behaviour yet did not he leave off his wicked practices for the time to come nor did he care to appear to be other than worse and worse till he died nor did he even then repent of his past actions nor endeavour to obtain pardon of God for them but did as those do who have rewards proposed to them when they have once in earnest set about their work they do not leave off their labours For thus did Baasha grow worse when the prophet foretold to him what would come to pass as if the threatened perdition of his family and the destruction of his house were good things and as if he were a com batant for wickedness he every day took more and more pains for it And at last he took his army and assaulted a certain con siderable city called Ramah which was forty furlongs distant from Jerusalem and when he had taken it he fortified it having pre viously determined to leave a garrison in it that they might thence make excursions and do mischief to the kingdom of Asa Hereupon Asa was afraid of the attempts the enemy might make upon him and con sidering with himself how many mischiefs this army that was left in Ramah might do to the country over which he reigned he sent am bassadors  to the king of the Damascens with gold and silver desiring his assistance and putting him in mind that they had a friendship together Â from the times of their forefathers So he gladly received that sum of money and made a league with him and brake the friendship he had with Baasha and sent the commanders of his own forces unto the cities that were under Baasha s do minion and ordered them to do them mis chief So they went and burnt some of them and spoiled others Ijon Dan and Abel maim and many others Now when the king of Israel heard this  Here is a

distresses they were in But Asa made use of the materials that were prepared for building that city for erecting in the same place two strong cities the one of which was called Geba and the other Mizpah So that after this Baasha had no leisure to make expeditions against Asa for he was prevented by death and was buried in the city Tirzah Elah his son took the kingdom but when he had reigned two years he was treache rously slain by Zimri the captain of half his army for when he was at a feast of Arza his steward s house he persuaded some of the horsemen that were under him to as sault Elah and by that means he slew him when he was without his armed men and his captains For they were all busied in the siege of Gibbethon a city of the Philis tines When Zimri the captain of the army had killed Elah he took the kingdom himself and according to Jehu s prophecy slew all the house of Baasha For it came to pass that Baasha s house utterly perished on ac count of his impiety in the same manner as we have already described the destruction of the house of Jeroboam But the army that was besieging Gibbethon when they heard what had befallen the king and that when Zimrif had killed him he had gained the kingdom they bestowed the government on Omri their general who drew off his army from Gibbethon and came to Tirzah where the royal palace was and assaulted the city and took it by force But when Zimri saw that the city had none to defend it he fled into the inmost part of the palace and set it on fire and burnt himself with it J when he had reigned only seven days Hereupon the people of Israel were presently divided and part of them would have Tibni to be king and part Omri but when those who were for Omri s ruling had beaten Tibni Omri reigned over all the multitude Now it was in the thirtieth year of the reign of Asa that Omri reigned for twelve years six of these years he reigned in the city Tirzah and the rest in the city called Samareon but named by the Greeks Samaria But he himself called it Semareon from Semer who sold him the mountain whereon he built it Now Omri was no way different from those kings that reigned before him but only that he grew worse than they For they all sought how they might turn people away from God by their daily wicked practices And on that account it was that God made one of them to be slain by another and that no one person of their families should remain This Omri also died at Samaria and Ahab his son succeeded him Â Now by these events we may learn what concern God hath for the affairs of mankind and how he loves good men and hates the wicked and destroys them root and branch For many of these kings of Israel they and their families were miserably destroyed and taken away one by another in a short time for their transgressions But Asa who was king of Jerusalem and of the two tribes at tained by God s blessing a long and a feli citous old age for his piety and his righteous ness and died happily when he had reigned forty one years And when he was dead that belonged to the land of Israel and bordered on the country of Damascus is supposed both by Hudson and Spanheim to be the same with Abel or

AHAB the king of Israel dwelt in Sa maria and held the government for twenty two years and made no alteration in the conduct of the kings that were his pre decessors but only in such things as were of his own invention for the worse and in his most gross wickedness He imitated them in their wicked courses and in their injurious behaviour towards God and most especially he imitated the transgression of Jeroboam For he worshipped the heifers that he had Egyptians the usage of burning many spices at their fune rals as we find they did at the funeral of Zedekiah king of Judah Jer xxxiv 5 but notwithstanding this some very able commentators are of opinion that all these spices and perfumes were burnt along with Asa s body and they remark that among his other offences the sacred history takes no notice of this vanity of his in ordering his body to be disposed of according to the manner of the Gentiles and not of his own people Though therefore they sup pose that Asa was the first who introduced this custom yet in after ages it became very frequent and was thought the more honourable ceremony of the two 2 Chron xxi 19 Ibid xvi 14 Amos vi 10 Patrick s and CalmeCs Commentaries on 2

the Scripture makes no mention either of the quality of bis parents the manner of his education or his call to the prophetic office some Jewish doctors have been of opinion that he was an angel sent from heaven in the midst of the general corruption of the world to preserve the true worship of God Others pretend that he was a priest descended from the tribe of Aaron that his father s name was Sabaca and his birth altogether miraculous whilst others again will needs have it that he was Phineas the son of Aaron who after having lived a long while concealed appeared again in the world under the name of Elijah But where the Scripture is silent all particulars of this kind are of small authority This however may be said with safety of him that he was one of the chief if not the prince of the prophets of his age a man of great and elevated soul of a generous and undaunted spirit a zealous defender of the cause of God and a just avenger of the violation of his honour Calmefs Commentary B made and he contrived other absurd objects of worship He also married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Tynans and Sidonians of whom he learnt to worship her own gods This woman was active and bold and fell into so great a degree of impurity and madness that she built a temple to the god of the Tyrians which they call Belus and planted a grove of all sorts of trees she also appointed priests and false prophets to this god The king also himself had many such about him and so exceeded in madness and wickedness all the kings that went be fore him Now there was a prophett of God of Thesbon J a country in Gilead that came to Ahab and said to him that God foretold he would not send rain nor dew in those years upon the country but when he should ap pear And when he had confirmed this by an oath he departed into the southern parts and made his abode by a brook out of which he had water to drink as for his food ravens II St James s words are these â Elias was a man sub ject to the like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth for the space of three years and six months Our blessed Saviour makes mention of the like compass of time Luke iv 25 and yet neither of these are contradictory to what the sacred history tells us viz That the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year 1 Kings xviii 1 For we must remember that as Egypt had usually no rain but was watered by the river Nile so the land of Canaan had generally none except twice a year which they called the early and latter rain The former of these was in the month Nisan which answers to our March and the other in the month Marheshvan which answers to our October Now at the beginning of the drought Ahab might very probably impute the want of rain to natural causes but when after six months neither the former nor the latter rain fell in their season he then began to be enraged at Elijah as the cause of the national judgment and forced him at God s command to save his life by flight and from that time the three years in the historian are to be computed though from the first notice which Elijah gave Ahab of this approaching calamity to the expiration of it were certainly three years and a half This calamity is said to have been procured by Elijah s prayers but we must not therefore imagine that his prayers were spiteful and malicious but necessary rather and charitable to the offenders that by the sharp and long affliction which they produced God s honour and the truth of his word and threatonings which was now universally contemned might be vindicated and that the Israelites whose pre sent impunity hardened them in their idolatry might hereby be awakened to see their wickedness their de pendence upon God

it to him every day But when that river was dried up for want of rain he came to Zarepbath a city between Sidon and Tyre and this at the command of God For God told him that he should there find a woman who was a widow that should give him sustenance So when he was not far off the city he saw a woman gathering of sticks So God informed him that this was the person who was to give him sustenance so he came and saluted her and desired her to bring him some water to drink But as she was going so to do he called to her and asked her to bring him a loaf of bread also She affirmed upon oath that she had at home nothing more than one handful of meal and a little oil and that she was going to gather some sticks that she might knead it and make bread for herself and her son after which she said they must perish by the famine for they had nothing for themselves any longer Here upon ne said Go on with good courage and hope for better things but first of all make me a little cake and bring it to me for I foretell to thee that this vessel of meal and this cruse of oil shall not fail until God send rain When the prophet had said this she came to him and made the cakes of which she had part for herself and gave the rest to her son and to the prophet also Nor did any thing of this fail until the drought ceased Now Menander mentions this drought in his account of the acts of Eth baal king of the Tyrians where he says Under him there was a want of rain from the month Hype rbe re toe us till the month Hyperberetoeue of the year following But when he made supplications there came great thunders This Ethbaal built the cily Botrys in Phoenicia and the city Auza in Lybia By these words he designed this want of rain that was in the days of Ahab for at that time it was that Ethbaal also reigned over the Tyrians as Menander wrote Now the son of this woman who sustained the prophet fell into a distemper till he gave up the ghost and appeared to be dead f The mother therefore came to the prophet weeping and beating her breast and uttering such expressions as her passions dictated to her and complained to him that he had come to reproach her for her sins and that on this account it was that her son was dead But he bade her be of good cheer and de liver her son to him for that he would re store him again to her alive So when she had delivered her son up to him he carried him into an upper room where he himself lodged and laid him down upon the bed and cried unto God and said that God had not done so well in rewarding the woman who had sustained him by taking away her son and he prayed that he would send again the soul of the child into him and bring him to life again Accordingly God took pity on the mother and was willing to gratify the prophet that he might not seem to have come to her to do her a mischief and the child beyond all expectation came to life again So the mother returned the prophet thanks and said she was then clearly satis fied that God did converse with him J IJAfter a littleÂ while Elijah came to king  The woman had sufficient reason to believe that Elijah was a prophet or person sent from God when she saw the miraculous increase of the meal and oil but upon his not curing her son when he lay sick but rather suf fering him to die her faith began to droop whereas upon seeing him revive her faith revived with him and through the joy of having him restored to her again she accounted this latter miracle much greater than the former Le Gere s Commentary B t Some of the Hebrew doctors and herein they are followed by some Christians are of opinion that this widow s son was the prophet Jonas that after his resto ration his mother gave him to Elijah that after he at tended on the prophet as long as he lived and on a cer tain occasion was despatched by him to Nineveh as every one knows Bat besides that these traditions are desti tute of any real proof Jonah was a Hebrew as he him self de hres chap i 9 and a native of Gath hepher as

xvii 17â 24 II Josephus in his present copies says that a little while after the recovery of the widow s son at Sarepta God sent rain upon the earth whereas in our other copies it is after many days 1 Kings xviii 1 Several years are also intimated there as belonging to this drought and famine Nay we have the express mention of the third year which I suppose was reckoned from the recovery of the widow s son and the ceasing of this drought in Phoenicia which as Menander informs us here laste  one whole year And both our Saviour and St James affirm that this drought lasted in all three years and six months as their copies of the Old Testament then informed them Luke iv 25 James v 17 I suspect therefore that Jo sephus s original reading was No small time afterward Â About an 907 an 906 311 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Ahab according to God s will to inform him that rain was coming Now the famine had seized upon the whole country and there was a great want of what was necessary for sustenance insomuch that it was not only men that wanted it but the earth itself also which did not produce enough for the horses and the other beasts of what was useful for them to feed on by reason of the drought So the king called for Obadiah who was steward over his cattle and said to him that he would have him go to the fountains of water and to the brooks that if any her bage could be found for them he might mow it down and reserve it for the beasts And when he had sent persons all over the thabi table earth to discover the prophet Elijah and they could not find him he bade Oba diah accompany him So it was resolved they should make a progress and divide the ways between them and Obadiah and the king went the one way and the other another Now it had happened that at the same time when Queen Jezebel slew the prophets that this Obadiah had concealed a hundred prophets and had fed them with bread and water J But when Obadiah was alone and absent from the king the prophet Elijah met him and asked him who he was And when he had learned it from him he worshipped him Elijah then bade him go to the king and tell him that he was ready to wait on him But Obadiah replied What evil have I done to thee that thou sendest me to one who seeketh to kill thee and hath sought over all the earth for thee Or art thou so ignorant as not to know that the king hath left no place untouched into which he hath not sent persons to bring thee back in order if they could take thee to have put thee to death He also acknowledged he was afraid lest God should appear to him again and he should go away into another place and that when the king should send him for Elijah and he should not be able to find him he should be put to death He de sired him therefore to take care of his pre servation and told him how diligently he had provided for those of his own profession and had saved a hundred prophets when Jezebel slew the rest of them and had kept them concealed and that they had been sustained by him But Elijah bade him fear nothing but go to the king assuring him upon oath that he would certainly shew himself to Ahab that very day So when Obadiah had informed the king that Elijah was there Ahab met him and asked him in anger Tf he were the man that afflicted the people of the Hebrews and was the occasion of the drought that they lay under but Elijah without any flattery said that Ahab was himself the man and his house which brought such sad afflictions upon them and that by introducing strange gods into their country and worshipping them and by leaving their own who was the only true God and naving no manner of re gard to him However he bade him go his way and gather together all the people to Mount Carmel with his own prophets and those of his wife telling him how many there were of them as also the prophets of the groves about four hundred in number And as all the men whom Ahab sent for ran away to the aforenamed mountain the prophet Elijah stood in the midst of them and said How long will ye live thus in uncertainty of mind and opinion he also exhorted them that in case they esteemed their own God to be the true and the only Deity they would follow him and his commandments but in case they esteemed him to be nothing but had an opinion of the strange gods and that they ought to worship them his counsel was that they should follow them And when  There are some Jewish doctors who think that this Obadiah was the same with him whose writings we have among the twelve minor prophets They pretend that he was married to that woman of Shunem where Elisha used to lodge that he was a disciple of the prophet Elijah and the last of the three captains whom king Ahnziah sent to apprehend him and that for this reason he had compas sion on hira though he had destroyed the others that came before him with fire from heaven 2 Kings i 9 c but all these things are pure apocrypha Obadiah himself in his discourse with Elijah sufficiently tells us who he was viz a person truly religious who worshipped God alone had a singular affection for his servants enough one would think to have made Ahab discard if not persecute him had he not found him so highly useful in the manage ment of his domestic affairs as to connive at his not wor shipping Baal or the calves especially as we read nothing of his going up to Jerusalem which was a defect that God might perhaps think proper to dispense with Calmet s and Patrick s Commentaries B t Josephus here seems to mean that this drought affected all the habitable earth 1 t Kings xviii 4 312 book viii ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the multitude made no answer to what he said Elijah desired that for a trial of the Sower ot the strange gods and of their own rod he who was his only prophet while they had four hundred might take a heifer and kill it as a sacrifice and lay it on pieces of wood and not kindle any fire and that they should do the same things and call upon their own gods to set the wood on fire for if that were done they would thence learn the nature of the true God f This proposal pleased the people So Elijah bade the prophets choose out a heifer first and kill it and to call on their gods But when there appeared no effect of the prayer or invocation of the prophets upon their sa crifice Elijah derided them and bade them call upon their gods with a loud voice for they might either be on a journey or asleep And when these prophets had done so from morning till noon and cutJ themselves with swords and lances according to the custom of their country and he was about to offer his sacrifice he bade the prophets go away but desired the people to come near and ob serve what he did lest he should privately hide fire among the pieces of wood So upon the approach of the multitude he took twelve stones one for each tribe of the people of the Hebrews and built an altar with them and dug a very deep trench And when he had laid the pieces of wood upon the altar and upon them had laid the pieces of the sacrifice he ordered them to fill four barrels of the water of the fountain and to pour it upon the altar till it ran over it and till the trench was filled with the water poured into it When he had done this he began to pray to God and to intreat him to manifest his power to a people that had been in an error a long time Upon which words a fire came on a sudden from heaven in the sight of the multitude and fell upon the altar and consumed the sacri fice till the very water was set on fire and the place was become dry Now when the Israelites saw this they fell down upon the ground and worshipped one God and called him the only great and the only true God but they called the others mere names framed by the wild opinions of men So they caught their prophets and at the command of Elijah slew them Elijah also said to the king that he should go to dinner without any farther concern for that in a little time he would see God send them rain Accordingly Ahab went his way but Elijah went up to the highest top of Mount Carmel and sat down upon the ground and leaned his head upon his knees and bade his servant go up to a certain elevated place and look towards the sea and when he should see a cloud rise any where he should give him notice of it for till that time the air had been clear When the ser vant had gone up and had said many times that he saw nothing at the seventh time of his going up he said that he saw a small black thing in the sky not larger than a man s foot When Elijah heard that he  This was the ancient way of God s declaring himself pleased with sacrifices See Gen xv 17 t This is not the first time wherein God had declared his approbation of his worshippers by sending down fire to consume the sacrifices Lev ix 24 and Judges vi 21 and though perhaps it may be possible for evil spirits who may have great knowledge how to manage meteors and exhalations to their purposes to make fire descend from the clouds yet since they can do nothing without a divine permission it is absurd to think that in a matter of competition between him and false gods he should give evil spirits any license to rival him in his miracles he Clerc s Commentary B I Mr Spanheim takes notice here that in the worship of Mithra the god of the Persians the priests cut them selves in the same manner as did these priests in their invocations of Baal the god of the Phoenicians  A strange method one would think to obtain the fa vour of their gods And yet if we look into antiquity we shall find that nothing was more common in the religious rites of several nations than this barbarous custom To this purpose we may observe that as Plutarch De Su perstitione tells us the priests of Bellona when they sa crificed to that goddess were wont to besmear the victim with their own blood but the Persian Magi according to Herodotus lib vii c 191 used to appease tempests and allay the winds by making incisions in their flesh that they who carried about the Syrian goddess as Apu leius lib viii relates among other mad pranks were every now and then cutting and slashing themselves with knives till the blood gushed out and that even to this day some modern travellers tell us that in Turkey Persia and several parts of the Indies there are a kind of fanatics who think they do a very meritorious thing and what is highly acceptable to the Deity in cutting and mangling their own flesh Dii autum nullo debent colli genere says Seneca as he is quoted by St Austin De Civ Dei vi c 10  si et hoc volunt Tantus est perturbatae mentis et sedius suis pulsae furor ut sic dii

to go away to the city before the storm of rain came down So he came to the city Jezreel And in a little time the air was all obscured and covered with clouds and a vehement storm of wind came upon the earth and with it a great deal of rain And the prophet was under a divine fury and ran along with the king s chariot unto Jezreel a city of Izar When Jezebel the wife of Ahab under stood what signs Elijah had wrought and how he had slain the prophets she was angry and sent messengers to him and by them threatened to kill him f as he had destroyed her prophets At this Elijah was affrighted and fled to the city called Beersheba which is situate at the utmost limits of the country belonging to the tribe of Judah towards the land of Edom And there he left his servant and went away into the desert J He prayed also that he might die for that he was not better than his fathers nor therefore need be very desirous to live when they were dead and he lay and slept under a certain tree And when somebody awakened him and he was risen up he found food set by him and water So when he had eaten and renewed his strength by that food he came to the mountain called Sinai  where it is related that Moses received his laws from God And finding there a certain hollow cave he entered into it and continued to make his abode in it But when a certain voice came to him and asked Why he came thither and had left the city he said that because he had slain the prophets of the foreign gods and had persuaded the people that he alone whom they had wor shipped from the beginning was God he was sought for by the king s wife to be punished for so doing And when he had heard ano ther voice telling him that he should come out the next day into the open air and should thereby know what he was to do he came out of the cave the next day accord ingly He then both heard an earthquake and saw the bright splendour of a fire and after a silence a divine voice exhorted him not to be disturbed with the circumstances he was in for that none of his enemies should have power over him The voice also com manded him to return home and to ordain Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over their own multitude and Hazael of Damas cus to be over the Syrians and Elisha of the city Abel to be a prophet in his stead And that of the impious multitude some should be slain by Hazael and others by Jehu So Elijah upon hearing this charge returned into the land of the Hebrews And when he found Elisha the son of Shaphat ploughing and certain others with him  For Izar we may here read with Hudson and Coc ceius Isachar i e of the tribe of Isachar for to that tribe did Jezreel belong and presently chap xv we may read for Izar with one MS nearly and the Scrip ture Jezreel for that was the city meant in the history of Naboth t This certainly was the effect of her blind rage and not of any prudence in her for prudence would have advised her to conceal her resentment until she had been ready to put her design in execution whereas this sending him word was giving him notice of his danger and admonishing him to avoid it  But since he had the confidence to come where she was she might think per haps that he was as courageous as she was furious that upon this notice he would scorn to fly and she too in her pride might scorn to kill him secretly or surrepti tiously resolving to make him a public sacrifice Patrick t Commentary and Pool s Annotations B J 1 Kings xix 3 4 II Elijah being now come to the same place where God had delivered the law to his servant Moses God was minded to communicate the like favour to his servant the prophet viz to unveil his Majesty to him and give him some signal of his immediate presence but there is something very remarkable in the words of the text â And behold the Lord passed by and a strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks hut the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earth quake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice 1 Kings xix 11 c And various are the speculations which this ap pearance of the divine Majesty hath suggested to inter preters The generality of them have looked upon this as a figure of the gospel dispensation which came not in such a terrible manner as the law did with storms thun ders lightnings and earthquakes Exod xix 16 but with great lenity and sweetness wherein God speaks to us by his Son who makes use of no other but gentle ar guments and soft persuasions But if we take this to be a symbolical admonition to Elijah according to the cir cumstances he was then in we may reasonably suppose that herein God intended to shew him that though he had all the elements ready armed at his command to destroy idolaters if he pleased to make use of them yet he had rather attain his end by patience and tenderness and long suffering signified by that small still voice wherein the Deity exhibited himself and consequently that the prophet should hereby be incited to imitate him bridling that passionate zeal to which his natural com plexion did hut too much incline him Le Clerc Col wietf s and Patrick s Commentaries B 314 book vni ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS driving twelve yoke of oxen he came to him and cast his own garment upon him Upon which Elisha began to prophesy and leaving his oxen he followed Elijah And when he desired leave to salute his parents Elijah gave him leave so to do and when he had bidden them adieu he followed him and became the disciple and the servant of Elijah all the days of his life And thus have I related the affairs in which this prophet was concerned Now there was one Naboth f of the city Izar who had a field adjoining to that of the king s The king would have persuaded him to sell him that field which lay so near to his own lands at what price he pleased that he might join them together and make them one farm and if he would not accept of money for it he gave him leave to choose any of his other fields in its stead But Na both said he would not do so but would keep the possession of that land of his own which he had by inheritance from his father J Upon this the king was grieved as if he had received an injury when he could not get another man s possession and would neither wash himself nor take any food And when Jezebel asked him what it was that troubled him and why he would neither wash him self nor eat he related to her the perverse ness of Naboth and how when he had made use of gentle words to him and such as were beneath the royal authority he had been affronted and had not obtained what he de sired However she persuaded him not to be cast down at this accident but to leave off his grief and return to the usual care of his body for that she would take care to have Naboth punished And she immedi ately sent letters to the rulers of the Jez reelites in Ahab s name and commanded them to fast and to assemble a congrega tion and to set Naboth at the head of them because he was of an illustrious family and to have three bold men ready to bear wit ness that he had blasphemed God and the king Â and then to stone him and slay him in that manner Accordingly when Naboth had been thus accused he was stoned by the multitude and slain When Jezebel heard that she went to the king and desired him to take possession of Naboth s vineyard on fqee cost So Ahab was glad of what had been done and rose up immediately from the bed whereon he lay to go to see Na both s vineyard but God had great indig nation at it and sent Elijah the prophet to the field of Naboth to speak to Ahab and  About an 899 t The account of Ahab s coveting Naboth s vineyard as Abarbinel observes is immediately set after his treat ment of Benhadad to shew his extreme great wickedness in sparing him as Saul did Agag king of the Amalekites and killing Naboth that he might get possession of his vineyard For this was a high aggravation of his crime that he basely murdered a just Israelite and let an im pious enemy escape Patrick s Commentary B J As it is natural to all men to love and value the an cient possessions that have been in their family so the law of Moses prohibited the alienation of lands from one tribe or family to another unless a man was reduced to poverty in which case he might sell it to the jubilee but then it was to revert to him again Lev xxv 15 25 28 Now as Naboth was in no need to sell his vineyard so he considered with himself that if merely to do the king a pleasure he should part with it out of his hands especially to be made a garden and so annexed to the palace neither he nor his posterity should ever be able to recover it again so that in this act he should both offend God and injure his posterity which he being a pious and religious man durst not adventure to do Pool s Annotations B  It was always a customary thing upon the approach of any great calamity or the apprehension of any na tional judgment to proclaim a fast and Jezebel ordered such a fast to be observed in Jezreel the better to con ceal her design against Naboth For by this means she intimated to the Jezreelites that they had some accursed thing among them which was ready to draw down the vengeance of God upon their city and that therefore it was their business to inquire into all those sins which provoked God to anger against them and to purge them out effectually As therefore these days of fasting were employed in punishing offenders doing justice and im ploring God s pardon they gave the elders of the city an occasion to convene an assembly and the false witnesses a fair opportunity to accuse Naboth before them Le Clerc s and Patrick s Commentaries B Â By the law of Moses it was death to blaspheme God Lev xxiv 16 and by custom it was death to revile the king Exod xxii 28 Now in order to make safe work the evidences as they were instructed accused Naboth of both these crimes that the people might be the better satisfied to see him stoned There is this difference however to be observed between these two crimes that if a man had only blasphemed God he was to be tried by the great court of Jerusalem as the Hebrew doctors tell us and his goods came to his heirs whereas when a man was executed for treason against the king his estate went to the exchequer and was forfeited to him against whom the offence was committed and for this reason it was that they accused Naboth of this crime likewise that his estate might be confiscated and Abab by that means got possession of his vineyard Patrick s Commentary B A 899 315 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS say to him that he had slain the true owner of that field unjustly And as soon as he came to him and the king had said that he might do with him what he pleased for he thought it a reproach to him to be thus caught in his sin Elijah said that in the very place in which the dead body of Naboth was eaten up by the dogs both his own blood and that of his wife should be shed and that all his family should perish because he had been so insolently wicked and had slain a citizen unjustly and contrary to the laws of his country Hereupon Ahab began to be sorry for the things he had done and to repent of them and he put on sack cloth and went barefoot and would not touch any food he also confessed his sins and endeavoured thus to appease God But God said to the prophet while Ahab was living he would put off the punishment of his family because he repented of those insolent crimes he had been guilty of but that still he would fulfil his threatening under his son f and this message the prophet delivered to the king CHAP XIV OF THE EXPEDITION OF HADAD KING OF DAMASCUS AND STRIA AGAINST AHAB WHEN the affairs of Ahab were in this situation the son of Benhadad who was king of the Syrians and Damascus got together an army out of all his country and procured thirty two kings beyond Euphrates to be his auxiliaries So he made an expe dition against Ahab But because Ahab s army was not like that of Benhadad s he did not set it in array to fight him but having shut up every thing that was in the country in the strongest cities he had he abode in Samaria himself for the walls about it were very strong and it appeared not easily to be taken in other respects also So the king of Syria took his army with him and came to Samaria and placed his army round about the city and besieged it He also sent a herald to Ahab and desired he would admit the ambassadors he would send him by whom he would let him know his pleasure So upon the king of Israel s permission for him to send those ambassadors came and by their king s command spake thus that Ahab s riches and his children and his wives were Benhadad s and if he would make an agreement and give him leave to take as much of what he had as he pleased he would withdraw his army and leave off the siege Upon this Ahab made the am bassadors to go back and tell their king that both he himself and all that he had were his possessions And when these am bassadors had told this to Benhadad he sent to him again and desired since he con fessed that all he had was his that he would admit those servants of his which he would send the next day and he commanded him to deliver to those whom he should send whatever upon their searching his palace and the houses of his friends and kindred they should find to be excellent in its kind but that what did not please them they should leave him At this second ambas sage Ahab was surprised and gathered to gether the multitude to a congregation and said For myself I am ready for your safety and peace to give up my own wives and children to the enemy and to yield to him all my own possessions for that was what the Syrian king required at his first ambassage But now he desires to send his servants to search all your houses and in them to leave nothing that is excellent in its kind seeking an occasion of fighting against me as knowing that I would not spare what is mine own for your sakes but taking a handle from the disagreeable terms he offers concerning you to bring a war upon us However 1 will do what you shall resolve is fit to be done Hereupon the multitude advised him to hearken to none of Benhadad s proposals but to despise him and to be in readiness to fight Ac cordingly he dismissed the ambassadors with this answer that he still continued in the mind to comply with what terms their master at first desired for the safety of the citizens  The Jews weep to this day says Jerom here recited by Reland and roll themselves upon sackcloth in ashes barefoot upon such occasions To which Span heim adds that after the same manner Berenice when voL I â NOS 27  28 life was in danger stood

submit to them When Benhadad heard this he had indig nation and sent ambassadors a third time threatening that his army should raise a bank higher than those walls in confidence of whose strength Ahab despised him and that by only each man of his army taking a handful of earth Hereby making a shew of the great number of his forces and aiming to affright him Ahab however answered that he ought not to vaunt himself when he had only put on his armour but when he should have conquered his enemies in the battle So the ambassadors came back and found Benhadad at supper with his thirty two kings and informed him of Ahab s answer in consequence of which he imme diately gave orders to make lines round the city and raise a bulwark and to prosecute the siege all manner of ways Now as this was doing Ahab was in great agony and all his people with him But he took courage and was freed from his fears upon a certain prophet s coming to him and saying that God had promised to subdue so many thou sands of his enemies under him And when he had inquired by whose means the victory was to be obtained he said By the sons of the princes but under thy conduct as their leader by reason of their unskilfulness in war Hereupon he called for the sons of the princes and found them to be two hundred and thirty two persons and when he was informed that the king of Syria had betaken himself to feasting and repose he opened the gates and sent out the princes sons Now when the sentinels told Ben hadad of it he sent some to meet them and commanded that if these men were come out for fighting they should bind them and bring them to him and that if they came out peaceably they should do the same Now Ahab had another army ready within the walls But the sons of the princes fell upon the out guard and slew many of them and pursued the rest of them to the camp And when the king of Israel saw that these had the upper hand he sent out all the rest of his army whicb falling suddenly upon the Syrians beat them for they did not think they would have come out On which ac count it was that they assaulted them when they were naked f and intoxicated inso much that they left all their armour behind them when they fled out of the camp and the king himself escaped with difficulty by fleeing away on horseback But Ahab went a great way in pursuit of the Syrians and when he had spoiled their camp which con tained a great deal of wealth and a large quantity of gold and silver he took Ben hadad s chariots and horses and returned to the city But as the prophet told him he ought to have his army ready because the Syrian king would make another expedition against him the next year Ahab was busy in making provision for it accordingly When Benhadad had saved himself and as much of the army as he could out of the battle he consulted with his friends how he might make another expedition against the Israelites Now those friends advised him not to fight with them on the hills because their God was potent in such places and thence it had come to pass that they had lately been beaten But they said that if they joined battle with them in the plain  1 Kings xx 11 t Mr Reland notes here very truly that the word naked does not always signify entirely naked but some times without men s usual armour without their usual robes or upper garments As when Virgil bids the hus bandmen plough and sow naked When Josephus says IV 3 that God had given the Jews the security of ar mour when they were naked and when he here says that Ahab fell on the Syrians when they were naked and intoxicated When XI 5 he says that Nehemiah commanded those Jews that were building the walls of Jerusalem to take care to have their armour on upon occasion that the enemy might not fall upon them naked I may add that the case seems to be the same in the Scripture when it says that Saul lay down naked among the prophets 1 Sam xix 24 When it says that Isaiah walked naked and barefoot Isaiah xx 2 3 and when it says that Peter before he girt his fisher s coat about him was naked John xxi 7 Nor were the naked sol diers others than those levis armaturx who were free from the heavy armour of the rest And the like may be supposed in several other places What is said to David also gives light to this who was reproached by Michnl for dancing before the ark and uncovering himself in the eyes of the handmaids as one of the vain fellows shamefully uncovereth himself 2 Sam vi 14 20 yet is it there expressly said verse 14 that David was girded with a linen ephod i e he had laid aside his robe of state and put on only the sacerdotal Levitical or sacred garments proper for such a solemnity See also Antiq V 3 VI 2 and XVII 10 J About an 898 aN 898 317 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS they should beat them They also gave him this farther advice to send home those kings whom he had brought as his auxiliaries but to retain their army and to set captains over it instead of the kings and to raise an army out of their country and let them be in the place of the former who perished in the battle together with horses and chariots So he judged their counsel to be good and acted according to it in the management of his army At the beginning of the spring Benhadad took his army with him and led it against the Hebrews and when he was come to a certain city called Aphek he pitched his camp in the great plain Ahab also went to meet him with his army and encamped over against him although his army were a very small one if it were compared with his enemies But the prophet came again to him and told him that God would give him the victory that he might demonstrate his own power to be not only on the mountains but on the plains also which it seems was contrary to the opinion of the Syrians So they lay quiet in the camp seven days but on the last of those days when the enemy came out and put themselves in array in order to fight Ahab also brought out his army and when the battle was joined and they fought stoutly he put the enemy to flight and pursued them and pressed upon them and slew them Nay they were de stroyed by their own chariots and by one another And even the few who escaped to their own city Aphek were also killed by the walls falling upon them being in number twenty seven thousand Now there was slain in this battle a hundred thousand more But Benhadad the king of the Syrians fled away with certain others of his most faithful servants and hid himself in a cellar under ground And when these told him that the kings of Israel were humane and merciful men and that they might make use of the usual manner of supplication and obtain de liverance from Ahab in case he would give them leave to go to him he gave them leave accordingly So they came to Ahab clothed in sackcloth and with ropes about their heads f for this was the ancient manner of supplication among the Syrians and said that Benhadad desired he would save him and that he would ever be a servant to him for that favour Ahab replied he was glad he was alive and not hurt in the battle And he further promised him the same honour and kindness that a man would shew to his brother So they received assurances upon oath from him that when he came to him he should receive no harm and then went and brought him out of the cellar wherein he was hid and brought him to Ahab as he sat in his chariot So Ben hadad worshipped him And Ahab gave him his hand and made him come up to him in his chariot and kissed him and bade him be of good cheer and not to expect that any mischief should be done to him So Benhadad returned him thanks and pro fessed that he would remember his kindness all the days of his life and promised he would restore those cities of the Israelites which the former kings had taken from them and grant that he should have leave to come to Damascus as his forefathers had come to Samaria So they confirmed their covenants by oaths and Ahab made him many presents and sent him back to his own kingdom And this was the conclusion of the war that Benhadad made against Ahab and the Israelites But a certain prophet whose name was Micaiah J came to one of the Israelites and bade him smite him on the head for by so  Josephus s number two myriads and seven thousand agrees here with that in our other copies as those that were slain by the fulling down of the walls of Aphek But I suspected at first that this number in Josephus s present copies could not be his original number because he calls them a few which could hardly be said of so many as 27 000 and because of the improbability of the fall of a particular wall killing so many Yet when I consider that Josephus s next words how the rest which were slain in the battle were ten other myriads  that 27 000 are but a few in comparison of 100 000 and that it was not a wall as in our English version but the wall or the entire walls of the city that fell down as in all the origi nals I lay aside that suspicion and firmly believe that Josephus himself hath with the rest given us the just number 27 000 The Aphek is by Josephus justly called the Syrians city as probably one of them which our Bible and Josephus speak of presently and which this Benhadad s predecessors had taken from the Israelites and was now to be restored t This manner of supplication for men s lives among the Syrians with ropes or halters about their heads or necks is I suppose no strange thing in later ages even in our own country J It is here very remarkable that in Josephus s copy this prophet whose denunciation of a disobedient person s 3K2 318 book via ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS doing he would please God but when he would not do so he foretold to him that since he disobeyed the commands of God he should meet with a lion and be destroyed by him When that sad accident had be fallen the man the prophet came again to another and gave him the same injunction So he smote him and wounded his skull Upon which he bound up his head and came to the king and told him that he had been a soldier of his and had the custody of one of the prisoners committed to him by an officer and that the prisoner being run away he was in danger of losing his own life by the means of that officer who had threatened him that if the prisoner escaped he would kill him And when Ahab had said that he would justly die he took off the binding about his head and was known by the king to be Micaiah the prophet who made use of this artifice as a prelude to his following words For he said that God would punish him who had suffered Ben hadad a blasphemer against him to escape punishment that he would so bring it about that he should die by the other s means and his people by the other s army Ahab was very angry at th 1 prophet and gave command that he snould be put in prison and there kept But for himself he was in confusion at the words of Micaiah and returned to his own house f CHAP XV OF JEHOSHAPHAT KINO OF JERUSALEM  ALSO OF AH AB s EXPE DITION AGAINST THE SYRIANS AND HIS DEFEAT AND DEATH I NOW return to Jehoshaphat king of Je rusalem who augmented his kingdom and set garrisons in the cities of the country belonging to his subjects and put no less garrisons into those cities which were taken out of the tribe of Ephraim by his grand father Abijah when Jeroboam reigned over the ten tribes than he did in the other But then he had God favourable and assisting to him as being both righteous and religious and seeking to do somewhat every day that should be agreeable and acceptable to God The neighbouring kings also honoured him with presents till the riches that he had acquired were immensely great and the glory he had gained was of a most exalted nature Now in the third year of his reign he called together the rulers of the country and the priests and commanded them to go round the land and teach all the people that were under him city by city the laws of Moses and to keep them and to be dili gent in the worship of God With this the whole multitude was pleased that they were not so eagerly set upon or affected with any thing so much as the observance of the laws The neighbouring nations also continued to love Jehoshaphat and to be at peace with him The Philistines paid their appointed tribute and the Arabians supplied him with three hundred and sixty lambs and as many kids of the goats He also fortified the great cities which were many in number and of great conse quence and he prepared a mighty army of soldiers and weapons against their enemies Now the army of men that wore their ar mour was three hundred thousand of the tribe of Judah of whom Adnah was the slaughter by a lion had lately come to pass was no other than Micaiah the son of Imlah who as he now denounced God s judgments on disobedient Ahab seems directly to have been that very prophet whom the same Ahab in 1 Kings xxii 8â 18 complains of as one whom he hated because he did not prophesy good concerning him but evil and who in that chapter openly repeats his denunciations against him all which came to pass accordingly Nor is there reason to doubt but this and the former were the very same prophet The other ancient Jews agreeing herein with Josephus as bishop Patrick assures us on 1 Kings xx 28 This is one of those very many instances in which the excellency of Josephus s Temple copy above all our other copies most evidently appears  What is most remarkable in this history and in many histories on other occasions in the Old Testament is that during the Jewish theocracy God acted entirely as the supreme king of Israel and the supreme general of their armies and always expected that the Israelites should be in such absolute subjection to him their supreme and heavenly king and general of their armies as sub jects and soldiers are to their earthly kings and generate and that usually without knowing the particular reasons of their injunctions See Dr Harris s Queries 8â 22 after his comment on Isa liii My Commentary on the book of Job and my Scripture Politics page 4â 7 where he will see that the particular Jewish theocracy did not commence till the rest of the idolatrous and wicked world had rejected that general theocracy which till then extended over all mankind t 1 Kings xx 43 j About an 914 II Seven thousand and seven hundred Hebrew and Septuagint 2 Chron xvii 1I an 896 319 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS chief But John was chief of two hundred thousand The same man was chief of the tribe of Benjamin and had two hundred thousand archers under him There was another chief whose name was Jehozabad who had a hundred and eighty thousand armed men This multitude was distributed to be ready for the king s service besides those whom he sent to the best fortified cities Jehoshaphat took for his son Jehoram to wife Athaliah the daughter of Ahab king of the ten tribes And when after some time he went to Samaria Ahab received him cour teously and treated the army that followed him in a splendid manner with great plenty of corn and wine and of slain beasts and desired that he would join with him in the war against the king of Syria that he might re cover from him the city of Ramoth in Gilead For though it had belonged to his father yet had the king of Syria s father taken it away from him And upon Jehoshaphat s promise to afford him his assistance for indeed his army was not inferior to the other s and his sending for his army from Jerusalem to Sa maria the two kings went out of the city and each of them sat on his own throne and each gave their orders to the respective armies Now Jehoshaphat bade them call the prophets if there were any there and inquire of them concerning this expedition against the king of Syria whether they would give them counsel to make the expedition at this time For there was peace at that time between Ahab and the king of Syria which had lasted three years from the time he had taken him captive till that day So Ahab called his own prophets being in number about four hundred f and bade them inquire of God whether he would grant him the victory if he made an expedition against Benhadad and enable him to overthrow that city for whose sake it was that he was going to war Now these prophets gave their counsel for making this expedition and said that he would defeat the king of Syria and as formerly would reduce him under his power But Jehoshaphat understanding by their words that they were false prophets asked Ahab whether there were not some other prophet belonging to the true God that they might have surer information con cerning futurities Ahab said there was in deed such a one but that he hated him as having prophesied evil to him and having foretold that he should be overcome and slain by the king of Syria and that for this cause he had him now in prison and that his name was Micaiah the son of Imlah But upon Jehoshaphat s desire that he might be produced Ahab sent an eunuch who brought Micaiah to him Now the eunuch had in formed him by the way that all the other prophets had foretold that the king should gain the victory But he said it was not lawful for him to lie against God but that he must speak what he should say to him about the king whatsoever it were When he came to Ahab and he adjured him upon oath to speak the truth to him he said that God had shewn to him the Israelites running away and pursued by the Syrians and dis persed upon the mountains by them as arc Â flocks of sheep dispersed when their shep herd is slain He said farther that God sig nified to him J that those Israelites should return in peace to their own home and that he only should fall in the battle When Micaiah had thus spoken Ahab said to Je hoshaphat  I told thee a little while ago the disposition of the man with regard to me and that he uses to prophesy evil to me Upon which Micaiah replied that he ought to hear all whatsoever it be that God foretells and that in particular they were false prophets who encouraged him to make this war in hope of victory whereas he must fight and  Two hundred and eighty thousand 2 Chron xvii 15 t 1 Kings xxii 6 J Micaiah s answer to Ahab inquiring of him the suc cess of his intended expedition is Go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver the city into the hands of the king 1 Kings xxii 15 which does not at all contradict the other prophets had it been spoken in earnest but we have good reason to believe that the words were spoken ironically and in mockery to the promises which the other prophets made Ahab Accordingly we may oh serve by Ahab s reply that he suspected Micaiah s sin cerity and either by his gesture or manner of speaking gathered that his meaning was to traduce these false pro phets for their answers so that Micaiah s answer is in effect as if he had said â Since thou dost not seek to know the truth but only to please thyself go to the battle as all thy prophets advise thee expect the success which they promise thee and try the truth of their pre dictions by thy dear bought experience Pool s Jhmo tations B 120 book viiL ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS be killed But Zedekiah one of those false prophets came near and exhorted him not to hearken to Micaiah for he did not at all speak truth As a demonstration of which he instanced in what Elijah had said who was a better prophet in foretelling futurities than Micaiah for he foretold that the dogs should lick his blood in the city Jezreel in the field of Nahoth as they licked the blood of Naboth who by his means was there stoned to death by the multitude f that therefore it was plain that this Micaiah was a liar as contradicting a greater prophet than himself and saying that he should be slain at three days journey distance And said he you shall soon know whether he be a true prophet and hath the power of the Divine Spirit for I will smite him and let him then hurt my hand as Jadon caused the hand of Jeroboam the king to wither when he would liave caught him for I suppose thou hast certainly heard of that accident So when upon his smiting Micaiah no harm happened to him Ahab took courage and readily led his army against the king of Syria For as I suppose Jfate was too hard for him and made him believe that the false prophets spake truer than the true one that it might take an occasion of bringing him to his end However Zedekiah made horns of iron and said to Ahab that God made those horns sig nals that by them he should overthrow all Syria But Micaiah replied that Zedekiah in a few days should go from one secret chamber to another to hide himself that he might escape the punishment of his lying Then did the king give order that they should take Micaiah away and guard him to Amon the governor of the city and give him no thing but bread and water Then Ahab and Jehoshaphat the king of Jerusalem took their forces and marched to Ramoth a city of Gilead And when the king of Syria heard of this expedition he brought out his army to oppose them and pitched his camp not far from Ramoth Now Ahab and Jehoshaphat had agreed that Ahab should lay aside his royal robes Â but that the king of Jerusalem should put on his Ahab s proper habit and stand before the army in order to disprove by this artifice what Micaiah had foretold But Ahab s fate found him out without his robes For Ben hadad the king of Assyria had charged his army by the means of their commanders to kill nobody else but only the king of Israel So when the Syrians upon their joining battle with the Israelites saw Jehoshaphat stand before the army and conjectured that he was Ahab they fell Violently upon him and en compassed him round But when they were near and knew that it was not he they all returned back And while the fight lasted from the morning light till late in the evening and the Syrians were conquerors they killed nobody as their king had commanded them And when they sought to kill Ahab alone but could not find him there was a young nobleman belonging to king Benhadad whose name was Naaman he drew his bow against  These reasonings of Zedekiah the false prophet in order to persuade Ahab not to believe Micaiah the true prophet are plausible but being omitted in our other copies we cannot now tell whence Josephus had them whether from his own temple copy from some other original author or from certain ancient notes That some such plausible objection was now raised against Micaiah is very likely otherwise Jehoshaphat who used to dis believe all such false prophets could never have been induced to accompany Ahab in these desperate circum stances  There is a great dispute among the learned as to the accomplishment of this prophecy At first it was no doubt intended to be literally fulfilled but upon Ahab s repentance as we find below the punishment was trans ferred from him to his son Joram in whom it was actually accomplished for his dead body was cast into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite for the dogs to de vour 2 Kings ix 25 Since Ahab s blood therefore was licked by dogs not at Jezreel but at Samaria it seems necessary that we should understand the Hebrew word which our translation renders in the place where not as denoting the place but the manner in which the thing was done and so the sense of the passage will beâ That as dogs licked or in like manner as dogs licked Naboth s blood even so shall they lick thine observe what I say even thine Pool s Annotations B I Or Divine Providence II 1 Kings xxii 27 Â This reading of Josephus s and of the Septuagint that Jehoshaphat put on not his own but Ahab s robe in order to appear to be Ahab while Ahab was without any robes at all and hoped thereby to escape his own evil fate and disprove Micaiah s prophecy against him is ex ceeding probable It gives great light also to this whole history and shews that although Ahab hoped Jehosha phat would be mistaken for him and run the only risk of being slain in the battle yet was he entirely disappointed while still the escape of the good man Jehoshaphat and the slaughter of the bad man Ahab demonstrated the great distinction that Divine Providence made betwixt them aN 896 321 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the enemy and wounded the king through his breast plate in his lungs Upon this Ahab resolved not to make his mischance known to his army lest they should run away But he bade the driver of his chariot to turn it back and carry him out of the battle be cause he was mortally wounded However he sat in his chariot and endured the pain till sunset and then he fainted away and died At the approach of night the Syrian army retired to their camp and when the herald belonging to the camp gave notice that Ahab was dead they returned home And they took the dead body of Ahab to Samaria and buried it there but when they had washed his chariot in the fountain of Jezreel which was bloody with the dead body of the king they acknowledged that the prophecy of Elijah was true for the dogs licked his blood and the harlots continued afterward to wash themselves in that fountain But still he died at Ramoth as Micaiah had foretold And as what things weref foretold should happen to Ahab by the two prophets came to pass we ought thence to have exalted notions of God and every where to honour and worship him and never to suppose that what is pleasant and agreeable is worthy of belief before what is true and to esteem nothing more advan tageous than the gift of prophecy and that foreknowledge of future events which is de rived from it Since God shews men thereby what they ought to avoid We may also from what happened to this king consider the power of fate J that there is no way of avoiding it even when we know it It creeps upon human souls and flatters them with pleasing hopes till it leads them about to the place whence it will be too hard for them Accordingly Ahab appears to have been de ceived thereby till he disbelieved those that predicted his defeat but by giving credit to such as foretold what was grateful to him he was slain and his son Ahaziah succeeded him  1 Kings xxii 34 t We have here a very wise reflection of Josephus s about Divine Providence and what is derived from it prophecy and the inevitable certainty of its accomplish ment and that when wicked men think they take proper methods to elude what is denounced against them and to escape the Divine judgments thereby threatened without repentance they are ever by Providence infatuated to bring about their own destruction And thereby withal to demonstrate the perfect veracity of that God whose predictions they endeavour to elude J Or Divine Providence 322 book it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK IX Containing an Interval of One Hundred and Fifty seven Years FROM THE DEATH OF AHAB TO THE CAPTIVITY OF THE TEN TRIBES CHAP I of jehoshaphat s pious conduct HIS appointment of JUDGES AND HIS VICTORIES OVER HIS ENEMIES WHEN Jehoshaphat was come to Jeru salem from the assistance he had afforded Ahab king of Israel against the Syrians the prophet Jehu met him and ac cused him for assisting an impious prince and said to him that God was displeased with him for so doing but that he delivered him from the enemy notwithstanding he had sinned because of his own disposition which was good Hereupon the king betook him self to thanksgivings and sacrifices to God and soon afterward went over all that country which he ruled round about and taught the people to observe the laws which God gave them by Moses and that religious worship that was due to him He also appointed judges in all the cities of his kingdom and charged them to have regard to nothing so much in judging the multitude as to do jus tice and not to be moved by bribes nor by the dignity of men eminent for either their birth or riches but to distribute justice equally to all as knowing that God is con scious of every secret action When he had instructed them thus and gone over every  The charge or solemn admonition which Jehoshaphat gave the judges whom he appointed in each city runs in these words â Take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man hut for the Lord who is with you in the judgment wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you Take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts 2 Chron xix 6 7 It is a remarkable saying of Cicero that judges being sworn to do justice should remember when they come to pass sentence Deum habere testem city of the two tribes he returned to Jeru salem He there also constituted judges out of the priests and Levites t and principal persons of the multitude and admonished them to pass all their sentences with care and justice And that if any of the people of his country had differences of great conse quence they would send them out of the other cities to these judges who would be obliged to give righteous sentences con cerning such causes and this with the greater care because it is proper that the sentences which are given in that city where the temple of God is and wherein the king dwells be given with the utmost care and equity Now he set over them Amariah the priest and Zebadiah of the tribe of Judah And after this manner it was that the king ordered these affairs About the same time the Moabites and Ammonites made an expedition against Je hoshaphat and took with them a great body of Arabians and pitched their camp at En gedi a city situate near the lake Asphaltites and distant three hundred furlongs from Je rusalem In that place grew the best kind of palm trees and the opobalsamum J Now Jehoshaphat heard that the

called the people of Jerusalem to a con gregation in the temple And standing over against the temple itself he called upon God to afford him power to inflict punishment upon those invaders for that those who built his temple had prayed that he would protect that city and take vengeance on those that were so bold as to come against it When he nad prayed thus he was affected even to tears and the whole multitude together with their wives and children made their supplications also Hereupon a certain pro phet Jahaziel by name came into the midst of the assembly and cried out both to the multitude and to the king that God heard their prayers and promised to fight against their enemies He also gave order that the king should draw his forces out the next day for that he should find them between Jeru salem and the ascent of Engedi at a place called Eminence f and that he should not engage their forces but only stand still and see how God would fight against them When the prophet had said this both the king and the multitude fell upon their faces and gave thanks to God and worshipped him and the Levites continued singing hymns to God with their instruments of music As soon as it was day and the king was come into that wilderness which was under the city of Tekoa he said to the multitude that they ought to give implicit credit to what the prophet had said and not to set them selves in array for fighting but to set the priests with their trumpets and the Levites with the singers of hymns to give thanks to God as having already delivered the country from its enemies This opinion of the king pleased the people and they did as he de sired So God caused a terror and commo tion to arise among the Ammonites J who thought one another to be enemies and slew one another insomuch that not one man out of so great an army escaped And when Jehoshaphat looked upon that valley wherein their enemies had been encamped and saw it full of dead men he rejoiced at this surpri sing assistance of God who by his own power and without their labour had given them the victory He also permitted his army to take the prey of the enemies camp and to spoil their dead bodies and indeed so they did for three days together till they were weary so great was the number of the slain And on the fourth day all the people were gathered together unto a certain hollow place or valley and blessed God for his power and assistance from which the place was called the valley of Berachah or Blessing When the king had brought his army back to Jerusalem he celebrated festivals and offered sacrifices for many days And indeed after the destruction of his enemies and when it came to the ears of the foreign nations they were all greatly affrighted as supposing that God would openly fight for him hereafter So Jehoshaphat from that time lived in great glory and splendour on account of his righte ousness and his piety towards God He was also in friendship with Ahab s son Â who was king of Israel and he joined with him in the building of ships that were to sail to Pontus and the commercial cities of Thrace but  2 Chron xx 3 4 t The cliff of Ziz 2 Chron xx 16 j The words in the text

privately and they supposing this to be done by their neighbours might turn about and fall upon them like enemies and so break forth into mutual slaughters Or 2d By some jealousies and animosities

of Ahab reigned over Israel and made his abode in Samaria He was a wicked man and in all respects like to both his parents and to Jeroboam who first of all transgressed and began to deceive the people In the second year of his reign the king of Moab revolted from his obedience and left off paying those tributes which he had before payed to Ahab Now it happened that Ahaziah as he was coming down from the top of his house f fell down from it and in his sickness sent to the Fly J which was the god of Ekron for that was this god s name to inquire about his re Ophir and Tarshish and the place whence it sailed is in them Eziongeber which lay on the Red Sea whence it was impossible for any ships to sail to Pontus or Thrace So that Josephus s copy differed here from our other copies But so far may we conclude that Josephus thought one Ophir to be somewhere in the Mediterranean and not in the South Sea though perhaps there might be another Ophir in that South Sea also and fleets might then sail both from Phoenicia and from the Red Sea to fetch the gold of Ophir I mean all this unless what our copies call Ophir Josephus s temple copy called Pontus as the word is here rendered by him Which is perhaps the real truth and clears the whole difficulty  An 899 t In the eastern countries the roofs of the houses were flat and surrounded with a battlement to prevent falling from them because it was a customary thing for people to walk upon them in order to take the air Now in this battlement we may suppose that there were some wooden lattices for people to look through of equal height with the parapet wall and that Ahaziah negligently leaning on it as it was rotten and infirm it broke down and let him fall into the court or garden belonging to his house Or there is another way whereby he might fall In these flat roofs there was generally an opening which served instead of a sky light to the house below and this opening might be done over with lattice work which the king as he was carelessly walking might chance to step upon and slip through Nor is there any absurdity in supposing such lattice work in a king s palace when the world was not arrived at that height of art and curiosity that we find it in now Fool s Annotations and Calmet s Dissertation sur les edifices des anciens Hebrew B J The word signifies The god of flies but how this idol came to obtain that name it is not so easy a matter to discover Several are of opinion that this god was called Baal semin the lord of heaven but that the Jews by way of contempt gave it the name of Baal zebub or the lord of a fly a god that was nothing worth or as others say whose temple was filled with flies whereas the temple of Jerusalem notwithstanding all the sacrifices that were daily offered never once had a fly in it as their doctors relate The sacred writings indeed when they speak of the gods of the Heathens very frequently call them in general idols vanity abominations c but they never change their proper names into such as are of an oppro brious import neither can we think it likely that the king of Israel would have called the god of Ekron for whom he had so high a veneration as to consult him in his â ickness by any appellation of contempt Whoever con siders what troublesome and destructive creatures espe cially in some hot countries flies are known to be in what vast swarms they sometimes settle and not only de vour all the fruits of the earth but in many places occa sioned a noisome pestilence may reasonably suppose that the Heathens had a proper deity to whom they paid their addresses either for the prevention or removal of their sore plagues And accordingly we are told by Pliny lib xxix c 6 that when there was a plague in Africa occasioned by vast quantities of flies after that the people had sacrificed to the god Achore he should have said the god of Ekron for there is a plain affinity between their names the flies all died and the distemper was extin guished Now it was a known maxim of the Heathen theology that as all plagues were inflicted by some evil daemon or other so all evil daemons were under the re straint of some superior one who is their prince and ruler As therefore Pluto was known to be the god of hell and to have all the mischievous band of spirits under his con trol to him the Heathens used to pray and offer sacri fices that he might not suffer any of his inferior agents to inflict this heavy judgment upon them They worshipped him I say not to engage him to do them any good but to prevail with him to do them no harm and accordingly we

the God of the Hebrews ap peared to Elijah the prophet and commanded him to go and meet the messengers that were sent and to ask them whether the people of Israel had not a God of their own that the king sent to a foreign god to inquire about his recovery and to bid them return and tell the king that he would not escape this disease And when Elijah had performed what God had commanded and the messengers had heard what he said they returned to the king immediately And when the king wondered how they could return so soon and asked them the reason of it they said  A certain man met us and forbade us to go on any farther but to return and tell thee from the command of the God of Israel that this dis ease will have a bad termination t And when the king desired them to describe the man who said this to them they replied  He was a hairy man and was girt about with a girdle of leather So the king understood that the man described by the messengers was Elijah Hereupon he sent a captain to him with fifty soldiers and commanded them to bring Elijah to him And when the cap tain that was sent found Elijah sitting upon the top of a hill he commanded him to come down and to come to the king for so had he enjoined but that in case he refused they would carry him by force Elijah replied That you may have a trial whether I be a true prophet I will pray that fireJ may fall from heaven and destroy both the soldiers and thyself So he prayed and a whirlwind of fire fell from heaven and destroyed the captain and those that were with him And when the king was informed of the destruction of these men he was very angry and sent another captain with the like number of armed men that were sent before And when this captain also threatened the prophet that unless he came down of his own accord he would take and carry him away upon his prayer against him the fire from heaven slew this captain as well as the other And when upon inquiry the king was informed of what happened to him he sent out a third captain But when this captain who was a wise man and of a mild disposition came to the place where Elijah happened to be he spake civilly to him and said he knew that it was without his own consent and only in submission to the king s command that he came to him and that those that came before did not come willingly but on the same account He therefore desired him to have pity on those armed men that were with him and to come down and follow him to the king So Elijah accepted of his discreet words and courteous behaviour and came down and followed him And when he came to the king he told him possession of it It was situated near the Mediterranean Sea between Ashdod and Jamnia in a moist and hot soil and was therefore very much infested with flies Calmtfs Dictionary and Patrick s Commentary B  The description which the messengers give of Elijah is â That he was a hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins 2 Kings i 8 where his being a hairy man may either denote his wearing long hair on his head and his beard as the ancient Greek philosophers were wont to do and as Lucan describes Cato Intensos rigidam in frontem descendere canos Passus erat moestamque genis increscere barbam Or it may denote his habit which was made of skins rough and with their hair on as the ancient heroes were clothed in the skins of lions tigers and bears as the Evangelists represent the Baptist in a raiment of camel s hair Matt iii 4 as the apostle describes the prophets wandering about in sheep skins and goat skins Heb xi 37 and as Statius dresses up old Tiresius longaevi vatis opacos Tiresiae vultus vocemaue et vellera nota Induitur  Theb lib 2 B  2 Kings i 6  It is commonly esteemed a cruel action of Elijah when he called for fire from heaven and consumed two captains and a hundred soldiers and this for no other crime than obeying the orders of their king in attempting to seize him And our Saviour notices it as an instance of greater severity than the spirit of the New Testament allows Luke ix 54 But we must consider that it is not unlikely that these captains and soldiers believed they were sent to fetch the prophet that he might be put to death for foretelling the death of the king and this while they knew him to be the prophet of the true God the supreme king of Israel for they were still under the theocracy which was no less than impiety rebellion and treason in the highest degree Nor would the command of a subaltern or inferior captain contradicting the com mands of the general when the captain and the soldiers both knew it to be so as I suppose justify or excuse such gross rebellion and disobedience in soldiers at this day Accordingly when Saul commanded his guards to slay Ahimelech and the priests at Nob they knew it to be an unlawful command and would not obey it 1 Sam xxii 17 From which cases both officers and soldiers may learn that the commands of their leaders or kings cannot justify or excuse them in doing

AND THE DEATH OF JEHOSHAPHAT WHEN Joram had taken upon him J the kingdom he determined to make an expedition against the king of Moab whose name was Mesha For as we have said be fore he was departed from his obedience to his brother Ahaziah while he payed to his father Ahab two hundred thousand sheep with their fleeces of wool When therefore he had gathered his own army together he sent to Jehoshaphat and intreated him that since he had from the beginning been a friend to his father he would assist him in the war that he was entering into against the Moabites who had departed from their obe dience Jehoshaphat readily promised that he would assist him and would oblige the king of Edom who was under his authority  An 898 t Josephus s character of Joram seems much worse than that in our Hebrew and Greek copies which say 2 Kings iii 2 3 that although he followed the calves of Jeroboam yet did he not act like his father Ahab and his mother Jezebel because he put away the image of Baal that his father had made Where we may note that not only the Alexandrian MS omits the last branch in to make the same expedition also When Joram had received these assurances he took his army with him and came to Jeru salem and when he had been sumptuously entertained by the king of Jerusalem it was resolved upon by them to make their march against their enemies through the wilderness of Edom And when they had taken a com pass of seven days journey they were in dis tress for want of water for the cattle and for the army from the mistake of their roads by the guides that conducted them inso much that they were all in an agony espe cially Joram and cried to God by reason of their sorrow and desired to know what wickedness had been committed by them that induced him to deliver three kings to gether without fighting into the hands of the king of Moab But Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man encouraged him and bade him send to the camp and know whether any prophet of God was come along with them that they might by him learn from God what they should do And when one of the servants of Joram said he had seen there Elisha the son of Shaphat the disciple of Elijah the three kings went to him at the intreaty of Jehoshaphat And when they were come to the prophet s tent without the camp they asked him what would become of the army and Joram was particularly pressing with him about it And when he replied to him that he should not trouble him but go to his father s and mother s pro phets for they to be sure were true pro phets he still desired him to prophesy and to save them So he sware by God that he would not answer him unless it were on ac count of Jehoshaphat who was a holy and righteous man and when at his desire they brought him a man that could play on the psaltery the Divine Spirit came upon him as the music played and he commanded them to dig many trenches in the valley For said he though there appear neither cloud nor wind nor storm of rain ye shall closed in

drinking of it JNor will this be all the favour that you shall receive from God but you shall also overcome your enemies and take the best and strongest cities of the Moabites and you shall cut down their fruit trees and lay waste their country and stop up their fountains and rivers Accordingly the next day before sun rise a great torrent ran strongly for God had caused it to rain very plentifully at the dis tance of three days journey in Edom So that the army and the cattle found water in abundance But when the Moabites heard that the three kings were coming upon them and made their approach through the wil derness the king of JVloab gathered his army together presently and commanded them to encamp upon the mountains that when the enemies should attempt to enter their country they might not be concealed from them But at the rising of the sun when they saw the water in the torrent for it was not far from the land of Moab and that it was of the colour of blood for at such a time the water especially looks red by the shining of the sun upon it they formed a false notion of the state of their enemies as if they had slain one another for thirst and that the river ran with their blood However supposing that this was the case they desired their king would send them out to spoil their enemies Whereupon they all went in haste as to an advantage already gained and came to the enemy s camp as supposing them destroyed already But their hope deceived them for as their enemies stood round about them some of them were cut in pieces and others were dispersed and fled to their own coun try And when the kings came to the land of Moab they overthrew the cities that were in it and spoiled their fields and marred them filling them with stones out of the brooks and cut down the best of their trees and stopped up their fountains of water and overthrew their walls to the foundations But the king of Moab when he was pursued endured a siege and seeing his city in dan ger of being overthrown by force he made a sally with seven hundred men in order to break through the enemies camp with his horsemen on that side where the watch seemed to be kept most negligently and when upon trial he could not get away he returned to the city and committed an ac tion expressive of despair and the utmost distress for he took his eldest son who was to reign after him and lifting him up upon the wall that he might be visible to all the enemies he offered him as a whole burnt offering to God When the kings saw this they commiserated the distress that had oc casioned it and were so affected that they raised the siege and every one returned to his own house So Jehoshaphat came to Je rusalem and continued in peace there and survived this expedition but a little time and then

acts 1 have a mind to go over particularly for they were illustrious and worthy to be re lated as we have them set down in the sacred books For they say that the widow of Obadiah  This practice of cutting down or plucking up by the roots the fruit trees was forbidden in ordinary wars by the law of Moses Deut xx 19 20 and only allowed by God in this particular case when the Moabites were to be punished and cut off in an extraordinary manner for their wickedness See Jer xlviii 11 12 13 and many similar prophecies against them Nothing could there fore justify this practice but a particular commission from God by his prophet as in the present case which was ever a sufficient warrant for breaking any such ritual or ceremonial law From an 919 to 894 B C 1 Kings xxii 50 That this woman who cried to Elisha and who in our Bible is styled the wife of one of the prophets 2 Kings ir 1 was no other than the widow of Obadiah J28 book IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  Ahab s steward came to him and said he was not ignorant how her husband had pre served the prophets that were to be slain by Jezebel the wife of Ahab for she said that he hid a hundred of them and had borrowed money for their maintenance and that after her husband s death she and her children were carried away to be made slaves by the creditors and she desired of him to have mercy upon her on account of what her husband did and afford her some assistance And when he asked her what she had in the house she said Nothing but a very small quantity of oil in a cruse So the prophet bade her go away and borrow a great many empty vessels of her neighbours the good steward of Abab as Joscphus affirms is con firmed as Dr Hudson informs us by the Chaldee Pa raphrast and by the Rabbins and others besides Nor is that unlikely which Josephus here adds that these debts were contracted by her husband for the support of those hundred of the Lord s prophets whom he main tained by fifty in a cave in the days of Ahab and Jezebel 1 Kings xviii 4 which circumstance rendered it highly fit that the prophet Elisha should provide her a remedy and enable her to redeem herself and her sons from that slavery which insolvent debtors were liable to by the law of Moses Lev xxv 39 Matt xviii 25 and which he did accordingly with God s help at the expense of a miracle  The Jewish law looked upon children as the proper goods of their parents who had power to sell them for seven years as their creditors had to compel them to do it in order to pay their debt and from the Jews this custom was propagated to the Athenians and from them to the Romans The Romans indeed had the most abso lute control over their children By the decree of Ro mulus they could imprison beat kill or sell them for slaves But Numa Pompilius first moderated this and the emperor Dioclesian made a law that no free person should be sold upon account of debt The ancient Athe nians had the like jurisdiction over their children but Solon reformed this cruel custom as indeed it seemed a little hard that the children of a poor man who have no manner of inheritance left them should be compelled into slavery in order to pay their deceased father s debts and yet this was the custom as appears from this passage wherein the prophet does not pretend to reprove the cre ditor but only puts the woman in a method to pay him Calmtt s and he Clere s Commentaries B t Dr Hudson with very good reason slispects that there is no small defect in our present copies of Josephus just before the beginning of this paragraph and that chiefly as to that distinct account which he had given us reason to expect in the preceding one and to which he seems to refer chap viii concerning the glorious miracles which Elisha wrought which indeed in our Bibles are not a few 2 Kings ivâ ix but of which we have several omitted in Josephus s present copies Nor does the fol lowing incoherence here which requires Joram to beware of that place as 2 Kings vi 10 whereas no certain place and when she had shut her chamber door to pour the oil into them all for that God would fill them And when the woman had done what she was commanded and bade her children bring every one of the vessels and all were filled she came to the prophet and told him they were full Upon which he advised her to go and sell the oil and S ay the creditors what was owing to them or that there would be some surplus of the price of oil which she might make use of for the maintenance of her children And thus did Elisha discharge the woman s debts and free her from the vexation of her creditors Elishaf also sent a hasty message to Jo had in his present copies been mentioned before at all agree with the foregoing coherence and context as it does in our other copies One of those histories omitted at present was evidently in his Bible I mean that of curing Naaman s leprosy 2 Kings v for he plainly alludes to it 111 11 where he observes that There were lepers in many nations who yet have been in honour and not only free from reproach and avoid ance but who have been great captaius of armies and been intrusted with high offices in the commonwealth and have had the privilege of entering into holy places and temples But what makes me most to regret the want of that history in our present copies of Josephus is this that we have here as it is commonly understood one of the greatest difficulties in all the Bible I mean that in 2 Kings v 18 19 where Naaman after he had been miraculously cured by a prophet of the true God and had thereupon promised that he would thenceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifices unto other gods but unto the Lord adds In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing And Elisha said unto him Go in peace This looks like a prophet s permission for being partaker in idolatry itself out of compliance with an idolatrous court The Septuagint in our ordinary copies plainly understood it so by using the verb bowing down in the future tense although Theodoret cites it as in the past tense And the great Bochart has shewn that in the original it more properly belongs to the times past Op page 892 894 898 and only contains his desire of pardon for what he had for merly done while he was a gross idolater and not of being indulged in any such thing for the time to come The permission of which seems utterly inconsistent with both the Old ai New Testament It is therefore a great pity that Josephus s copies should be defective in so re markable a place Nor is it very unlikely that what Josephus promised to speak of afterward V 1 concerning the curse on the rebuilder of Jericho but is not now found in his present books was contained in what is here wanting upon occasion of Elisha s miracle there 2 Kings ii 18â 22 an 893 329 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ram and exhorted him to take care of that place for that therein were some Syrians lying in ambush to kill him So the king did as the prophet exhorted him and avoid ed going a hunting And when Benhadad missed of the success of his lying in ambush he was angry with his own servants as if they had betrayed his concealment to Jo ram and he sent for them and said they were the betrayers of his secret counsels and he threatened that he would put them to death since such their practice was evi dent because he had intrusted this secret to none but them and yet it was made known to his enemy But one that was E resent said that he should not mistake imself nor suspect that they had discovered to his enemy his sending men to kill him but that he ought to know that it was Elisha the prophet who discovered all to him and laid open all his counsels So he gave order that they should send some to learn in what city Elisha dwelt Accordingly those that were sent brought word that he was in Dothan Wherefore Benhadad sent to that city a great army with horses and chariots to take Elisha So they encom passed the city round about by night and kept him therein confined But when the prophet s servant in the morning perceived this and that his enemies sought to take Elisha he came running and crying after a disordered manner to him and told him of it But he encouraged him and bade him not be afraid but to despise the enemy and trust in the assistance of God and he besought God to manifest to his servant his power and pre sence so far as was possible in order to the inspiring him with hope and courage Ac cordingly God heard the prayer of the pro phet and made the servant see a multitude of chariots and horses encompassing Elisha till he laid aside his fear and his courage re vived at the sight of what he supposed was come to their assistance After this Elisha did farther intreat God that he would dim the eyes of their enemies and cast a mist before them whereby they might not discern him When this was done he went into the midst of his enemies and asked them who it was that they came to seek And when they replied the prophet Elisha he promised he would deliver him to them if they would follow him to the city where he was So these men were so darkened by God in their sight and in their mind that they followed him very diligently And when Elisha had brought them to Samaria he ordered Joram the king to shut the gates and to place his own army round about them and prayed to God to clear the eyes of these their enemies and take the mist from before them Ac cordingly when they were freed from he obscurity they had been in they saw them selves in the midst of their enemies And as the Syrians were strangely amazed and distressed as was but reasonable at an ac tion so divine and surprising and as king Joram asked the prophet if he would give him leave to shoot at them Elisha forbade them so to do and said that it was just to kill those that were taken in battle but that these men had done no harm but without knowing it were come thither by the divine power So that his counsel was to treat them in a hospitable manner at his table and then send them away without hurting them Wherefore Joram obeyed the prophet and when he had feasted the Sy rians in a splendid and magnificent manner he let them go to Benhadad their king t Now when these men were come back and had shewed Benhadad how strange an accident had befallen them and how they had experienced the God of Israel s power he wondered at it as also at that prophet with whom God was so evidently present So he determined to make no more secret attempts upon the king of Israel out of fear of Elisha but resolved to make open war with them as supposing he could be too hard for his enemies by the multitude of his army and his power So he made an ex pedition with a great army against Joram who not thinking himself a match for him shut himself up in Samaria and depended  1 Kings vi 20 t Upon occasion of this stratagem of Elisha s in Jose phus we may take notice that although Josephus was one of the greatest lovers of truth in the world yet in a just war he seems to have had no manner of scruple upon him by all such stratagems possible to deceive public enemies See this Josephus s account of Jere miah s imposition on the great men of the Jews in some what a like case X 7 See him also VII 9 And see our own Bible 2 Sam xvi 16 c and xvii 1â 16 20 330 BOOK 15 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS â i w m on the strength of its walls But Benhadad supposed he should take the city if not by his engines of war yet that he should over come the Samaritans by famine and the want of necessaries and brought his army upon them and besieged the city And the plenty of necessaries was brought so low with Jo ram that from the extremity of want an ass s head was sold in Samaria for eighty pieces of silver and the Hebrews bought a sextary of dove s dung instead of salt for five pieces of silver Now Joram was in fear lest some persons should betray the city to the enemy by reason of the famine and went every day round the walls and the guards to see whether any such were con cealed among them and by being thus seen and by taking such care he deprived them of the opportunity of contriving any such things One day upon a certain woman s crying out Have pity on me my lord he thought that she was about to ask for somewhat to eat and imprecated God s curse upon her saying he had neither threshing floor nor wine press whence he might give her any thing at her petition Upon which she said she did not desire his aid in any such thing nor troubled him about food but desired that he would do her justice as to another woman And when he bade her let him know what she desired she said she had made an agree ment with another woman who was her neighbour and her friend that because the famine was intolerable they should kill their children each of them having a son of her own and live upon them two days the one day upon one son and the other day upon the other And said she I have killed my son the first day and we lived upon him yesterday but this other woman will not do the same thing but hath broken her agree ment and hath concealed her son This story affected the king so deeply that he rent his garment and cried out with a loud voice and conceiving great wrath against Elisha the prophet he resolved to have him slain because he did not pray to God to provide them some way of escape out of the miseries with which they were surrounded Accordingly a messenger was immediately despatched to kill the prophet but Elisha was not unacquainted with the wrath of the king against him For as he sat in his house by himself with none but his disciples about him he told them that Joram f who was the son of a murderer had sent one to take away his head But said he when he that is commanded to do this comes take care that you do not let him come in but press the door against him and hold him fast there for the king himself will follow him and come to me having altered his mind Accordingly they did as they were bidden when he that was sent by the king to kill Elisha came But Joram repented of his wrath against the prophet and for fear he that was commanded to kill him should have done it before he came he made haste to hinder his slaughter And when he came he accused him that he did not pray to God for his deliverance from the miseries the people now lay under but saw them so sadly destroyed by them Here upon Elisha promised that the very next day at the very same hour in which the king came to him they should have a great plenty of food and that two Jseahs of barley should be sold in the market for a shekel and a seah of fine flour should be bought for a shekel This prediction made Joram and those that were present very joyful for they did not scruple believing what the prophet said on account of the experience they had of the truth of his former predictions And the expectation of plenty made the want they were in that day with the uneasiness that accompanied it appear a light thing to them But the captain of the third band who was a friend of the king s and on whose hand the king leaned said Thou talkest of incredible things O prophet for as it is impossible for God to pour down torrents of  This was threatened as a punishment for disobedience in Levit xxvi 29 and Deut xxvii 53 57 t This son of a murderer was Joram the son of Ahab which Ahab slew or permitted his wife Jezebel to slay the Lord s prophets and Naboth 1 Kings xviii 4 xxi 19 and he is here called by this name 1 suppose be cause he had now also himself sent an officer to murder him Yet is Josephus s account of Joram s coming to himself at List as repenting of his intended cruelty much more probable than that in our copies 2 Kings vi 33 which rather implies the contrary See the place which seems to be imperfect in those copies J About a peck D Half a peck aN 896 331 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS barley or fine flour out of heaven so it is impossible that what thou hast said should come to pass To which the prophet made this reply Thou shalt see these things come to pass but thou shalt not be in the least a partaker of them What Elisha had thus foretold came to mss in the following manner There was a aw at Samaria that those who had the leprosy and whose bodies were not cleansed from it should abide without the city And there were four men that on this account abode before the gates while nobody gave them any food by reason of the extremity of the famine And as they were prohibited from entering into the city by the law and they considered that if they were permitted to enter they should miserably perish by the famine as also that if they stayed where they were they should suffer in the same manner they resolved to deliver themselves up to the enemy that in case they spared them they should live but if they should be killed that would be an easy death So when they had confirmed this resolution they came by night to the enemy s camp Now God had alarmed and disturbed the Syrians by bringing the noise of chariots and armour to their ears as though an army were coming upon them and had made them suspect that it was coming nearer and nearer In short they were in such a dread of this army that they left their tents and ran together to Ben hadad and said that Joram king of Israel had hired for auxiliaries both the king of Egypt and the king of the Islands and led them against them for they heard the noise of them as they were coming And Benha dad believed what they said for there came the same noise to his ears as well as it did to theirs so they fell into a great disorder and tumult and left their horses and beasts in their camp with immense riches also and betook themselves to flight When the afore mentioned lepers therefore arrived at the camp they found every thing perfectly quiet and silent Accordingly they went hastily into one of the tents and when they saw no body there they ate and drank and carried  This law of the Jews for the exclusion of lepers out of the camp in the wilderness and out of cities in Judea is a known one voL I â NOS Levit xiii 46 27  28 and Numb v 1â 4 off garments and a great quantity of gold and concealed them beyond the camp After which they went into another tent and car ried off what was in it as they did at the former and this they did four several times without the least interruption They now perceived plainly that the enemies were de parted and reproached themselves that they did not inform Joram and the citizens of it So they came to the walls of Samaria and called aloud to the watchmen and told them in what state the enemies were This was soon communicated to the king who sent for his friends and the captain of his host and said to them I suspect that this departure of the king of Syria is designed by way of ambush and treachery and that out of de spair of ruining you by famine when you ima gine them to be fled away you may come out of the city to spoil their camp and he may then fall upon you on a sudden and may both kill you and take the city without fighting Whence it is that I exhort you to guard the city carefully and by no means to go out of it or proudly to despise your enemies as though they were really gone away A cer tain person replied that he did very wisely to admit such a suspicion but that he still advised him to send a couple of horsemen to search all the country as far as Jordan that if they were seized by an ambush of the enemy they might be a security to the army that they may not go out as if they suspected nothing nor undergo the like misfortune And said he those horsemen may be numbered among those that have died by the famine supposing they be caught and destroyed by the enemy So the king was pleased with his opinion and sent such as might search out the truth who performed their journey over a road that was without any enemies but found it full of provisions and of weapons that they had thrown away and left behind them in order to their being light and expeditious in their flight When the king heard this he sent out the multitude to take the spoils of the camp which were not things of small value but they took a great quantity of gold and silver and all kinds Antiq III 11 See the examples of its constant obtaining in practice Numb xii 10â 14 2 Kings vii 3 xv 5 2 Chron xxvi 21 Antiq IX 10 3M 332 book IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS TT SH Pâ of cattle They also possessed themselves of so many thousand measures of wheat and bar ley as they never in the least expected and were not only freed from their former mise ries but had such plenty that two seahs of barley were bought for a shekel and a seah of fine flour for a shekel according to the prophecy of Elisha Now a seah is equal to an Italian modius and a half The captain of the third band was the only man that re ceived no benefit by this plenty For he was appointed by the king to oversee the gate that he might prevent the too great crowd of the multitude and they might not endanger one another in the press but he suffered himself in that very way and was trodden to death as Elisha had predicted when he alone disbelieved what he said concerning the plenty of provisions which they should soon have When Benhadad had escaped to Damascus and understood that it was God himself that cast all his army into disorder and that it did not arise from the invasion of enemies he was greatly dejected at having God so greatly for his enemy and fell into a dis temper Now it happened that Elisha the prophet at that time was gone out of his own country to Damascus of which when Benhadad was informed he sent Hazael the most faithful of all his servants to meet him and to carry him presents and bade him inquire about his distemper and whether he should escape the danger that it threatened So Hazael came to Elisha with forty camels laden with the best and most precious fruits that the country of Damascus afforded as well as those which the king s palace sup plied He saluted him kindly and said that he w as sent to him by king Benhadad and brought presents with him in order to inquire concerning his distemper whether he should recover from it or not whereupon the pro phet bid him tell the king no melancholy news but still he said he would die So the king s servant was troubled to hear it And Elisha wept also and his tears ran down plenteously at his foresight of what miseries his people would undergo after the death of Benhadad And when Hazael asked him what was the occasion of the confusion he was in he said Out of com miseration for the multitude of the Is raelites and what terrible miseries they will suffer by thee For thou wilt slay the strongest of them and wilt burn the strongest cities and wilt destroy their pregnant wo men and dash their children against the stones And when Hazael said How can it be that 1 should have power enough to do such things the prophet replied that God had informed him he should be king of Syria So when Hazael was come to Benhadad he told him good news concern ing his distemper f but on the next day he spread a wet cloth in the nature of a net over him and took his dominion J He was an active man and had the good will of the Syrians and of the people of Damascus by whom both Benhadad himself and Hazael who ruled after him are honoured to this day as gods by reason of their benefactions and their building them temples by which they adorned the city of the Damascens They also do with great pomp pay their daily worship to these kings and value  2 Kings vii 20 t Since Elijah did not live to anoint Hazael king of Syria  himself as he was empowered to do 1 Kings xix 15 Antiq VIII 13 it was most probably now done in his name by his servant and successor Elisha Nor does it seem to me otherwise but that Benhadad immediately recovered of his disease as the prophet foretold and that Hazael upon his being anointed to succeed him though he ought to have staid till he died by the course of nature or some other way of divine punishment as did David for many years in the like case was too im patient and the very next day smothered or strangled him in order to come directly to the succession J 2 Kings viii 15  What M Le Clerc pretends here that it is more probable that Hazael and his son were worshipped by the Syrians and people of Damascus till the days of Jose phus than Benhadad and Hazael because under Ben hadad they had greatly suffered and because it is almost incredible that both a king and the king s murderer should be worshipped by the same people is of little force against those records out of which Josephus drew this history especially when it is likely that they thought Benhadad died of the distemper he laboured under and not by Hazael s treachery and when Selden hath shewn that Benhadad was among the gods of Syria De Diis Syris Synt I D 6 Besides the reason that Josephns gives for this adoration that these two kings had been great benefactors to the inhabitants of Damascus and had built them temples is too remote from the political suspicions of Le Clerc Nor ought such weak suspicions to be deemed of any force against the authentic testimo nies of antiquity an 894 333 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 051 themselves upon their antiquity Nor do they know that these kings are much later than they imagine and that they are not yet eleven hundred years old Now when Joram the king of Israel heard that Ben hadad was dead he recovered out of the terror he had been in on his account and was very grateful for the restoration of peace CHAP V OF THE WICKEDNESS OF JEHOKAM KING OF JERUSALEM HIS DEFEAT AND DEATH JEHORAM the king of Jerusalem had no sooner taken the government upon him than he betook himself to the slaughter of his brethren and his father s friends who were governors under him and thus began to demonstrate his wickedness Nor was he at all better than those kings of Israel who at first transgressed against the laws of their country and against God s worship And it was Athaliah the daughter of Ahab whom he had married who taught him to be a bad man in other respects and also to worship foreign gods Now God would not quite root out this family because of the promise he had made to David However Jehoram did not leave off the introduction of new sorts of customs to the propagation of impiety and to the customs of his own country And when the Edomites about that time had re volted from him and slain their former king who was in subjection to his father and had set up one of their own choosing Jehoram fell upon the land of Edom with the horse men that were about him and the chariots by night and destroyed those that lay near to his own kingdom but proceeded no far ther However this expedition did him no service for they all revolted from him with those that dwelt in the country of Libnah He was indeed so mad as to compel the people to go up to the high places of the mountains and worship foreign gods As he was doing thus and had entirely cast the laws of the Hebrews out of his mind there was brought him an fepistle from the prophet Elijah which declared that God would execute great judgments upon him because he had not imitated his own fathers but had followed the wicked courses of the kings of Israel and had compelled the tribe of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem to leave the holy worship of their own God and to worship idols as Ahab had compelled the Israelites to do and because he had slain his brethren and those men that were righteous The prophet also gave him notice in this epistle what punishment he should undergo for these crimes namely the destruction of his people with the corruption of his own wives and children and that he should him self die of a distemper in his bowels with long torments his bowels falling out by the violence of the inward decay of the parts insomuch that though he saw his own misery he should not be able to help himself but should die in that manner It was not long after this that an army of the Philistines and of those Arabians who lived near to Ethiopia fell upon the kingdom of Jehoram and spoded the country and the king s house They also slew his wives and his sons one only escaping whose name was Ahaziah After this calamity he himself fell into that disease which was foretold by the prophet and lasted Ja great while for God inflicted this punishment upon him out of his wrath against him and so he died misera bly and saw his own bowels fall out The people also abused his dead body I suppose it was because they thought that such his death came upon him by the wrath of God and that therefore he was not worthy to par take of such a funeral as became kings Accordingly they neither buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers nor vouchsafed him any honours but buried him like a private man and this when he had lived forty years and reigned eight H And the people of Je rusalem delivered the government to his son Ahaziah  An 894 B C t This epistle in some copies of Josephus is said to come to Joram from Elijah with this addition for he was yet upon earth which could not be true of Elijah who as all agree was gone from the earth about four years before and could only be true of Elisha Nor  perhaps is there any more mystery here than that the name of Elijah has very anciently crept into the text instead of Elisha by the copiers there being nothing in any copy of that epistle peculiar to Elijah J Two years 2 Chron xxi 19 II From 895 to 887 3M2 334 book IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP VI OF THE ANOINTING OF JEHU THE DEATH OF JORAM AND AHAZIAH AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE IDOLATROUS ISRAELITES NOW Joram king of Israel after the death of Benhadad hoped that he might take Ramoth a city of Gilead from the Syrians Accordingly he made an ex pedition against it with a great army But as he was besieging it an arrow was shot at him by one of the Syrians but the wound was not mortal So he returned to have his wound healed in Jezreel but left his whole army in Ramoth and Jehu the son of Nimshi for their general for he had already taken the city by force and he proposed after he was healed to make war with the Syrians But Elisha the prophet sent one of the dis ciplest to RamothJ to anoint Jehu and to tell him that God had chosen him to be their king He also sent him to say other things to him and bade him take his journey as if he fled that when he came away he might escape the knowledge of all men So when he was come to the city he found Jehu sit ting in the midst of the captains of the army and said that he desired to speak with him about certain matters And when he had fol lowed him into an inner chamber the young man took the holy oil and poured it on his head and said that God ordained him to be king in order to his destroying the house of Ahab and that he might revenge the blood of the prophets that were unjustly slain by Jezebel that so their house might utterly perish as those of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and of Baasha had perished for their wickedness and no seed might remain of Ahab s family And when he had said this he went hastily out of that chamber and en deavoured not to be seen by any of the army When JehuÂ returned to the place where he before sat with the captains they asked  An 886 t The Jewish doctors are of opinion that the prophet whom Elisha sent upon this message was Jonah but upon this supposition he must at this time have been a very young man because Jeroboam the Second in whose reign Jonah prophesied did not ascend the throne till about fifty years after this unction of Jehu king of Israel However this be it is reasonable to think that Elisha himself did not go to perform this office either because he was now grown old and unfit for such a journey or because he was a person too well known and not so proper to be employed in an affair that re quired secrecy Calmefs and Patrick s Commenta ries B  It is supposed by some interpreters that the city of Raraoth Gilead was taken by Joram before he de parted from it to be cured of his wounds This they gather from the mention made of the inner chamber 2 Kings ix 2 the top of the stairs ver 13 and from that caution which Jehu thinks advisable Let none go forth or escape out of the city ver 15 But these arguments will not do What we render out of the city does sig nify every whit as properly from before the city i e out of the camp or army that is besieging the city But even if this be not so the Israelites might at this time have the suburbs or out buildings belonging to the city in their possession where the general might have his head quarters and from whence he might give orders o the picket guard as we call it that none should be permitted to move For had the town been already in their hands we cannot see why Joram should have kept all Israel there ver 14 i e all the military force of Israel when a strong garrison would have been sufficient Pool s Annotations B II The Jews are of opinion that none of the kings of Israel were anointed but those that were of the house of David and these only when there was a question about their succession as Solomon they say needed not to have been anointed had it not been for the faction of Ado nijah But in the case of Jehu in whom the succession of the kingdom of Israel was to be translated out of the right line of the family of Ahab into another family which had no right to the kingdom but merely the appointment of God there was a necessity for his unction in order both to convey to him a title and to invest him in the ac tual possession of the kingdom for if that which some imagine from 1 Kings xix 16 be true viz that the pro phet Elisha did before this time anoint Jehu that unction did only confer on him a remote right to the kingdom in the same manner as Samuel s unction did to David 1 Sam xvi 13 Patrick s Commentary and Pool s Anno tations B Â The officers who were in company with Jehu might easily perceive by the habit and air and manner of speech of the person who accosted Jehu so boldly and when he had done his business vanished so suddenly that he was a prophet but then there might be several reasons which might induce men of the profession to have a contemptible opinion of men of that order The rigid and obscure course of life which the prophets led their neglect of themselves and of the things of this world might pass with them for a kind of infatuation and the holy exercises to which they devoted themselves for no more than a religious frenzy Besides this the false prophets which they had seen in the court of Ahab had given just offence and by their affected gestures and studied contortions whereby they thought to re commend their crude enthusiasm made themselves justly ridiculous and contemptible And tkerefore it is no wonder that these officers at first sight should censure a true as they thought they had reason to judge of the false prophet with whom they had been acquainted especially when we find some leading men in the tribe of Judah treating the prophets of the Lord as in the case an 855 335 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him wherefore this young man came to him and added withal that he was mad he re plied  you guess rightly for the words he spake were the words of a madman And when they were eager about the matter and desired he would tell them he answered that God had said he had chosen him to be king over the multitude When he had said this every one of them put off his garment and spread it under him and blew with trumpets and proclaimed Jehu king So when he had assembled the army he pre pared to set out immediately against Joram at the city Jezreel in which city as we said before he was healing of the wound which he had received in the siege of Ra moth It happened also that Ahaziah king of Jerusalem was now come to Joram for he was his sister s son as we have said already to see how he did after his wound and this upon account of their kindred But as Jehu was desirous to make a sudden attack upon Joram and his companions he desired that none of the soldiers might run away and tell Joram what had happened for that this would be an evident demon stration of their kindness to him and would shew that their real inclinations were to make him king So they were pleased with what he did and guarded the roads f lest somebody should privately carry intelligence to those that were at Jezreel Now Jehu took his choice horse men and sat upon his chariot and went on for Jezreel And when he was come near the watchman J whom Joram had set there to observe such as came to the city saw Jehu marching on and told Joram that he saw a of Ezekiel chap xxiii 30 31 and of Jeremiah xxix 26 as fools and madmen and some great names in the Heathen world looking upon all pretenders to inspiration in no better light according to that noted passage in Cicero Quid habet auctorilatis furor iste quern divinum vocatis ut quae sapiens non videt ea videat insanus et is qui humanos sensus atniserit divinos assecutus sit De Divinat lib 2 B  Spanheim here observes that this putting off men s garments and spreading it under a king was an eastern custom which he has elsewhere explained t An 855 J In time of peace as well as war it was customary to have watchmen set on high and eminent places wherever the king was to prevent his being surprised Thus David at Jerusalem was informed by the watchman that his sons were escaped from the slaughter of Absalom when he troop of horsemen He accordingly gave orders that one of his horsemen should be sent out to meet them and to know who it was that was coming So when the mes senger came up to Jehu he asked him in what condition the army was for that the king wanted to know it But Jehu told him not to meddle with such matters but to follow him When the watchman saw this he told Joram that the horseman had mingled himself among the company and came along with them And when the king had sent a second messenger Jehu commanded him to do as the former did And as soon as the watchman told this also to Joram he at last got upon his chariot himself together with Ahaziah the king of Jerusalem for as we said before he was there to see how Joram did after he had been wounded as being his relation So he went out to meet Jehu who marched slowly and in good order And wjaen Joram met him in the field of Naboth he asked him if all things were well in the camp but Jehu reproached him bitterly and called his mother a witch and a harlot Upon this the king fearing what he intended turned his chariot about as soon as he could and said to Ahaziah  We are fought against by deceit and treachery But Jehu drew his bow and smote him the arrow going through his heart So Joram fell down im mediately and gave up the ghost Jehu also gave orders to Bidkar the captain of the third part of his army to cast the dead body into the field of Naboth reminding him of the prophecy which Elijah delivered to Ahab his father when he had slain Naboth that both he and his family should perish in that thought them all lost 2 Sam xiii 34 and therefore Joram who had an army lying before Ramoth Gilead had good reason to keep a watchful eye upon every motion that came especially from that quarter Patrick s and Calmefs Commentaries B I I Our copies say that this driving of the chariots was like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi for he drove furiously 2 Kings ix 20 whereas Josephus s copy as he understood it was that on the contrary Jehu marched slowly and in good order Nor cap it be denied that since there was interval enough for king Joram to send out two horsemen one after another to Jehu and at length to go out with king Ahaziah to meet him and all this after he was come within sight of the watchman and before he was come to Jezreel the probability is greatly on the side of Josephus s copy or interpretation f 336 book rx ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS place for that as they sat behind Ahab s chariot they heard the prophet say so and it was now come to pass according to his prophecy Upon the fall of Joram Ahaziah was afraid of his own life and turned his chariot into another road supposing he should not he seen by Jehu But he fol lowed after him and overtook him at a cer tain acclivity and drew his bow and wounded him So he left his chariot and got upon his horse and fled from Jehu to Megiddo and though he was under cure in a little time he died of that wound and was carried to Jerusalem and buried there after he had reigned one year and had proved a more unrighteous man than his father When Jehu was come to Jezreel Jezebel adorned herself and stood upon a tower and said He was a fine servant that had killed his master And when he looked up to her he asked who she was and com manded her to come down to him At last he ordered the eunuchsf to throw her down from the tower and being thrown down J she sprinkled the walls with her blood and was trodden upon by the horses and so died When this was done Jehu came to the palace with his friends and took some refreshment after his journey He also bade his servants take up Jezebel and bury her because of the nobility of her blood for she was descended from kings But those that were appointed to bury her found nothing remaining but the extreme parts of her body for all the rest were eaten by dogs When Jehu heard this he admired the prophecy of Elijah whichÂ foretold that she should perish in this manner at Jezreel Now Ahab had seventy sons brought up in Samaria So Jehu sent two epistles the one to them that brought up the children the other to the rulers of Samaria desiring them to set up the most valiant of Ahab s sons for king for that they had abundance of chariots and horses and armour and a great army and fenced cities and that by so doing they might avenge the murder of their master This he wrote to try the intentions of those of Samaria Now when the rulers and those that had brought up the children had read

read of a Sardanapalus painting his eyes and eyebrows of the ancient Greeks running into the same custom and much more of the martial Romans but there were fops in all nations then as well as now Ille

attend upon queens in their chambers who by their great fidelity and obse quiousness gained generally the esteem and were ad mitted to the confidence of those they served and from thence into places very often of great trust and profit It is remarked however of Jezebel s eunuchs that they were far from being faithful to her to let us see how suddenly courtiers are wont to change with the fortune of their masters Patrick s Commentary B  Some of the Jewish doctors look upon this as a punishment according to the lex talionis for as she had done so she suffered She had caused Naboth to be Stoned

wrote letters and sent to Samaria unto the rulers of Jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up Ahab s children 2 Kings x 1 But then the question is How the rulers of Jezreel came to be at Samaria Some have imagined indeed a mistake in the transcriber and that instead of Jezreel the word should be Israel which is no great variation but why may we not suppose that upon hearing how Jehu had slain Joram the great men of his court might take the children and for fear that they should fall into his hands flee with them into Samaria as the capital and strongest place in the kingdom where they might think of defending them selves against his usurpation and as his letters seem to import of filling with one of Ahab s family the vacant throne It was customary for princes of the blood in those days to be brought up in the families of the prime nobility of the nation and therefore whatever persons of this quality had these princes under their care and saw the revolution that was like to happen they might think it the most advisable way to hasten with them to Samaria as a place of the most security or for this very reason Joram when he went against Ramoth Gilead might have sent them thither that they might be under cover from any ill accident that might possibly happen in his war with the king of Syria Patrick s Commentary and PooPs Annotations B AN 337 855 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the letter they were afraid and considering their utter inability to oppose him who had already subdued two great kings they re turned for answer that they owned him for their lord and would do whatsoever he com manded them So he wrote back enjoining them to cut off the heads of Ahab s sons and send them to him Accordingly the rulers sent for those that brought up the sons of Ahab and commanded them to cut off their heads and send them to Jehu This was accordingly done and the heads were put in wicker baskets and sent to Jezreel And when Jehu as he was at supper with his friends was informed that the heads of Ahab s sons were brought he ordered them to make two heaps of them one before each of the gates and in the morning he went out to take a view of them and when he saw them he began to say to the people that were pre sent that he certainly made an expedition against his master Joram and slew him but that it was not he that slew all these And he desired them to take notice that as to Ahab s family all things had come to pass according to God s prophecy and his house was perished according as Elijah had fore told And when he had farther destroyed all the kindred of Ahab that was found in Jezreel he went to Samaria And as he was upon the road he met the relations of Aha ziah king of Jerusalem and asked them whither they were going They replied that they came to salute Joram and their own king Ahaziah for they knew not that he had slain them both So Jehu gave orders that they should be taken and slain being in number forty two persons After these there met him a righteous man whose name was Jehonadab and who had been his friend of old He saluted Jehu and began to commend him because he had done every thing according to the will of God in extirpating the house of Ahab So Jehu desired him to come up into his chariot and make his entry with him into Samaria and told him that he would not spare one wicked man but would punish the false pro phets and false priests and those that de ceived the multitude and persuaded them to leave the worship of the Almighty and to  2 Kings x 10 worship foreign gods and that it was a most excellent and pleasing sight to a righteous man to see the wicked punished So Jeho nadab was persuaded by these arguments and came into Jehu s chariot and came to Samaria And Jehu sought out for all Ahab s kindred and slew them And being de sirous that none of the false prophets nor the priests of Ahab s god might escape punish ment he caught them deceitfully by the fol lowing artifice â He gathered all the people together and said that  he would worship twice as many gods as Ahab had worshipped and desired that his priests and prophets and servants might be present because he would offer costly and great sacrifices to Ahab s god and that if any of his priests were wanting they should be punished with death Now Ahab s god was called Baal and when he had appointed a day on which he would offer those sacrifices he sent messengers through all the country of the Israelites that they might bring the priests of Baal to him So Jehu commanded to give all the priests vestments and when they had received them he went into the house of Baal with his friend Jehonadabf and gave orders to make search whether there were not any foreigner or stranger among them for he would have no one of a different religion to mix among their sacred offices And when they said that there was no stranger there and they were beginning their sacrifices he set eighty of his most faithful soldiers without the doors and bade them slay the false pro phets and vindicate the laws of their country which had been a long time in disesteem He also threatened that if any escaped their own lives should go for them So they slew them all with the sword and destroyed the house of Baal f and by that means purged Samaria of idolatrous worship Now this Baal was the god of the Tyrians and Ahab in order to gratify his father in law Ethbaal who was the king of Tyre and Sidon built a temple for him in Samaria and appointed him prophets and worshipped him with all sorts of worship This idol Jehu now de molished but he still permitted the Israelites to worship the golden heifers However because he had done thus and taken care to T 2 Kings x 27 338 book jx ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS punish the wicked God foretold by his pro

JEHOASH SON OF AHA Z1AH WHEN Athaliah the daughter of Ahab heard of the death of her brother Joram and of her son Ahaziah and of the royal family she endeavoured that none of the house of David might be left alive but that the family might be exterminated that no king might arise out of it afterward And she supposed her sanguinary wishes were completely fulfilled But one of Ahaziah s sons escaped death after the following manner â Ahaziah had a sister by the same father whose name was Jehosheba and she was married to the high priest Jehoiada She went into the king s palace and found Jehoash for that was the little child s name who was not above a year old among those that were slain but concealed with his nurse t So she took him into a secret bed chamber and shut him up there and she and her husband Jehoiada brought him up privately in the temple six years J during which time Athaliah reigned over Jerusalem and the two tribes Now on the seventh year Jehoiada com municated this important matter to five of the captains of hundreds and persuaded them to assist in the attempts he was making against Athaliah and to join with him in securing the kingdom to the child He also received such oaths from them as are proper to secure those that assist one another from the fear of dis covery and he was then of good hope that they should depose Athaliah Now those men whom Jehoiada the priest had taken to be his partners went into all the country and gathered together the priests and the Levites and the heads of the tribes out of it and brought them to Jerusalem to the high priest So he demanded the security of an oath of them to keep private whatsoever he should discover to them which required both their silence and their assistance So when they had taken an oath and had thereby made it safe for him to speak he produced the child that he had brought up of the family of David and said to them This is your king of that house which yon know God hath foretold should reign over you for all time to come I exhort you therefore that one third part of you guard him in the temple and that a fourth guard keep watch at all the gates and that the next part of you keep guard at that gate which opens and leads to the king s palace and let the rest of the multitude be unarmed in the temple and let no armed person go into the temple but the priest only He also ordered that a part of the priests and the Levites should be about the king himself and be a guard to him with their drawn swords and to kill that man immediately whoever he might be that should be so bold as to enter armed into the temple and bade them be afraid of nobody but persevere in guarding the king So these men obeyed what the high priest advised them to and declared the reality of their resolution by their actions Jehoiada also opened that armoury which David had made in the temple and distri buted to the captains of hundreds as also to the priests and Levites all the spears quivers and other weapons which it con tained and set them armed in a circle round about the temple so as to touch one another s hands by that means excluding those from entering that ought not to enter So they  This promise was fulfilled in the persons of Jehoahaz Jehoash Jeroboam II and Zachariah t Some interpreters are of opinion that Joash was not the real son of Ahaziah in whom the race of Solomon in a direct line was extinct but properly the son of Na than and only called Ahaziah s because he succeeded him in the throne for had he been Ahaziah s true son and Athaliah s grandson why might not she have declared him king and during his minority at least taken the ad ministration into her own hands But therefore she ex ercised her cruelty as they say in destroying the princes related to Ahaziah because she was unwilling to have the kingdom go into another branch of David s family But notwithstanding these reasons and the authority of those who produce them in the second books both of Kings and Chronicles we find this Jehoash so frequently called the son of Ahaziah the king s son c without any manner of restriction that we cannot be persuaded to look out for any other father for him B t 2 Kings xi 3 B A third part Hebrew and Septuagint ait 879 339 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS brought the child into the midst of them and put on him the royal crown and Jehoiada anointed him with the oil and made him king And the multitude rejoiced and shouted  God save the king When Athaliah unexpectedly heard these acclamations she was disturbed in her mind and suddenly issued out of the royal palace with her own army and when she was come to the temple the priests received her but as for those that stood round about the temple as they were ordered by the high priests to do they hindered the armed men that followed her from going in But when Athaliah saw the child standing on a pillar t with the royal crown upon his head she rent her clothes and cried out vehemently and commanded her guards to kill him that had laid snares for her and endeavoured to deprive her of the government But Je hoiada called for the captains of hundreds and commanded them to bring Athaliah to the valley of Cedron and slay her there for he would not have the temple defiled with the punishment of this pernicious woman And he gave order that if any one came near to help her he should be slain also Wherefore those that had the charge of her slaughter led her to the gate of the king s mules and slew her there Jehoiada now called together the people and the armed men into the temple and made them take an oath that they would be obedient to the king and take care of his safety and of the safety of his government After which he obliged the king to give security upon oath that he would worship God and not transgress the laws of Moses They then ran to the house of Baal which Athaliah and her husband Jehoram had built to the dishonour of the God of their fathers and to the honour of Ahab and de molished it and slew Mattan that had the priesthood But Jehoiada intrusted the care and custody of the temple to the priests and Levites according to the appointment of David and enjoined them to bring their regular burnt offerings twice a day and to offer incense according to the law He also ordained some of the Levites with the por ters to be a guard to the temple that no one that was defiled might come there When Jehoiada had set these things in order he with the captains of hundreds and the rulers and all the people took Jehoash out of the temple into the king s palace and when he had set him upon the king s throne the people shouted for joy and kept a festival for many days But the city was quiet upon the death of Athaliah Now Je hoash was seven years old when he took the kingdom His mother s name was Zibiah of the city Beersheba And all the time that Jehoiada lived Jehoash was careful that the laws should be kept and was very zealous in the worship of God And when he was of age he married two wives who were given to him by the high priest by whom were born to him both sons and daughters CHAP VIII OF HAZAEL S EXPEDITION AOAINST THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THE

under this distress Nay he was become a contemner of religion and despiser of holiness and of the laws and died when he had reigned over the Is raelites twenty seven years He was bu ried in Samaria and left the government to his son Jehoahaz Meanwhile Jehoash king of Judah had an inclination to repair the temple of God So he called Jehoiada and bade him send the Levites and priests through all the country to require half a shekel of silver from every head towards the rebuilding and repairing of the temple which was brought to decay by Jehoram and Athaliah and her sons But the high priest did not do this as concluding that no one would willingly pay that money But in the twenty third year of Jehoash s reign when the king sent for him and the Levites and complained that they had not obeyed what he enjoined them and still commanded them to take care of the rebuilding of the temple he used this stratagem for collecting the money He made a wooden chest and closed it up fast on all sides but opened one hole in it He then set it in the temple beside the altar and desired every one to cast into it through the hole what he pleased for the repair of the temple This contrivance was acceptable to the people and they strove one with another and brought in jointly large quantities of silver and gold f And when the scribes and the priests that were over the treasuries had emptied the chest and counted the money in the king s pre sence they then set it in its former place And thus did they every day But when the multitude appeared to have cast in as much as was wanted the high priest Jehoiada and king Joash sent to hire masons and car penters and to buy large pieces of timber and of the most curious sort And when they had repaired the temple they made use of the remaining gold and silver for bowls basons cups and other vessels and they went on to make the altar every day rich with sacrifices of great value Some time afterwards Jehoiada died when he had lived one hundred and thirty years having been a righteous and in every re spect a good man and he was buried in the king s sepulchres at Jerusalem because he had recovered the kingdom to the family of David After his death Jehoash betrayed his want of care about God and the prin cipal men of the people were corrupted with him and offended against their duty and what their constitution determined to be most for their good Hereupon God was displeased with the change that was made in the king and in the rest of the people and sent prophets to testify to them what their actions were and to bring them to leave off their wickedness But they had so violent an inclination to it that neither could the examples of those that had offered af fronts to the laws and had been so severely punished they and their entire families nor could the fear of what the prophets now foretold bring them to repentance and turn them back from their course of trans gression to their former duty But the king commanded that Zachariah the son of the high priest Jehoiada should be stoned to Jdeath in the temple and forgot the kind nesses he had received from his father For when God had appointed him to prophesy he stood in the midst of the multitude and exhorted both them and the king to act righteously and foretold that if they would not hearken to his admonitions they should suffer a heavy punishment But as Zacha riah was ready to die he appealed to God as a witness of what he suffered for the good counsel he had given them and how he perished after a most severe and violent manner for the good deeds his father had done to Jehoash However it was not long before the king suffered punishment for his transgression For when Hazael king of Syria made an irruption into his country and when he had overthrown Gath and spoiled it he made an expedition against Jerusalem Hereupon Jehoash was afraid and emptied all the treasures of God and of the kings before him and took down the gifts that had been  Twenty

that he was not besieged nor his king dom quite endangered but Hazael was in duced by the greatness of the sum of money not to bring his army against Jerusalem Yet Jehoash fell into a severe distemper and was set upon by his friends in order to revenge the death of Zachariah the son of Jehoiada These laid snares for the king and slew him He was buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal sepulchres of his fore fathers because of his impiety He lived forty seven years and Amaziah his son suc ceeded him in the kingdom f In the Jtwenty first year of the reign of Jehoash Jehoahaz the son of Jehu took the government of the Israelites in Samaria and held it seventeen years He did not properly imitate his father but was guilty of as wicked practices as those that first had God in contempt But the king of Syria brought him low and by an expedition against him did so greatly reduce his forces that there remained no more of so great an army than ten thousand men and fifty horse men He also took away from him many of his great cities and destroyed his army And these were the things that the people of Israel suffered according to the prophecy of Elisha when he foretold that Hazael should kill his master and reign over the Syrians and Damascens But when Jehoahaz was under such unavoidable miseries he had re course to prayer and supplication to God and besought him to deliver him out of the hands of Hazael and not overlook him and give him up into his hands Accordingly God accepted of his repentance and being desirous rather to admonish those that might repent than to determine that they should be utterly destroyed he granted him deliver ance from war and dangers So the country having obtained peace returned to its former condition and flourished as before After the death of Jehoahaz his son Joash took the kingdom in the thirty seventh year of Jehoash king of the tribe of Judah and he retained the government sixteen years He was a good man Â and in his disposition not at all like to his father Now at this time it was that the king of Israel went to visit Elisha the prophet who was already very old and was now fallen into a disease and when the king found him very near death he began to weep in his sight and lament calling him his father and his weapons because it was by this means that he never made use of his weapons against his enemies but overcame them by his prophecies without fighting And that he was now departing this life and leaving him to the Syrians who were already armed and to other enemies that were under their power So he said it was not safe for him to live any longer but that it would be well for him to hasten to his end and depart out of this life with him As the king was thus bemoaning himself Elisha comforted him and desired him to bend a bow that was brought him and when the king had fitted the bow for shooting Elisha took hold of his hands and bade him shoot And when he had shot three arrows and then left off Elisha said If thou hadst shot more arrows thou hadst cut the kingdom of Syria up by the roots but since thou hast been satisfied with shooting three times only thou shalt fight and beat the Syrians no more times than three that thou mayest recover that country  2 Kings xii 18 t 2 Kings xii 21 I The twenty third Hebrew and Septuagint II An 842 Â This character of Joash the son of Jehoahaz that he was a good man and in his disposition not at all like his father seems a direct contradiction to our ordinary copies which says 2 Kings xiii 11 that he did evil in the sight of the Lord and that he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin Which copies are here the truest it is difficult to determine If Josephus s be true this Joash is the single instance of a good king over the ten tribes If the other be true we have not one such example The account that follows in all copies of the prophet Elisha s con cern for him and his concern for Elisha greatly favour Josephus s copies and suppose this king to have been then a good man and no idolater with whom God s prophets used not to be so familiar Upon the whole since it appears even by Josephus s own account that Amaziah the good king of Judah while he was a good king was forbidden to make use of the 10 000 auxiliaries he had hired of this Joash king of Israel as if he and they were idolaters  IX 9 2 Chron xxv 5â 9 it is most likely that these different characters of Joash suited the different parts of his reign and that according to our common copies he was at first a wicked king and after wards was reclaimed and became a good one according to Josephus 3N2 342 Â OOK IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS which they cut off from thy kingdom in the reign of thy father So when the king had heard that he departed and a little while after the prophet died He was a man celebrated for righteousness and in eminent favour with God he also performed many wonderful works by prophecy and such as were gloriously preserved in memory by the Hebrews He obtained a magnificent funeral such a one indeed as it was fit a person so beloved of God should have It also happened that at that time certain rob bers cast a man whom they had slain into Elisha s grave and upon the dead corpse coming close to Elisha s body it revived again And thus far have we enlarged about the actions of Elisha the prophet both such as he did while he was living and how he had a divine power after his death also Now upon the death of Hazael king of Syria that kingdom came to Adad his son with whom Joash king of Israel made war and when he had beaten him in three battles he took from him all that country and those cities and villages which his father Hazael had taken from the kingdom of Israel which came to pass

rusalem He was exceeding careful of doing what was right and this when he was very young But when he came to the manage ment of affairs and to the government he resolved that he ought first ol all to revenge his father Jehoash and to punish those that had laid violent hands upon him So he seized upon them all and put them to death J yet did he execute no severity on their children but acted therein according to the law of Moses who did not think it just to punish the children for the sins of their fathers j After this he chose an army out of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin of such as were in the flower of their age and about twenty years old And when he had collected about three hundred thousand of them together he set captains of hundreds over them He also sent to the king of Israel and hired a hundred thousand of his soldiers for a hundred talents of silver Â for he had resolved to make an expedition against the nations of the Amalekites Edom ites and Gebalites But as he was pre paring for his expedition and ready to go out to the war a prophet gave him counsel to dismiss the army of the Israelites because they were bad men and because God fore told that he should be beaten if he made use of them as auxiliaries but that he should overcome his enemies though he had but a few soldiers when it so pleased God And when the king grudged at his having already paid the hire of the Israelites the prophet exhorted him to do what God would have him because he should thereby obtain much wealth from God So he dismissed them and said that he still freely gave them their pay and went himself with his own army and made war with the aforementioned nations and when he had beaten them in battle he pounds weight and each pound weight at four pounds value the whole will amount to fifty thousand pounds ster ling which will be but ten shillings to each man officers included Very low pay unless we suppose that this whole sum was given to the king of Israel for the loan of so many men and that the men were to have no other pay besides or rather that they were to have no other pay but the booty which they took from the enemy and that this was the true reason why they were so exaspe rated at their dismission as to fall upon the cities of Judah from Samaria even unto Beth horon 2 Chron xxv 13 Patrick s and CalmeCs Commentaries B s XJr 827 343 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS slew of them ten thousand and took as many prisoners alive whom he brought to the great rock which is in Arabia and threw them down from it headlong He also brought away a great deal of prey and vast riches from those nations But while Ama ziah was engaged in this expedition those Israelites whom he had hired and then dis missed were very uneasy and taking their dismission for an affront as supposing that this would not have been done to them but out of contempt they fell upon his kingdom and proceeded to spoil the country as far as Beth horon and took much cattle and slew three thousand men In consequence of the victory which Araa ziah had gotten and the great acts he had done he was puffed up and began to over look God who had given him the victory and proceeded to worship the gods he had brought out of the country of the Amalekites So a prophet came to him and said he won dered how he could esteem them to be gods who had been of no advantage to their own Seople who paid them no honours nor had elivered them from his hands but had over looked the destruction of many of them and had suffered themselves to be carried cap tive for that they had been carried to Jeru salem in the same manner as any one might have taken some of the enemy alive and led them thither This reproof provoked the king to anger and he commanded the pro phet to hold his peace and threatened to Sunish him if he meddled with his conduct o he replied that he should indeed hold his peace but foretold withal that God would not overlook those attempts at innova tion Amaziah however was not able to contain himself under that prosperity which God had given him although he had affronted God thereupon but in a vein of insolence he wrote to Joash king of Israel com manding that he and all his people should be obedient to him as they had formerly been obedient to his progenitors David and Solomon and giving him to understand that if he would not be so wise as to do what he commanded he must fight for his dominions Hereupon Joash returned this answer in writing  8 Kings xiv 9 10 KING JOASH TO KING AMAZIAH There was a vastly tall cyprus tree in mount Lebanon as also a thistle this thistle sent to the cypress tree to give the cypress tree s daughter in marriage to the thistle s son But as the thistle was saying this there came a wild beast and trod it down And this may be a lesson to thee not to be so ambitious but to be careful lest upon thy good success in the fight against the Amale kites thou growest so proud as to bring dangers upon thyself and upon thy king dom When Amaziah had read this letter he was more eager upon his expedition which I suppose was by the impulse of God that he might be punished for his offence against him But as soon as he led out his army against Joash and they were going to join battle there came such a consternation upon the army of Amaziah as God when he is displeased sends upon men and discomfited them even before they came to a close fight Now it happened that as they were scattered about by the terror that was upon them Amaziah was left alone and was taken pri soner by the enemy Whereupon Joash threatened to kill him unless he would per suade the people of Jerusalem to open their gates and receive him and his army into the city Accordingly Amaziah was so distressed and in such fear of his life that he made his enemy to be received into the city So Joash overthrew a part of the wall of the length of one hundred cubits and drove his chariot through the breach into Jerusalem and led Amaziah captive along with him By which means he became master of Jerusalem and took away the treasures of God and carried off all the gold and silver that was in the king s palace and then freed the king from captivity and returned to Samaria f Now these things happened to the people of Jeru salem in the fourteenth year of the reign of Amaziah who after this had a conspiracy formed against him by his friends and fled to the city Lachish and was there slain by the conspirators So they took up his dead body and carried it to Jerusalem and made a royal funeral for him This was the end t 2 Kings xiv 11 13 344 BOOK IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS of the life of Amaziah because of his inno vations in religion and his contempt of God when he had lived fifty four years and had reigned twenty nine He was succeeded by his son whose name was Uzziah CHAP X OF THE AFFAIRS OF JEROBOAM KINO OF ISRAEL JONAH THE PROPHET ZECHARIAH THE SON OF JEROBOAM J AND UZZIAH KING OF JERUSALEM v IN the fifteenth year of the reign of Ama ziah Jeroboam the son of Joash reigned over Israel f in Samaria The king was guilty of contumely against God J and be came very wicked in worshipping of idols and in many absurd and impious underta kings by which he occasioned ten thousand misfortunes to the people of Israel Now one Jonah a prophet foretold to him that he should make war with the Syrians and con quer their army and enlarge the bounds of his kingdom on the northern parts to the city Hamath and on the southern to the lake Asphaltites for the bounds of the Canaanites originally were these as Joshua their general had determined them So Jeroboam made an expedition against the Syrians and over run all their country as Jonah had foretold Now I cannot but think it necessary to de scribe the actions of this prophet so far as I have found them written down in the He brew books Jonah had been commanded by God to go to the kingdom of Nineveh and to publish in that city how it should lose the dominion it had over the nations But he went not out of fear nay he ran away from God to the cityÂ Joppa and finding a ship there he went into it and sailed to Tarsus  From an 840 to an 811 t 2 Kings xiv 22 J What I have above noted concerning Jehoash seems to have been true also concerning his son Jeroboam II viz that although he began wickedly as Josephus agrees with our other copies and as Josephus adds was the cause of a vast number of misfortunes to the Israelites in those his first years the particulars of which are unhap pily wanting both in Josephus and in all our copies so does it seem that he was afterward reclaimed and became a good king and so was encouraged by the prophet Jonah and had great successes afterward when God saved the Israelites by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash 2 Kings xiv 27 which encouragement by Jonah and great successes are equally observable in Josephus and in other copies II The only mention we have of this prophet whom the Jews will have to be the son of the widow of Zare phath whom Elijah raised from the dead but without any foundation of reason is in this passage and the ac count of this famous mission to Nineveh What the pro phecies were whereby he encouraged Jeroboam to pro claim war against the king of Syria we have no where recorded but as we have not every thing which the prophets did write so several prophets we must know did not commit their predictions to writing From this place however we may observe that God was very merciful to the Israelites though they were certainly a very wicked people in continuing a race of prophets among them even after Elisha was dead Patrick s Commentary It is a very common opinion among the Jews as we said that Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath and this opinion they found upon the words of the mother when she received her son alive from the prophet s hand By this I know that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth 1 Kings xvii 24 for there fore say they was the child called the son of Amittai because Amittai signifies truth a weak reason and such as is plainly repugnant to the testimony of Scripture For this we know for certain that Jonah lived in the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam the second kings of Israel and therefore could not be the son of the widow of Zarephath since the former of these two princes did not begin to reign till sixty years after the translation of Elijah Others pretend that he was son to the Shunamite woman whom the prophet Elisha raised from the dead but Shunam and Gath hepher where we are certain Jonah was born were two quite different places the former in the tribe of Issa char the other in that of Zabulon and therefore we may conclude that Amittai was the proper name of Jonah s father who lived in a little canton of the tribe of Zabulon called Hepher orHopher wherein was the town of Goth which is generally believed to be the same with Jotapata so fiimous for the siege which Josephus there maintained against the Roman army a little before the destruction of Jerusalem Cahnefs Preface sur Jonas and his Dictionary under the word B Â Jonah i 3  Joppa is a seaport town in Palestine upon the Mediterranean and was formerly the only port which the Jews had upon that coast whither all the materials that were sent from Tyre towards the building of Solomon s temple were brought and landed The town itself is very ancient for profane authors reckon it was built before the flood and derives the name of it from Joppa the daughter of Elolas and the wife of Cepheus who was the founder of it Others arc rather inclined to be lieve that it was built by Japhet and from him had the name of Japho which was afterwards moulded into Joppa but is now generally called Jaffa which comes nearer to the first appellation The town is situated in a fine plain between Jamnia to the south Caesirea of Palestine to the north and Rama or Ramula to the east but at pre sent is in a poor and mean condition nor is its port by any means good by reason of the rocks which project into the sea The chief thing for which this place was famous in ancient Pagan history is the exposition of Andromeda the daughter of Cepheus king of Egypt who for her mother s pride was bound to a rock in order to be devoured by a sea monster but was delivered an 820 345 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in Cilicia And upon the rise of a most ter rible stoxm f which was so great that the ship was in danger of sinking the mariners the master and the pilot himself made prayers and vows in case they escaped the sea But Jonah lay still and covered in the ship without imitating any thing which the others did But as the waves grew greater and the sea became more violent by the winds they suspected as is usual in such cases that some one of the persons that sailed with them was the occasion of this storm and agreed to discover by lots which of them it was When they had cast lots4 the lot fell upon the prophet And when they asked him whence he came and what he had done he replied that he was a Hebrew by nation and a prophet of Almighty God and he per suaded them to cast him into the sea if they would escape the danger they were in for that he was the occasion of the storm Now at the first they durst not do so as esteeming it a wicked tiling to cast a man who was a stranger and who had committed his life to them into such manifest destruction But at last when their ship was just going to be wrecked and when they were animated to do it by the prophet himself and by the fear concerning their own safety they cast him into the sea upon which the storm immedi ately subsided It is also related that Jonah was swallowed by a whale and that when he had been there three days and as many nights he was vomited out upon the Euxine sea without having sustained any injury And there on his prayer to God he ob tained pardon for his sins and went to the city of Nineveh where he stood so as to be heard and preached that in a very little time they should lose the dominion of Asia And when he had published this he returned Now I have given this account about him as I have found it written in our books  by the valour and bravery of Perseus who afterwards married her For in the times of Mela and Pliny there were some marks remaining as they themselves testify nempe Mela lib i c 11 Pliny lib 5 c 13 Joseph De Bello Jud lib iii c 15 of the chain wherewith this royal virgin was bound to

stances Calmcfs Commentaire svr Jonas c i v 3 B  When Jonah is said in our Bibles to have gone to Tarshish Jonah i 3 Josephus understood it that he went to Tarshish in Cilicia or to the Mediterranean Sea upon which Tarsus lay So that he does not appear to have read the text 1 Kings xxii 48 as our copies do that ships of Tarshish could lie at Ezion Geber upon the Red Sea See the note on IX 1 But as to Josephus s assertion that Jonah s fish was carried by the strength of the current upon a storm as far as the Euxine Sea it is no way impossible And since the storm might have driven the ship while Jonah was in it near to that Euxine Sea and since in three more days while he was in the fish s beHy that current might bring him to the Assyrian coast and since withal that coast could bring htm nearer to Nineveh than could any coast of the Mediterranean it is by no mean an improbable determination in Josephu t The Jewish doctors who ate great lovers of prodi gies are not even satisfied with what they meet with in this history of Jonah hut have over and above added that as soon as the ship wherein he was embarked was under sail it all on a sudden stood stockstill so that it could be made to move neither backward nor forward notwith standing all the pains that the mariners took in rowing But others with more probability say that while all the rest of the ships were quiet and unmolested the storm fell upon none but that wherein Jonah was which made the seamen think that there was something miraculous in it and thereupon called upon the company that sailed with them to come and cast lots as the superstitious custom among the Heathens was whenever they were in any great distress  that accordingly they cast lots three different times which still fell upon Jonah and that they let him down several times with a rope without plunging him into the sea and as often as they did it found the storm abate and whenever they pulled him up again found it increase so that at last they were forced to commit him to the mercy of the waves All which are circumstances which the Scripture account neither favours nor contradicts Calmet s Commentary B J This ancient piece of religion of supposing there was great sin where there was great misery and of casting lots to discover great sinners not only among the Israelites but among these Heathen mariners seems a remarkable vestige of the ancient tradition which pre vailed of old over all mankind that Providence used to interpose visibly in all human affairs and never to bring or at least not long to continue notorious judgments but for notorious sins which the most ancient book of Job shews to have been the state of mankind for about the former 3000 years of the world till the days of Job and Moses II The book of Jonah ends as abruptly as it begins It begins with a conjunctive copulative And the word of the Lord came upon Jonah so it should be read which has made some commentators think that it was but an appendix to some of his other writings and it ends without giving us any manner of account either whot became of the Ninevites or of Jonah himself after this expedition It is likely indeed from the compassionate expressions which God makes use of towards the Ninevites that for that time he reversed their doom and it is not improba ble that Jonah when he had executed his commission and been satisfied by God concerning his merciful proce dure returned into Judea but the author of the Lives 346 book IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When Jeroboam the king had passed his life in great happiness and had ruled forty years he died and was buried in Samaria and his son Zechariah took the kingdom After the same manner did Uzziah the son of Amaziah begin to reign over the two tribes in Jerusalem in the fourteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam He was a good man and by nature magnanimous and very laborious in taking care of the affairs of his kingdom He made an expedition against the Philis tines and overcame them in battle and took the cities of Gath and Jabneh and brake down their walls After which expedition he assaulted those Arabs that adjoined to Egypt  He also built a city upon the Red Sea and put a garrison in it and having overthrown the Ammonites and appointed that they should pay tribute he subdued all the countries as far as to the bounds of Egypt and then began to take care of Jerusalem for the rest of his life For he rebuilt and repaired all those parts of the wall which had either fallen down by length of time or by the carelessness of his predecessors as well as all that part which had been thrown down by the king of Israel when he took his father Amaziah prisoner and entered with him into the city Moreover he built a great many towers of a hundred and fifty cubits high and built walled towns in desert places and put garrisons into them and dug many channels for conveyance of water He had also many beasts of labour and an immense number of cattle for his country was fit for pasturage and being addicted to husbandry he took care to cultivate the ground and planted it with all sorts of plants and sowed it with all sorts of seeds He had also about him an army composed of three hundred and seventy thousand chosen men who were governed by two thousand general officers and captains of thousands who were men of valour and of unconquerable strength He also divided his whole army into bands and armed them giving every one a sword with brazen bucklers and breast plates with bows and slings and besides these he made for them many engines of war J for besieging of cities such as cast stones and darts with grapplers and other instruments of that sort  While Uzziah was in this state and ma king preparations for futurity he was cor rupted in his mind by pride Â and became insolent on account of that abundance which he had of things that will soon perish and despised that power which is of eternal du ration which consisted in piety towards God and in the observance of his laws so he fell by occasion of the success of his affairs and was carried headlong into those sins of his fathers which the splendour of that pros Eerity he enjoyed and the glorious actions e had done led him into while he was unable to govern himself well about them Accordingly when a remarkable day was come and a general festival was to be cele brated he put on the holy garment and went into the temple to offer incense to God and Deaths of the prophets who goes under the name of Epiphanus tells us returning from Nineveh and being ashamed to see that his prediction was not fulfilled he retired with his mother to the city of Tyre where he lived in the plain of Sear until he died and was buried in the cave of Cenezeus judge of Israel but who the author means by Cenezeus

treats of sieges describes a kind of entrenchment though a poor one some lines of circumvallation and a ditch with palisades but we hear not one word of any machines such as the ballistae and the catapultae which were used for hurling stones and throwing darts and therefore we need less wonder that the famous siege of Troy continued so long Sardanapalus king of Assyria maintained himself in Nineveh for seven years because the besiegers as Diodorus ob serves lib 2 wanted such engines as were fit for de molishing and taking of cities they being not then invented Uzziah was certainly the first inventor of them and therefore it is said that for these and other warlike pre parations his name was spread abroad From this time they began to be employed both in attacking and de fending towns and therefore we find the prophet Ezekiel describing the future sieges of Jerusalem and Tyre where he makes mention of battering rams and engines of war or as it should be rendered machines of

posterity of Aaron were permitted so to do And when they cried out that he must go out of the temple and not transgress against God he was wroth with them and threat ened to kill them unless they would hold their peace In the mean time a great earthquake shook the ground and a rent was made in the temple and the bright rays of the sun shone through it and fell upon the king s face insomuch that the leprosy seized upon him immediately And before the city at a place called Eroge half the mountain broke off from the rest on the west and rolled itself four furlongs and stood still at the east mountain till the roads as well as the king s gardens were spoiled by the obstruction Now as soon as the priests saw that the king s face was in fected with the leprosy they told him of the calamity he was under and commanded that he should go out of the city as a pol luted person Hereupon he was so con founded that he did as he was commanded and underwent this terrible and miserable punishment for a presumptuous intention and for that impiety against God which was implied therein So he abode out of the city for some time and lived a private life while his son Jotham took the govern ment f He died with grief and anxiety at what had happened to him when he had lived sixty eight years and reigned fifty two J and his body was buried in his own garden  This account of an earthquake at Jerusalem at the very same time when Uzziah usurped the priest s office and went into the sanctuary to burn incense and of the consequences of the earthquake is entirely wanting in our other copies though it be exceeding like to a pro phecy of Jeremiah s now in Zachariah xiv 4 5 In which prophecy mention is made of fleeing from that earthquake as they fled from this earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah So that there seems to have been some considerable resemblance between these his torical and prophetical earthquakes But whether Jose pbus interpreted this prophecy as

PROPHECY OF NAHUM AGAINST THE ASSYRIANS WHEN Zachariah the son of Jero boam had reigned six months over Israel he was slain by the treachery of Shallum the son of Jabesh who took the kingdom afterward but kept it no longer than thirty days For Menahem the gene ral of his army who was at that time in the city Tirzah and heard of what had befallen Zachariah removed with all his forces to Samaria and joining battle with Shallum slew him and when he had made himself king he went thence and came to the city Tiphsah The citizens shut their gates and barred them against the king and would not admit him But in order to be avenged on them he burnt the adjacent country and took the city by storm and being very much displeased at what the inhabitants of Tiphsah had done he slew them all and spared not so much as the infants without omitting the utmost instances of cruelty and barbarity For he used such severity upon his own countrymen as would not be par donable with regard to strangers who had been conquered by him And after this manner it was that this Menahem continued to reign with cruelty and barbarity for ten years Â But when Pul king of Assyria had made an expedition against him he did not venture an engagement but he persuaded him to accept of a thousand talents of silver upon the house of Ahab he would continue the crown of Israel in his family for four generations and accord ingly Jehoahaz Joash Jehoram and Zachariah suc ceeded him but because he did it not so much in obe dience to the divine command as to satisfy his private and ambitious views and in a method of cruelty

house of Jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel chap i 4 and perhaps it was in remembrance of this prophecy as well as of the promise which confined the kingdom in Jehu s

at a feast by the treachery of one Pekah the general of his horse and the son of Rema liah who laid snares for him Now this Pe kah held the government twenty years J and proved a wicked man and a transgressor But the king of Assyria whose name was Tiglath Pileser when he had made an expe dition against the Israelites and had over run all the land of Gilead and the region beyond Jordan and the adjoining country which is called Galilee and Kadesh and Hazor he made the inhabitants prisoners and trans planted them into his own kingdom Now Jotham the son of Uzziah reigned over the tribe of Judah in Jerusalem being a citizen thereof by his mother whose name was Jerusha This king was not defective in any virtue but was religious towards God and righteous towards men and careful of the good of the city for what parts soever wanted to be repaired or adorned he mag nificently repaired and adorned them He also took care of the foundations of the cloisters in the temple and repaired the walls that were fallen down and built very great towers and such as were almost im pregnable and if any thing else in his king dom had been neglected he took great care of it He also made an expedition against the Ammonites and overcame them in battle and ordered them to pay an annual tribute of a hundred talents and ten thousand cori of wheat and as many of barley and so augmented his kingdom that his enemies could not despise it and his own people lived happily There was at this time a prophet Â called Nahum who spake after this manner con cerning the overthrow of the Assyrians and of Nineveh Nineveh shall be a pool of water in motion so shall all her people be troubled and tossed and go away by flight while they say one to another stand stand still seize their gold and silver for there shall be none to wish them well For they will rather save their lives than their money For a terrible contention shall possess them one with another and lamentation and loos ing of the members and their countenances shall be perfectly black with fear And where will be the den of the lions and the mother of the young lions God says to thee Nineveh that they shall deface thee and the lions shall no longer go out from thee to give laws to the world And indeed this prophet prophesied many other things besides these concerning Nineveh which I do not think necessary to repeat and I here omit them that I may not appear trouble drawn into idolatry that Rehoboam forsook the law of the Lord and Abijah walked in his steps that Asa sent the treasures of the temple to the king of Syria and put the prophet in the stocks that Jehoshaphat entered into society with the idolatrous and so he goes on with all the rest But in Jotham says he there is no fault found which in an age of general corruption is pretty wonder ful unless we may suppose that the people s sacrificing and burning incense still on high places 2 Kings xv 35 which he by his authority might have removed be im

wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give Pul king of Assyria 1000 talents this is the first public money raised by any Israelitish king by a tax on the peo ple that they used before to raise

forty one years and of them reigned sixteen f and he was buried in the sepul chres of the kings The kingdom then came to his son Ahaz who proved most impious towards God J and a transgressor of the laws of his country He imitated the kings of Israel and reared altars in Jerusalem and offered sacrifices upon them to idols to which also he offered his own son as a burnt offering according to the practice of the Canaanites His other actions were also of the same sort Now as he was going on in this mad course Rezin king of Syria and Damascus and Pekah king of Israel who were now at amity made war with him And when they had driven him into Jeru salem they besieged that city a long while making but a small progress on account of the strength of its walls And when the king of Syria had taken

the reason of God s anger against king Ahaz and he complained that they were not satis fied with the good success they had had against him but were so bold as to make captives out of their kinsmen the

Damascus its founder This much is certain that one whom he had made free and appointed steward of his house was of Damascus Gen xv 2 at the time that he pursued Chedorlaomer and the five confederated kings as far as Hobah which lies northward of Damascus Gen xiv 15 The Scriptures say nothing more of this city until the time of David when Hadad who according to Josephus Jewish Antiq lib vii c 6 was the first who took upon him the title of king of Damascus sending troops to the assistance of Hadadezer king of Zobah was himself defeated by David and his country subdued Towards the end of Solomon s

Israel 1 Kings xv 18 And from his time the kings of Damas cus were generally called Benhadad till in this last con troversy with them Ahaz called in the assistance of the king of Assyria who killed

own that we have committed against him as the prophet assures us Nor ought we therefore to introduce the practice of new crimes When the soldiers heard that they permitted them to do what they thought best So the aforenamed men took the captives and gave them provisions and sent them into their own country without doing them any harm However these four went along with them and conducted them as far as Jericho which is not far from Jeru salem and then returned to Samaria Hereupon king Ahaz having been so com pletely defeated by the Israelites sent to Tiglath Pileser king of the Assyrians and sued for assistance in his war against the Israelites Syrians and Damascenes with a promise to send him much money He sent him also great presents at the same time Now this king upon the reception of the ambassadors came to assist Ahaz and having made war upon the Syrians he laid their country waste took Damascus by force slew Rezin their king and transplanted the people of Damascus into the upper Media and planted a colony of Assyrians in their city He also afflicted the land of Israel and took many captives out of it In the mean time king Ahaz took all the gold that was in the royal treasury and the silver and what was in the temple of God and what precious gifts were there and he carried them with him and came to Damascus and gave it to the king of Assyria according to his agreement So he confessed that he owed him thanks for all that he had done for him and returned to Jerusalem Now this king was so thoughtless of what was for his own good that he would not leave off worshipping the Syrians gods when he was beaten by them but he continued in his idolatry as though they had procured him the victory And when he was beaten again he began to honour the gods of the Assyrians and he seemed more desirous to honour any other than his paternal and true God whose anger was the cause of his de feat Nay he proceeded to such a degree of contempt of God s worship that he shut up the temple entirely f and forbade the people to bring in the appointed sacrifices and took away the gifts that had been given to it And when he had offered these indig nities to God he died having lived thirty six years J and reigned sixteen j and he left his son Hezekiah for his successor CHAP XIII OF THE DEATH OF PEKAH AND THE REIGNS OF HOSHEA KING OF ISRAEL AND HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH ABOUT the

strengthened him not And yet in 2 Kings xvi 9 it is said that he did help him and how then can he be said to have distressed him Very well for as he came to his assistance against the king of Syria so he took Damascus carried the people captive and delivered Ahaz from the power of the Syrians but this did Ahaz little good for he helped him not to re cover the cities which the Philistines had taken from him He lent him no forces nor enabled him to recruit his own  on the contrary he rather weakened him by ex hausting his treasures and destroying Samaria which opened a way for the invasion of his country with more facility as it happened in the next reign For it is no uncommon thing even in later ages to hear of kingdoms that were called in the help of some foreign prince against their enemies over run and conquered by those who came in their assistance Patrick Commentary B t 2 Kings xxviii 24 J When Josephus together with all our Hebrew and all our Greek copies in the Kings and all our Hebrew and almost all our Greek copies in the Chronicles make Ahaz to be but twenty years old when he began to reign and to reign sixteen years and then as all the copies agree to be succeeded by Hezekiah at twenty five years of age it is plain there are but eleven years or at most some odd months besides for Ahaz the father when the son Hezekiah was born which is one of the greatest dif ficulties in all the Bible But then as Dr Wall justly observes this difficulty is cleared by the Greek copy and the Armenian version which though the former in the Kings and the latter in the Chronicles had with the rest dropped the odd years above twenty for the age of Ahaz when he came to the crown yet has the former in the Chronicles 2 Chron xxviii 1 and the latter in the Kings preserved them and expressly assured us there that Ahaz was twenty five years old when he began to reign which directly implies that he was sixteen years old when his son Hezekiah was born which wholly obviates the difficulty II From An 744 to 728 Â Josephus says here that Pekah was slain about the same time that Ahaz died which chronology will not allow Yet when we consider that in the same chrono logy the fourth of Ahaz is called the twentieth of Jotham 2 Kings xv 30 while Jotham reigned in all but sixteen an 782 351 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS dom nine years but was a wicked man and a despiser of the divine worship And Shalmaneser king of Assyria made an expe dition against him and overcame him which must have been because he had not God favorable nor assistant to him and brought him to submission and ordered him to pay an appointed tribute Now in the fourth year of the reign of Hoshea Hezekiah f the son of Ahaz began to reign in Jerusalem and his mother s name was Abijah a citizen of Jerusalem His nature was good and reli fious For when he came to the kingdom e thought nothing more necessary or more advantageous to himself and to his subjects than to worship God Accordingly he as sembled the people and the priests and the Levites and made a speech to them and said  You are not ignorant how by the sins of my father who transgressed that sacred honour which was due to God you have had experience of many and great miseries while you were corrupted in your mind by him and were induced to worship those which he supposed to be gods I exhort you there fore who have learned by sad experience how dangerous a thing impiety is to put that imme diately out of your memory and to purify yourselves from your former pollutions and to open the temple to these priests and Le vites who are here convened and to cleanse it with the accustomed sacrifices and to recover all the ancient honour which our forefathers payed to it For by this means we may render God favourable and he will remit the anger he hath had towards us When the king had said this the priests opened the temple and when they had set in order the vessels of God and had cast out what was impure they laid the accustomed years verse 33 it may be questioned whether some of the copies in the days of Josephus had not hereabouts some different numbers and that according to those numbers Pekah might hare been slain about the same time that Ahaz died though possibly Josephus might use these words about the same time in a looser acceptation  From an 737 to 728 t Of Ahaz it is recorded that he was but twenty years old when he began to reign and that he reigned sixteen before he died so that in the whole he lived six and thirty years 2 Kings xvi 2 Now his son Hezekiah is said to have been five and twenty years old when he began to reign 2 Kings xviii 2 and consequently his father must have begot him when he was eleven years old which seems a HtUe incredible and to solve this diffi culty commentators have taken several ways Some have imagined that Hezekiah was not the real but adopted son only of Ahaz and might therefore succeed his foster father at this or any other age but this hypothesis as Bochart observes spoils the descent of our Saviour from David Others suppose that there was an interregnum for some years occasioned by a sedition that happened in Jerusalem But there is no foundation for this hypothesis in history on the contrary it is much more likely that as Hezekiah was a man grown and greatly beloved by the people he should immediately succeed upon his father s demise Others imagine that in the detestation of Ahaz s wickedness his reign is omitted in this account and that therefore the passage should be thus rendered â Ahaz was twenty years old when his father began to reign But this is reversing the order of the words in the text and turning them into a sense that is fir from being natural Others not satisfied with any of these solutions will needs have it that there is an error crept into the text itself by the negligence of some transcriber who instead of twenty made Hezekiah five and twenty years old when his reign commenced merely by mistaking the numerical letters which are most liable in variation to find any fault with the text except where there is no other tolerable solution which is not the case here In these days and long before it was no unusual thing upon se veral considerations for kings to take the son who was to succeed them into partnership with them before they died Now Ahaz by his mismanagement had brought himself into so many intanglements 2 Chron xxviii 16 c and xxix 7 c as to want an assistant in the government and accordingly it appears that he admitted his son in that capacity For whereas it is said of Hezekiah that he began to reign in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah 2 Kings xviii 1 and of Hoshea that he began to reign in the twelfth year of Ahaz 2 Kings xvii 1 it is evident that Hezekiah began to reign in the fourteenth year of Ahaz his father and so reigned two or three years before his father s death So that at the first date of his reign which was in conjunction with his father he might be two or three and twenty and his father consequently when he begot him two or three years older than the common computation But there is another way of solv ing this difficulty It is a common thing both in sacred and profane authors in the computation of time to take no notice whether the year they mention be perfect or imperfect whether finished or but newly begun Upon this account Ahaz might be near one and twenty years old when he began to reign and near seventeen years older when he died and on the other hand Hezekiah when he began to reign might be but just entering into his five and twentieth year and by this means Ahaz might be near fourteen years old when he begat Hezekiah which is no extraordinary thing at all Nay even upon the lowest supposition that he was but eleven or twelve years old yet instances are innumerable such as Bochart and others have given of persons that have procreated chil dren at that age for it is not so much the number of years as the nature of the climate the constitution of the body the stature of the person the quality of the diet c that ought to be considered in this affair Bochart s Pha leg p 920 Miller History of the Church p 201 Bed ford s Scripture Chronology Patrick s and Caltntt t Com mentaries B 352 book k ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sacrifices upon the altar The king also sent to the country that was under him and called the people to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of unleavened bread for it had been intermitted a long time on account of the wickedness of the aforementioned kings He also sent to the Israelites and exhorted them to leave off their present way of living and to return to their ancient practices and to worship God for that he gave them leave to come to Jerusalem and to celebrate all in one body the feast of unleavened bread and this he said was by way of invitation only and to be done of their own good will and for their own advantage and not out of obe dience to him because it would make them happy But the Israelites upon the arrival of the ambassadors and upon their laying before them what they had in charge from their own king were so far from complying there with that they laughed the ambassadors to scorn and mocked them as fools they also affronted the prophets who gave them the same exhortations and foretold what they would suffer if they did not return to the worship of God insomuch that they caught them and slew them Nor did this degree of transgressing suffice them but they had more wicked contrivances than what have been described Nor did they leave off before God as a punishment for their impiety brought them under their enemies But of that more hereafter There were however many of the tribe of Manasseh and of Zab ulon and of Issachar t who were obedient to what the prophets exhorted them to do and all these came running to Jerusalem to Heze kiah that they might worship God there When these men were come king Heze kiah went up into the temple with the rulers and all the people and offered for himself seven bulls and as many rams with seven lambs and seven kids of the goats The king also and the rulers laid their hands on the heads of the sacrifices and permitted the priests to complete the sacred offices about them So they both slew the sacrifices and burnt the burnt offerings while the Levites stood round about them with their musical instruments and sang hymns to God and played on their psalteries as they were in structed to do and this while the rest of the priests returned the music and sounded the trumpets which they had in their hands And when this was done the king and the multi tude prostrated themselves and worshipped God Seventy bulls one hundred rams and two hundred lambs were sacrificed by the king who also granted the multitude sacri fices to feast upon six hundred oxen and three thousand other cattle and the priests performed all things according to the law Now the king was so pleased herewith that he feasted with the people and returned thanks to God But as the least of unleavened bread was now come when they had offered that sacrifice which is called the passover they afterwards offered other sacrifices for seven days When the king had bestowed on the multitude beside what they sacrificed of themselves two thousand bulls and seven thousand other cattle the same thing was done by the rulers For they gave them a thousand bulls and a thousand and forty other cattle Nor had this festival been ob served from the days of king Solomon with such great splendour and magnificence and when the festival was ended they went out into the country and purged it and cleansed the city of all the pollution of the idols The king also gave order that the daily sacrifices should be offered at his own expense and according to the law and appointed that the tithes and the first fruits should be given by the multitude to the priests and the Levites that they might constantly attend upon divine service and never be taken off from the worship of God Accordingly the multitude brought together all sorts of their fruits to  2 Chron xxx 1 t Asher Hebrew and Septuagint j Moses in the service of the tabernacle did not ap point the use of many musical instruments only he caused some trumpets to be made which upon solemn occasions were to be sounded at the time when the burnt offering and peace offering were upon the altar Numb x 10 But David by the advice of the prophets Gad and Na than introduced several kinds of music into the service of the temple as a thing highly conducive to inspire people with respect with joy and with affection for the solem nities and assemblies of religion 1 Chron xxiii 5 and xxv 1 and it is farther observable that the institution of music in religious assemblies is not a matter of human invention but was ordained by God and has the sanction and authority of his prophets to confirm itâ for so was the commandment of the Lord by his prophets 2 Chron xxix 25 B am 727 353 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the priests and the LeviteB The king also made garners and receptacles lor these fruits and distributed them to every one of the priests and Levites and to their wives and children And thus did they return to their old form of divine worship Now when the king had settled these matters after the manner already described he made war upon the Philistines and defeated them and possessed himself of all their cities from Gaza to Gath And when the king of Assyria gent to him threatening to overturn all his dominions unless he would pay him the tri bute which his father paid formerly Heze kiah was not alarmed but depended on his piety towards God by whom he inquired and accurately knew all future events And thus much shall suffice for the present con cerning king Hezekiah CHAP XIV OP THE REDUCTION OF SAMARIA BY SHALMANE9ER AND THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN TRIBES INTO MEDIA WHEN Shalmaneser king of Assyria was informed that Hoshea had sent Erivately to So the king of Egypt desiring is assistance against him he was very angry and made an expedition against Sa maria in the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea And on being refused admittance into the city he besieged Samaria three years and took it by mere force in the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea and in the seventh of Hezekiah king of Jerusalem and quite demolished the government of the Is raelites and transplanted all the people into Media and Persia among whom he took king Hoshea alive and when he had removed these people out of their land he transplanted other nations out of a place called Cuthah into Samaria and into the country of the Israelites So the tten tribes of the Israelites were removed out of Judea nine hundred and forty seven years after their forefathers came out of the land of Egypt and possessed themselves of this country but eight hundred years after Joshua had been their leader and two hundred and forty years seven months and seven days after they had re volted from Rehoboam the grandson of David and had given the kingdom to Jero boam And such a conclusion overtook the Israelites when they had transgressed the laws and would not hearken to the prophets who foretold that this calamity would come upon them if they would not leave off their transgressions What gave birth to these doings was that sedition which they raised against Rehoboam the grandson of David when they set up his servant Jeroboam to be their king who by sinning against God and bringing them to imitate his bad example made God to be their enemy while himself underwent that punishment he justly de served And now the king of Assyria invaded all Syria and Phoenicia in a hostile manner The name of this king is also set down in the ar chives of Tyre for he made an expedition against Tyre in the reign of Eluleus And Menander attests to it who when he wrote his Chronology and translated the archives of Tyre into the Greek language gives us the following history One whose name was Eluleus reigned thirty six years the king upon the revolt of the Citteans sailed to them and reduced them again to submission Against these did the king of Assyria send an army and in a hostile manner over ran all Phoenicia but soon made peace with them and returned back But Sidon and Ace Pa loetyrus revolted and many other cities there were which delivered themselves up to the king of Assyria Accordingly when the Ty rians would not submit to him the king re turned and fell upon them again while the Phoenicians had furnished him with sixty ships and eight hundred men to row them And when the Tyrians had come upon them  This siege of Samaria though not given a particular account of either in our Hebrew or Greek Bibles or in Josephus was so very long no less than three years that it is no way improbable but that parents and particu larly mothers might therein be reduced to eat their own children as the law of Moses had threatened upon their disobedience Levit xxvi 29 Deut xxviii 53â 57 and as was accomplished in the other shorter sieves of both the capital cities Jerusalem and Samaria the former mentioned Jer xix 9 Lam ii 20 iv 10 Antiq IX 4 Of the War VI 3 4 the latter mentioned 2 Kings vi 26â 29 See my Boyle s Lectures page 209â 214 t That our Chronology is certain as far backward as this captivity of the ten tribes and that to a single year during the interval of 2456 years see demonstrated from the sabbatical years in the Supplement to the Literal Accomplishment of the Prophecies page 75 354 book IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in twelve ships and the enemies were dis persed they took five hundred men prisoners And the reputation of all the citizens of Tyre was thereby increased But the king of Assyria returned and placed guards at their river and aqueducts who should hinder the Tyrians from drawing water This continued for five years and still the Tyrians sustained the siege and drank of the water they had out of the wells they dug And this is what is written in the Tyrian archives concerning Shalmaneser king of Assyria But now the Cutheans who removed into Samaria for that is the name they have been called by to this time because they were brought out of the country called Cuthah which is a country of Persia and there is a river of the same name in it each of them according to their nations which were in number five brought their own gods into Sa maria and by worshipping them as was the custom of their own countries they provoked Almighty God to send a plague upon them by which they were destroyed And when they found no cure for their miseries they learned by an oracle that they ought to wor ship Almighty God as the method for their deliverance So they sent ambassadors to the king of Assyria and desired him to send them some of those priests of the Israelites whom he had taken captive And when he thereupon sent them and the people were by them taught the laws and the holy wor ship of God they worshipped him in a re spectable manner and the plague ceased immediately And indeed they continued to make use of the same customs to this very time and are called in the Hebrew tongue Cutheans but in the Greek tongue Samari tans And when they see the Jews in pros perity they pretend that they are allied to them and call them kinsmen as though they were derived from Joseph and had by that means an original alliance with them But when they see them falling into a low con dition they say they are no way related to them and that the Jews have no right to expect any kindness from them but they declare that they are sojourners that come from other countries But of these we shall have a more seasonable opportunity to dis course hereafter t  Josephus says here that instead of lions as in our other copies 2 Kings xvii 26 a plague or pestilence was sent among these Cutheans or Samaritans He also con firms this afterwards XII 5 by an epistle of these Cu theans or Samaritans to Antiochus Epiphanes which says nothing of lions but expressly mentions these fre quent plagues So that Josephus s reading seems to be the most accurate in this place t See Book XI chap 8 and XII 5 kit 710 305 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK X Containing an Interval of One Hundred and Eighty two Years and a half PROM THE CAPTIVITY OF THE TEN TRIBES TO THE FIRST OF CYRUS CHAP I oÂ Sennacherib s expedition against hezekiab THE THREATENINGs OF RABSHAKEH J THE FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION AND THE SUBSEQUENT DEATH OF SENNA CHERIB IT was now the fourteenth year of the government of Hezekiah king of the two tribes when Sennacherib king of As syria made an expedition against him with a great army and took all the cities of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by force And when he was ready to bring his army against Jerusalem Hezekiah sent ambassa dors to him promising to submit and to pay what tribute ne should appoint Hereupon Sennacherib resolved not to proceed in the war but to accept of the proposals that were made him and if he might receive three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold he promised that he would depart in a friendly manner and gave security upon oath to the ambassadors that he would then do Hezekiah no harm but go away as he came So Hezekiah submitted and emptied his treasures and sent the money as sup C posing he should be freed from his enemy and from any farther distress about his king dom Accordingly the Assyrian took it and et had no regard to what he had promised ut while he himself went to the war against the Egyptians and Ethiopians he left his general Rabshakeh t and two other of his principal commanders with great forces to destroy Jerusalem The names of the two other commanders were Tartan and Rab saris Now as soon as they were come before the walls they pitched their camp and sent mes sengers to Hezekiah and desired that they might speak with him But he did not him self come out to them for fear but sent three of his most intimate friends viz Eliakim who was over the kingdom Shebna and Joah the recorder So these men came out and stood over against the commanders of the Assyrian army and when Rabshakeh saw them he bade them go and speak to Hezekiah in the following manner that Sennacherib the great king desires to know of him on whom it is that he relies and depends in flying from his lord and re  2 Kings xviii 13 Isaiah xxxvi 1 t Tartan Rabsaris and Rabshakeh are not the proper names of these men but rather denote their employments and offices Tartan signifies the president of the customs Rabsaris the chief eunuch and Rabshakeh the principal cup bearer and because he spake Hebrew with some fluency the Rabbins are generally of opinion that he was either an apostate Jew or one of the captivity of Israel It is certain that he was a very eloquent man and his speech very excellently well calculated to raise sedition or defection among the besieged but that a person of his education should be versed in the Phoenician which is in a manner the same with the Hebrew language is no wonder fOIÂ I â NOS 29  30 at all Moreover had he been a Jew though an apos tate he should have known better one would think than to have upbraided Hezekiah with acting according to the law under which he lived in destroying the groves and altars of idols and in requiring his subjects to worship God in Jerusalem only 2 Kings xviii 22 Le Clerc s Commentary B t 2 Kings xviii 17 I This title of Great King both in oar Bibles 2 Kings xviii 19 Isaiah xxxiv 4 and here in Josephus is the same that Herodotus gives this Sennacherib as Spanheim takes

beaten by them Whereupon he lets him know that if this be what he expects he is a foolish man and like one who leans on a broken reed while such a one will not only fall down but will have his hand pierced and hurt by it for he ought to know he makes this expedition against him by the will of God who hath granted this favour to him that he shall overthrow the kingdom of Israel arid that in the very same manner he shall destroy those that are his subjects also When Rab shakeh had made this speech in the Hebrew tongue for he was skilful in that language Eliakim was afraid lest the multitude that heard him should be disturbed So he de sired him to speak in the Syrian tongue But the general understanding what he meant and perceiving the fear that he was in replied with a louder voice in the He brew tongue and said Since they all hear what are the king s commands they will consult their own advantage in delivering up themselves to us for it is plain that both you and your king dissuade the people from submitting by vain hopes and so induce them to resist But if you be courageous and think to drive our forces away I am ready to deliver to you two thousand of these horses that are with me for your use if you can set as many horsemen on their backs and shew their strength But what you have not you cannot produce Why therefore do you delay to deliver up your selves to a superior force who can take you without your consent although it will be safer for you to deliver yourselves up volun tarily while a forcible capture when you are beaten must appear more dangerous and will bring farther calamities upon you f When the people as well as the ambassa dors heard what the Assyrian commander L  The words in the text are â Now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon Egypt 2 Kings xviii 21 The comparison is excellent to de note an ally that is not only weak and unable to help but dangerous likewise to those that rely upon him for suc cour and his representing the power of Egypt to be as brittle as the canes or reeds that grow on the banks of the Nile for it is to this no doubt that the Assyrian orator alludes is a great beauty in the similitude This how ever must be allowed that what he here speaks in con said they related it to Hezekiah who there upon put off his royal apparel and clothed himself with sackcloth and took the habit of a mourner and after the manner of his country he fell upon his face and besought God and entreated him to assist them now they had no other hope of relief He also sent some of his friends and some of the priests to the prophet Isaiah desiring that he would pray to God and offer sacrifices for their common deliverance and so put up supplications to him that he would have in dignation at the expectations of their enemies and have mercy upon his people And when the prophet had done accordingly an oracle came from God to him and encouraged the king and his friends that were about him and foretold that their enemies should be beaten without fighting and should go away in an ignominious manner and not with that insolence which they had now shewn for that God would take care they should be de stroyed He also foretold that Sennacherib the king of Assyria should fail of his purpose against Egypt and that when he came home he should perish by the sword About the same time also the king of As syria wrote an epistle to Hezekiah in which he said he was a foolish man in supposing that he should escape from being his servant since he had already brought under many and great nations and he threatened that when he took him he would utterly destroy him un less he now opened the gates and willingly received his army into Jerusalem When he had read this epistle he despised it on ac count of the trust that he had in God but he rolled up the epistle and laid it up within the temple And as he made his farther prayers to God for the city and for the preservation of all the people the prophet Isaiah said that God had heard his prayer and that he should not be besiegedJ at this time by the king of Assyria that for the future he might be se tempt of the Egyptian strength has more of ostentation in it than truth because the Assyrian army having lately made an attempt to subdue that kingdom was now returned into Judea with disgrace Patrick s Le Clerc i and Calmet s Commentaries B t 2 Kings xviii 19â 35 J What Josephus says here how Isaiah the prophet assured Hezekiah that At this time he should not be besieged by the king of Assyria that for the future he might be secure of being not at all disturbed by him and AN 710 357 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS cure of not being at all disturbed by him and that the people might go on peaceably and without fear with their husbandry and other affairs But after a little while the king of Assyria when he had failed of his treache rous designs against the Egyptians returned home without success on the following oc casion He spent a long time in the siege of Pelusium and when the banks that he had raised over against the walls were of a great height and when he was ready to make an immediate assault upon them he heard that Tirhaka king of the Ethiopians was bringing great forces to aid the Egyptians and was resolved to march through the de sert and so to fall directly upon the Assy rians Sennacherib was therefore disturbed at the news and as I said before left Pe lusium and returned back without success Now concerning this Sennacherib Herodotus says in the second book of his histories that he came against the Egyptian king who was the priest of Vulcan and that as he was besieging Pelusium he broke up the siege on the following occasion This Egyptian priest prayed to God and God heard his prayer and sent a judgment upon the Ara bian king but in this Herodotus was mis taken when he called this king not king of the Assyrians but of the Arabians For he saith that A multitude of mice gnawed to pieces in one night both the bows and the rest of the armour of the Assyrians and that it was on that account that the king when he had no bows left drew off his army from Pelusium And Herodotus does indeed give us this history Nay and Berosus who wrote of the affairs of Chaldea makes mention of this king Sennacherib and that he ruled over the Assyrians and that he made an expedition against all Asia and Egypt and fsays thus â Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyptian war to Jerusalem he found his army under Rabshakeh his gene ral in danger by a plague for God had sent a pestilential distemper upon his army and on the very first night of the siege a hundred and eighty five thousand with their captains and generals were destroyed J So the king that afterward the people might go on peaceably and without fear with their husbandry and other affairs is more distinct in our other copies both of the Kings and of Isaiah and deserves very great consideration The words are these This shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof 2 Kings xix 20 Isaiah xxxvii 30 which seem to me plainly to design a sabbatic year a year of Jubilee next after it and the succeeding usual labours and fruits of them on the third and following years From which may be determined the sabbatic year part of the 18th and part of the 19th year of He zekiah or part of the 710th and 709th years before the Christian Era and the year of Jubilee part of the 19th and part of the 20th of Hezekiah which is the part of the 709th and part of the 708th before the Christian Era From which texts may be determined all the other sab batic years and that in agreement with a great deal of other evidence which in this case no way differs from it From which texts also may be determined what we have hitherto extremely wanted the situation of all the other years of Jubilee even from that first year wherein Moses died and Joshua led the Israelites into the land of Canaan an 1492 to the last year of Jubilee wherein John the Baptist began his ministry A D 28 thirty two in all Whence the Scripture chronology may be settled and this without the error of a single year as far back as the death of Moses during the very long interval of 3227 years  Correct here Josephus s copies as to the citation out of Herodotus and read who says that Sennacherib was not only king of the Assyrians but of the Arabians also Which Josephus seems to have esteemed a mis take in Herodotus t That this terrible calamity of the slaughter of the 185 000 Assyrians is here delivered in the words of Be rosus the Chaldean and that it was certainly and fre quently foretold by the Jewish prophets and that it was certainly and undeniably accomplished see Authentic Rec part II page 858â 871 J The ancient Jews as well as Persians and Arabians were of opinion that there is an angel of death or an ex terminating angel whom God has given the commission to take away the lives either of single persons or of mul titudes of people at once wherein the Almighty gives the order but leaves the method of doing it to the angel so that in which way soever the infliction is made it is always said to be done by the angel of God The modern Jews are much of the same opinion for they maintain that this angel of death stands at every dying man s bed s head with a naked sword in his hand at the extremity of which there hang three drops of gall and that the sick person seeing this angel in a great fright opens his mouth whereupon he immediately drops into it these three fatal drops the first which occasions his death the second makes him pale and livid and the third reduces him to the dust in the grave with some other notions of the like nature Now since the Scripture has no where said expressly in what manner this Assyrian army was destroyed some have thought that it was by a plague others by thunder and lightning others by fire from hea ven others by a scorching wind others by their falling foul upon one another in the obscurity of the night but which way soever it was

Jewish nation To which he was answered That Abraham from whom they were descended by sa crificing his only son to him had purchased his protection to his progeny whereupon the king replied If that will win him I will spare him two of mine to gain him to my side which when his two sons Sharezer and Adram melech heard they resolved to prevent their own death by sacrificing him But for all this

melancholy circum stance that disordered the king which was the consideration that he was childless and was going to die and leave his house and his government without a successor of his own body So he was troubled at the thoughts of his condition and lamented himself and intreated God that he would prolong his life for a little while till he had some children and not suffer him to depart this life before he was become a father Hereupon God had mercy upon him and accepted of his supplication because the trouble he was under at his supposed death was not be cause he was soon to leave the advantages he enjoyed in the kingdom nor did he on that account pray that he might have a longer life afforded him but in order to have sons that might receive the govern ment after him And so God sent Isaiah the prophet and commanded him to inform Hezekiah that within three days time he should recover from his distemper and should survive it fifteen years ll and that he should also have children Now upon the prophet s saying this as God had com manded him Hezekiah could hardly be lieve it both on account of the distemper he was under which was very sore and by reason of the surprising nature of what was told him so he desired that Isaiah would Hezekiah after the destruction of Sennacherib s army because it appears to have been after his first assault us he was going into Arabia and Egypt where he pushed his conquest as far as they would go and in order to despatch his story altogether Yet does no copy but this of Josephus s say it was after that destruction but only that it happened in those days or about that time of Hezekiah s life Nor will the fifteen years prolongation of his life after his sickness allow that sickness to have been later than the former part of the fifteenth year of his reign Since chronology does not allow him in all above twenty nine years and a few months Whereas the first assault of Sennacherib was in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah 2 Kings xviii 13 but the destruction of Sennacherib s army was not till the eighteenth year There is also a promise inserted in the history of He zekiah s sickness which shews it to have been after Sennacherib s first assault but before his army s destruc tion I mean the words of the prophet Isaiah I wiH deliver thee awl this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this

said and be sensible that he came from God For things that are beyond expectation and greater than our hopes are made credible by actions of the like nature And when Isaiah had asked him what sign he wished to be exhibited He desired that he would make the shadow of the sun which had already gone down ten steps in his house to return again to the same place and to make it as it was before And when the prophet prayed to God to exhibit this sign to the king he saw what he desired to see and was freed from his distemper and went up to the temple where he worshipped God and made vows to him At this time the dominion of the Assyrians wasf overthrown by the Medes But the king of Babylon whose name was Baladan sent ambassadors to Hezekiah with presents and desired he would be his ally and his friend J So he received the ambassadors gladly and made them a feast and shewed them his treasures and his armoury and the other wealth he was possessed of in precious stones and in gold and gave them presents to be carried to Baladan and sent them back to him  Upon which the prophet Isaiah came to him and inquired whence those ambassadors came to which he re plied that they came from Babylon from the king and that he had shewn them all he had that by the sight of his riches and forces they might thereby guess at the plenty he was in and be able to inform the king of it But the prophet rejoined and said Know thou that after a little while these riches of thine shall be carried away to Babylon and thy posterity shall be made eunuchs there and be servants to the king of Babylon for God hath foretold such things shall come to pass Upon these  As to this regress of the shadow either upon a sun dial or the steps of the royal palace built by Ahaz whe ther it were physically done by the miraculous revolu tion of the earth in its diurnal motion backward from cast to west for a while and its return again to its old natural revolution from west to east or whether it were apparent only and performed by an aerial phos phorus of which sort though under other shapes we have had a great many of late years which imitated the sun s motion backward while a cloud hid the real sun cannot now be determined Philosophers and astrono mers will naturally incline to the latter hypothesis How ever it must be noted that Josephus seems to have un derstood it otherwise than we generally do that the shadow was accelerated as much at first forward as it was made to go backward afterward and so the day was neither longer nor shorter than usual which it must be confessed agrees best of all to astronomy whose eclipses elder than that time were observed at the same times of the day as if this miracle had never happened After all this wonderful signal was not it seems peculiar to Judea but either seen or at least heard of at Babylon also as appears by 2 Chron xxxii 31 where we learn that the Babylonian ambassadors were sent to Hezekiah among other things to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land It is also taken notice of by the father of Sirach Ecclus xlviii 23 See another ancient testimony also before in the note under Joshua Antiq V 1 t This expression of Josephus s that the Medcs upon this destruction of the Assyrian army overthrew the As syrian empire seems to be too strong For although they immediately cast off the Assyrian yoke and set up De joces a king of their own yet was it some time before the Medes and Babylonians overthrew Nineveh and some generations ere the Medes and Persians under Cy axares and Cyras overthrew the Assyrian or Babylonian empire and took Babylon t The conquests which the Assyrians were every where making could not fail of giving umbrage to the neighbouring powers to confederate against them and therefore we may well suppose that besides the business of congratulating Hezekiah s recovery the purpose of this embassy was to enter into an alliance with him against Sennacherib whose growing power the Babylonians had reason to fear as well as the Jews  and as the author of the Chronicles expresses it to inquire into the wonder that was done in the land 2 Chron xxxii 31 i e to in quire into the miracle of the sun s retrogradation which could not fail of being a matter of great curiosity to the Chaldeans who above all other nations were at that time given to the study of Astronomy Calmet s Commentary and Prideaux s Connection Anno 713 B   The things which Hezekiah shewed to the Babylo nian ambassadors were the riches of his house his trea sures his armoury and all his stores and strength for war and the reason for his doing this was doubtless to make the Babylonians put the greater value upon his friend ship but herein he offended God that he not only laid a bait before these foreigners to encourage them to invade his country but seemed to place more confidence in this new alliance with them than in the power of the Al mighty whose favour and protection he had so long ex perienced The author of the Chronicles tells us that in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart 2 Chron xxxii 31 And from hence some have inferred that Hezekiah s great offence lay not so much in the ostentation of his military stores and treasures as in his not giving sufficient glory to God for so signal a miracle and his recovery ensuant there upon and in his not representing this matter to these idolatrous ambassadors in such powerful and convincing terms as might have drawn them over to the knowledge of the true God which was the proper improvement he should have made this divine vouchsafement to him Ls Clerks Commentary B 360 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS words Hezekiah was troubled and said he was himself unwilling that his nation should fall into such calamities yet since it was not possible to alter what God had determined he prayed that there might be peace while he lived f Berosus also makes mention of this Baladan king of Babylon Now as to this prophet Isaiah he was by the confession of all a divine and wonderful man in speak ing truth and out of the assurance that he had never written what was false he wrote down all the prophecies and left them be hind him in books that their accomplish ment might be judged of from the events by posterity Nor did this prophet do so alone but the others which wereJ twelve in num ber did the same And whatever is done among us whether it be good or whether it be bad comes to pass according to the pro phecies CHAP HI OF THE IMPIETY OF MANASSEH HEZEKIAH S SUCCESSOR HIS PENITENCE IN CAPTIVITY AND HIS RESTORATION TO HIS KINGDOM WHEN the king Hezekiah had sur vived the interval of time already mentioned and had dwelt all that time in peace he died having completed fifty four years of his life and reigned twenty nine But when his son Manasseh whose mother s name was Hephzibah of Jerusalem had taken the kingdom he departed from the conduct of his father and fell into a course of life quite contrary thereto and shewed himself in his manners most wicked in all re spects omitting no sort of impiety but imi tating those transgressions of the Israelites by the commission of which against God they had been destroyed For he was so hardy as to defile the temple of God and the city and the whole country For by setting out from a contempt of God he barbarously slew all the righteous men that were among the Hebrews Nor would he spare the pro phets Â for he every day slew some of them till Jerusalem was deluged with blood So God was angry at these proceedings and sent prophets to the king and to the multi tude by whom he threatened the very same calamities to them which their brethren the Israelites upon the like affronts offered to God were now under But these men would not believe their words by which belief they might have reaped the advantage of escaping all those miseries yet did they in earnest learn that what the prophets had told them was true Now while they persevered in the same course of life God raised up war against them from the king of Babylon and Chaldea who sent an army against Judea and laid waste the country and caught Manasseh by  2 Kings xx 19 t The words in the text are â Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken And he said Is it not good if peace and truth be in my days 2 Kings xx 19 The prophet had told him that the very people whom he had been so highly complimenting would carry his posterity into cap tivity and to return him such an answer as this shews not all the concern which a good prince ought to have for his people and posterity It shews indeed as if he cared not what became of them so long as he was per mitted to live easy and happy The words in the original are to this effect That which thou hast told me from God is good I will submit to it But shall peace and truth i e solid and lasting peace continue for my time May I flatter myself with so much happiness And will God be so gracious as not to revoke the grant which he hath made me of a longer continuance here He is just no doubt in every thing he sends upon us but do these threats relate to me or my posterity only Well were it for me if he would suspend the execution of his wrath for the little time that I have to live This is the natural sense of Hezekiah s answer and accordingly Josephus makes him say  That though I am much afflicted at the thoughts of the misery that will befall my family yet since it is God s pleasure that it should be so I have no more to beg of Heaven than that I may enjoy the small remainder of my miserable life in peace Jewish Antiq lib 10 c 3 and Calmefs Commentary B I See Essay on

punishment he pleased upon him But Manasseh perceiving what a miserable con dition he was in and esteeming himself the cause of all besought God to render his enemy humane and merciful to him Accord ingly God heard his prayer and Manasseh was released by the king of Babylon and escaped the danger he was in And when he was come to Jerusalem he endeavoured if it were possible to cast out of his memory his former sins against God of which he now repented and to apply himself to a very re ligious life He sanctified the temple and purified the city and for the remainder of his days he was intent on nothing but to re turn thanks to God for his deliverance and to preserve him propitious to him all his life long He also instructed the multitude to do the same as having nearly experienced what a calamity he was fallen into by a contrary conduct He also rebuilt the altar and offered the legal sacrifices as Moses com manded and when he had re established what concerned the divine worship as it ought to be he took care of the security of Jerusalem He did not only repair the old walls with great diligence but added another wall to the former f He also built very lofty towers and strengthened the garrisoned places before the city supplying them with rovisions of all sorts And indeed when ie had changed his former course he so led his life for the time to come that from the time of his return to piety towards God he was deemed a happy man and a pattern for imitation When therefore he had lived sixty seven years he departed this life having reigned Jfifty five years and was buried in his own gardens and the kingdom came to his son HAmon whose mother s name was Meshulemeth of the city Jotbath CHAP IV OF THE REIGNS OF AMON AND JOSIAII AND OF THE PRE DICTIONS OF HULDAH THE PROPHETESS AMON imitated those works of his father which he insolently did when he was young So a conspiracy was formed against him by his servants and he was slain in his own house when he had lived twenty four years and reigned two But the multitude punished those that slew Amon and buried him with his father and gave the kingdom to his son Josiah who was eight years old Â His mother was of the city Boscath and her name was Jedidah He was of a most excel lent disposition and naturally virtuous and followed the actions of king David as a pat tern and a rule to him in the whole conduct of his life When he was only twelve years old he gave demonstrations of his religious and righteous behaviour for he brought the people to a sober way of living and exhorted them to leave off the opinion they had of their idols because they were not gods but to worship their own God And by reflecting on the actions of his progenitors he prudently corrected what they did wrong like a very elderly man and like one abundantly able to understand what was fit to be done and what he found they had well done he ob served all the country over and imitated the same And thus he acted in following the wisdom and sagacity of his own nature and in compliance with the advice and instruc tion of the elders For by following the laws it was that he succeeded so well in the order of his government and in piety with regard to the divine worship And this hap  The Jewish doctors have a tradition that while Ma nasseh was at Babylon by the direction of his conqueror he was put in a large brazen vessel full of holes and set near to a great fire that in this extremity he had re course to all his false deities to whom he had offered so many sacrifices but received no relief from them that remembering what he had heard hit good father Hezekiah â ay viz When thou art in tribulation if thou turn to the Lord thy God he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee Deut iv 30 31 he was thereupon immediately de livered and in a moment translated to his kingdom But this is no less a fiction than that miraculous flame which the author of the imperfect comment upon St Matthew speaks of that encompassed him on a sudden as he was praying to God and having melted his chains asunder set him at liberty Vide Tradit Hebr in paralip Targum in 2 Chron xxxiii 11 In all probability it was Saos

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS pened because the transgressions of the former kings were seen no more but quite vanished away For the king went about the city and the whole country and cut down the groves which were devoted to strange gods and overthrew their altars and if there were any gifts dedicated to them by his forefathers he made them ignominious and plucked them down and by this means he brought the people back from their opinion about them to the worship of God He also offered his accustomed sacrifices and burnt offerings upon the altar Moreover he or dained certain judges and overseers that they might order the matters to them severally be longing and have regard to justice above all things and distribute it with the same con cern they would have about their own souls He also sent over all the country and desired such as pleased to bring gold and silver for the repairs of the temple according to every one s inclination and abilities And when the money was brought in he made Maaseiah the governor of the city Shaphan the scribe Joah the recorder and Eliakim the high priest curators of the temple and of the charges contributed thereto These persons made no delay nor put the works off at all but prepared architects and whatsoever was proper for those repairs and set closely about the work So the temple was repaired by this means and became a public demon stration of the king s piety In the eighteenth year of his reign Josiah sent to Eliakim the high priest and gave  An 624 t Whether it was the whole Pentateuch or the hook of Deuteronomy only which the high priest found in the temple it is generally agreed that the part which Shaphan read to the king was taken out of the book of Deutero nomy and not without some probability that the 28th 29th and 30th chapters were that portion of Scripture which the secretary who as we are told 2 Kings xxii 8 had read the book before he brought it to the king thought proper upon this occasion to turn to for therein is contained a renewal of the covenant which Moses as mediator had made between God and the people of Israel at mount Horeb and therein are those threats and ter rible comminutions to the transgressors of the law whe ther prince or people which affected Josiah so much and which Moses had given to the Levites to put on the side of the covenant that it might be there for a witness against the transgressors of it Dent xxxi 25 26 Cal met s Commentary 6 t This is the only mention we have of this prophetess and certainly it makes much to her renown that she was order that out of what money was overplus he should cast cups and dishes and vials for ministration in the temple and besides that they should bring all the gold and silver which was among the treasures and should expend that in like manner in making cups and other vessels But as the high priest was bringing out the gold he found the holy books of Moses f that were laid up in the temple and when he had brought them out he gave them to Shaphan the scribe who when he had read them came to the king and in formed him that all was finished which he had ordered to be done He also read over the books to him who when he had heard them read rent his garment and called for Eliakim the high priest and for Shaphan the scribe and for certain other of his most par ticular friends and sent them to Huldah J the prophetess the wife of Shallum which Shallum was a man of dignity and of an emi nent family and bade them go to her and say that he desired she would appease God and endeavour to render him propitious to them for that there was cause to fear lest upon the transgression of the laws of Moses by their forefathers they should be in peril of going into captivity and of being cast out of their own country lest they should be in want of all things and so end their days miserably When the prophetess had heard this she bade the messengers go back to the king and say that God had already given sentence against them to destroy the people and cast them out of their country and de consulted upon this weighty occasion when both Jere miah and Zephaniah were at that time prophets in Judab But Zephaniah perhaps at that time might not have com menced a prophet because though we are told that he prophesied in the days of Josiah Zeph i 1 yet we are no where informed in what part of his reign he entered upon the prophetic office Jeremiah too might at that time be absent from Jerusalem at his house at Anathoth or some more remote part of the kingdom so that con sidering Josiah s haste and impatience there might be no other remedy at hand to apply to but this woman Great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us says the king to his ministers 2 Kings xxii 13 and therefore his intent in sending them might be to inquire whether there were any hopes of appeasing his wrath and in what manner it was to be done Being therefore well assured of this woman s fidelity in delivering the mind and counsel of God the ministers who went to inquire concluded rightly that it was much more considerable what mes sage God sent than by whose hand it was that he con veyed it Pool s

of their not having re Eented in so long a time while the prophets ad exhorted them to amend and had fore told the punishment that would ensue on their impious practices which threatening God would certainly execute upon them that they might be persuaded that he was God and had not deceived them in any re spect as to what he had denounced by the prophets that yet because Josiah was a righteous man he would at present delay those calamities but that after his death he would send on the multitude what miseries he had determined for them So the messengers upon this prophecy of the woman came and told it to the king Whereupon he sent to the people every where and ordered that the priests and Le vites should come together to Jerusalem and commanded that those of every age should be present And when they were gathered together he first read to them the holy books after which he stood upon a pulpit in the midst of the multitude and obliged them to make a covenant with an oath that they would worship God and keep the laws of Moses Accordingly they gave their assent willingly and undertook to do what the king had recommended So they immediately offered sacrifices after an ac ceptable manner and besought God to be gracious and merciful to them He also enjoined the high priest that if there re mained in the temple any vessels dedicated to idols or to foreign gods they should cast them out So when a great number of such vessels were got together he burnt them and scattered their ashes abroad and slew the priests of the idols that were not of the family of Aaron When he had done thus in Jerusalem he went into the country and utterly destroyed what buildings had been made therein by king Jeroboam in honour of strange gods and he burnt the bones of the false prophets upon that altar which Jeroboam first built t And as the prophet Jadon who came to Jeroboam when he was offering sacrifice and when all the people heard him fore told what would come to pass viz that a certain man of the house of David Josiah by name should do what is here mentioned And it happened that those predictions took effect after three hundred and sixty one years J After the9e things Josiah went to such other Israelites as had escaped captivity unT der the Assyrians and persuaded them to desist from their impious practices and to leave off the honours they paid to the strange gods but to worship rightly their own Almighty God and adhere to him He also searched the houses the villages and the cities out of a suspicion that somebody might have idols in private Nay indeed he took away the chariots of the sun that were set up in his royal palace which his predecessors had framed and what thing soever there was besides which they wor shipped as a god and when he had thus purged all the country he called the people to Jerusalem and there celebrated the feast of unleavened bread and that called the passover Â He also gave the people for paschal sacrifices thirty thousand young  That

were observed in the days of David and Solomon in the most happy and flourishing state of the Jewish monarchy and when the twelve tribes were met together to solemnize that feast It may not be amiss

to the laws of Moses while every priest explained the matter and ministered to the multitude And indeed there had been no other festival thus celebrated by the Hebrews from the time of Samuel the

Mendes which belonged to the kingdom of Josiah he brought an army to hinder him from passing through his country in his expedition against the Medes Now Necho sent a herald to Josiah and told him that he did not make this expedition against him but was making haste to Euphrates and desired that he would not provoke him to fight against him because he obstructed his march to the place whither he had resolved to go But Josiah did not admit of this ex cuse but put himself into a posture to hinder him from his intended march I suppose it was Sfate that pushed him on this conduct that it might take an occasion against him For as he was setting his troops in array and rode about in his chariot ff from one wing of his army to another one of the Egyptians shot an arrow at him and put an end to his eagerness of fighting for being sorely wounded he commanded a retreat to be sounded for his army and returned to Jerusalem and died of that wound and he was magnificently buried in the sepulchre of his fathers when he had lived thirty nine years and of them had reigned JJthirty one But all the people mourned greatly for him lamenting and grieving on his account many magnificence seen when we mean no more than that the thing we speak of was very splendid and magnifi cent unless we suppose with some that a preference is given to this passover above all the rest in respect of the exact observation of the rites and ceremonies belong ing to it which at other times were performed according to custom and several things either altered or omitted whereas at this every thing was performed

not fight at this time And indeed the prophet Jeremiah foretold every day how vainly they relied on their hopes from Egypt and how the city would foe overthrown by the king of Babylon and Jehoiakim the king would be subdued by him But what he thus spoke proved to be of no advantage to them because there were none that should escape For both the mul titude and the rulers when they heard him had no concern about what they heard but being displeased at what was said as if the prophet were a diviner against the kings they accused Jeremiah and bringing him before the court they required that a sen tence of punishment might be given against him Now all the rest gave their votes for his condemnation but the elders pru dently sent away the prophet from the court of the prison and persuaded the rest to do him no harm For they said he was not the only person who foretold what would come to the city but that Micah signified the same before him as well as many others none of whom suffered any thing of the kings that then reigned but were honoured as the pro phets of God So they appeased the multi tude with these words and delivered Jere miah from the punishment to which he was condemned f Now when this prophet had written all his prophecies and the people were fasting and assembled at the temple on the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim he read the book he composed containing his predictions of what was to befall the city the temple and the multitude And when the rulers heard of it they took the book from him and bade him and Barucb the scribe to go their ways lest they should be discovered by one or the other They then carried the book to the king who gave order in the presence of his friends that his scribe should read it but when he heard what it contained he was angry and tore it and cast it into the fire where it was consumed He also commanded they should seek for Jere miah and Baruch the scribe and bring them to him that they might be punished How ever they escaped his anger A little time afterward the king of Baby lon made an expedition against Jehoiakim who received him into the city and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of Jere miah as supposing he should suffer nothing that was terrible because he neither shut the gates nor fought against him Yet when he was come into the city he did not observe the covenants he had made but he slew such as were in the flower of their age and such as were of the greatest dignity together with their king Jehoiakim whom he com manded to be thrown before the walls with out any burial and made his son Jehoiachirj king of the country and of the city he also took the principal persons in dignity for cap tives three thousand in number and led them away to Babylon Among whom was the prophet Ezekiel who was then but young And this was the end of king Jehoiakim when he had lived thirty six years and reigned eleven J But he was succeeded in â â  â  â  The prophet s words upon this occasion

Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever Jer xxxv 18 19 To stand before a prince or to â ee his face in Scripture phrase denotes the honour which accrues from being in his service but the Recha bites were neither priests nor Levites Hitherto they had lived in the fields separate from towns and villages and were averse indeed to any employment either in church or state but from the time of their captivity for they were carried along with the two tribes we hnd them employed as singers and porters in the service of the temple To serve in this capacity there was no necessity for their being of the tribe of Levi the decla ration of the divine will by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah was in this case a sufficient vocation Colmei s Commentary on Jer xxv 19 B t

OF THE DEPOSITION OF JEHOIACHIN BY THE BABYLONIANS THE SUCCESSION OF ZEDEKIAH J AND IMPRISONMENT OF THE PROPHET JEREMIAH AFTER the king of Babylon had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin he re pented of what he had done fearing lest he might excite a revolt to revenge the death of his father He therefore sent an army and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem f But because he was of a gentle and just disposi tion J ne did not desire to see the city en dangered on his account but he took his mother and kindred and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of Babylon and accepted of their oaths that neither should they nor the city suffer any harm This agreement however was not observed for a single year for the king of Babylon gave orders to his generals to take all that were in the city captives both the youth and the handicraft men and bring them bound to him their number was ten thou sand eight hundred and thirty two as also Jehoiachin and his mother and friends And when these were brought to him he kept them in custody and appointed Jehoiachin s uncle Zedekiah to be king and made him take an oath that he would certainly keep the kingdom for him and make no innovation nor have any league of friendship with the Egyptians Now Zedekiah was twenty one years old when he took the government and had the same mother with his brother Jehoiakim but he was a despiser of justice and of his duty And those of the same age with him were wicked about him and the whole mul titude did what unjust and insolent things they pleased For this reason the prophet Jeremiah came often to him and insisted that he must leave off his impieties and trans gressions and take care of what was right and neither give ear to the rulers among whom were wicked men nor give credit to their false prophets who deluded them as if the king of Babylon would make no more war against them and as if the Egyptians would make war against him and conquer him since what they said was not true and the events would not prove such as they ex pected Now as to Zedekiah himself while he heard the prophet speak he believed him and agreed to every thing as true and supposed it was for his advantage But then his friends perverted him and dissuaded him from what the prophet advised and obliged him to do what they pleased Ezekiel also foretold in Babylon what calamities were  It is very probable that Nebuchadnezzar heard that he had entered into a confederacy with the king of Egypt as his successor did and therefore sent an army against him in the very beginning of his reign to lay siege to Jerusalem against which he intended to come himself but the Jews have a conceit that Nebuchadnezzar s counsellors represented to him how unadvisedly he acted in making him king whose father had been in rebellion against him and that upon their representation he re solved to depose him From an ill dog there never comes a good whelp was the proverb they say which the counsellors made use of on this occasion and to make this more feasible to the father and son they generally apply that passage in Ezekiel  She took another of her whelps and made him a young lion and he went up and down among the lions He became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devour men â Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces they spread their net over him and he was taken in their pit chap xix 6 c Calmet s and Patrick s Com mentaries B t 2 Kings xxiv 10 J Josephus s character of this Jehoiachin here seems contrary to that in 2 Kings xxiv 19 2 Chron xxxvi 9 and Jer xxii 28 And yet Josephus s account is con firmed by himself elsewhere Of the War IV 9 both which places agree that he was so mild and so disposed to spare his people that he gave up the city Jerusalem into the hands of the Babylonians upon their oath to do the people no harm without opposition which good will to his people he greatly celebrates in the place last quoted Perhaps Josephus chose to omit his idolatrous conduct in so short a reign and to celebrate this humane disposition only without any contradiction of his copy to ours Corn pure his character of Zedekiah at first with that a little after II The words in the text according to our translation areâ The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah c when he went with Zede kiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign And this Seraiah was a quiet prince Jer li 59 and from hence some Hebrew interpreters infer that Zedekiah went to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign to make his court and cultivate the good graces of his patron and paramount Nebuchadnezzar But this opinion though followed by several has no foundation in any other part of Scripture and the passage now before us may according to the original be very properly rendered in this wise â The word which Jeremiah commanded Seraiah when he went to Babylon upon an embassy from 368 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS coming upon the people which when he heard he sent accounts of them unto Jeru salem But Zedekiah did not believe their prophecies for the following reason It hap pened that the two prophets agreed with one another in what they said as to all other things that the city should be taken and Zedekiah himself should be taken captive But Ezekiel disagreed with him and said that Zedekiah should not see Babylon while Jeremiah said that the king of Babylon should carry him away thither in bonds And because they did not both say the same thing as to this circumstance he disbelieved what they both appeared to agree in and condemned them as not speaking truth therein although all the things predicted did come to pass according to their prophe cies as we shall shew upon a fitter oppor tunity Now when Zedekiah had preserved his league with the Babylonians for eight years f he broke it and revolted to the Egyptians in hopes by their assistance of overcoming the Babylonians When the king of Babylon knew this he made war against him laid his country waste and took his fortified towns and came to the city Jerusalem itself to be siege it But when the king of Egypt heard what circumstances Zedekiah his ally was in he took a great army with him and came into Judea as if he would raise the siege Upon which the king of Babylon departed from Jerusalem and met the Egyptians and joined battle with them and defeated them and when he had put them to flight he pur sued them and drove them out of all Syria Now as soon as the king of Babylon was de parted from Jerusalem the false prophets deceived Zedekiah and said that the king of Babylon would not make any more war Zedekiah The chief business of this embassy was to re quest of Nebuchadnezzar a restitution of the sacred ves sels of the temple which he had taken away when he carried Jehoiachin captive into Babylon Our translation however is not at all significant in this place when it styles this Seraiah a quiet prince The Septuagint has very properly rendered the words ap uv Supuv the prince of the presents which some apply to the pre sents which king Zedekiah made to the temple and others to the things they daily supplied for sacrifices but the most natural sense in this place is that he was charged with the presents and tribute which Zedekiah was obliged to send to Nebuchadnezzar that his business was to present them to the empep Â and imnn that occasion to against him or his people nor remove them out of their own country into Babylon and that those then in captivity would return with all those vessels of which the king of Baby lon had despoiled the temple But Jeremiah came among them and prophesied what con tradicted those predictions and what proved to be true that they did ill and deluded the king that the Egyptians would be of no advantage to them but that the king of Babylon would renew the war against Jeru salem and besiege it again and would de stroy the people by famine and carry away those that remain into captivity and would take away what they had as spoils and would carry off those riches that were in the temple Nay that besides this he would burn it and utterly overthrow the city and that they should serve him and his posterity seventy years That then the Persians and thfc Medes should put an end to their servitude and overthrow the Babylonians and that the Jews should be dismissed and return to their land Jrebuild the temple and restore Jeru salem When Jeremiah said this the greater part believed him but the rulers and those that were wicked despised him as one disordered in his senses Now he had resolved to go to his own country which was called Anatnoth and was twenty furlongs distant from Jeru salem But as he was going one of the rulers met him and seized upon him and accused him falsely as though he were going as a deserter to the Babylonians Jeremiah said that he accused him falsely and added that he was only going to his own country But the other would not believe him but seized upon him and led him away and accused him to the rulers under whom he endured all sorts of torments and was reserved to be solicit the restoration of the sacred vessels upon which account the Vulgate has rendered the words princeps prophetic the chief person in the embassy who at the time of nudience was to make a speech to the emperor in his prince s name Calmet s Commentary B  See Jeremiah xxxii 4 and Ezekiel xii 13 t An 591 X Josephus says here that Jeremiah prophesied not only of the return of the Jews from the Babylonian cap tivity and this under the Persians and Medes as in our other copies but of their rebuilding the temple and even the city Jerusalem which do not appear in our copies under his name AN 591 369 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS punished and this was the condition he was in for some time while he suffered unjustly what I have already described In the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah on the tenth day of the tenth month the king of Babylon made a second expedition against Jerusalem and lay before it eighteen months and besieged it with the utmost application There came upon them also two of the greatest calamities at the same time that Jerusalem was besieged a famine and pes tilential distemper and made great havock among them And though the prophet Jere miah was in prison he did not rest but pro claimed aloud and exhorted the multitude to open their gates and admit the king of Babylon for that if they did so they should be preserved and their whole families but if they did not do so they should be destroyed And he foretold that if any one staid in the city he should certainly perish by the fa mine or by the enemies sword but that if he would flee to the enemy he would escape death Yet did not these rulers that heard him believe him even when they were in the midst of their sore calamities but they came to the king and in their anger in formed him of what Jeremiah said and ac cused him and complained of the prophet as of a madman and one that disheartened their minds and by the denunciation of miseries weakened the alacrity of the mul titude who were otherwise ready to expose themselves to danger for him and for their country while he in a way of threatening warned them to flee to the enemy and told them that the city should certainly be taken and utterly destroyed  But for the king himself he was not at all irritated against Jeremiah such was his gentle and righteous disposition Yet that he might not be engaged in a quarrel with those rulers at such a time by opposing what they intended he let them do with the prophet whatsoever they would Where upon when the king had granted them such a permission they presently came into the prison and took him and let him down with a cord into a pit full of mire that he might be suffocated and die of himself So he stood up to the neck in the mire which was all about him and so continued But there was one of the king s servants who was in esteem with him an Ethiopian by descent who told the king what a state the prophet was in and said that his friends and his rulers had done evil in putting the prophet into the mire and by that means contriving against him that he should suffer a death more bitter than by his bonds only When the king heard this he repented of his having delivered up the prophet to the rulers and bade the Ethiopian take thirty men of the king s guards and cords with them and whatsoever else they understood to be necessary for the prophet s preserva tion and to draw him up immediately So the Ethiopian took the men he was ordered to take and drew up the prophet out of the mire and left him in the prison f But when the king had sent to call him privately and inquired what he could say to him from God which might be suitable to his present circumstances and desired him to inform him of it Jeremiah replied he had somewhat to say but that he should not be believed nor if he admonished him should he be hearkened to For said he thy friends have determined to destroy me as though I had been guilty of some wicked ness And where are now those men that deceived us and said that the king of Baby lon would not come and fight against us any more But I am afraid now to speak the truth lest thou shouldst condemn me to die And when the king had assured him upon oath that he would neither himself put him to death nor deliver him up to the rulers he became bold upon that assurance and gave him this advice that he should deliver the city up to the Babylonians and he said that it was God that prophesied this by him that he must do so if he would be preserved and escape out of the danger he was in and that then neither should the city fall to the ground nor should the temple be burned but if he disobeyed he would be the cause of these miseries coming upon the citizens and of the calamity that would be fall his whole house When the king heard this he said he would willingly do what he persuaded him to and what he declared  2 Kings xxv J t Jeremiah xxviii 13 370 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS would be to his advantage but that he was afraid of those of his own country that had fallen away to the Babylonians lest he should be accused by them to the king of Babylon and be punished But the prophet encouraged him and said he had no cause to fear such punishment for that he should not have the experience of any misfortune if he would deliver all up to the Babylonians neither himself nor his children nor his wives and that the temple should then con tinue unhurt So when Jeremiah had said this the king let him go and charged him to betray what they had resolved on to none of the citizens nor tell any of these matters to any of the rulers if they should have learned that he had been sent for and should inquire of him what it was that he was sent for and what he had said to him but to pretend to them that he besought him that he might not be kept in bonds and in prison And indeed he said so to them for they came to the prophet and asked him what advice it was that he came to give the king relating to them CHAP VIII OF THE REDUCTION OF JERUSALEM AND THE REMOVAL OF ZEDEKIAH AND HIS SUBJECTS TO BABYLON NOW the king of Babylon was very intent upon the siege of Jerusalem And he erected towers upon great banks of earth and from them repelled those that stood upon the walls He also made a great num ber of such banks round about the whole city whose height was equal to those walls However those that were within bore the siege with courage and patience For they were not dismayed either by the famine or by the pestilential distemper but were of cheerful minds in the prosecution of the war although those miseries within oppressed them also and they did not suffer them selves to be terrified neither by the con trivances of the enemy or by their engines of war but contrived still different engines to oppose them till there seemed to be an entire struggle between the Babylonians and the people of Jerusalem which had the greater sagacity and skill the former party supposing they should be thereby too hard for the other for the destruction of the city the latter placing their hopes of deliverance in persevering in such inventions in oppo sition to the other as might demonstrate the enemies engines were useless to them And this siege they endured for eighteen months until they were destroyed by the famine and by the darts which the enemy threw at them from the towers At length the city was taken on the ninth day of the fourth month in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah They were in deed only generals of the king of Babylon to whom Nebuchadnezzar committed the care of the siege for he abode himself in the city of Riblah The names of these generals who ravaged and subdued Jerusa lem if any one desire to know them were these Nergal Sharezer Samgar Nebo Rabsaris Sarsechim and Rabmag And when the city was taken about midnight and the enemy s generals were entered into the temple f and when Zedekiah was sen sible of it he took his wives his children his captains and his friends and fled out of the city through the fortified ditch and through the desert And when certain of the deserters had informed the Babylonians of this at break of day they pursued after Zedekiah and overtook him not far from Jericho and encompassed him about But for those friends and captains of Zedekiah  2 Kings xxv 2 3 t The temple was burnt from the time that it was built four hundred years says Sir John Marsham four hundred and twenty four years three months and eight days says Primate Usshur four hundred and thirty years says Abarbinel and other learned Jews but Jo sephus computes the thing still higher for he tells us that the temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years six months and ten days from the building of it one thousand and sixty years six months and ten days from the Israelites coming out of the land of Egypt one thou sand nine hundred and fifty years and six months and ten days from the deluge and three thousand five hundred and thirty years six months and ten days from the crea tion of the world Josephus stands amazed that the se cond temple should be burnt by the Romans in the same month and on the very same day of the month that this was set on fire by the Chaldeans and as some of the Jewish doctors say when the Levites were singing the same psalm in both destructions viz xciv 23 He shall bring upon them their own iniquity and he shall cot them off in their own wickedness yea the Lord out God shall cut them off Patrick s Commentary and Jewish Antiq lib X c 11 6 an 589 371 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS who had fled out of the city with him when they saw their enemies near them they left him and dispersed themselves some one way and some another every one en deavouring to save himself So the enemy took Zedekiah alive when he was deserted by all but a few with his children and his wives and brought him to the king When he was come Nebuchadnezzar began to call him a wicked wretch and a covenant breaker and one that had for gotten his former words when he promised to keep the country for him He also re Eroached him for his ingratitude that when e had received the kingdom from him who had taken it from Jehoiachin and given it him he made use of his power against him that gave it But said he God is great who hateth that conduct of thine and hath brought thee under us And when he had used these words to Zedekiah he com manded his sons and his friends to be slain while Zedekiah and the rest of the cap tains looked on He then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him and carried him to Babylon And these things hap pened as tJeremiah and Ezekiel had fore told to him that he should be caught and brought before the king of Babylon and should speak to him face to face and should see his eyes with his own eyes And thus far did Jeremiah prophesy He was also made blind and brought to Babylon but did not see it according to the prediction of Ezekiel We have said thus much because it is sufficient to shew the nature of God to such as are ignorant of it that it is various and acts many different ways and that all events happen after a regular manner in their pro per season and that it foretells what must come to pass It is also sufficient to shew the ignorance and incredulity of men whereby they are not permitted to foresee any thing that is future and are without any guard exposed to calamities so that it is impos sible for them to avoid the experience of those calamities After this manner have the kings of Da vid s race ended their lives being in number twenty one until the last king who alto gether reigned five hundred and fourteen years six months and ten days Of whom Saul who was the first king retained the government twenty years though he was not of the same tribe with the rest Now the king of Babylon sent Nebuzara dan the general of his army to Jerusalem to pillage the temple who had it also in command to burn it and the royal palace and to lay the city even with the ground and to transplant the people into Babylon Accordingly he came to Jerusalem in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah and pillaged the temple and carried out the vessels of God both gold and silver and particularly that large laver which Solomon dedicated as also the pillars of brass and their chapiters with the golden tables and the candlesticks And when he had carried these off he set fire to the temple in the fifth month the first day of the month in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah and in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar He also burnt the king s palace and overthrew the city j Now the temple was burnt four hundred ana seventy years six months and ten days after it was first built It was then one thousand sixty two years six months and ten days from the departure from Egypt and from the deluge to the destruction of the temple the whole interval was one thousand nine hundred fifty seven years six months and ten days but from the generation of Adam there were three thousand five hundred and thirteen years six months and ten days So great was the number of years hereto belonging And what actions were done during those years we have particularly related But the Babylonish general now overthrew the city to the very foundations and removed the people and took for prisoners the high priest Seraiah and Zephaniah the priest that was next to him and the rulers that guarded the temple who  Jeremiah xxxix 7 t This observation of Josephus s about the seeming disagreement of Jeremiah xxxii 4 xxxiv 3 and Eze kiel xii 13 but real agreement at last concerning the fate of Zedekiah is very true and very remarkable See chap 7 Nor is it at all unlikely that the courtiers and voL I â N0S 31  32 false prophets might make use of this seeming contradic tion to dissuade Zedekiah from believing either of those prophets as Josephus here intimates J The twelfth Hebrew and Septuagint II 2 Kings xxv 9 3R 372 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS were three in number and the eunuch who was over the armed men and seven friends of Zedekiah and his scribe and sixty other rulers all of whom together with the vessels which they had pillaged he carried to the king of Babylon to Riblah a city of Syria So the king commanded the heads of the high priest and of the rulers to be cut off there But he himself led all the captives and Zedekiah to Babylon He also led Jo sedek the high priest away bound He was the son of Seraiah the high priest whom the king of Babylon had slain in Riblah a city of Syria as we have just now related And now because we have enumerated the succession of the kings and who they were and how long they reigned I think it neces sary to set down the names of those who suc ceeded one another in the high priesthood under the kings The first high priest then at the temple which Solomon built was Zadok After whom his son Achimas re ceived that dignity After Achimas was Azarias His son was Joram and Joram s son was Isus After him was Axioramus His son was Phideas and Phideas s son was Sudeas and Sudeas s son was Juelus and Juelus s son was Jotham and Jotham s son was Urias and Urias s son was Nereias and Nereias s son was Odeas and his son was Sallumus and Sallurnus s son was Elicias and his son was Azarias and his son was Sareas and his son was Josedek who was carried captive to Babylon All these re ceived the high priesthood by succession the sons from their fathers When the king was come to Babylon he kept Zedekiah in prison until he died and then buried him magnificently He also de dicated the vessels he had pillaged out of the temple of Jerusalem to his gods and planted the people in the country of Babylon but freed the high priest from his bonds CHAP IX OF THE APPOINTMENT OF GEDALIAH AS GOVERNOR OF THE JEWS LEFT IN JUDEA J HIS ASSASSINATION BV ISHMAEL THE REMOVAL OF THE PEOPLE INTO EGYPT J AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT CAPTIVITV NOW the general of the army Nebuzara dan when he carried the people of the Jews into captivity left the poor and those that had deserted in the country and ap pointed for their governor one Gedaliah the son of Ahikam a person of a noble family and of a gentle and righteous disposition He commanded that they should cultivate the ground and pay an appointed tribute to the king He took Jeremiah the prophet out of prison and would have persuaded him to go along with him to Babylon for that he had been enjoined by the king to supply him with whatever he wanted and if he did not like to do so he desired him to inform him where he resolved to dwell that he might signify the same to the king But the prophet had no inclination to follow him nor to dwell any where else but expressed a wish to live in the ruins of his country and in the miserable remains of it When the general understood what his purpose was he enjoined Gedaliah whom he had left behind to take all possible care of him and to supply him with whatever he wanted So when he had given him rich presents he dismissed him f Accordingly Jeremiah abode in a city of that country which was called Mispah and desired of Nebuzaradan that he would set at liberty his disciple Baruch J the son of Neriah J  I have here inserted this high priest Azarias though he be omitted in all Josephus s copies out of the Jewish chronicle Seder Olam of how little authority soever I generally esteem such later Rabbinical historians be cause we know from Josephus himself that the number of the high priests belonging to this interval was eighteen Antiq XX 10 whereas his copies have here but seven teen And note that so many of these names are spelled differently from those that occur in our Bible 1 Chron vi 15 Ezra

genuineness of his book that stands now in our Apo crypha and that it is really a canonical book and an appendix to Jeremiah see Authentic Records part I page 1â 11 II Baruch the son of Neriah and grandson of Maase iah was of an illustrious birth and of the tribe of Judah Seraiah his brother had a considerable employment in the court of king Zedekiah but himself kept close to the person of Jeremiah and was his most faithful disciple though his adherence to his master drew upon him several persecutions and a great deal of bad treatment After the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar Baruch and his master were permitted to stay in the land of Ju dea but when the remains of the people which were left behind after having slain their governor Gedaliah were for retiring into Egypt they compelled Jeremiah and his an 586 378 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS one of a very eminent family and exceed ingly skilful in the language of his country When Nebuzaradan had done thus he made haste to Babylon But as to those that fled away during the siege of Jerusalem and had been scattered over the country when they heard that the Babylonians were gone away and had left a remnant in the land of Jerusalem and those such as were to culti vate the same they came together from all parts to Gedaliah to Mispah Now the ru lers that were over them were Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah and Seraiah and others beside them Now there was of the royal family one Ishmael a wicked man and very crafty who during the siege of Jerusalem fled to Baalis the king of the Ammonites and abode with him during that time And Gedaliah persuaded them now they were there to stay with him and have no fear of the Babylonians for that if they would cultivate the country they should suf fer no harm This he assured them of by oath and said that they should have him for their patron and that if any disturbance should arise they should find him ready to defend them He also advised them to dwell in any city as every one of them pleased and to send men along with his own servants and rebuild their houses upon the old founda tions and dwell there And he admonished them beforehand that they should make pre paration while the season lasted of corn and wine and oil to subsist during the winter When he had thus discoursed to them he dismissed them that every one might dwell in what part of the country he pleased When this report was spread abroad as far as the nations that bordered on Judea that Gedaliah kindly entertained those that came to him after they had fled away upon condition that they should pay tribute to the king of Babylon they also came readily to Gedaliah and inhabited the country And when Johanan and the rulers that were with him observed the country and the humanity of Gedaliah they were exceedingly in love with him and told him that Baalis the king of the Ammonites had sent Ishmael to kill him by treachery and secretly that he might have the dominion over the Israelites as being of the royal family and they said that he might deliver himself from his trea cherous design if he would give them leave to slay Ishmael and nobody should know it For they told him they were afraid that when he was killed by the other the entire ruin of the remaining strength of the Israel ites would ensue But he professed that he did not believe what they said when they told him of such a treacherous design in a man that had been well treated by him disciple to go along with them where the prophet died and Baruch soon after made his escape to his brethren in Babylon where according to the tradition of the Rab bins he likewise died in the twelfth year of his captivity But of what authority the book which goes under his name is or by whom it was written and whether any thing related therein be historically true or the whole of it a fiction is altogether uncertain Grotius in his Commentary upon it thinks it an entire fiction of some Hellenistical Jew under the name of Baruch And St Jerom long before him in the preface to his Exposition of Jeremiah tells us that the reason why he did not make a comment on this book though in the edition of the Septuagint it be joined with Jeremiah was because it was not deemed canonical among the Hebrews and con tains an epistle which falsely bears the name of Jeremiah This epistle is annexed to the book and in the common division of it makes the last chapter But the main sub ject of the book itself is likewise an epistle either sent or feigned to be sent by king Jehoiakim and the Jews who were in captivity with him in Babylon to their brethren the Jews who were still left in Judah and Jerusalem wherein they recommend to their prayers the emperor Nebuchadnezzar and his children that under his domi nion they may lead quiet and peaceable lives wherein they confess their sins and ask pardon for what is past take notice of the threats of the prophets which they had so long despised and acknowledge the righteousness of God in what he had brought upon them wherein they remind them of the advantage which the Jews had in their knowledge of the law of God and of true wisdom above all other nations and thereupon exhorted them to reform their manners and forsake their evil customs which would be the only means to bring about their deliverance from the captivity under which they groaned The whole is introduced with an historical preface wherein it is related that Baruch being then at Babylon did in the name of the captive king and his people draw up the same epistle and afterwards read it to them for their approbation and that together with it they sent a collection of money to the high priest at Jerusalem for the maintenance of the daily sacrifices This is the substance of the book itself and in the letter annexed to it which goes under Jere miah s name the vanity of the Babylonish idols and idol atry is set forth at large and with liveliness enough Of the whole there are but three copies one in Greek and the other two in Syriac whereof one agreeth with the Greek though the other very much differs from it but in what language it was originally written or whether one of these be not the original or which of them may be so it is next to impossible to tell Prideaux s Connection anno 595 and Calmet s Preface stir Baruch B 374 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS because it was not probable that one who under such a want of all things had failed of nothing that was necessary Tor him should be found so wicked and ungrateful towards his benefactor that when it would be an in stance of wickedness in him not to save him had he been treacherously assaulted by others to endeavour to kill him with his own hand That however if he ought to suppose this information to be true it was better for himself to be slain by the other than to destroy a man who fled to him for refuge and intrusted his own safety to him and committed himself to his disposal So Johanan and the rulers that were with him not being able to persuade Gedaliah went away But after an interval of thirty days Ishmael came again to Gedaliah to the city Mispah and ten men with him and when he had feasted Ishmael and those that were with him in a splendid manner at his table and had given them presents he be came disordered in drink while he endea voured to be merry with them And when Ishmael saw him in that case and that he was drowned in his cups to a degree of insensi bility and fallen asleep he rose up on a sudden with his ten friends and slew Geda liah and those that were with him at the feast And when he had slain them he went out by night and slew all the Jews that were in the city and those soldiers also that were left therein by the Babylonians But the next day eighty men came out of the country with presents to Gedaliah none of them knowing what had befallen him When Ishmael saw them he invited them in to Gedaliah and when they were come in he shut up the court and slew them and cast their dead bodies into a certain deep pit that they might not be seen But of these eighty men Ishmael spared those that in treated him not to kill them till they had delivered up to him what riches they had concealed in the fields consisting of their furniture garments and corn But he took captive the people that were in Mispah with their wives and children among whom were the daughters of king Zedekiah whomNebu zaradan the general of the army of Babylon had left with Gedaliah And when he had done this he came to the king of the Ammo nites But when Johanan and the rulers with him heard of what was done at Mispah by Ishmael and of the death of Gedaliah they had indignation at it and every one of them took his own armed men and came suddenly to fight with Ishmael and overtook him at the fountain of Hebron And when those that were carried away captives by Ishmael saw Johanan and the rulers they were very glad and looked upon them as coming to their assistance So they left him that had carried them captives and came over to Jo hanan Then Ishmael with eight men fled to the king of the Ammonites But Johanan took those whom he had rescued out of the hands of Ishmael and the eunuchs and their wives and children and came to a certain place called Mandra and there they abode that day for they had determined to remove from thence and to go into Egypt for fear lest the Babylonians should slay them in case they continued in the country and that out of danger at the slaughter of Gedaliah who had been set over it for governor While they were under this deliberation Johanan the son of Kareah and the rulers that were with him came to Jeremiah the grophet and desired that he would pray to od that because they were at an utter loss about what they ought to do he would dis cover it to them and they sware that they would do whatever Jeremiah should say to them And the prophet said he would be their intercessor with God it came to pass that after ten days God appeared to him and said he should inform Johanan and the other rulers and all the people that he would be with them while they continued in that country and take care of them and keep them from being hurt by the Babylonians of whom they were afraid but that he would desert them if they went into Egypt and out of his wrath against them would inflict the same punishments upon them which they knew their brethren had already endured So when the prophet had informed Johanan and the people that God foretold these things he was not believed when he said that God commanded them to continue in that country but they imagined that he said so to gratify Baruch his own disciple and belied God that he persuaded them to stay there that they might be destroyed by the an 587 375 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Babylonians Accordingly both the people and Johanan disobeyed the counsel of God which he gave them by the prophet and re moved into Egypt and carried Jeremiah and Baruch along with them While they were there God signified to the prophet that the king of Babylon was about making an expedition against the Egyptians and commanded him to foretell to the people that Egypt should be taken and that the king of Babylon should slay some of them and should take others cap tive and bring them to Babylon which things came to pass accordingly For on the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem which was the twenty third of the reign of Nebu chadnezzar he made an expedition against Coele Syria and when he had possessed himself of it he made war against the Am monites and Moabites and when he had brought all those nations under subjection he fell upon Egypt in order to overthrow it And he slew the fking that then reigned and set up another and took those Jews that were there captives and Jled them away to Babylon And such was the end of the na tion of the Hebrews it having twice gone beyond Euphrates For the people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria by the Assyrians in the days of king Hoshea After which the people of the two tribes that remained after Jerusalem was taken were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and Chaldea Now as to Shalma  Jeremiah xliii 6 t Herodotus says this king of Egypt Pharaoh Hophra or Apries was slain by the Egyptians as Jeremiah fore told his slaughter by his enemies xliv 29 30 and that as a sign of the destruction of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar Josephus says this king was slain by Nebuchadnezzar himself Which assertion is supposed by Dr Hudson to contradict Herodotus If it do the question will remain whether Herodotus or Josephus had the more authentic accounts of Egypt at that time Nor is such a question easily decided for want of some more authentic and ori ginal monuments of that country J Of this real captivity of the Jews in Egypt to

the royal family and of the nobility of the land made eunuchs and slaves in the palace of the king of Babylon the vessels of the temple carried thither the king made a tributary and the whole land now brought into vassalage under the Babylonians from hence we mast reckon the beginning of the seventy years captivity neser he removed the Israelites out of their country and placed therein the nation of the Cutheans who had formerly belonged to the interior of Persia and Media but were then called Samaritans by taking the name of the country to which they were removed But the king of Babylon who brought out the two tribes Â placed no other nation in their country By which means all Judea and Jerusalem and the temple continued to be a desert for seventy years But the entire interval of time which passed from the cap tivity of the Israelites to the carrying away of the two tribes proved to be a hundred and thirty years six months and ten days CHAP X CONCERNING DANIEL AND WHAT BEFELL HIM AT BABYLON NEBUCHADNEZZAR king of Babylon took some of the most noble of the Jews that were children and the kinsmen of Zedekiah their king such as were remark able for the beauty of their bodies and the comeliness of their countenances and de livered them into the hands of tutors and to the improvement to be made by them He also made some of them to be eunuchs which course he took also with other nations whom he had taken in the flower of their age and afforded them their diet from his own table and had them instructed in the institutes of the country and taught the learning of the foretold by the prophet Jeremiah chap xxv 11 and xxix 10 and in the fourth year of Jehoiakim must be the first year in that computation Prideavx s Connection an 606 B Â We see here that Judea was left in a manner deso late after the captivity of the two tribes and was not re peopled with foreign colonies perhaps as an indica tion of Providence that the Jews were to re people it without opposition themselves I esteem the latter and present desolate condition of the same country without being re peopled by foreign colonies to be a like indica tion that the same Jews are hereafter to re people it again at their long expected restoration  That Daniel was made one of those eunuchs of whom Isaiah prophesied xxxix 7 and the three children his companions also seems to me plain both here and in our copies of Daniel i 3 6 7 â 11 18 Although it must be granted that some married persons that had children were sometimes called eunuchs in a general acceptation for courtiers on account that so many of the ancient courtiers were real eunuchs See Gen xxxix 1 with Antiq 6 X 8 9 and 10 376 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Chaldeans and they exercised themselves in that wisdom which he had ordered they should apply themselves to Now among these were four of the family of Zedekiah of most excellent dispositions the one of whom was called Daniel another was called Ana nias another Misael and the fourth Azarias And the king of Babylon changed their names and commanded that they should make use of other names Daniel he called Baltasar Ananias Shadrach Misael Me shach and Azarias Abednego f These the king had in esteem and continued to love on account of their excellent temper their application to learning and the progress they had made in wisdom Now Daniel and his kinsmen had resolved to use a severe diet and to abstain from those kinds of food which came from the king s table and entirely to forbear to eat of all living creatures So he came to Ashpenaz who was that eunuch to whom the care of them was committed J and desired him to take and spend what was brought for them from the king but to give them pulse and dates for their food and any thing else be sides the flesh of living creatures that he pleased for that their inclinations were to that sort of food and that they disliked the other He replied that he was ready to serve them in what they desired but he suspected that they would be discovered by the king from their meagre bodies and the alteration of their countenances because it could not be avoided but their bodies and complexions must be changed with their diet especially while they would be clearly dis covered by the finer appearance of the other children who would tare better and thus they should bring him into danger and occa sion him to be punished However they persuaded Arioch to give them what they desired for ten days by way of trial and in case their habits of bodies were not altered to go on in the same way as expecting that they should not be hurt thereby afterwards but that if he saw them look worse than the rest he should reduce them to their former diet Now it appeared that they were so far from becoming worse by the use of this food that they grew plumper and fuller in body than the rest insomuch that he thought those who fed upon what came from the king s table seemed less plump and full while those that were with Daniel looked as if they had lived in plenty and in all sorts of luxury Arioch therefore from that time securely took himself what the king sent every day from his supper according to custom to the children but gave them the aforementioned diet while they had their souls in some measure more pure and less burdened and s o fitter for learning and had their bodies better adapted for labour For they neither had the former oppressed and heavy with variety of meats nor were the other effemi nate on the same account So they readily understood all the learning that was among  It was a usual thing for conquerors to change the names of the persons they vanquished in war in testi mony of their absolute power over them Thus we find the king of Babylon changing the name of Mattaniah into Zedekiah when he constituted him king of Judah 2 Kings xxiv 17 But our learned Usher has farther re marked that the king of Egypt gave Eliakim the name of Jehoiakim thereby to testify that he ascribed his victory over the Babylonians to Jehovah the God of Israel by whose excitation as he pretended 2Chron xxxv 21 22 he undertook the expedition Patrick s and Cahners Commentary B t It is very remarkable that as all their former names related to the true God so all the names which on this occasion were imposed upon these four Jewish youths had some reference or other to Babylonish idols Daniel in Hebrew signifies God is my judge Belteshazzar in Chaldee is the treasure of Baal Hananiah in Hebrew is well pleasing to God Shadrach in Chaldee the in spiration of the sun Mishael in Hebrew proceeding fro n God Meshach in Chaldee belonging to the god dess Sheshach Azariah in Hebrew God is my help and Abednego in Chaldee the servant of Nego i e the sun or the morning star both deities among the Babylo nians and so called because of their brightness Colmef s Commentary on Dan i 7 B  What we render master of the eunuchs may very likely signify the chief minister of Nebuchadnezzar s court Such officers in the palaces of eastern princes were usually called eunuchs because they who had the control of the king s household as we say were ordi narily such though many times it might be otherwise The Jews have a notion that Daniel and his three com panions were by the order of Nebuchadnezzar made eunuchs that the prophecy of Isaiah might be fulfilled â Thy sons that shall issue from thee shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon chap xxxix 7 Buf that is no conclusive reason because in that prophecy as well as in the pas sage we are now upon the name of eunuch might mean no more than any person who had an employment at court Calmefs Commentary B II Daniel i 15 an 587 377 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS the Hebrews and among the Chaldeans As especially did Daniel who being already sufficiently skilful in wisdom was very busy about the interpretation of dreams And God manifested himself to him Two years after the destruction of Egypt king Nebuchadnezzar saw a wonderful dream the accomplishment of which God shewed him in his sleep But when he arose out of his bed he forgot the accomplishment So he sent for the Chaldeans magicians and prophets and told them he had seen a dream and informed them that he had forgotten the accomplishment of what he had seen and he enjoined them to tell him both what the dream was and what was its signification They replied that this was a thing impos sible to be discovered by men but they pro mised that if he would explain to them what dream he had seen they would tell him its signification Hereupon he threatened to put them to death unless they told him his dream and he gave command accordingly since they confessed they could not do what they were commanded Now when Daniel heard that the king had given a command that all the wise men should be put to death and that among them himself and his three kinsmen were in danger he went to Arioch who was captain of the king s guards and desired to know the reason why the king had given command that all the wise men Chal deans and magicians should be slain So when he had learned that the king had had a dream and had forgotten it and that when they were enjoined to inform the king of it they had said they could not do it and had thereby provoked him to anger he desired  Some are of opinion that Nebuchadnezzar s dream and the interpretation thereof were both revealed to Daniel while he was asleep but others rather think that it was in a vision while he was awake because the prayer and thanksgiving which he made to God seem to insinuate that he was awake though we cannot see why he might not receive the revelation in his sleep and return God thanks for it as soon as he awoke Calmefs Commentary B t The prophet Daniel makes mention of these sort of people and ranks them under theÂ e four different kinds The Chartumim the Asaphim the Mecasphim and the Chasdim chap ii 2 Chartumim according to the Septu agint signifies sophists but according to St Jerom divi ners fortune tellers casters of nativity c Asaphim has no derivation from the Chaldee tongue but no small resemblance to the Greek word sophos whether the Greeks took this word from the Babylonians or the of Arioch that he would go in to the king and desire respite for the magicians for one night and to put off their slaughter so long for that he hoped in that time to obtain by prayer to God the knowledge of the dream Accordingly Arioch informed the king of what Daniel desired So the king bade them delay the slaughter of the magicians till he knew what Daniel s promise would come to The young man then retired to his own house with his kinsmen and besought God that whole night to discover the dream and thereby deliver the magicians and Chaldeans with whom they were themselves to perish from the king s anger by enabling him to declare his vision and to make manifest what the king had seen the night before in his sleep but had forgotten it Accordingly God out of pity to those that were in danger and out of regard to the wisdom of Daniel made known to him the dream and its interpreta tion so that the king might understand by him its signification also When Daniel had obtained this knowledge from God he arose joyfully and told it his brethren and made them to hope that they should now preserve their lives of which they despaired before and had their minds full of nothing but the thoughts of dying So when he had with them returned thanks to God who had commise rated their youth he came to Arioch and desired him to bring him to the king because he would discover to him that dream which he had seen the night before When Daniel was come in to the king he excused himself first that he did not pretend to be wiser than the other Chaldeans and magicians t when upon their entire inability Babylonians from them and therefore the Septuagint has rendered it by philosophers Mecasphim is thought by some to be necromancers such as pretend to raise the dead to gain intelligence of things future but the Sep tuagint has rendered it by a word that denotes such en chanters as made use of noxious herbs and drugs the blood of victims and the bones of the dead for their su perstitious operations The other word Chasdim is the same with Chaldeans and here signifies a sort of philoso phers among the Babylonians who dwelt in a separate part of the city and were exempt from all employments Their study was natural philosophy astrology divination or the foretelling of future events by the observation of the stars the interpretation of dreams the science of auguries the worship of their gods c as Diodorus Si culus lib 1 gives us an account of them Calmest Dictionary under the word Magicians B 378 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to discover his dream he was undertaking to inform him of it For this was not by his own skill or on account of his having better cultivated his undertaking than the rest But said he God hath had pity upon us when we were in danger of death and when I prayed for the life of myself and of those of my own nation he hath manifested to me both the dream and the interpretation thereof For I was not less concerned for thy glory than for the sorrow that we were by thee condemned to die while thou didst so un justly command men both good and excellent in themselves to be put to death when thou enjoined them to do what was entirely above the reach of wisdom and required of them what was only the work of God Wherefore as thou in thy sleep was solicitous concerning those that should succeed thee in the govern ment of the whole world God was desirous to shew thee all those that should reign after thee and to that end exhibited to thee the following dream â Thou seemedst to see a great image standing before thee the head of which was of gold the shoulders and arms of silver the belly and the thighs of brass but the legs and the feet of iron Thou then sawest a stone broken off from a moun tain which fell upon the image and threw it down and brake it to pieces and did not permit any part of it to remain whole but the gold the silver the iron and the brass became smaller than meal which upon the blast of a violent wind was forcibly carried away and scattered abroad but the stone increased to such a degree that the whole earth beneath it seemed to be filled there with This is the dream which thou sawest and its interpretation is as follows â The head of gold denotes thee and the kings of Babylon that have been before thee But the two hands and arms signify that thy go vernment shall be dissolved by two kings But another king that shall come from the west armed with brass shall destroy that government And another government that shall be like unto iron shall put an end to the power of the former and shall have dominion over all the earth on account of the nature of iron which is stronger than that of gold of silver and brass Daniel also declared the meaning of fthe stone to the king but I do not think it proper to relate it since I have only undertaken to describe things past or things present but not the things that are future Yet if any one be so desirous of knowing truth as not to wave such points of curiosity and cannot curb his inclination for understanding the uncertainties of futurity and whether they will happen or not let him diligently read the book of Daniel which he will find among the sacred writings  By these different emblems of metals and stone God intended to signify to Nebuchadnezzar the several em pires that were to be in the world The Assyrian or Chaldean is represented by gold because it was the first and the most magnificent if not the most extensive and Nebuchadnezzar being then upon the throne is said to be head of it That of silver is the Persian founded by Cyrus upon the ruins of the Chaldean but inferior to the Chaldean in its duration at least if not in its extent That of brass is the Grecian founded by Alexander upon the ruins of the Persian and its character is that it should bear rule over all the earth Daniel ii 39 which was verified in its great founder for upon his return from India to Babylon the ambassadors of almost all the known parts of the world resorted thither to pay their homage and acknowledgment of his dominion That of iron is the Roman empire which is extinguished by its breaking in pieces and subduing all things verse 40 For whilst it was in its full strength and vigour under its consuls and first emperors it brought under its dominion all the king doms and states that were then subsisting in Europe Africa and a great part of Asia but from that time it became a mixture of iron and clay Its emperors proved most of them vicious and corrupt either by their tyranny making themselves hateful to their subjects or by their follies and vices contemptible Lastly that of the stone out of the mountain is the fifth monarchy or the kingdom of the Messiah s which against all the power and policy of the Roman empire prevailed not by an external force but by the powerful preaching of the gospel to the sup pression and defeat of wickedness and impiety idolatry and superstition and it shall stand for ever and never be destroyed Daniel ii 44 which can be said of no other kingdom but that of Jesus Christ which for these seven teen hundred years and upwards has withstood the vio lence of persecutions and all other contrivances formed against it and has the sure promises of its Almighty Founder on its side that the gates of hell should not pre vail against it Matt xvi 18 Calmefs Commentary B t This is a most remarkable passage in Josephus con cerning the stone cut out of the mountain and destroying the image which he intimated to be a prophecy of futurity and probably not safe for him to exclaim as belonging to the destruction of the Roman empire by Jesus Christ the true Messiah of the Jews Take here also the words of Havercamp The place referred to by Josephus says he is  chap 10 Nor is this to be wondered at that he would not meddle with things future For he had no mind to provoke the Romans by speaking of the destruction of the city which they called the eternal city Note v on X 11 an 570 379 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When Nebuchadnezzar heard this and recollected his dream he was astonished at the nature of Daniel and fell upon his face and saluted Daniel in the manner that men worship God and gave command that he should be sacrificed to as a god He also imposed the name of his own god Baltasar upon him and made him and his kinsmen rulers of the whole kingdom These kins men however happened to fall into danger by the envy and malice of their enemies for they offended the king upon the following occasion The king made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits and set it in the great plain of Babylon and when he was going to dedi cate the image he invited all the principal men that were under his dominion and com manded that when they should hear the sound of the trumpet they should then fall down and worship the image and he threat ened that those who did not do so should be cast into a fiery furnace J When therefore all the rest upon hearing the sound of the  Nebuchadnezzar seems in a sudden transport to have looked upon Daniel as having something more than human in him just as the barbarians thought of St Paul Acts xxviii 6 and therefore it is said that he fell on his face and worshipped him because the doing of reve rence by way of prostration is not only an act of worship paid to God but frequently given to kings and great men in the Old Testament according to the custom of eastern countries 2 Sam ix 6 and sometimes even to prophets on account of the sanctity of their office 1 Kings xviii 7 nor was it usually refused by them except such circumstances were added to it as made it look like divine worship and then it was always rejected as in the case of St Peter Acts x 26 Lowtk s Commentary on Daniel ii 43 B t Grotius is of opinion that the image which Nebuchad nezzar set up was the figure of his father Nebopolassar whom by this means he intended to deify but others think that it was his own statue which he erected to gain the adorations of his people in this form We can not however in what we find Nebuchadnezzar saying to Daniel s friends perceive that he any where upbraids them with contempt offered to his person or his statue bat only that they would not serve his gods nor worship the image which he had set up Daniel iii 14 And therefore others have imagined that this was neither his own nor his father s statue but that of Jupiter which was afterward found in the temple of Belus when Xerxes plundered it of its immense riches among which were several images of massy gold but one more especially fifty feet high which might be the same that Nebuchadnezzar consecrated in the plains of Dura For though that is said to have been sixty cubits i e ninety feet high yet we may suppose that it stood upon a pedestal of forty feet high and so the image and the pedestal together might make ninety vide vol i page 310 in the notes other VOL I â NOS 31  32 trumpet worshipped the image Daniel s kitismen did not do it because they would not transgress the laws of their country So these men were convicted and cast imme diately into the fire but were saved by Divine Providence and after a surprising manner escaped death for the fire did not touch them And I suppose it touched them not as if it reasoned with itself that they were cast into it without any fault of theirs and that therefore it was too weak to burn the young men when they were in it This was done by the power of God who made their bodies so far superior to the fire that it could not consume them This it was which recom mended them to the king as righteous men and men beloved of God on which account they continued in great esteem with him A little after this the king saw in his sleep another vision intimating that he should fall from his dominion and feed among the wild beasts and that when he had lived in this manner in the desert for seven years Â he should recover his dominion again When wise there would be no proportion between its height and its breadth according to the description we have of it in Daniel iii 1 Prideaux s Connection anno 573 B J This kind of punishment was pretty common in these parts of the world so that some will have it that Abra ham before he departed from Chaldea was made to undergo it but escaped by a miraculous preservation founding their opinion on Gen xi 31 Of this furnace in particular it is related that the king s servants having re ceived the command to heat it seven times hotter ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin pitch tow and small wood so that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits and passed through and burnt the Chaldeans it found about the furnace The Song of the Three Holy

still persisted in his crimes as soon as the measure of his iniquity was full he smote and re duced him to the condition of a beast This is Theodoret s notion of the matter but St Jerome rather thinks that this king being terrified with the threats and touched with the exhortations of the prophet began to set about his re formation and by acts of charity and mercy to reconcile himself to God for which he obtained a delay of his punishment for a year s space but that instead of perse vering in these good purposes he suffered himself to fall into pride upon the contemplation of the mighty works he had done and so by his vanity lost what he had gained by his charity Bonum misericordiae perdidit malo superbiae Calmet t Commentary B Â Since Josephus here explains the seven prophetic times which were to pass over Nebuchadnezzar Daniel iv 16 to be seven years we thence learn how he most 3S  380 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he had seen this dream he called the magi cians together again and inquired of them about it desiring them to tell him what it sig nified But when none of them could find out the meaning of the dream nor discover it to the king Daniel was the only person that explained it And as he foretold so it came to pass For after he had continued in the wilderness the aforementioned interval of time while no one durst attempt to seize his kingdom during those seven years he prayed to God that he might recover his throne and be returned to it But let no one blame me for writing down every thing of this nature as I find it in our ancient books For as to that matter I have plainly assured those that think me defective in any such point that I intended to do no more than translate the Hebrew books into the Greek language and promised to explain those facts without adding any thing to them of my own or taking any thing away from them CHAP XI OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR AND HIS SUCCESSORS THE DISSO LUTION OF THEIR GOVERNMENT BY THE PERSIANS THE AFFAIRS OF DANIEL AND THE PROPHECIES HE DE LIVERED IN MEDIA OW when king Nebuchadnezzar had reigned forty three years he ended N his life f He was an active man and more fortunate than the kings were before him Berosus makes mention of his actions in the third book of his Chaldaic history where he says When his father Nabuchodonosor Nabopollassar heard that the governor whom he had set over Egypt and the places about Coele Syria and Phoenicia had re volted from him while he was not himself able any longer to undergo the hardships of War he committed to his son Nebuchad nezzar who was still but a youth some parts of his army and sent him against them So when Nebuchadnezzar had given battle and fought with the rebel he defeated him and reduced the country under subjection and made it a branch of his own kingdom But about that time it happened that his father fell ill and ended his life in the city Babylon when he had reigned twenty one years J And when he was made sensible that his father was dead he settled the af fairs of Egypt and other countries as also those that concerned the captive Jews Phoe nicians Syrians and those of the Egyptian nations and having committed the convey ance of them to Babylon to certain of his friends together with the body of his army and the rest of their ammunition and pro visions he went himself hastily accompa probably must have understood those other parallel phrnses of a time times and a half VII 25 and XII 9 of so many prophetic years also Though he lets us know by his hint at the interpretation of the seventy weeks as belonging to the fourth monarchy and the de struction of Jerusalem by the Romans in the days of Josephus chap 2 that he did not think those years to be bare years but rather days for years by which reckoning and by which alone could seventy weeks or four hundred and ninety days reach to the age of Jose phus But as to the truth of those seven years banish ment of Nebuchadnezzar from men and his living so long among the beasts the very small remains we have any where else of this Nebuchadnezzar prevent our expecta tion of any other full account of it So far we know by Ptolemy s Canon a contemporary record as well as by Josephus s presently that he reigned in all forty three years that is eight years after we meet with any ac count of his actions One of the last of which was the thirteen years siege of Tyre XI 11 where yet the old Latin has three years and ten months Yet were his actions before so remarkable both in sacred and profane authors that such a vacuity of eight years at the least at the latter end of his reign must be allowed to agree very well with Daniel s accounts that after a brfctal life of seven years duration he might return to his reason and to the exercise of his royal authority for one whole year at least before his death  These forty three years for the duration of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar are as I have just observed the same number as that in Ptolemy s Canon Moses Chorenensie also confirms this captivity of the Jews under Nebuchad nezzar and adds what is very remarkable that one of those Jews that were carried by him into captivity got away into Armenia and raised the great family of the Bagratidae there See page 1 58 91 98 100 109 123 124 136 180 184 t This prince died in the year of the world 3442 and before Christ 562 after he had reigned from the death of his father according to the Babylonish account three and forty years He was certainly one of the greatest princes that had appeared in the east for many ages be fore him and according to Megasthenes as he is cited by Josephus Antiq lib X c 11 both for his enterprises and performances far excelled even Hercules himself The same historian as he is quoted by Eusebius Prep lib IX c 41 informs us that a little before his death he foretold his subjects of the coming of the Persians and their subduing the kingdom of Babylon but this he might gather from the prophet Daniel and especially from the interpretation of his dreams Prideavx s Con nection anno 562 B J These twenty one years here ascribed to Nabopol lassar the father of the great Nebuchadnezzar are the same with those given him in Ptolemy s Canon And note here that what Dr Prideaux says Connection at AN 381 562 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS nied with a few others over the desert and came to Babylon So he took upon him the management of the public affairs and of the kingdom which had been kept for him by one that was the principal of the Chaldeans and he received the entire dominions of his father and appointed that when the cap tives came they should be placed as colo nies in the most proper parts of Babylonia He then adorned the temple of Belus and the rest of the temples in a magnificent manner with the spoils he had taken in the war He also added another city to that which was there of old and rebuilt it that such as would besiege it hereafter might no more turn the course of the river and thereby attack the city itself He therefore built three walls round about the inner city and three others about that which was the outer and this he did with burnt brick And after he had walled the city and adorned its gates he built another palace before his father s palace but so that they joined to it to describe whose vast height and immense riches it would perhaps be too much for me to attempt Yet as large and lofty as they were they were completed in fifteen days He also erected elevated places for walking of stone and made it resemble mountains and built it so that it might be planted with all sorts of trees He also erected what was called a pensile paradise because his wife was desirous to have things like her own country she hav ing been bred up in the palaces of Media Megasthenes also in his fourth book of his the year 6IS that Nebuchadnezzar must have been a common name of other kings of Babylon besides the great Nebuchadnezzar himself is a groundless mistake of some modem chronologers only and destitute of all proper original authority  These fifteen days for finishing such vast buildings at Babylon in Josephus s copy of Berosus would seem too absurd to be supposed to be the true number were it not for the same testimony extant also in the first book against Apion with the same number It thence indeed uppears that Josephus s copy of Berosus had this sm ill number but that it is the true number I Still doubt Josephus assures us that the walls of so much a smaller city as Jerusalem were two years and four months in building by Nehemiah who yet hastened the work all he could XI 5 I should think one hun dred and fifteen days or a year and twenty days much more proportionable to so great a work t Two ye irs  Four years Accounts of India makes mention of these things and thereby endeavours to shew that this king Nebuchadnezzar exceeded Her cules in fortitude and in the greatness of his actions For he saith that he conquered great part of Libya and Iberia Diocles also in the second book of the Accounts of Persia mentions this king As does Philos tratus in his accounts both of India and of Phoenicia say that this king besieged Tyre thirteen years while at the same time Ethbaal reigned at Tyre These are all the histories that I have met with concerning this king After the death of Nebuchadnezzar Evil Merodach his son succeeded in the kingdom who immediately set Jechoniah at liberty and esteemed him among his most intimate friends He also gave him many presents and made him honourable above the rest of the kings that were in Babylon For his father had not kept his faith with Jechoniah when he voluntarily delivered up himself to him with his wives and children and his whole kindred for the sake of his country that it might not be taken by siege and ut terly destroyed as we said before When Evil Merodach was dead after a reign of teighteen years Niglissar his son took the government and retained it Jforty years and then ended his life And after him the succession in the kingdom came to his son Labosordacus who continued in it in all but nine months and when he was dead it came to Baltasar who by the Babylonians was called Naboandelus Against him did II It is here remarkable that Josephus without the knowledge of Ptolemy s Canon should call the same king whom he himself here Baruch i 11 and Daniel v 1 2 9 12 22 29 30 styles Baltasar or Belshazzar from the Babylonian god Bel Naboandelus also and in another place from the same citation out of Berosus Nabonnedon from the Babylonian god Nabo or Nebo This last is not remote from the original Babylonian pronunciation in Ptolemy s Canon Nabonadius For both the place of this king in that Canon as the last of the Assyrian or Babylonian kings and the number of years of his reign seventeen the same in both demonstrate that it is one and the same king that is meant by them all It is also worth noting that Josephus knew that Darius the part ner of Cyrus was the son of Astyages and was called by another name among the Greeks though it does not appear he knew what that name was as having never seen the best history of this period which is Xenophon i Kujs buiSsm But then what Josephus s present copies say presently that it was only within no long time 3S2 382 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Cyrus king of Persia and Darius king of Media make war And when he was be sieged in Babylon there happened a won derful and prodigious vision He set down at supper in a large room and there were a great many vessels of silver such as were made for royal entertainments and he had with him his concubines and his friends Whereupon he commanded that those ves sels of gold which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of Jerusalem and had not made use of but had put them into his own temple should be brought out of that temple He also grew so haughty as to proceed to use them in the midst of his cups drinking out of them and blaspheming against God In the mean time he saw a hand proceed out of the wall and writing certain syllables At this sight he was disturbed and called the magicians and Chaldeans together and all that sort of men that were among these harbarians and were able to interpret sign and dreams that they might explain the writing to him f But when the magicians said they could discover nothing nor did understand it the king was in great disor der of mind and under great trouble at this surprising accident J So he caused it to be proclaimed through all the country and promised that to him who could explain the writing and give the signification thereof he would give a golden chain for his neck and permission to wear a purple garment as did the kings of Chaldea and would bestow on him the third part of his own dominions When the proclamation was made the ma gicians ran together more earnestly and were very ambitious to find out the import of the writing but still hesitated about it as much as before Now when the king s grandmother saw him cast down at this accident she began to encourage him and after the hand writing on the wall that Baltasar was slain does not so well agree with our copies of Da niel which say it was the same night Daniel v 30 But then it must be observed that Theodoret directly Snotes Josephus for the confirmation of our copies of â aniel and particularly for affirming that he was slain the same night also Whose testimony is here set down at large by Dr Hudson  Daniel v 5 t The writing very probably might be in a character unknown to the Chaldeans as the old Hebrew Phoeni cian and Samaritan were or if they were acquainted with the character yet such is the genius of most of the oriental languages where so little use is made of vowels and where the pronunciation and sequel of the discourse generally determine the signification of the letters that a man may be a perfect master of a language and yet not able to read and comprehend a word when it stands alone and without any context as it is in the case of Mene Tekel Upharsin A man for instance that un derstands the Hebrew tongue ever so well were he to meet dbr standing alone would have much ado to read them because according to the manner that we pro nounce them the letters will admit of many different significations and it is much the same in the Chaldee language wherein the words we are now speaking of were wrote Calmet s Commentary on Daniel v 7 B J The king s words are these â Whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom Daniel v 7 From whence it appears that the kings of Babylon wore the same ornaments and in rewarding their favourites gave the same marks of honour that the kings of Persia and their successors did For purple we find in several Greek authors was the ordinary habits of the kings of Persia and of the princes of their court that were in the highest posts of honour The chain or collar of gold was one of the greatest marks of distinction that the Persian kings could bestow upon their subjects and to be the third ruler of the kingdom was the same sub lime office that Darius the Mede put Daniel in chap vi 1 2 when he constituted him one of the presidents over the hundred and twenty princes that he had made go vernors over provinces Xenophon s Cyropadia lib viii Diodorus lib xviii Josephui s Antiquities lib xi c 6 Brisson De Regno Persar lib i B  This grandmother or mother of Baltasar the queen dowager of Babylon for she is distinguished from his queen Daniel v 10 23 seems to have been the famous Nitocris who fortified Babylon against the Medes and Persians and in all probability governed it under Bal tasar who seems to have been a weak and effeminate prince Whether Baltasar were the son or grandson of the great Nebuchadnezzar will be best understood by the following passage out of some observations 1 formerly made when I carefully read over Mr Hutchinson s ex cellent edition of Xenophon s KuÂ TXtuSem as follows Xenophon who made his Persian expedition not till one hundred and twenty eight years after the death of Cyrus and never seems to have been at Babylon nor ever names any king of Babylon as perhaps not knowing their names always and only calling each of them tiv Aottupiov the Assyrian king in agreement with Ptolemy s Canon  took the last king of Babylon to be the son of his prede cessor and the same that injured Gobryas and Gadates page 307 529 Berosus also who lived still much later took Niricassolassar for the sister s husband and puts in Laborosoarchod who is not in the Canon Perhaps we had better follow the Scripture and the Canon as elder and indeed contemporary records and say that Ilvaro damus or Evil Merodach was the son and Niricassolassar the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar and that Baltasar or Nabonadius was the uncle of Niricassolassar and the son of Nebuchadnezzar by another wife Nitocris See Ba ruch i 11 2 Chron xxxvi 20 Jer xxvii 7 Daniel v 18 22 And perhaps Laborosoarchod was no more than a first minister under Baltasar at first as the queen an 562 383 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to say that there was a certain captive who came from Judea a Jew by birth bijt brought away thence by Nebuchadnezzar when he destroyed Jerusalem whose name was Daniel a wise man and one of great sagacity in finding out what was impossible for others to discover and what was known to God alone and who brought to light and answered such questions to Nebuchadnezzar as no one else was able to answer when they were consulted She therefore desired that he would send for him and inquire concern ing the writing and to condemn the unskil fulness of those that could not find their meaning and this although what God sig nified thereby should be of a melancholy nature When Baltasar heard this he called for Daniel and when he had expressed what he had learned concerning him and his wisdom and how a divine spirit was with him and that he alone was fully capable of finding out what others would never have thought of he desired him to declare to him what this wri ting meant That if he did so he would give him leave to wear purple and to put a chain of gold about his neck and would bestow on him the third part of his dominion as an ho norary reward of his wisdom that thereby he might become illustrious to those who saw him and who inquired upon what occasion he obtained such honours But Daniel de sired that he would keep his gifts to him self the effect of wisdom and of divine reve lation admitting of no gifts but bestowing its advantages on petitioners freely but that still he would explain the writing to him He said it denoted that he should soon die and this because he had not learned to honour God and not to admit things above human nature by what punishments his progenitor had undergone for the injuries he had offered to God and because he had quite forgotten how Nebuchadnezzar was removed to feed among wild beasts for his impieties and did not recover his former life among men and his kingdom but upon God s mercy to him after many supplications and prayers Who did thereupon praise God all the days of his life as one of almighty power and who takes care of mankind He also reminded him that he had greatly blasphemed against God and had made use of his vessels amongst his concubines that therefore God was angry with him and declared by his writing be forehand what a sad conclusion of his life he should come to And he explained the wri ting thus MANEH this if it be expounded in the Greek language may signify Apifljioj a number because God hath numbered so long a time for thy life and for thy govern ment and there remains but a small portion THEKEL this signifies Era of a weight and means that God hath weighed thy king dom in a balance and finds it going down already PHARES this also in the Greek tongue denotes KXoWfMi a fragment God will therefore break thy kingdom in pieces and divide it among the Medes and Persians When Daniel had told the king that the writing upon the wall signified these events Baltasar was in great sorrow and affliction as was to be expected when the interpreta tion was so heavy upon him However he did not refuse what he had promised Daniel although he were become a foreteller of mis fortunes but bestowed it all upon him As reasoning thus that what he was to reward was peculiar to himself and to fate and did not belong to the prophet but that it was the part of a good and a just man to give what he had promised although the events were to be of a melancholy nature Now after a little while both himself and the city were taken by Cyrus king of Persia who fought against him For it was Baltasar under whom Babylon was taken when he had reigned seventeen years And this is the end of the posterity of Nebuchadnezzar as history informs us But when Babylon was taken by Darius and when he with his kinsman Cyrus had put an end to the do minion of the Babylonians he was sixty two years old He was the son of Astyages and mother Nitocris appears to have been the real regent afterwards Baltasar being a weak and effeminate prince as I have already noted and as his history shews N B It is plain that though Xenophon knew the history of Cyrus yet did he not know his chronology or how long he was in his war He thought those wars before the taking of Babylon to have been over in a very few years contrary to the strongest evidence elsewhere though in contradiction to this he knew Cyrus to be younger than Cyaxares and a very old man before he died which agrees with the other testimonies of antiquity  Daniel v 28 384 book X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS had another name among the Greeks Moreover he took Daniel the prophet and carried him with him into Media and ho noured him very greatly and kept him with him for he was one of the three presidents whom he set over his three hundred and sixty provinces However while Daniel was in so great dignity and in so great favour with Darius and was alone intrusted with every thing by him as having somewhat divine in him he was envied by the rest for those that see others in greater honour than themselves with kings envy them And when those that were grieved at the great favour Daniel was in with Darius sought for an occasion against him he afforded them no occasion at all For as he was above all the temptations of money and despised bribery and esteemed it a very base thing to take any thing by way of reward even when it might be justly given him he afforded those that envied him not the least handle for an accusation So when they could find nothing for which they might calumniate him to the king and thereby de prive him of the honour he was in they sought for some other method whereby they might destroy him When therefore they saw that Daniel prayed to God three times a day f they thought they had found an occa sion by which they might ruin him So they came to Darius and told him that the princes and governors had thought proper to allow the multitude a relaxation for thirty days that no one might offer a petition or prayer either to himself or to the gods but that he who should transgress this decree should be cast into the den of lions and there perish J Hereupon the king not being acquainted with their wicked design nor suspecting that it was a contrivance against Daniel said he was pleased with this decree and promised to confirm what they desired he also pub lished an edict to promulgate that decree which the princes had made Accordingly all the rest took care not to transgress those injunctions and rested in quiet But Daniel had no regard to them but as he was wont he stood and prayed to God in the sight of them all The princes having now met with the occasion they so earnestly sought came presently to the king and accused Daniel as the only person who had transgressed the decree while not one of the rest durst pray to their gods This discovery they made not because of his impiety but because they had watched him and observed him out of envy For supposing that Darius did thus out of a greater kindness to him than they expected and that he was ready to grant him pardon for this contempt of his injunc tions and envying this very pardon to Daniel they did not become more favourable to him but desired he might be cast into the den of lions according to the law So Darius ho ping that God would deliver him and that he would undergo nothing that was terrible by the wild beasts bade him bear this acci dent cheerfully and when he was cast into the den he put his seal to the stone that lay upon the mouth of the den and went his way He then passed all the night without food and without sleep being in great distress for Daniel But when it was day he got up and came to the den and found the seal entire which he had left the stone sealed withal he also opened the seal and called to Daniel and asked him if he were alive And as soon as he heard the king s voice and said that he had suffered no harm the king gave order that he should be drawn up out of the den Now when his enemies saw that Daniel had suffered nothing which was terrible they would not own that he was preserved by God and by his providence but they said that the lions had been filled with food and on that account it was as they supposed that they would not touch Daniel nor come to him And this they alleged to the king Bat the king out of an abhorrence of their wick edness gave order that they should throw in a great deal of flesh to the lions and when  Cyaxares t It was a constant custom among the Jews for those that were in the country or in any distant land to turn themselves towards Jerusalem and for those that were at Jerusalem to turn towards the temple when they prayed and the probable reason of this might be the words of Solomon in his prayer to God at the consecration of the temple If thy people when led away captive pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fa thers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which 1 have built for thy name then hear thou their prayers and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause 1 Kings viii 48 49 B X Daniel vi 7 an 538 385 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS they had filled themselves he gave farther order that Daniel s enemies should be cast into the den that he might learn whether the lions now they were full would touch them or not And it appeared plainly to Darius after the princes had been cast to the wild beasts that it was God who preserved Daniel tFor the lions spared none of them but tore them all to pieces as if they had been very hungry and wanted food I sup pose therefore it was not their hunger which had been a little before satisfied with abun dance of flesh but the wickedness of these men that provoked them to destroy the princes For if it so please God that wick edness might by even those irrational crea tures be esteemed a plain foundation for their punishment When therefore those that had intended thus to destroy Daniel by treachery were themselves destroyed king Darius sent letters over all his country and praised that God whom Daniel worshipped and said that he was the only true God and had power He also held Daniel in very great esteem and made him the principal of his friends Now when Daniel was become so illustrious and famous on account of the opinion men had that he was beloved of God he built a Jtower at Ecbatana in Media It was a most ele gant building and wonderfully made and it is still remaining and preserved to this day And to such as see it it appears to have been lately built and to have been no older than that very day when any one looks upon it it is so fresh and beautiful and no way grown old in so long a time For buildings suffer the same as men do they grow old as well as they and by numbers of years their strength is dissolved and their beauty withered Now they bury the kings of Media of Persia and Parthia in this tower to this day and he who was intrusted with the care of it was a Jewish priest which thing is also observed to this day But it is proper to give an account of what this man did for he was so happy as to have strange revelations made to him and those as to one of the greatest of the prophets insomuch that while he was alive he had the esteem and applause both of kings and of the multitude and now he is dead he retains a remembrance that will never fail For the several books that he wrote and left behind him are still read by us till this time and from them we believe that he conversed with God for he not only prophesied of future events as did the other prophets but he also determined the time of their accomplishment And while prophets used to foretell misfortunes and on that account were disagreeable both to the kings and the multitude Daniel was to them a prophet of good things and this to such a degree that by the agreeable nature of his predictions he procured the good will of all men and by the accomplishment of them he procured the belief of their truth and the opinion of a sort of divinity for himself among the multitude He also wrote and left be hind him what evinced the accuracy and undeniable veracity of his predictions For he saith that when he was in Susa the metro polis of Persia and went out into the field with his companions there was on the sudden a motion and concussion of the earth and that he was left alone by himself his friends  The lex talionis condemned all calumniators to the same sort of punishment which they intended to have brought upon others and in this case among the Per sians it was a frequent thing to include all the family in the penalty inflicted on the father but abominandae leges says Ammianus Marcellinus per quas ob novara unius omnis propinquitas perit Calmed Comtnentary B t It is no way improbable that Daniel s enemies might suggest this reason to the king why the lions did not meddle with him and that they might suspect the king s kindness to Daniel had procured these lions to be so filled beforehand and that thence it was that he encouraged Daniel to submit to this experiment in hope of coming off safe and that this was the true reason of making so terrible an experiment upon those his enemies and all their families Daniel vi 24 Though our other copies do not directly take notice of it  Of this Baris or tower built by Daniel whether it were at Ecbatana in Media as Josephus s present copies have it or at Susa in Persia as Jerome quotes it from his copies of Josephus is hard to determine Dean Pri deaux thinks Jerome s to be the true reading and that this tower was at Susa Connex part 1 at the year 634 I What Josephus here says that the stones of the se pulchres of the kings of Persia at this Baris or those per haps of the same sort that are now commonly called the ruins of Persepolis continued so entire and unaltered in his days as if they were lately put there  1 says Re land  here can shew to be true as to those stones of the Persian king s mausoleum which Corn Brunius brake off and gave me He ascribed this to the hardness of the stones which scarcely yields to iron tools and proves frequently too hard for cutting by the chisel but often times breaks the chisel to pieces See the like as to the Armenian buildings of Semiramis in Moses Chorenensis page 46 386 boor X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS fleeing away from him that he was disturbed and fell on his face and on his two hands and that a certain person touched him and at the same time bid him to rise and see what would befall his countrymen after many generations He also related that when he stood up he was shewn a great ram with many horns growing out of his head and that the last was nigher than the rest that after this he looked to the west and saw a he goat carried through the air from that quarter that he rushed upon the ram with violence and smote him twice with his horns and overthrew him to the ground and trampled upon him that afterward he saw a very treat horn growing out of the forehead of the e goat and that when it was broken offj four horns grew up that were exposed to each of the four winds and he wrote that out of them arose another lesser horn which as he said waxed great and that God shewed to him that it should fight against his nation and take their city by force and bring the temple worship to confusion and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for one thousand two hundred and ninety six days Daniel wrote that he saw these visions in the plain of Susa and he hath informed us that God interpreted the appearance of this vision after the fol lowing manner â He said that the ram sig nified the kingdom of the Medes and Persians and the horns those kings that were to reign in them and that the last horn signified the last king and that he should exceed all the kings in riches and glory that the he goat signified that one should come and reign from the Greeks who should twice fight with the Persians and overcome him in battle and should receive his entire dominion that by the great horn which sprang out of the forehead of the he goat was meant the first king and that the springing up of four horns upon its falling off and the conversion of every one of them to the four quarters of the earth signified the succours that should arise after the death of the first king and the par tition of the kingdom among them and that  See Daniel viii 1â 14 they should be neither his children nor of his kindred that should reign over the habit able earth for many years and that from among them there should arise a certain king that should overcome our nation and laws and should take away the political govern ment and should spoil the temple and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for three years Accordingly it happened that our nation suffered these things under Antiochus Epi phanes according to Daniel s vision and what he wrote many years before they came to pass In the same manner Daniel wrote concerning the Roman government and that our country should be made desolate by them All these things did this man leave in writing as God had shewed them to him Insomuch that such as read his prophecies and see how they have been fulfilled may justly wonder at the honour wherewith God ho noured Daniel and may thence discover how the Epicureans are in an error who cast Providence out of human life and do not believe that God takes care of the affairs of the world nor that the universe is governed and continued in being by that blessed and immortal nature but say that the world is carried along of its own accord without a ruler and a curator which were it destitute of a guide to conduct it as they imagine it would be like ships without pilots which we see destroyed by the winds or like chariots without drivers which are overturned so would the world be dashed to pieces by being carried without a Providence and so perish and come to nought So that by the afore mentioned predictions of Daniel those men seem to err from the truth who determine that God exercises no Providence over human affairs For if that were the case that the world went on by mechanical necessity we should not see that all things would come to pass according to his prophecy Now as to myself I have so described these matters as I have found them and read them but if any one be inclined to another opinion about them let him enjoy his sentiments without any blame from me an 536 387 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK XL Containing an Interval of Two Hundred and Fifty three Years and Five Months FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS TO THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT CHAP I OF THE PERMISSION GRANTED TO THE JEWS BY CYRUS KING OF PERSIA TO RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND TO REBUILD THEIR TEMPLE IN the firstf year of the reign of Cyrus which was the seventieth from the day that the Jews were removed out of their own land into Babylon God commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor people according as he had foretold by Jeremiah the prophet J before the destruction of the city that after they had served Nebuchadnezzar and his posterity and after they had un dergone that servitude seventy years he would restore them again to the land of their fathers and they should rebuild their temple and enjoy their ancient prosperity And these things God did afford them For he stirred up the mind of Cyrus and made him write thus throughout all Asia Thus saith Cyrus the king Since God Almighty hath appointed me to be king of the habit able earth I believe that he is that God whom the nation of the Israelites worship for indeed he foretold my name by the pro phets and that I should build him a house at Jerusalem in the country of Judea Â This was known to Cyrus by his reading the book which Isaiah left behind him of his prophecies For this prophet said that God had spoken thus to him in a secret vision â My will is that Cyrus whom I have ap pointed to be king over many and great na tions send back my people to their own land and build my temple This was foretold by Isaiah one hundred and forty years before the temple was demolished Accordingly  N B Josephus never makes use of our Hebrew book of Ezra which probably he never saw but only of the first book of Esdras by us called apocryphal and which he read in Hebrew but which Hebrew copy has been long lost our book being now only extant in the Septuagint and vulgar Latin versions T 2 Chron xxxvi 22 Ezra i 1 j This Cyrus is called God s shepherd by Xenophon page 581 as well as by Isaiah xlv 28 as also it is said of him by the same prophet I will make a man more pre cious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir Isa xiii 12 which character makes Xenophon s most excellent history of him very credible II Jeremiah xxv 11 Â It is a good deal more than probable that this decree in favour of the Jews was in a great measure owing to Daniel s good offices Cyrus at his first coming to Baby Ion after he had taken the city found him there an old minister of state famed for his great wisdom over all the East and in many things for a knowledge superior to the rest of mankind and accordingly we find that he not only employed him as such but upon the settling of the govern voL I â NOS 33  34 ment of the whole empire made him first superintendent or prime minister of state over all the provinces of it In this station of life Daniel must have been a person of great authority at court and highly in the esteem of his prince and therefore as we find him earnest in his prayer to God for the restoration of his people Daniel ix we cannot but think that he would be equally warm in his intercessions for it with the king To which purpose it is not im probable that he might shew him those passages in Isaiah which speak of him by name 150 years before he was born as a great prince and conqueror the ruler of many nations and the restorer of his people by causing his temple to be built and the city of Jerusalem re inhabited For that Cyrus had seen those prophecies the thing is plain not only from the testimony of Josephus Antiq lib xi c 1 but from the recital that is made of them in the decree itself Ezra i 2 and if so who shall be so proper to shew them to him and to recommend the accomplish ment of them to his princely care as Dataiel who had so great credit with him and so passionate a concern for the restoration of Zion Prideaux s Connection anno 539 B  Isaiah xliv 28 3T 388 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS when Cyrus read this and admired the di vine power an earnest desire seized upon him to fulfil what was so written So he called for the most eminent Jews that were in Babylon and said that he gave them leave to go back to their own country and to re build their city Jerusalem and the temple of God for that he would be their assistant and that he would write to the rulers and fovernors that were in the neighbourhood of udea that they should contribute gold and silver for the building of the temple and be sides that beasts for their sacrifices When Cyrus had said this to the Israelites the rulers of the two tribes of Judah and Ben jamin with the Levites and priests went in haste to Jerusalem Yet did many of them stay at Babylon as not willing to leave their possessions And when they were come thi ther all the king s friends assisted them and brought in for the building of the temple some gold and some silver and some a great many cattle and horses So they performed their vows to God and offered the sacrifices that had been accustomed of old time I mean this upon the rebuilding of their city and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their worship Cyrus also sent back the ves sels of God which king Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple and had carried to Babylon f So he committed these things to Mithridates the treasurer to be sent away with an order to give them to Sanabasser that he might keep them till the temple was built and when it was finished he might deliver them to the priests and rulers of the multitude in order to their being restored to the temple Cyrus also sent the following epistle to the governors that were in Syria KING CYRUS TO SISINNES AND SATHRABUZANES SENDETH GREETING I have given permission to as many of the Jews in my country as please to return to their own country and to rebuild their city and to build the temple of God at Jerusalem on the same place where it was before I have also

of polished stones and one of the wood of the country and tbe same order extends to the altar whereon they offer sacrifices to God I require also that the expenses for these things be given out of my

could not hitherto be demonstrated from the sacred history to have been completely fulfilled I mean as to that part of it which concerned his giving a commission for the rebuilding the city Jerusalem as distinct from the temple whose re building is alone permitted or directed in the decree of Cyrus in all our copies t Some are of opinion that among the eacred things which Cyrus ordered to be restored the ark of the cove nant was one but it no where appears that this ark was carried from Jerusalem to Babylon They tell us in deed that in the second temple sacrifices were offered as in the first and all solemn days observed especially the great day of expiation when the law ordained that the blood should be sprinkled before the mercy seat and the mercy seat say they was part of the ark but besides that the ark without the Shechinah or divine glory which was then withdrawn would have been of no great significance the Jews universally acknowledged that the ark was one of the five

four hundred and sixty two CHAP II OF THt OPPOSITION WHICH THE JEWS EXPERIENCED FROM THE CUTHEANS AND THE NEIGHBOURING GOVERNORS OF THE COMMAND OF CAMBYSES TO STOP THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE WHEN the foundations of the temple were laying and when the Jews were zealous about building it the neighbouring nations and especially the Cutheans whom Shalmaneser king of Assyria had brought out of Persia and Media and had planted in Samaria when he carried the people of Is rael captive besought the governors and those that had the care of such affairs that they would interrupt the Jews both in the rebuilding of their city and in the building their temple Now as these men were cor rupted with money they sold the Cutheans their interest for rendering this building a slow and careless work For Cyrus who was busy about other wars knew nothing of all this and it so happened that when he had led his army against the Massageta3 he ended his life f But when Cambyses the son of Cyrus had taken the kingdom the governors in Syria and Phoenicia and in the countries of Ammon and Moab and Samaria wrote an epistle to Cambyses whose contents were as follows To our lord Cambyses we thy servants Rathumus the historiographer and Semellius the scribe and the rest that are thy judges in Syria and Phoenicia greeting It is fit O king that thou shouldest know that those Jews who were carried to Babylon are come into our country and are building that re bellious and wicked city and its market places and setting up its walls and raising up the temple Know therefore that when these things are finished they will not be willing to pay tribute nor will they submit to thy commands but will resist kings and will choose rather to rule over others than be ruled over themselves We therefore thought it proper to write to thee O king while the works about the temple are going on so fast and not to overlook this matter that thou mayest search into the books of thy fathers for thou wilt find in them that the Jews have been rebels and enemies to  Josephus here follows Herodotus and those that re lated how Cyrus made war with the Scythians and Mas sagetes near the Caspian Sea and perished in it Of whom Strabo speaks XI page 307 to whom yet he gives little credit While Xenophon s account which appears never to have been seen by Josephus that Cyrus died in peace in his own country of Persia corroborated by the writers of the affairs of Alexander the Great when they agree that he found Cyrus s sepulchre or Pasargada near Persepolis This account of Xenophon s is also strongly confirmed by the circumstances of Cambyses upon his succession to Cyrus who instead of a war to avenge his father s death upon the Scythians and Massa getes and to prevent those nations from over running his northern provinces which would have been the natural consequence of his father s ill success and death there went immediately to an Egyptian war long ago began by Cyrus according to Xenophon page 644 and con quered that kingdom Nor is there that I ever heard of the least mention in the reis i of this Cambyses of any war against the Scythians or Massagetes that he was ever engaged in Nor by the way is this Cambyses any other than that Artashashta which our canonical Ezra names in this place iv 5 c t It is generally agreed by historians that Cyrus was much about seventy years old when he died but then they widely differ among themselves as to the manner of his death Some say that he was taken in an en gagement and hanged others that he died of a wound which he received in his thigh and others that he was killed in a battle with the people of Samos Herodotus Justin and Valerius Maximus relate that in his war against the Scythians falling into an ambush which Queen Tomyris had laid for him he was taken prisoner and with insult enough had his head cut off by her order but Xenophon s account is â that he died peace ably in his bed amidst his friends and in his own coun try as indeed there is little reason to think either that so wise a man as Cyrus should in his advanced years engage in so desperate an undertaking as this Scythian expedition is represented on all hands or that had he died in Scythia his mangled body could have ever been got out of the hands ot these barbarians to be buried at Pasargada in Persia as most authors agree it was and where his monument was to be seen in the time of Alexander the Great Calmefs Dictionary under the word Cyrus and Prideaux s Connection anna 530 B 3 T2 390 BOOK XL ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS kings as hath their city been also which for that reason hath been till now laid waste We thought proper also to inform thee of this matter because thou mayest otherwise perhaps be ignorant that if this city be once inhabited and entirely encom passed with walls thou wilt be excluded from thy passage to Coelesyria and Phoenicia When Cambyses had read the epistle being naturally wicked he was irritated at what they told him and wrote back to them as follows Cambyses the king to Rathumus the historiographer to Beeltethmus to Semellius the scribe and the rest that are in commis sion and dwelling in Samaria and Phoenicia after this manner I have read the epistle that was sent from you and I gave order that the books of my forefathers should be searched into And it is there found that this city hath always been an enemy to kings and its inhabitants have raised seditions and wars We also are sensible that their kings have been powerful and tyrannical and have exacted tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia Wherefore I give order that the Jews shall not be permitted to build that city lest such mischief as they used to bring upon kings be greatly augmented When this epistle was read Rathumus and Semellius the scribe and their associates got suddenly on horse back and made haste to Jerusalem they also brought a great company with them and forbade the Jews to build the city and the temple Accordingly these works were hindered from going on till the second year of the reign of Darius for nine more years For Cambyses reigned seven years and within that time overthrew Egypt and when he was come back he died at Damascus CHAP III OF THE ELEVATION OF DARIUS TO THE THROVE OF PERSIA THE SUPERIORITY OF ZOROBABEL IN THE SOLUTION OF FROBLKVS AND THE PERMISSION WHICH HE ATTAINED FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE FTER the slaughter of the Magi f who upon the death of Cambyses retained A  Cambyses reigned according to the canon of Pto lemy including the seven months of the Magi eight years Josephus gives here Cambyses but six years Rnd the Magi one year seven in all I suppose Pto the government of the Persians for a year those families which were called the seven families of the Persians appointed Darius the son of Hystaspes to be their king Now he while he was a private man had made a vow to God that if he came to be king he would send all the vessels of God that were in Babylon to the temple at Jerusalem Now it so fell out that about this time Zorobabel who had been made governor of the Jews that had been in captivity came to Darius from Jerusalem for there had been an old friendship between him and the king He was also with two others thought worthy to be guards of the king s body and obtained that honour which he hoped for Now in the first year of the king s reign Darius feasted those that were about him and those born in his house with the rulers of the Medes and princes of the Persians and the toparchs of India and Ethiopia and the generals of the armies of his hundred and twenty seven provinces But when they had eaten and drank abundantly they every one departed to their own houses And Da rius the king went to bed But after he had rested a little part of the night he awoke and not being able to sleep any more he fell into conversation with the three guards of his body and promised that to him who should make an oration about points that he should inquire of such as should be most agreeable to truth and to the dictates of wisdom he would grant it as a reward of his victory to put on a purple garment to drink in cups of gold to sleep upon gold and to have a cha riot with bridles of gold and a head tire of fine linen and a chain of gold about his neck and to set next to himself on account of his wisdom and to be called his cousin Now when he had promised to give them these gifts he asked the first of them whether wine were not the strongest the second whether kings were not such and the third whether women were not such or whether truth were not rather the strongest of all When he had proposed that they should make their inquiries about these problems he went to rest But in the morning he Bent lemy s canon to be the true number though the dif ference between that account and Josephus s is no more than a single year   An 622 AN 521 391 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS for his great men his princes and toparchs of Persia and Media and set himself down in the place where he used to give audience and bade each of his body guards to declare what they thought proper concerning the pro posed questions in the hearing of them all Accordingly the first of them began to speak of the strength of wine and demon strated it thus When said he I am to give my opinion of wine O ye men I find that it exceeds every thing by the following indications It deceives the mind of those that drink it and reduces that of the king to the same state with that of the orphan and he who stands in need of a tutor and erects that of the slave to the boldness of him that js free and that of the needy becomes like that of the rich man For it changes and re news the souls of men when it gets into them and it quenches the sorrow of those that are under calamities and makes men forget the debts they owe to others and makes them think themselves to be of alLmen the richest it makes them talk of no small things but of talents and such other names as become wealthy men only Nay more it makes them insensible of their commanders and of their kings and takes away the remem brance of their friends and companions For it arms men even against those that are dearest to them and makes them appear the greatest strangers to them And when they are become sober and they have slept out their wine in the night they arise without knowing any thing they have done in their cups I take these for signs of power and by them discover that wine is the strongest and most insuperable of all things As soon as the first had given the afore mentioned demonstrations of the strength of wine the next to him began to speak about the strength of a king and demonstrated that he was the strongest of all and more power ful than any thing else that appears to have any force or wisdom They are men said he who govern all things they force the earth and the sea to become profitable to them in what they desire and over these men do kings rule and over them they have authority Now those who rule over that animal which is of all the strongest and most powerful must needs deserve to be esteemed insuperable jn po er and force For example when kings command their subjects to make wars and undergo dangers they are hearkened to and when they send them against their enemies their power is so great that they are obeyed They com mand men to level mountains and to pull down walls and towers nay when they are commanded to be killed and to kill they submit to it that they may not appear to transgress the king s commands And when they have conquered they bring what they have gained in the war to the king Those also who are not soldiers but cultivate the ground after they have endured the labour and all the inconveniences of such works of husbandry and have reaped and gathered in their fruits they bring tributes to the king And whatsoever it is which the king says or commands it is done of necessity and that without any delay While he in the mean time is satiated with all sorts of food and pleasure and sleeps in quiet He is guarded by such as watch and such as are as it were fixed down to the place through fear For no one dares leave him even when he is asleep nor does any one go away and take care of his own affairs but he esteems this one thing to be the only work of necessity to guard the king and accordingly to this he wholly addicts himself How then can it be otherwise but that the king exceeds all in strength  hile so great a multitude obey his injunctions Now when this man had held his peace the third of them who was Zorobabel be gan to speak concerning women and truth Wine said he is strong as is the king also whom all men obey but women are superior to them in power For it was a woman who brought the king into the world and those who plant the vines and make the wine they are women who bear them and bring them up Nor indeed is there any thing which we do not receive from them For these women weave garments for us and our household affairs are by their means taken care of and preserved in safety Nor can we live separate from women And when we have got a great deal of gold and silver and any other thing that is of fjreat value and see a beautiful woman we leave all these things and with open mou h fix our eyes upon her countenauce and are 392 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  willing to forsake what we have that we may enjoy her beauty and procure it to ourselves We also leave father and mo ther and the earth that nourishes us and frequently forget our dearest friends for the sake of women Nay we are so hardy as to lay down our lives for them But what will chieily make you take notice of the strength of women is this that follows Do not we take pains and endure a great deal of trouble and that both by land and sea and when we have procured somewhat as the fruit of our labours do not we bring them to the women as to our mistresses and bestow them upon them Nay I once saw the king who is lord of so many people smitten on the face by Apame the daughter of Rabsaces Themasius his concubine and his diadem taken away from him and put upon her own head while he bore it pa tiently and when she smiled he smiled and when she was angry he was sad and ac cording to the change of her passions he flattered her and drew her to reconciliation by the great humiliation of himself if at any time he saw her displeased And when the princes and rulers looked one upon another Zorobabel began to speak about truth and he said I have already de monstrated how powerful women are But both these women and the king are weaker than truth For although the earth be large and the heaven high and the course of the sun swift yet are all these moved according to the will of God who is true and righteous For which cause we ought also to esteem truth to be the strongest of all things and that what is unrighteous is of no force against it Moreover all things that have any strength are mortal and short lived but truth is a thing that is immortal and eternal It affords us not indeed such a beauty as will wither away by time nor such riches as may be taken away by fortune but righteous rules and laws It distinguishes them from injustice and puts what is unrighteous to rebuke So when Zorobabel had left oft his dis course about truth and the multitude had cried out aloud that he had spoken the most wisely and that it was truth alone that had immutable strength and such as never would wax old the king commanded that he should ask for somewhat over and above what he had promised for that he would give it him because of his wisdom and that prudence wherein he exceeded the rest And thou slialt sit with me said the king and shalt be called my cousin When he had said this Zorobabel reminded him of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom Now this vow was to rebuild Je rusalem and to build therein the temple of God as also to restore the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged and carried to Babylon And this said he is that request which thou now permiltest me to make on account that I have been judged to be wise and to have understanding So the king was pleased with what he said and arose and kissed him and wrote to the toparchs and governors and enjoined them to conduct Zorobabel and those that were going with him to build the temple He also sent letters to those rulers that were in Syria and Phoenicia to cut down and carry cedar trees from Lebanon to Jerusalem and to as sist him in building the city He also wrote to them that all the captives who should go to Judea should be free and he prohibited his deputies and governors from imposing any king s taxes upon the Jews He also per mitted that they should have all that land  The reader is to note that although the speeches or papers of these three of the king s guard are much the same in our third Book of Esdras chap iii and iv as they are in Josephus yet the introduction of them is en tirely different While in our Esdras the whole is related as the contrivance of the three of the king s guard them selves and even the mighty rewards are spoken of as proposed by themselves and the speeches arc related to have been delivered by themselves to the king in writing While all is contrary in Josephus I need not say whose account is nost probable The matters speak for them selves and there can be no doubt but Josephus s history is here to be very much preferred before the other Nor indeed does it seem to me at all unlikely that the whole was a contrivance of king Darius s in order to be de  cently and inoffensively put in mind by Zorobabel of fulfilling his old vow for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple and the restoration of the worship of the One True God there Nor does the full meaning of Zo robabel when he cries out 3 Esdras iv 40 Blessed be the God of truth and here God is true and righ teous or of even all the people 3 Esdras iv 41 God is truth and mighty above all things seem to me much different from this there is but One True God the God of Israel To which doctrine such as Cyrus Darius c those great patrons of the Jews seem not to have been very averse though the entire idolatry of their kingdom made them generally conceal it aN 521 393 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS which they could possess themselves of with out tribute At the same time he enjoined the Idumeans and Samaritans and the inha bitants of Coelesyria to restore those villages which they had taken from the Jews and that besides all this fifty talents should be given them towards the building of the tem ple He also permitted them to offer their appointed sacrifices and promised whatso ever the high priest and the priests wanted and those sacred garments wherein they used to worship God should be made at his own expense and that the musical instruments which the Levites used in singing hymns to God should be given them Moreover he charged them that portions of land should be given to those that guarded the city and the temple as also a determinate sum of money every year for their maintenance and withal he sent the vessels And all that Cyrus intended to do before him relating to the restoration of Jerusalem Darius ordained should be done accordingly When Zorobabel had obtained these grants from the king he went out of the palace and looking up to heaven he began to return thanks to God for the wisdom he had given him and the victory he had gained thereby even in the presence of Darius him self For said he I had not been thought worthy of these advantages O Lord unless thou hadst been favourable to me When therefore he had returned thanks to God for the present circumstances he was in and had prayed to him to afford him the like favour for time to come he came to Babylon and brought the good news to his countrymen of what grants he had procured for them from the king When they heard this they also gave thanks to God that he had restored the land of their forefathers to them again So they betook themselves to drinking and eating and for seven days they kept a fes tival for the rebuilding and restoration of their city After this they chose themselves rulers who should go up to Jerusalem out of the tribes of their forefathers with their wives and children and cattle who travel led to Jerusalem with great pleasure under the conduct of those whom Darius sent along with them and they made a cheerful noise with songs and pipes and cymbals the rest of the Jewish multitude accompanying them with rejoicing And thus did these men go a certain and determinate number out ot every family though i do not think it proper to recite par ticularly the names of those families that I may not take off the mind of my readers from the connection of the historical facts and make it hard for them to follow the co herence of my narrations But the sum of those that went up above the age of twelve years of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin was four fhundred and sixty two myriads and eight thousand The Levites were seventy four the number of women and children mixed together was forty thousand seven hundred and forty two And besides these there were singers of the Levites one hun dred and twenty eight porters one hundred and ten and of the sacred ministers three hundred and ninety two There were also others who said they were of the Israelites but were not able to shew their genealogies six hundred and sixty two Some there were also who were expelled out of the number and honour of the priests as having married wives whose genealogies they could not pro duce nor were they found in the genealogies of the Levites and priests they were about five hundred and twenty five The multitude also of servants followed those that went up to Jerusalem seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven The singing men and singing women were two hundred and forty five The camels were four hundred and thirty five the beasts used to the yoke were j  See Ezra ii 1â 70 Nehemiah viii 6â 70 t This number of 4 620 000 in Josephus s present copies is one of the grossest errors that is in them and ought to be corrected from Ezra ii 64 1 Esdras v 40 and Neh vii 66 who all agree the general sum was but about 42 360 It is also very plain that Josephus thought when Esdras afterward brought up another company out of Babylon and Persia in the days of Xerxes they were also as well as these out of the two tribes and out of them only and were in all no more than a seed and a remnant while an immense number of the ten tribes never returned but as he believed continued them be yond Euphrates chap v Of which multitude of Jews beyond Euphrates he speaks frequently elsewhere Though by the way he never takes them to be idolaters but looks on them still as observers of the laws of Moses The certain part of the people that now came up from Babylon at the end of this chapter imply the same smaller number of Jews that now came up and will no way agree with the 4 620 000 3U book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS five thousand five hundred and twenty five And the governors of all the multitude thus numbered were Zorobabel the son of Sala thiel of the posterity of David and of the tribe of Judah and Jeshua the son of Josedek the high priest And besides these there were Mordecai and Serebeus who were dis tinguished from the multitude and were ru lers who also contributed a hundred pounds of gold and five thousand of silver By this means therefore the priests and the Levites and a certain part of the people of the Jews that were in Babylon came and dwelt in Je rusalem but the rest of the multitude re turned to their own countries CHAP IV UT THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND THE FRUITLESS ATTEMPT OF THE CUTHEANS TO OBSTRUCT THE WORK IN the seventh month after they were de parted out of Babylon both Jeshua the high priest and Zorobabel the governor sent messengers every way round about and ga thered those that were in the country together to Jerusalem They then built the altar on the place where it formerly stood that they might offer the appointed sacrifices upon it to God according to the laws of Moses But while they did this they did not please the neighbouring nations who regarded them with envy and ill will They also celebrated the feasts of tabernacles at that time as the legislator had ordained and after that they offered sacrifices and what were called the daily sacrifices and the oblations proper for the sabbath and for all the holy festivals Those also that had made vows performed them and offered their sacrifices from the first day of the seventh month They also began to build the temple and gave a great sum of money to the masons and carpenters and what was necessary for the maintenance of the workmen The Sidonians also were very willing to bring cedar trees from Liba nus to bind them together and to make a united float of them and to bring them to the port of Joppa For that was what Cyrus had commanded at first and what was now done at the command of Darius  Ezra iii 1 t An 519 In the second yearf of their Coming to Je rusalem as the Jews were there in the second month the building of the temple went on apace And when they had laid the founda tion on the first day of the second month of that year they appointed as overseers of the work such Levites as were full twenty years old and Jeshua and his sons and brethren and Cadmiel the brother of Judas the son of Aminadab with his sons And by the great diligence of those that had the care of it the temple was finished sooner than any one would have expected The priests then adorned with their accustomed garments stood with their trumpets while the Levites and the sons of Asaph stood and sang hymns to God according as David had first of all appointed Now the priests and Levites and the elder part of the families recollect ing how much greater and more sumptuous the old temple had been and contrasting it with the inferiority of the new one they con sidered with themselves how much their hap py state was sunk below what it had been of old as well as their temple Hereupon they were very disconsolate and proceeded so far as to lament and shed tears on those accounts But the people in general were contented with their present condition and because they were allowed to build them a temple they desired no more and neither regarded nor indeed at all tormented themselves with the comparison of that and the former tem ple as if this were below their expectations But the wailing of the old men and of the priests on account of the deficiency of this temple in their opinion if compared with that which had been demolished overcame the sounds of trumpets and the rejoicing of the people J When the Samaritans who were still ene mies to the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard the sound of the trumpets they came running together and desired to know what was the occasion of this tumult and when they perceived that it was from the Jews who had been carried captive to Babylon and were rebuilding their temple they came to Zorobabel and to Jeshua and to the heads of the families and desired they would give  I Ezra iii 13 AN 519 395 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them leave to assist in building the temple For said they we worship your God and especially pray to him and are desirous of the same religious settlement and this ever since Shalnianezer king of Assyria trans planted us out of Cuthah and Media to this place When they said thus Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest and the heads of the families of the Israelites replied that it was impossible to permit them to be their partners whilst they only had been appoint ed to build that temple at first by Cyrus and now by Darius f although it was indeed law ful for them to come and worship there if they pleased and that they could allow them no thing but that in common with them When the CutheansJ heard this they had indignation at it and persuaded the nations of Syria to desire of the governors in the same manner as they had done formerly in the days of Cyrus and in the time of Cambyses afterwards to put a stop to the building of the temple and to endeavour to delay and pro tract the Jews in their zeal about it Now at this time Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia and Sathrabuzanes with certain Others came up to Jerusalem and asked the rulers of the Jews by whose grant it was that they built the temple in this manner since it was more like a citadel than a temple And for what reason it was that they built cloisters and walls and those strong ones too about the city Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest replied that they were the ser vants of God Almighty that this temple was built for him by a king of theirs that lived in great prosperity and one that exceeded all men in virtue and that it continued a long time but that because of the impiety of their forefathers Nebuchadnezzar king of the Babylonians and of the Chaldeans took their city by force and destroyed it and pil laged the temple and burnt it down and transplanted the people whom he had made captives and removed them to Babylon that Cyrus who after him was king of Babylonia and Persia wrote to them to build the tem ple and committed the gifts and vessels and whatever Nebuchadnezzar had carried oat of it to Zorobabel and Mithridates the treasu  Ezra iv 1 2 t Ezra iv 3 voL I â NOS 33  34 rer and gave order to have them carried to Jerusalem and to have them restored to their own temple when it was built For he had sent to them to have that done speedily and commanded Senabassar to go up to take care of the building of the temple Who upon receiving that epistle from Cyrus came and immediately laid its foundations And al though it hath been in building from that time to this said they it hath not yet been finished by reason of the malignity of our enemies If therefore you think proper write this account to Darius that when he hath consulted the records of the kings he may find that we have told you nothing that is false about this matter When Zorobabel and the high priest had made this answer Sisinnes and those that were with him did not resolve to hinder the building until they had informed king Darius of all this So they immediately wrote to him about these affairs while the Jews were under terror and afraid lest the king should change his resolution as to the building of Jerusalem and of the temple There were however two prophets at that time among them Haggai and Zachariah who encouraged them and bade them be of good cheer and to suspect no discouragement from the Per sians for that God foretold this to them So in dependence on those prophets they appli ed themselves earnestly to building and did not intermit one day Now the Samaritans in their epistle to Da rius had accused the Jews of fortifying the city and building the temple more like a citadel than a temple and said that their doings were not expedient for the king s af fairs and besides they shewed the epistle of Cambyses wherein he forbade them to build the temple Darius therefore when he un derstood that the restoration of Jerusalem was not expedient for his affairs and when he had read the epistle that was brought him from Sisinnes and those that were with him gave order that what concerned these matters should be sought for among the royal records Accordingly a book was found at Ecbatana in the tower that was in Media wherein was written as follows Cyrus the king in the  I Samaritans 3U 396 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS first year of his reign commanded that the temple should be built in Jerusalem and the altar in height sixty cubits and its breadth of the same with three edifices of polished stone and one edifice of stone of their own country and he ordained that the expenses of it should be paid out of the king s revenue He also commanded that the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the tem ple and had carried to Babylon should be restored to the people of Jerusalem and that the care of these things should belong to Se nabassar the governor and president of Syria and Phoenicia and to his associates that they may not meddle with that place but may permit the servants of God the Jews and their rulers to build the temple He also ordained that they shoyld assist them in the work and that they should pay to the Jews out of the tribute of the country where they were governors on account of the sacrifices bulls rams lambs and kids of the goats and fine flour together with oil and wine and all other things that the priests should suggest to them and that they should pray for the pre servation of the king and of the Persians and that for such as transgressed any of these orders thus sent to them he commanded that they should be hung on a cross and their substance confiscated to the king s use He also prayed to God against them that if any one attempted to hinder the building of the temple God would strike him dead and thereby restrain his wickedness When Darius had found this book among the records of Cyrus he wrote the following answer to Sisinnes and his associates â King Darius to Sisinnes the governor and to Sathrabuzanes sendeth greeting Hav ing found a copy of this epistle among the records of Cyrus I have sent it you and I will that all things be done as is therein writ ten Fare ye well So when Sisinnes Pand those that were with him understood the intention of the king they resolved to follow his directions for the time to come So they forwarded the sacred work and assisted the elders of the Jews and the princes of the Sanhedrim and the structure of the temple was with great dili  Ezra vi 14 â t From an 619 to an 612 B C gence brought to a conclusion by the pro phecies of Haggai and Zachariah according to God s commands and by the injunctions of Cyrus and Darius the kings Now the tem ple was built in fseven years time And in the ninth year of the reign of Darius on the twenty third day of the twelfth month which is by us called Adar but by the Macedonians Dystrus the priests and Levites and the multitude of the Israelites offered sacrifices as the renovation of their former prosperity after their captivity and because they had the temple rebuilt a hundred bulls two hun dred rams four hundred lambs and twelve kids of the goats according to the number of their tribe f for so many are the tribes of the Israelites and this last for the sins of every tribe The priest also and the Le vites set the porters at every gate according to the laws of Moses The Jews also built the cloisters of the inner temple that were round about the temple itself Â And as the feast of unleavened bread was at hand in the first month which according to the Macedonians is called Xanthicus but according to us Nisan all the people ran to gether out of the villages to the city and celebrated the festival having purified them selves with their wives and children accord ing to the law of their country and they of fered the sacrifice called the passover on the fourteenth day of the same month and feasted seven days and spared no expense but offer ed whole burnt offerings to God and per formed sacrifices of thanksgiving because God had led them again to the land of their fathers and to the laws thereto belonging and had rendered the mind of the king of Persia favourable to them So these men of fered the largest sacrifices on these accounts and used great magnificence in the worship of God and dwelt in Jerusalem and made use of a form of government that was aristo cratic but mixed with an oligarchy For the high priests were at the head of the af fairs until the posterity of the Asmoneans set up regal government For before their captivity and the dissolution of their polity they at first had kingly government from Saul and David for five hundred and thirty two J Ezra vi 17 aN 486 397 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS years six months and ten days But before those kings such rulers governed them as were called judges and monarchs Under this form of government they continued for more than five hundred years after the death of Moses and of Joshua their com mander And this is the account I had to give of the Jews who had been carried into captivity but were delivered from it in the times of Cyrus and Darius But the Samaritans being enviously dis posed toward the Jews wrought them many mischiefs by reliance on their riches and by their pretence that they were allied to the Persians And whatsoever it was that they were enjoined to pay to the Jews by the king s order out of their tribute for the sa crifices they would not pay it They had also the governors favourable to them and assisting them for that purpose Nor did they spare to hurt them either by themselves or by others as far as they were able So the Jews determined to send an ambassage to king Darius in favour of the people of Jeru salem and in order to accuse the Samaritans The ambassadors were Zorobabel and four others of the rulers And as soon as the king knew from the ambassadors the accusations and complaints they brought against the Sa maritans he gave them an epistle to be car ried to the governors and council of Samaria The contents of the epistle were these â King Darius to Tanganas and Sambabas governors of the Samaritans to Sadraces and Bobelo and the rest of their fellow servants that are in Samaria Zorobabel Ananias and Mordecai the ambassadors of the Jews complain of you that you

The character which oar celebrated connector of the Old and New Testament has given us of this Darius is â That he was a prince of great wisdom clemency and justice and has the honour to be recorded in holy writ for a favourer of God s people and a restorer of his temple at Jerusalem and a promoter of his worship therein For all this God was pleased to make him his instrument and with respect to this I doubt not it was that he blessed him with a numerous issue a long reign and great prosperity For though he was not so very fortunate in his wars against the Scythians and Grecians yet every where else he had full success in all his under takings and not only restored and fully settled the empire of Cyrus after it had been much shaken by Cambyses and the Magian but also added many large and rich pro vinces to it especially those of India Thrace Macedon and the Isles of the Ionian sea Pridcaitx t Connection anno 486 B I  Darius had three sons by his first wife the daugh ter of Gobrias all born before his advancement to the throne and four others by Atossa the daughter of Cyrus who were all born after it Of the former Artabasanes was the eldest of the latter Xerxes and as Darius ad vanced in years between these two was the competition for the succession Artabasanes urged that as he was the eldest son according to the custom and usage of all nations he ought to be preferred before any that was younger But Xerxes replied to this That he was the son of Darius by Atossa the daughter of Cyrus who was the first founder of the Persian empire for which reason he held it just and reasonable that the crown of Cyrus should rather come to a descendant of Cyrus than to one that was not and to this he added that though Artaba sanes was the eldest son of Darius yet he was not the eldest son of a king that he was born when he was only a private person and could therefore claim no more than to be heir of his private fortunes but that as to himself he was the first born after his father was king and had therefore the best right to succeed1 him m the kingdom Whereupon he was nominated to the succession but not so much for the strength of his plea as for the influence which his mother Atossa had over the inclinations of her husband PridetLttx s Connection anno 486 B II An 479 3U2 398 book xr ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  dras He was very skilful in the laws of Mo ses and well acquainted with king  Xerxes He had determined to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him some of those Jews that were in Babylon And he desired that the king would give him an epistle to the go vernors of Syria by which they might know who he was Accordingly the king wrote the following epistle to those governors â Xerxes king of kings to Ezra the priest and the reader of the divine law greeting 1 tliiuk it agreeable to that love which 1 bear to mankind to permit those of the Jewish na tion that are so disposed as well as those of the priests and Levites that are in our king dom to go together to Jerusalem Accord ingly I have given command for that purpose And let every one that hath a mind go ac cording as it hath seemed good to me and to my seven counsellors and this in order to their review of the affairs of Judea to see whether they be agreeable to the law of God Let them also take with them those presents which I and my friends have vowed with all that silver and gold that is found in the coun try of the Babylonians as dedicated to God and let all this be carried to Jerusalem for sacrifices Let it also be lawful for thee and thy brethren to make as many vessels of sil ver and gold as thou pleasest Thou shalt also dedicate those holy vessels which have been given thee and as many more as thou hast a mind to make and shalt take the ex penses out of the king s treasury I have moreover written to the treasurers of Syria and Phoenicia that they take care of those affairs that Esdras the priest and reader of the laws of God is sent about And that God may not be angry with me or with my chil dren I grant all that is necessary for sacri fices to God according to the law as far as a hundred cori of wheat And I enjoin you not to lay any treacherous imposition or any tributes upon their priests or Levites sacred singers porters sacred servants or scribes of the temple And do thou O Esdras ap point judges according to the wisdom given thee of God and those such as understand the law that they may judge in all Syria and Phoenicia and do thou instruct those also who are ignorant of it that if any one of thy countrymen transgress the law of God or that of the king he may be punished as not transgressing it out of ignorance but as one that knows but boldly despises and contemns it And such may be punished by death or by paying fines Farewell When Esdras had received this epistle he was very joyful and began to worship God and confessed that he had been the cause of the king s great favour to him and for the same reason he gave all the thanks to God So he read the epistle at Babylon to those Jews that were there but he kept the epistle itself and sent a copy of it to all those of his own nation that were in Media And when these Jews had understood what piety the king had toward God and what kindness he had for Esdras they were all greatly pleased Nay many of them took their effects with them and came to Babylon as very desirous of going down to Jerusalem But then the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country Wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense mul titude and not to be estimated by numbers Now there came a great number of priests Levites porters sacred singers and sacred servants to Esdras So he gathered those that were in captivity together beyond Euphrates and stayed there three days and ordained a fast for them that they might make their prayers to God for their preservation that they might suffer no misfortunes by the way either from their enemies or from any other ill accident For Esdras had said beforehand that he had told the king how God would preserve them and so he had not thought fit to request that he would send horsemen to conduct them So when they had finished their prayers they removed from Euphrates on the twelfth day of the first month of the seventh year of the reign of Xerxes and they came to Jerusalem on the fifth month of the  That the histories of Ezra or Esdras the scribe when he came and settled the Jewish commonwealth after their return from the Babylonish captivity and of Nehemiab when he built the walls of Jerusalem do not belong to Ar  taxerxes the son but to Xerxes the father as Josephus here rightly places them contrary to all our other copies of Ezra and Nehemiah is largely proved in my Literal Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies Supplement page 59â 75 As also that Daniel s famous seventy weeks take their date not from the seventh or twen e 5 I  a 479 399 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS same year Now Esdras presented the sacred money to the treasurers who were of the fa mily of the priests of silver six hundred and fifty talents vessels of silver one hundred ta lents vessels of gold twenty talents and ves sels of brass that was more precious than gold twelve talents by weight For these presents had been made by the king and his counsellors and by all the Israelites that stayed at Babylon So when Esdras had delivered these things to the priests he gave to God as the appointed sacrifices of whole burnt offerings twelve bulls on account of the common preservation of the people ninety rams seventy two lambs and twelve kids of the goats for the remission of sins He also delivered the king s epistle to the king s officers and to the governors of Coole syria and Phoenicia And as they were under a necessity of doing what was enjoined by him they honoured our nation and were as sistant to them in all their necessities Now these things were truly done under the conduct of Esdras and he succeeded in them because God esteemed him worthy of the success of his conduct on account of his righteousness But some time afterward there came some persons to him and brought an accusation against certain of the multitude and of the priests and Levites who had trans gressed their settlement and dissolved the laws of their country by marrying strange wives and had brought the family of the priests into confusion These persons desir ed him to support the laws lest God should take up a general anger against them all and reduce them to a calamitous condition again Hereupon he rent his garment immediately out of his grief and pulled the hair of his head and beard and cast himself upon the ground because this crime had reached the principal men among the people and considering that if he should enjoin them to cast out their wives and the children they had by them he should not be hearkened to he continued ly ing upon the ground However all the better sort came running to him who also them selves wept and partook of the grief he was under for what had been done So Esdras rose up from the ground and stretched out his hand towards heaven and said that he wa ashamed to look towards it because of the sins which the people had committed while they had cast out of their memories what their fathers had undergone on account of their wickedness And he besought God who had saved a seed and a remnant out of the calamity and captivity they had been in and had restored them again to Jerusalem and to their own land and had obliged the kings of Persia to have compassion on them that he would also forgive them the sins they had now committed which though they deserved death yet was it agreeable to the mercy of God to remit the punishments due to them After Esdras had said this he left off pray ing and when all those who came to him with their wives and children were under la mentation one whose name was Jechonias a principal man in Jerusalem came to him and said that they had sinned in marrying strange wives and he persuaded him to ad jure them all to cast those wives out and the children born of them and that those should be punished who would not obey the law So Esdras hearkened to this advice and made the heads of the priests and of the Levites and of the Israelites swear that they would put away those wives and children according to the advice of Jechonias And when he had received their oaths he went in haste out of the temple into the chamber of Joha nan the son of Eliasib and as he had hitherto stated nothing at all for grief so he abode there that day And when proclamation was made that all those of the captivity should gather themselves together to Jerusalem and that those that did not meet there in two or three days should be banished from the multitude and that their substance should be appropriated to the uses of the temple ac cording to the sentence of the elders

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS of the temple where the elders also were present but were uneasy because of the cold Esdras stood up and told them they had sinned in marrying wives that were not of their own nation But that now they would do a thing both pleasing to God and advantageous to themselves if they would put those wives away Accordingly they all cried out that they would do so that how ever the multitude was great and the season of the year was winter and this work would require more than one or two days Let their rulers therefore said they and those that have married strange wives come hither at a proper time while the elders of every place that are in common to estimate the number of those that have thus married are to be there also Accordingly this was re solved on And they began the inquiry after those that had married strange wives on the first day of the tenth month and continued the inquiry till the first day of the next month and found a great many of the posterity of Jeshua the high priest and of the priests and Levites and Israelites who had fa greater regard to the observance of the law than to their natural affection and immediately cast out their wives and the children which were born of them And in order to appease God they offered sacrifices and slew rams as ob lations to him But it does not seem neces sary to set down the names of these men So when Esdras had reformed this sin about the marriages of the aforementioned persons he reduced that practice to purity so that it continued in that state for the time to come Now when they kept Jthe feast of taber nacles in the seventh month and almost all the people were come together to it they went up to the open part of the temple to the gate that looked eastward and desired of Esdras that the laws of Moses might be read to them Accordingly he stood in the midst of the multitude and read them from the morn ing to noon Now by hearing the laws read to them they were instructed to be righteous men for the present and for the future But as for their past offences they were dis pleased at themselves and proceeded to shed tears on their account as considering with themselves that if they had kept the law they had endured none of those miseries which they had experienced But when Es dras saw them in this disposition he bade them go home and not weep for that it was a festival and that they ought not to weep thereon for that it was not lawful so to do j He exhorted them rather to proceed imme diately to feasting and to do what was agree able to a day of joy but let their repentance and sorrow for their former sins be a security and a guard to them that they fall no more into the like offences So upon Esdras s ex hortation they began to feast and when they had so done for eight days in the tabernacles they departed to their own homes singing hymns to God and returning thanks to Es dras for his reformation of what corruptions had been introduced into their settlement So it came to pass that after he had ob tained this reputation among the people he died an old man and was buried in a mag nificent manner at Jerusalem About the same time it happened also that Joacim the high priest died and his son Eliasib suc ceeded to the high priesthood NowÂ there was one of those Jews that had been carried captive who was cup bearer to king Xerxes His name was Nehemiah As this man was walking before Susa the metro polis of the Persians he heard some strangers that were entering the city after a long jour ney speaking to one another in the Hebrew  Ezra 13 14 t This procedure of Ezra and of the best part of the Jewish nation after the return from the Babylonish Cap tivity of reducing the Jewish marriages one for all to the strictness of the law of Moses without any regard to the greatness of those who had broken it and without regard to that natural affection or compassion for their heathen wires and their children by them which made it so hard for Ezra to correct them deserves greatly to be observed among Christians The contrary conduct having ever been the bane of true religion both among Jews and Christians while political views human pas sions or prudential motives are suffered to take place instead of the divine laws and the blessing of God is forfeited and the church suffered to continue corrupt from one generation to another J This Jewish feast of tabernacles was imitated in seve ral heathen solemnities as Spanheim here observes and proves He also farther observes presently what great regard many heathens had to the monuments of their forefathers as Nehemiah had here II This rule of Ezra s not to fast on a festival day is quoted in the Apostolical Constitutions as obtaining among Christians also V 20 Â An 462 an 462 401 ANTIQUITIES

condition Jerusalem was They replied that they were in a bad state for that their walls were thrown down to the ground and that the neighbouring na tions did a great deal of mischief to the Jews while in the day time they over ran the coun try and pillaged it arid in the night did them mischief insomuch that not a few were led away captive out of the country and out of Jerusalem itself and that the roads were in the day time found full of dead men Here upon Nehemiah shed tears out of commisera tion of the calamities of his countrymen and looking up to heaven he said How long O Lord wilt thou overlook our nation while it suffers so great miseries and while we are made the prey and the spoil of all men And while he stayed at the gate and la mented thus one told him that the king was going to sit down to supper So he made haste and went as he was without washing himself to minister to the king in his office of cup bearer But as the king was very plea sant after supper and more cheerful than usual he cast his eyes on Nehemiah and seeing him look sad he asked him why he was sad Whereupon he prayed to God to give him favour and afford nim the power of persuading by his words and said â How can I O king appear otherwise than thus and not be in trouble while I hear that the walls of Jerusalem the city where the sepul chres of my fathers are thrown down to the fround and that its gates are consumed by re But do thou grant me the favour to go and build its wall and to finish the buildings of the temple f Accordingly the king gave him a signal that he freely granted him what he asked and told him that he should carry an epistle to the governors that they might pay him due honour and afford him what  This miserable condition of the Jews and the capi tal must have been after the death of Ezra their former governor and before Nehemiah came with his commis sion to build the walls of Jerusalem Nor is that at all disagreeable to these histories in Josephus since Ezra came on the seventh and Nehemiah not till the twenty fifth of Xerxes at the interval of eighteen years  t Nehemiah ii 1â 6 ever assistance he wanted and as he pleased Leave off thy sorrow then said the king and be cheerful in tbs performance of thy office hereafter So Nehemiah worshipped God and gave the king thanks for his pro mise and cleared up his sad and cloudy countenance by the pleasure he had from the king s promises Accordingly the king called for him the next day and gave him an epistle to be carried to Adeus the governor of Syria and Phoenicia and Samaria wherein he sent to him to pay due honour to Nehe miah and to supply him with what he wanted for his building Now when he was come to Babylon and had taken with him many of his countrymen who voluntarily followed him he came to Je rusalem in the twenty fifth year of the reign of Xerxes And when he had shewn the epistle to God J he gave them to Adeus and to the other governors He also called to gether all the people to Jerusalem and stood in the midst oi the temple and made the fol lowing speech to them Ye know O Jews that God hath kept our fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in mind continually and for the sake of their righteousness hath not left off the care of you Indeed he hath assisted me in granting this authority of the king to raise up our wall and finish what is wanting of the temple I desire you there fore wno well know the ill will the neigh bouring nations bear to us and that when they once are made sensible that we are in earnest about building they will come upon us and contrive many ways of obstructing our works that you will in the first place put your trust in God as in him that will as sist us against their hatred and to intermit building neither night nor day but to use all diligence and to hasten on the work now we have this especial opportunity for it When he had said this he gave order that the rulers should measure the wall and part the work of it among the people according J This shewing king Xerxes s epistles to God or laying them open before God in the temple is very like the laying open the epistles of Sennacherib before him also by Hezekiah 2 Kings xix 14 Isaiah xxxvii 14 although this last was for a memorial to put him in mind of the enemies in order to move the divine compassion and the present as a token of gratitude for mercies already received as Havercamp well observes on thli place 402 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS to their villages and cities as every one s ability should require And when lie had added this promise that he himself with his servants would assist them he dissolved the assembly So the Jews prepared for the work This is the name they are called by from the day that they came up from Babylon which is taken from the tribe of Judah which came first to these places and thence both they and the country gained that appella tion Now when the Ammonites and Moabites and Samaritans and all that inhabited Coele syria heard that the building went on apace they took it heinously and proceeded to lay snares for them and to hinder their intentions They also slew many of the Jews and sought how they might destroy Nehemiah himself by hiring some of the foreigners to kill him They also put the Jews in fear and disturbed them and spread abroad rumours as if many nations were ready to make an expedition against them by which means they were harassed and had almost left off the building But none of these things could deter Nehe miah from being diligent about the work He only set a number of men about him as a guard to his body and so unweariedly per severed therein and was insensible of any trouble out of his desire to perfect this work â And thus did he attentively and with great precaution take care of his own safety not that he feared death but out of this persua sion that if he were dead the walls for his citizens would never be raised He also gave orders that the builders should keep their ranks and have their armour on while they were building Accordingly the mason had his sword on as well as Tie that brought the materials for building He also appointed that their shields should lie very near them and he placed trumpets at every five hundred  Nehemiah iv 18 t It may not be improper to remark here with what an unusual accuracy Josephus determines these years of Xerxes in which the walls of Jerusalem were built viz that Nehemiah came with his commission in the 25th of Xerxes that the walls were two years and four months in building and that they were finished on the 28th of Xerxes It may also be remarked farther that Josephus hardly ever mentions more than one infallible astrono mical character I mean an eclipse of the moon and this a little before the death of Herod the Great XVII 6 feet and charged them that if their enemies appeared they should give notice of it to the people that they might fight in their armour and their enemies might not fall upon them naked He also went about the compass of the city by night being never discouraged neither about the work itself nor about his own diet and sleep for he made no use of those things for his pleasure but out of ne cessity And this trouble he underwent ffor two years and four months for in so long a time was the wall built in the twenty eighth year of the reign of Xerxes in the ninth month Now when the walls were finished Nehemiah and the multitude offered sacrifices to God for building of them and they con tinued in feasting eight days However when the nations which dwelt in Syria heard that the building of the wall was finished they had indignation at it But when Nehemiah saw that the city was thin of people he ex horted the priests and the Levites that they would leave the country and remove them selves to the city and there continue and he built them houses at his own expense and he commanded that part of the people which were employed in cultivating the land to bring the tithes of their fruits to Jerusalem that the priests and Levites having whereof they might live perpetually might not leave the divine worship Accordingly they heark ened to the constitutions of Nehemiah by which means the city of Jerusalem came to be fuller of people than it was before So when Nehemiah had done many other excel lent things and things worthy of commenda tion in a glorious manner he came to a great age and then died He was a man of a good and righteous disposition and very ambitious to make his own people happy And he left the walls of Jerusalem as an eternal monu ment for himself Now this was done in the days of Xerxes Now on these two chronological characters in great mea sure depend some of the most important points belonging to Christianity viz The explication of Daniel s seventy weeks the duration of our Saviour s ministry and the time of his death in correspondence to those seventy weeks Though Josephus s own chronology was so dif ferent from ours as exhibited in Ptolemy s Canon that it was impossible he should have regard to any such cor respondence J An 459 AK 457 403 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP VI concerning esther mordecai and hahan and the Imminent danger to which the whole

the government over the Persians the whole nation of the Jews J with their wives and children were in danger of perishing the occasion whereof we shall declare in a little time For it is proper in the first place to explain somewhat relating to this king and how he came to marry a Jewish wife who was also of the royal family and who is related to have saved our nation For when Artaxerxes had taken

of Persia and for their governors such a one as was proper for a king to make when he had a mind to make a public demonstration of his riches and this for a hundred and eighty days Af ter which he made a feast for other nations and for their ambassadors at Shushan for seven days Now this feast was ordered after the following manner He caused a tent to be pitched which was supported by pillars of gold and silver with curtains of linen and purple spread over them that it might afford room for many thousands to sit down The cups which the waiters ministered were of gold and adorned with precious stones He also gave order to the servants that they should not force the guests to drink by bring ing them wine continually as is the practice of the Persians but to permit every one to follow his own inclination Moreover he sent  About an 457 t This prince to distinguish him from others of that name was called Maxpox p orLongimanus upon the sup posed length of his hands with which

learned and judicious Dr Wall in his late posthumous critical notes upon all the other Hebrew books of the Old Testament gives us none upon the Canticles or upon Esther and seems thereby to give up this book as well as the Canticles as indefensible I shall venture to say that almost all the objections against this book of Esther are obviated at once if as we ought certainly to do and as Dean Prideaux has justly done we place this history under Artaxerxes Longimanus as do both the Septuagint interpreters and Josephus I mean in this case we also take our true copies from the Septuagint and from Jose phus rather than from our Masorete Hebrew I shall here add farther on its behalf the words of the learned Dr Lee in his posthumous Dissertation on the second book of Esdras page 25 that The truth of this history is demonstrated by the feast of Purim kept from that time to this very day See 2 Maccabees xv 36 And this surprising Providential revolution in favour of a captive people thereby constantly commemorated standeth even upon a firmer basis than that there ever was such a man as Alexander the Great in the world of whose reign there is no such abiding monument at this day to be found any where Nor will they I dare say who quar rel at this or any other of the sacred historians find it a very easy matter to reconcile the different accounts which are given by historians of the affairs qf this king or to confirm any one fact of his whatever with the same evi dence which is here given for the principal fact in this voL I â NOS 33  34 sacTed book or even so much as to prove

occasion of this great festival is very likely In timated to us in the phrase When the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom chap i 2 i e enjoying peace and tranquillity through his large dominions for the history of his accession to the throne is this â Xerxes his father was privately murdered by Artabanus captain of his guard He coming to him who was then but the third son made him believe that Darius his elder bro ther had done it to make his way to the throne and had a design likewise to cut him off to secure himself in it This Ahasuerus believing went immediately to his bro ther s apartment and by the assistance of the wicked Ar tabanus and his guards slew him thinking all the while that he acted but in his own defence Artabanus s drift was to seize on the throne himself but for the present he took Ahasuerus and placed him thereon with a design to pull him down as soon as matters were ripe for his own ascent but when Ahasuerus understood this from Maga byzus who had married one of his sisters he took care to counterplot Artabanus and to cut him and his whole party off before his treason was come to maturity and for this and some other successes against his brother Hystaspes which settled him in a peaceable possession of the whole Persian empire very probably it was that a festival season of above a hundred and fourscore days continuance was appointed

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS messengers through the country and gave order that they should have a remission of their labours and should keep a festival many days on account of his kingdom In like manner did Vashti the queen gather her guests together and made them a feast in the palace Now the king was desirous to shew her who exceeded all other women in beauty to those that feasted with him and sent some to command her to come to his feast But she out of regard to the laws of the Persians which forbid the wives to be seen by stran gers did not go to the king And though he repeatedly sent the eunuchs to her she did nevertheless refuse to come till the king was so much irritated that he broke up the entertainment and rose up and called for those seven who had the interpretation of the laws committed to them and accused his wife and said that he had been affronted by her because when she was frequently called by him to his feast she did not obey him He therefore gave order that they should in form him what could be done by the law against her So one of them whose name was Memucan said that this affront was of fered not to him alone but to all the Persians who were in danger of leading their lives very ill with their wives if they must be despised by them For that none of their wives would have any reverence for their husbands if they had such an example of arrogance in the queen towards him who ruled over all Accordingly he exhorted him to punish her who had been guilty of so great an affront to him after a severe manner and when he had so done to publish to the nations what had been decreed about the queen So the resolution was to put Vashti away and to give her dignity to another woman f But the king having been fond of her did not well bear a separation and yet by the law he could not admit of a reconciliation So he was under trouble as not having it in his power to do what he desired But when his friends saw him so uneasy they advised him to cast the memory of his wife and his love for her out of his mind and to send abroad over all the habitable earth and to search out for comely virgins and to take her whom he should best like for his wife be cause his passion for his former wife would be quenched by the introduction of another and the kindness he had for Vashti would be withdrawn from her and be placed on her that was with him Accordingly he was per suaded to follow this advice and gave order to certain persons to choose out of the vir gins that were in his kingdom those that were esteemed to be most comely So when a great number of these virgins were gather ed together there was found a damsel in Babylon whose parents were dead and she was brought with her uncle Mordecai who was of the tribe of Benjamin and one of the principal persons among the Jews Now it proved that this damsel whose name was Esther was the most beautiful of all the rest and that the grace of her countenance drew the eyes of the spectators principally upon her So she was committed to one of the eunuchs to take the care of her and she was provided with odours and with costly ointments such as her body required to be anointed withal J And this was used for six months by the virgins who were in number  It has been a great inquiry among the learned who this Vashti was Those who make the Ahasuerus in Scrip ture to be Darius the son of Hystaspes suppose that she was Atossa the daughter of Cyrus who was first married to Cambyses her own brother then to the Magian who would have passed for Smerdis and last of all to Darius Others suppose that she was Ahasnerus s own sister be ca i e the Persians in those days made no scruple in these kind of marriages though there is much more reason to think that before her marriage there had been such a collection of virgins made for the use of the king as was before Esther s this is implied in chap ii 19 and that having the good fortune then of obtaining the preference in the king s esteem she was created queen but being perhaps a woman of no high descent her family extrac tion for that reason might be concealei CalmeCs Die tionary under the name B t Esther ii 3 4 j The reason is assigned in

soft and smooth and clear it from all man ner of scurf and for six more with sweet odours which in these hot countries were necessary to take away all ill scents and as some think to make the body more vigor ous But besides this there might be something of state in making those vassals for such they were accounted wait before they were admitted to the honour of the king s bed and something of

bed he sent one to be with the king every day So when he had ac companied with her he sent her back to the eunuch And when Esther had come to him he was pleased with her and fell in love with the damsel and married her and made her his lawful wife and kept a wed ding feast for her on the twelfth month of the seventh year of his reign which was called Adar He also sent Angari as they are called or messengers into every nation and gave orders that they should keep a feast for his marriage while he himself treated the Persians and the Medes and the principal men of the nations for a whole month Ac cordingly Esther came to his royal palace and he set a diadem pn her head and thus was she married f without making known to the king what nation she was derived from Her uncle also removed from Babylon to Shushan and dwelt there being every day about the palace and inquiring how the damsel did for he loved her as though she had been his own daughter Now the king had made a law that none of his own people should approach him4 un less he were called when ne sat upon his throne And men with axes in their hands stood round about his throne in order to punish such as approached to him without being called However the king sat with a golden sceptre in his hand which he held out when he had a mind to save any one of those that approached to him without being called and he who touched it was free from danger Some time after this two eunuchs Big than and Teresh conspired against the king and Barnabazus the servant of one of the eunuchs being by birth a Jew was acquainted with their conspiracy and dis covered it to the queen s uncle And Mor decai by the means of Esther made the conspirators known to the king Â This trou bled the king but he discovered the truth and hanged the eunuchs upon a cross At that time however he gave no reward to Mordecai who had been the occasion of his preservation He only bade the scribes to set down his name in the records and bade him stay in the palace as an intimate friend of the king s Now there was one Haman the son of Amedatha by birth an Amalekite that used to go in to the king and the foreigners and Persians worshipped him as Artaxerxes had commanded that such honour should be paid to him But Mordecai was so wise and so observant of his country s laws that he would not worship the man When Haman ob served this he inquired whence he came and when he understood that he was a Jew   Esther ii 17 t According to this account of things this Persian mo narch seems to have had but one wife at least but one in chief favour and esteem with him though it is certain he could not fail of having an infinite number of secondary wives or concubines This was the name of every one that was taken from among the virgins who had a separate house for themselves and conducted to the king s bed where having passed a night she returned no more to the virgins apartments but was the next morning received into the house of the concubines and there treated in the state and port of one of the king s wives for such they Were accounted No man was permitted to marry them as long as the king lived and upon his demise they generally fell to his successor Of these Darius Nothus is reckoned to have had no less than three hundred and sixty Pool s Annotations The manner of the Persian king was to give his queens at their marriage such a city to buy them clothes another for their hair another for their necklaces and so on for the rest of their ex penses And as it was customary for him according to the testimony of Herodotus upon his accession to the throne to remit the tribute that was due to him from all the cities so he might upon this occasion out of his abundant joy make a release to the provinces and forgive them some of the duties and imposts that they were bound to pay him Patrick s Commentary B J Take here Dr Hudson s note which ie this Hero dotus shews lib I cap 99 that this law against any one s coming uncalled to the kings of Persia when they were sitting on their thrones was first enacted by Dejoces i e by him who first withdrew the Medes from the dominion of the Assyrians and himself first reigned over thera Thus also says Spanheim stood guards with their axes about the throne of Tenus or Tenelus that the offender might by them be punished immediately II Those were two great men who perhaps kept the door of the king s bed chamber and being either incensed at the divorce of Vashti whose creatures they were or at the advancement of Esther who in all probability would raise her kinsman Mordecai to a superiority over them took disgust thereat and so resolved to revenge themselves on the king for it Prideaux s Connection and Patrick s Commentary B Â Esther ii 21 22  Whether this adoration required of Mordecai to Ha man were by hhn deemed too like the adoration due only to God as Josephus seems here to think  as well as their Septuagint interpreters also by their translation of Esther xiii 12 13 14 of whether he thought he ought to pay 3X2 406 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he had indignation at him and said within himself Whereas the Persians who are free men worship me this man who is no better than a slave does not vouchsafe to do eo And when he desired to punish Morde cai he thought it too small a thing to request of the king that he alone might be punished He rather determined to extirpate the whole nation For he was naturally an enemy to the Jews because the nation of the Amale kites of which he was had been destroyed by them Accordingly he came to the king and accused them saying There is a cer tain wicked nation and it is dispersed over all the habitable earth that is under thy do minion a nation separate from others unso ciable neither admitting the same sort of divine worship that others do not using laws like the laws of others at enmity with thy people and with all men both in their man ners and practices Now if thou wilt be a benefactor to thy subjects thou wilt give order to destroy them utterly and not leave the least remains of them nor preserve any of them either for slaves or for captives But that the king might not be injured by the loss of the tributes which the Jews paid him Haman promised to give him out of his own estate forty thousand talents whenever he pleased And he said he would pay this money very willingly that the kingdom might be freed from such a misfortune When Haman had made this petition the king both forgave him the money and granted him the men to do what he would with them So Haman having gained what he desired sentf out immediately a decree as from the king to all nations the contents whereof were these Artaxerxes the great king to the rulers of the hundred and twenty seven provinces from India to Ethiopia sends this writing Whereas I have governed many nations and obtained the dominion of all the habitable earth according to my desire and have not been obliged to do any thing that is insolent or cruel to my subjects by such my power but have shewn myself mild and gen tle by taking care of their peace and good order and have sought how they might enjoy those blessings for all time to come And whereas Haman who on account of his pru dence and justice is the first in my esteem and in dignity and only second to myself for his fidelity and constant good will to me hath kindly informed me that there is an ill natured nation intermixed with all mankind that is averse from our laws and not subject to kings and of a different conduct of life from others and of a disposition pernicious to our affairs I give order that all these men of whom Haman our second father hath in formed us be destroyed with their wives and children and that none of them be spared and that none prefer pity to them before obe dience to this decree And this I will to be executed on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month of this present year so that when all that have enmity to us are destroyed and this in one day we may be allowed to lead the rest of our lives in peace hereafter Now when this decree was brought to the cities and to the country all were ready for the de struction and entire extirpation of the Jews against the appointed day And they were very hasty about it at Shushan in particular Accordingly the king and Haman spent their time in feasting together with good cheer and wine but the city was in Jdisorder no sort of adoration to an Amalekite which nation had been such great sinners as to have been universally de voted to destruction by God himself Exod xvii 14 15 16 1 Sam xv 18 or whether both causes occurred cannot now be entirely determined  See Exod xvii 8 â 16 and 1 Sara xv t The first institution of posts is generally ascribed to the Persians for the kings of Persia as Diodorus Sicu lus lib 19 observes that they might have intelligence of what passed in all the provinces of their vast dominions placed sentinels on eminences at convenient distances where towers were built and these sentinels gave notice of public occurrences to one another with a very loud and shrill voice by which means news was transmitted from one extremity of the kingdom to the other with great ex pedition But as this could be practised only in the case of general news which might be communicated to the whole nation Cyrus as Xenophon relates Cyropaed lib 8 set up couriers places for post horses on all high roads and offices where they might deliver their packets to one another This says our author they did night and day so that no rain or hard weather being to stop them in the judgment of many they went faster than cranes could fly The like is said in Herodotus lib 8 And he acquaints us farther that Xerxes in his famous expedition against Greece planted posts from the jEgean sea to Shushan at certain distances as far as a horse could ride with speed that thereby he might send notice to the capital city of whatever might happen in his army Calmefs Dictionary under the word B  Esther iii 15 11 Not only the Jews but a great many others in Shu ax 453 407 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now when Mordecai was informed of what was done he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes upon his head and went about the city crying out that a nation that had been injurious to no man was to be destroyed And he went on saying thus as far as to the king s palace and there he stood For it was not lawful for him to go into it in that habit The same thing was done by all the Jews that were in the several cities wherein this decree was published with lamentation and mourning on account of the calamities denounced against them But as soon as certain persons had told the queen that Mordecai stood before the court in a mourning habit she was disturbed at this report and sent out such as should change his garments But when he could not be in duced to put off his sackcloth because the sad occasion that forced him to put it on was not yet ceased she called the eunuch Aeratheus for he was then present and sent him to Mordecai in order to learn what sad acci dent had befallen him for which he was in mourning and would not put off that habit at her desire Then did Mordecai inform the eunuch of the occasion of his mourning and of the decree which was sent by the king into all the country and of the promise of money whereby Haman bought the destruction of their nation He also gave him a copy of what was proclaimed at Shushan to be car ried to Esther and he charged her to petition the king about this matter and not to think it a dishonourable thing in her to put on a hum ble habit for the safety of her nation wherein she might deprecate the ruin of the Jews who were in danger of it For that Haman whose dignity was only inferior to that of the king had accused the Jews and had irritated the king against them When she was in formed of this she sent to Mordecai again and told him that she was not called by the king and that he who should presume to go in to him without being called would certainly be slain f unless it happened that the king held out his golden sceptre to him in which case alone he could obtain pardon and be entirely preserved Now when the eunuch carried this message from Esther to Mordecai he bade him tell her that she must not only pro vide for her own safety but for the common preservation of her nation For that if she now neglected this opportunity there would certainly arise help to them from God some other way but she and her father s house would be destroyed by those whom she now despised But Esther sent the same eunuch back to Mordecai to desire him to go to Shu shan and to gather the Jews that were there together to a congregation and to fast and to abstain from all sorts of food on her ac shan might be concerned at this horrid decree either because they were related to them or engaged with them in worldly concerns or perhaps out of mere humanity and compassion to so vast a number of innocent people now appointed as sheep for the slaughter They might ap prehend likewise that upon the execution of the decree some sedition or tumult might ensue that in so great a slaughter it was hard to tell who would escape without oeing killed or plundered because those who were em ployed in this bloody work would be more mindful to enrich themselves than to observe their orders Pool t An notations and Patrick s and Le Clerc s Commentaries B  The latter Targum upon the book of Esther gives us this account of Mordecai s behaviour upon this sad occasion viz that in the midst of the streets he made his complaint saying What a heavy decree is this which the king and Haman have passed not against a part of us but against us all to root us out of the earth Whereupon all the Jews flocked about him and having caused the book of the law to be brought to the gate of Shushan he being covered with sackcloth read therein these words out of Deut iv 30 31 When thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee in the latter days if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shalt be obedient to his voice for the Lord thy God is a merciful God he will not forsake thee nor destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them After which he exhorted them to fasting humiliation and repentance ac cording to the example of the Ninevites Patrick s Com B t Ever since the reign of Dejoces king of Media Herodotus lib I informs that for the preservation of royal majesty it was enacted That no one should be admitted into the king s presence but that if he had any business with him he should transact it by the inter course of his ministers The custom passed from the Medes to the Persians and therefore we find it in the same historian lib 3 that after the seven Persian princes had killed the Magian who had usurped the throne they came to this agreement that whoever should be elected king should allow the others to have at all times a ready access to his presence which is an implication that they had it not before whenever they should desire it except only when he was accompanied with any of his wives This therefore was the ancient law of the country and not procured by Haman as some imagine though it cannot be denied but that the reason of the law at first might be not only the preservation of the majesty and safety of the king s person but a contrivance likewise of the great officers of state that they might engross the king to themselves by allowing admittance to none but whom they should think proper to introduce Pool s Annotations and Le Clerc s Commentary B 108 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS count and to let him know that she with her maidens would do the same and then she promised that she would go to the king though it were against the law and that if she must die she would not refuse it Accordingly Mordecai did as Esther had enjoined him and made the people fast f and he besought God together with them not to overlook his nation particularly at this time when it was going to be destroyed But that as he had often before provided for them and forgiven them when they had sinned so he would now deliver them from that destruction which was denounced against them For al though it was not the nation that had at all offended yet must they so ingloriously be slain and that he was himself the occasion of the wrath of Haman because said he I did not worship him nor could I endure to pay that honour to him which I used to pay to thee O Lord For upon that his anger hath he contrived this present mischief against those that have not transgressed thy laws The same supplications did the multitude put up and entreated that God would pro vide for their deliverance and free the Is raelites that were in all the earth from this calamity which was now coming upon them For they had it before their eyes and ex pected its coming Accordingly Esther made supplication to God after the manner of her country by prostrating herself upon the earth and putting on her mourning garments and bidding farewell to meat and drink and all delicacies for three days time and she entreated God to have mercy upon her and make her words appear persuasive to the king and render her countenance more beau tiful than it was before that by both her words and beauty she might succeed for the averting of the king s anger in case he was irritated against her and for the consolation of those of her own country now they were in the utmost danger of perishing as also that he would excite a hatred in the king against the enemies of the Jews and those that had contrived their future destruction if they proved to be contemned by him When Esther had offered this supplication for three days she put off those garments and changed her habit and adorned herself as became a queen and took two of her handmaids with her one of whom supported her as she gently leaned upon her and the other followed after and held up her large train with the extremities of her fingers And thus she came to the king having a blushing redness in her countenance with a pleasant agreeableness in her behaviour Yet did she go in to him with fear And as soon as she was come over against him as he was sitting on his throne in his royal apparel which was a garment interwoven with gold and precious stones which made him seem to her more terrible especially when he looked at her somewhat severely and with a counte nance on fire with anger her joints failed her out of the dread she was in and she fell down sideways in a swoon But the king changed his mind which happened as I suppose by the will of God and was con cerned for his wife lest her fear should bring some ill thing upon her and he leaped from his throne and took her in his arms and re covered her by embracing her and speaking comfortably to her and exhorting her to be of good cheer and not to suspect any thing that was sad on account of her coming to him without being called because the law was made for subjects but that she who was a queen might be entirely secure And as he said this he put the sceptre into her hand J and laid his rod upon her neck on account of the law and so freed her from her fear And after she had recovered her self by these encouragements she said My lord it is not easy for me on the sudden to say what hath happened for as soon as I saw thee to be great and comely and terri ble my spirit departed from me and I had no soul left in me And while it was with difficulty and in a low voice that she cottid  Esther iv 16 t This is not to be understood as if the people were to take no manner of sustenance for three days because few or none could undergo that but only either that they should abstain from all delicacies and content them selves with coarse fare as Josephus expounds it or that they should make no set meals of dinner or supper in their families but eat and drink no more than would suffice to sustain nature and support them in prayer to God for a blessing upon her undertaking Patrick s and Le Cterc s Commentaries B J A sceptre was the ensign of the highest and most absolute authority and therefore some have observed that when Mordecai was advanced to the greatest dignity next the king having the royal robes and other ensigns of royal dignity no mention is made of any sceptre for aN 453 409 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS say thus much the king was in great agony and disorder and encouraged Esther to be of good cheer and to expect better fortune since he was ready if occasion should re quire it to grant to her the half of his king dom Accordingly Esther desired that he and his friend Haman would come to her to a banquet for she said she had prepared a supper for him Accordingly he consented and when they were there as they were drinking he bade Esther tell him what she desired for that she should not be disap lointed though she should desire the half of lis kingdom But she put off the discovery of her petition till the next day if he would come again together with Haman to her banquet Now when the king had promised so to do Haman went away very joyful because he alone had the honour of supping with the king at Esther s banquet and because no one else partook of the same honour with kings but himself Yet when he saw Morde cai in the court he was very much displeased for he paid him no manner of respect when he saw him So he went home and called for his wife Zeresh and his friends and when they were come he shewed them what honour he had enjoyed not only from the king but from the queen also For as he alone had that day supped with her together with the king so was he also invited again for the next day Yet said he I am not pleased to see Mordecai the Jew in the court Hereupon his wife Zeresh advised him to give order that a gallows should be made fifty cubits high and that in the mor ning he should ask it of the king that Mor decai might be hanged thereon So he com mended her advice and gave order to his servants to prepare the gallows and to place it in the court for the punishment of Morde cai thereon which was accordingly pre pared But God laughed to scorn the wick ed expectations of Haman for that night he took away the king s sleep and as the king was not willing to lose the time of his lying awake but to spend it in something that might be of advantage to his kingdom he commanded the scribe to bring him the chronicles of the former kings and the re cords of his own actions And when he had brought them and was reading them one was found to have received a country on ac count of his excellent management on a cer tain occasion and the name of the country was set down Another was found to have had a present made him on account of his fidelity Then the scribe came to Bigthan and Teresh the eunuchs who had formed a conspiracy against the king which Mordecai had discovered And when the scribe said no more but that and was going on to an other history the king stopped him and in quired if it were not added that Mordecai had a reward given him And when he said there was no such addition he bade him leave oflf and he inquired of those that were appointed for that purpose what hour of the night it was And when he was informed that it was already day he gave order that if they found any one of his friends already come and standing before the court they should tell him Now it happened that Ha man was found there for he was come soon er than ordinary to petition the king to have Mordecai put to death f And when the ser vants said that Haman was before the court he bade them call him in And when he was come in he said Because I know that thou art a sincere friend I desire thee to give me advice how I may honour one that I greatly love and that after a manner suitable to my magnificence Now Haman reasoned with himself that what opinion he should give it would be for himself since it was he alone who was beloved by the king So he gave that advice which he thought of all other the best For he said If thou would est truly that was proper and peculiar to the king and the queen s touching or as some say kissing it was a token of her subjection and thankfulness for his favour B  Esther v 8 t It may seem a little strange that so proud a man as Haman was should not be prompted immediately to avenge himself on Mordecai for his contemptuous usage of him since he had enough about him no doubt who upon the least intimation of his pleasure would have done it and since he who had interest enough with his prince to procure a decree for the destruction of a whole nation might easily have obtained a pardon for having killed one obscure and infamous member of it But herein did the wise and powerful providence of God appear that it dis posed Haman s heart contrary to his own inclination and interest instead of employing his power against his ene my to put fetters as it were upon his own hands PnrJ Annotations B 410 book xi ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS honour a man whom thou dost love give or der that he may ride on horseback with the same garment which thou wearest and with a gold

which Haman gave out of a supposal that such re ward would come to himself f Hereupon the king was pleased with the advice and said Go thou therefore for thou hast the horse the garment and the chain Ask for Mordecai the Jew and give him those things and go before his horse and proclaim accor dingly for thou art my intimate friend and hast given me good advice Be thou then he minister of what thou

thought all the honours he specifieJ were designed for him was arrived we may observe that for any one to put on the royal robe with out the privity and consent of the king was among the Persians accounted a capital crime To which purpose Plutarch in his life of Artaxerxes has related this story â That one day when in hunting the king happened to tear his garment and Tiribazus was telling him of it the king asked him what he should do Why put on another says Tiribazus and give that to me That I will says the king but then I enjoin you not to wear it Tiri bazus however who was a good kind of man enough but a little weak and silly adventured to put it on with all its fine ornaments and when some of the nobles began to resent it as a thing not lawful for any subject to do I allow him says the king laughing at the figure he made to wear the fine trinkets as a woman and the robe as a madman Le Clerc s Commentary There was a custom not unlike this among the Hebrews as appears from the history of Solomon 1 Kings i 33 for the person that was declared to be successor to the crown on the day of his inauguration to be mounted on the king s horse and to the like custom among the Persians it is highly probable that the poet Statius in his description of a young king succeeding to his father s throne may allude Sicut Ahaemenius solium gentesque paternas Excepit si forte puer cui vivere patrem Tutius incerta formidine gaudia librat An fidi proceres an pugnet vulgus habenis Cui latus Euphratae cui Caspia limina mandet Samere nunc arcus ipsumque onerare veretur before the court clothed in sackcloth he bade him put that garment off and put the purple garment on But Mordecai not know ing the truth of the matter but thinking that it was done in mockery said O thou wretch the vilest of all mankind dost thou thus laugh at our calamities But when he was satisfied that the king bestowed this honour upon him for the deliverance he had procured him when he convicted the eunuchs who had conspired against him he put on that purple garment which the king always wore and put the chain about his neck and got on horseback and went round the city while Haman went before and proclaimed This shall be the reward which the king will bestow on every one whom he loves and esteems worthy of honour And when they had gone round the city Mordecai went in to the king But Haman went home out of shame and informed his wife and friends of what had happened and this with tears up on which they said he would never be able to be revenged on Mordecai for that God was with him Patris equum visusque sibi nee sceptra capaci Sustentare manu nee adhuc implere tiaram Thebaid lib 8 B J Commentators arc not agreed whether this crown was placed upon the king s head or his horse s Those who refer it to the king will have it to be what we call a turban made of fine white and pure linen which it was death for any one to put on his head without the king s express order to which purpose Arrian Alex exped lib 7 tells us this story â That as Alexander was sail ing on the Euphrates and his turban happened to fall off among some reeds one of the watermen immediately jumped in and swam to it but as he could not bring it back in his hand without wetting it he put it upon his head and so returned with it Whereupon most histo rians that have wrote of Alexander says he tells us that he gave him a talent of silver for this expression of his zeal to serve him but at the same time ordered his head to be struck off for presuming to put on the royal diadem Other commentators are of opinion that this Keter which we render crown being a word of a large signification will equally denote that ornament which the horse that the king rode wore upon his head As it must be acknow ledged that this application of the thing agrees better with the signification and order of the Hebrew words with the following verses wherein no mention is made ol the Keter but only of the robe and the horse to which this crown belonged and with the custom of the Persians Â who used to put a certain ornament in Italian called fiocco upon the head of that hor r whereon the king was mounted Le Clerc s

away to come to supper But one of the eu nuchs named Sabuchadas saw the gallows that was fixed in Haman s house and inquired of one of his servants for what purpose they had prepared it So he knew that it was for the queen s uncle because Haman was about to petition the king that he might be punished But at present he held his peace Now when the king with Haman were at the banquet he desired the queen to tell him what gift she desired to obtain and assured her that she should have whatsoever she had a mind to She then lamented the danger her peo ple were in and said that she and her nation were given up to be destroyed and that she on that account made this petition That she would not have troubled him if he had only given order that they should be sold into servitude for such a misfortune would not have been intolerable But she desired that they might be delivered from such a destruc tion And when the king inquired of her who was the author of this misery to them she only accused Haman and convicted him that he had been the wicked instrument of this and had formed this plot against them When the king was hereupon in disorder and was gone hastily out of the banquet into the gardens Haman began to intercede with Esther and to beseech her to forgive him as to what he had offended for he perceived that he was in a very bad case And as he had fallen upon the queen s bed and was making supplication to her the king came in and being still more provoked at what he saw O thou wretch said he thou vilest of all mankind dost thou aim to force my wife And when Haman was astonished at this and not able to speak one word more Sabuchadas the eunuch came in and accused Haman and said he found a gallows fifty cubits high at his house prepared for Mor decai for that the servant told him so much upon his inquiry when he was sent to him to call him to supper When the king heard this he determined that Haman should be punished after no other manner than that which had been devised by him against Mordecai So he gave order immediately that he should be hung upon that gallows and be put to death after that manner f And from hence I cannot forbear to admire God and to learn hence his wisdom and his justice and not only in punishing the wick edness of Haman but in so disposing it that he should undergo the very same punish ment which he had contrived for another As also because thereby he teaches others this lesson that what mischiefs any one pre pares against another he without knowing of it first contrives it against himself Wherefore Haman who had immoderately abused the honour he had from the king was destroyed after this manner and the king granted his estate to the queen He also called for Mordacai for Esther had informed him that she was related to him and gave him that ring which he had before given to Haman The queen also gave Haman s es tate to Mordecai and prayed the king to de liver the nation of the Jews from the fear of death and shewed him what had been writ ten over all the country by Haman the son of Amedatha For that if her country were destroyed and her countrymen were to perish she could not bear to live any longer So the king promised that he would not do any thing that should be disagreeable to her nor con tradict what she desired but he bade her write what she pleased about the Jews in the king s name and seal it with his seal and send it to all his kingdom for that those who read epistles whose authority was secured by having the king s seal to them would no way contradict what was written therein So

benefactor and my saviour and by basely and treache rously requiring to have Esther the partner of my life and of my dominion brought to destruction For he contrived by this means to deprive me of my faithful friends and transfer the government to others But since I perceived that these Jews that were by this pernicious fellow devoted to destruction were not wicked men but con ducted their lives in the best manner and were men dedicated to the worship of that God who hath preserved the kingdom to me and my ancestors I do not only free them from the punishment which the former epistle which was sent by Haman ordered to be in flicted on them to which if you refuse obe dience you shall do well but I will that they have all honour paid them Accordingly I have hanged up the man that contrived such things against them with his family before the gates of Shushan that punishment being sent upon him from God who seeth all things And I give you in charge that you publicly propose a copy of this epistle through all my kingdom that the Jews may be permitted peaceably to use their own laws and that you assist them that at the same season whereto their miserable estate did belong they may defend themselves the very same day from unjust violence the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is Adar For God hath made that day a day of salvation instead of a day of destruction to them And may it be a good day to those that wish us well and a memorial of the punishment of the conspirators against us And I will that properly revoke his former barbarous decree for the uni versal slaughter of the Jews but only empowered and encouraged the Jews to fight for their lives and to kill their enemies if they attempted their destruction seems to have been that old law of the Medes and Persians not yet laid aside that whatever decree was signed both by the king and his lords could not be changed but re mained unalterable Daniel vi 7 8 9 12 IS 17 Esther i 19 viii 8 And Haman having engrossed the royal fa vour might perhaps have himself signed this decree for the Jews slaughter instead of the ancient lords and so might have rendered it by their rulers irrevocable  These words give an intimation as if Artaxerxes sus pected a deeper design in Haman than openly appeared viz that knowing the Jews would be faithful to him and that he could never transfer the crown to his own family who was an Agagite Esther iii 1 10 or of the posterity of Agag the old king of the Amalekites 1 Sam xv 8 32 33 while they were alive and spread over all his do minions he therefore endeavoured to destroy them Nor is it to me improbable that those 75 000 of the Jews enemies who were soon destroyed by the Jews on the permission of the king which must be on some great occasion were Amalekites their old and hereditary ene mies Exod xvii 14 15 and that thereby was fulfilled Balaam s prophecy Amalek was the first of the na tions but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever Numb xxiv 20 ait 453 413 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS you take notice that every city and every nation that shall disobey any thing contained in this epistle shall be destroyed by fire and sword However let this epistle be published through all the country that is under our obedience and let all the Jews by all means be ready against the day be forementioned that they may avenge them selves upon their enemies Accordingly the horsemen who carried the epistle proceeded on the ways which they were to go with speed But as for Morde cai as soon as he had assumed the royal gar ment and the crown of gold and had put the chain about his neck he went forth in a pub lic procession And when the Jews who were in Shushan saw him in so great honour with the king they thought his good fortune was common to themselves also and joy and a beam of salvation encompassed the Jews both those that were in the cities and those that were in the countries upon the publica tion of the king s letters insomuch that many even of other nations circumcised themselves for fear of the Jews that they might procure safety to themselves thereby For on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which according to the Hebrews is called Adar but according to the Macedonians Dystrus those that carried the king s epistle gave them no tice that the same day wherein their danger was to have been on that very day should they destroy their enemies But now the rulers of the provinces and the tyrants and the kings and the scribes had the Jews in esteem For the fear they were in of Morde cai forced them to act with discretion Now when the royal decree was come to all the country that was subject to the king the Jews at Shushan slew five hundred of their enemies And when the king had told Esther the number of those that were slain in that city but did not well know what had been done in the provinces he asked her whether she would have any thing farther done against them for that it should be done accordingly Upon which she desired that the Jews might be permitted to treat their remaining enemies in the same manner the next day as also that they might hang the ten sons of Haman upon the gallows f So the king permitted the Jews to do so as de sirous not to contradict Esther So they gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month Dystrus and slew about three hundred of their ene mies but Jtouched nothing of what riches they had Now there were slain by the Jews that were in the country and in the other cities seventy five thousand of their enemies and these were slain on the thirteenth day of the month and the next day they kept as a festival In like manner the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together and  It might be presumed that some out of hatred to the Jews might be inclinable to obey Human s decree for though he himself was gone yet it cannot be imagined that all the friends and creatures that he had made perished with him He might have a great party every where and some of them so furiously enraged at his fall as even at the hazard of their own lives would not fail to shew their indignation at those who were the occasion of it and therefore this second decree procured by Morde cai gave them authority if any attempt was made upon them either in great bodies or small parties not only to defend themselves and repel them but to make as great a slaughter of them as they were able and even to take possession of their goods as Haman had procured them license chap iii 13 to seize the goods of the Jews Patrick s Commentary B t It is not unlikely that many might be enraged at his death and his sons in particular might set them selves at the head of those who were bold enough to attempt the destruction of the Jews in Shushan being resolved to reveDge their father s death though in so doing they were sure to meet their own And this seems to suggest one reason why Esther was so solicitous to have their dead bodies for they were slain already hung upon the gallows chap ix 13 even because they had shewn more malice and indignation against the Jews and on the day when the cruel edict came to take place had made more desperate attacks upon them than any though the reason of the state in this severity might be to ex pose the family to the greater infamy and to deter other counsellors from abusing the king at any time with false representations For though the Jews suffered none to hang on the tree as they call the gallows longer than till the evening of the day whereon they were executed yet other nations let them hang until they were consumed as appears from the story of the Gibeonites 2 Sam xxi 9 10 or devoured by crows vultures or other ravenous creatures from whence that vulgar saying among the Romans pascere in cruce corvos had its rise Patrick s Commentary and Pool s Annotations B t See 1 Sam xv 9 14 15 19 21 II Pur in the Persian language signifies a lot and the feast of Purim or lots which had its name from Ha inan s casting lots in order to divine which would be most lucky to prefix for the murder of all the Jews in the whole Persian dominions is to this very day celebrated by the Jews with some peculiar ceremonies but most of them reducible to these three things reading resting and feasting Before the reading which is performed in the synagogue and begins in the evening as soon as the 3Y2 414 BOOK XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS feasted on the fourteenth day and that which followed it Whence it is that even now all the Jews that are in the habitable earth keep these days as a festival and send portions to one another Mordecai also wrote to the Jews that lived in the kingdom of Artaxerxes to observe these days and celebrate them as festivals and to deliver them down to pos terity that this festival might continue for all time to come and that it might never be buried in oblivion For since they were about to be destroyed by Haman they would do a right thing upon escaping the danger in them and on their inflicting punishment on their enemies to observe those days and give thanks to God on them For which cause the Jews still keep the aforementioned days and call them days of Purim And Mor decai became a great and illustrious person with the king and assisted him in the govern ment of the people He also lived with the queen So that the affairs of the Jews were by their means better than they could ever have hoped for And this was the state of the Jews under the reign of Artaxerxes f CHAP VII of John s assassination of his brother jesvs in the temple and of the injuries offered to the jews by bagoses and what sanballat did WHEN Eliashib the high priest was dead his son Judas succeeded in the high priesthood And when he was dead stars appear they make use of three forms of prayer in the first of these they praise God for counting them worthy to attend this divine service in the second they thank him for the miraculous preservation of their an cestors and in the third they bless his holy name for having continued their lives to the celebration of another festival in commemoration of it Then they read over the whole history of Haman from the beginning to the end but not out of any printed book for that is not lawful but out of a Hebrew manuscript written on parchment There are five place in the text wherein the reader raises his voice with all his might when he comes to the place that mentions the names of the ten sons of Haman he repeats them very quick to shew that they were all destroyed in a moment and every time that the name of Haman is pronounced the children with great fury strike against the benches of the synagogues with the mallets that they bring for that purpose After that the reading is finished they return home and have a supper not of flesh but of spoon meat and early next morning they arise and return to the synagogue where after they have read that passage in Exodus which makes mention of the war of Amalek they begin again to read the book of Esther with the same ceremonies as before and so conclude the service of the day with curses against Haman and his wife Zeresh with blessings upon Mordecai and Esther and with praises to God for having preserved his people Their resting on this day is ob served so religiously that they will not so much as set or sow any thing in their gardens with full persuasion that it would not come up if they did and therefore they ei ther play at chess and such like games or spend the time in music and dancing until it be proper to begin their feasting wherein they indulge themselves to such an immoderate degree that their feast of Purim has with great justice been called the Bacchanals of the Jews They allow themselves to drink wine to excess nay even to such a pitch as not to be able to distinguish be tween the blessings of Mordecai and the curse of Haman as themselves speak and amidst the other sports and diversions of the day they used formerly to erect a gib bet and burn upon it a man made of straw whom they called Haman but herein it was thought that they might have a design to insult Christians upon the death of our crucified Saviour and therefore Theodosius the second anno Dom 408 forbade them to use this ceremony under the penalty of forfeiting all their privileges We have only further to remark concerning this festival that it is always kept for two days together and the reason hereof is thisâ The Jews at Shushan had two days al lowed them to revenge themselves of their enemies Esther ix 13 but the rest of the Jews in other nations had but one This caused at first some difference in their time of feasting for the Jews in all other parts of the kingdom having done execution on their enemies on the thirteenth day kept their rejoicing feast on the four teenth but the Jews at Shushan being engaged in this work both on the thirteenth and fourteenth days kept their festival for their deliverance on the fifteenth When Mordecai however had made a record of this great de liverance he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the dominions of Ahasuerus to establish it as a standing ordi nance among them that they should keep both the four teenth and fifteenth of the month Adar every year as the days whereon the Jews rested from their enemies and this is the reason why the festival continues for two days though the former of them is only kept with great solemnity Patrick s Commentary Hotvcl s History in the notes and Calmefs Dictionary under the word Purim B  Take here part of Reland s Note on this disputed passage In Josephus s copies these Hebrew words days of Purim or Lots as the Greek copies of Esther ix 26 28 29 31 32 is read days of phurim or days of protection but ought to be read days of purim as in the Hebrew Than which emendation nothing is more cer tain And had we any assurance that Josephus s copy mentioned the casting of lots as our copies do Esther iii 7 I should fully agree with Reland but as it now stands it seems to me by no means certain t As to this whole book of Esther in the present Hebrew copy it is so very imperfect in a case where the providence of God was so very remarkable that the Septuagint and Josephus have so much of religion that it has not so much as the name of God once in it and it is hard to say who made that epitome which the Masorites have given us for the genuine book itself No religious Jews could well be the authors of it whose education obliged them to have a constant regard to God and whatsoever related to hit v 336 413 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS his son John took that dignity On whose account il was also that Bagoses the general of another of Artaxerxes s army polluted the temple and imposed tributes on the Jews that out of the public stock before they of fered the daily sacrifices they should pay for every lamb filly shekels Now Jesus was the brother of John and was a friend of Bagoses who had promised to procure him the high priesthood In consequence of whose sup port Jesus quarrelled with John in the tem ple and so provoked his brother that in his anger his brother slew him Now it was a horrible thing for John when he was high priest to perpetrate so great a crime and so much the more horrible that there never was so cruel and impious a thing done either by the Greeks or Barbarians However God did not neglect its punishment But the people were on that very account enslaved and the temple was polluted by the Persians Now when Bagoses the general of Artax erxes s army knew that John the high priest of the Jews had slain his own brother Jesus in the temple he came upon the Jews imme diately and began in anger to say to them Have you had the impudence to perpetrate a murder in your temple And as he was aiming to go into the temple they forbade him so to do But he said Am not I purer than he that was slain in the temple And when he had said those words he went into the temple Accordingly Bagoses made use of this pretence and punished the Jews seven years for the murder of Jesus Now when John was departed this life his son Jaddua succeeded in the high priesthood He had a brother whose name was Manasseh Now there was one tSanballat who was sent by Darius the last king of Persia into Sa maria He was a Cuthean by birth of which stock were the Samaritans also This man knew that the city of Jerusalem was a famous city and that their kings had given a great deal of trouble to the Assyrians and the peo ple of Coelesyria So that he willingly gave his daughter whose name was Nicaso in marriage to Manasseh as thinking this alli ance by marriage would be a pledge and security that the nation of the Jews should continue their good will to him CHAP Vffl OF SANBATXAT AND MANASSEH AND OF THE TEMPLE WHICH THEY BUILT IN MOUNT GERIZZIM J

iEgeae by Pausanias the son of Ce rastes who was derived from the family of the Orestae His son Alexander succeeded in the kingdom and passing over the Hel lespont overcame the generals of Darius s army in a battle fought at Granicum So he marched over Lydia and subdued Ionia and over ran Caria and fell upon the places of Pamphylia worship nor do we know that there ever was so im perfect a copy of it in the world till after the days of Barchocah in the second century  Concerning this other Artaxerxes called Mnemon and the Persian affliction and captivity of the Jews under him occasioned by the murder of the high priest s bro ther in the holy house see Authent Rec at large page 49 50 116â 161 And if any one wonder why Josephus wholly omits the rest of the kings of Persia after Ar taxerxes Mnemon till he came to their last king Darius who was conquered by Alexander the Great I shall give them Vossius s and Dr Hudson s answer though in my own words viz that Josephus did not do ill in omit ting those kings of Persia with whom the Jews had no concern because he was giving the history of the Jews and not of the Persians Which is a sufficient reason also why he entirely omits the history and the book of Job as not particularly relating to that nation He justly therefore returns to the Jewish affairs after the death of Longimanus without any mention of Darius II before Ar taxerxes Mnemon or of Ochus or Arogus as the canon of Ptolemy names them after him Nor had he probably mentioned this other Artaxerxes unless Bagoses one of the governors and commanders under him had occasioned the pollution of the Jewish temple and had greatly dis tressed the Jews upon that pollution But still how very wide are those learned men from truth who from such bare omissions in Josephus collect that he was unacquainted with those reigns he omitted and with the modern Jews greatly shortened the Persian monarchy For Josephus was in fact so far from diminishing that he has increased its duration and that no fewer than 38 or 39 years t Many have here very weakly supposed that this Sanballat under the last Darius is by Josephus confounded with Sanballat the Horonite in Nehemiah xiii 28 under Xerxes or Artaxerxes Longimanus who yet lived by Josephus s own chronology about 120 years before him So palpable a mistake is hardly worth a particular confuta tion and only pardonable on account of the same persons former mistake as to the duration of this Persian monarchy in Josephus s opinion just now observed and confuted  An 336 41 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS But the elders of Jerusalem being very un easy that the brother of Jaddua the high priest though married to a foreigner should be a partner with him in the high priesthood quarrelled with him For they esteemed this man s marriage a step to such as should be desirous of transgressing about the marriage of strange wives and that this would be the beginning of a mutual intercourse with foreigners although the offence of some about marriages and their having married wives that were not of their own country had been an occasion of their former captivity and of the miseries they then underwent So they commanded Mauasseh to divorce his wife or not to approach the altar the high priest himself joining with the people in their indignation against his brother and driving him away from the altar Whereupon Ma uasseh came to his father in law Sanhallat and told him that although he loved his daughter Nicaso yet he was not willing to be deprived of his sacerdotal dignity on her ac count which was the principal dignity in their nation and always continued in the same family But Sanballat promised not only to preserve to him the honour of his priesthood but to procure for him the power and dignity of a high priest and to make him governor of all the places he himself now ruled if he would keep his daughter for his wife He also told him farther that he would build him a temple like to that at Jerusalem upon mount Gerizzim which is the highest of all the mountains that are in Samaria and he promised that he would do this with the approbation of Darius the king Manasseh was elevated with these promises and staid with Sanballat upon a supposal that he should gain a high priesthood as bestowed on him by Darius For it happened that Sanballat was then in years But there was now a great disturbance among the people of Jerusalem because many of those priests and Levites were entangled in such matches For they all revolted to Manasseh and San ballat afforded them money and divided among them land for tillage and habitations also and all this in order to gratify his son in law About this time Darius heard how Alex  An 334 ander had passed over the Hellespont and had beaten his lieutenants in the battle at Granicum and was proceeding farther Whereupon he assembled an army of horse and foot and determined that he would meet the Macedonians before they should assault and conquer all Asia So he passed over the river Euphrates and came over Taurus the Celician mountain and at Issus of Cilicia he waited for the enemy as ready there to give him battle Now Sanballat was glad that Darius was come down and told Manasseh that he would perform his promises to him as soon as Darius should come back after he had beaten his enemies For not he only but all those that were in Asia also were per suaded that the Macedonians would not so much as come to a battle with the Persians on account of their multitude But the event proved otherwise than they expected For the king joined battle with the Macedonians and was beaten and lost a great part of his army His mother also with his wife and children were taken captives and he fled into Persia So Alexander came into Syria and took Damascus and when he had ob tained Sidon he besieged Tyre He then sent an epistle to the Jewish high priest re quiring him to send him some auxiliaries and to supply his army with provisions and that what presents he formerly sent to Darius he would now send to him and choose the friendship of the Macedonians and that he should never repent of so doing But the high priest answered the messengers that he had given his oath to Darius not to bear arms against him and he said he would not trans gress it while Darius was in the land of the living Upon hearing this answer Alexander was very angry and though he determined not to leave Tyre which was just ready to be taken yet as soc o as he had taken it he threatened that he would make an expedition against the Jewish high priest and through him teach all men to whom they must keep their oaths So when he had with a good deal of pains during the 6iege taken Tyre and had settled its affairs he came to the city of Gaza and besieged both the city and him that was governor of the garrison whose name was Babemeses But Sanballat thought he had now a proper opportunity of making his attempt So he an 334 417 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS renounced Darius and taking with him seven thousand of his own subjects he came to Alexander And finding him beginning the siege of Tyre he said to him that he de livered up to him these men who came out of places under his dominion and gladly ac cepted of him for his lord instead of Darius So when Alexander had received him kindly Sanballat thereupon took courage and spake to him about his present affair He told him that he had a son in law Manasseh who was brother to the high priest Jaddua and that there were many others of his own nation now with him that were desirous to have a temple built in the places subject to him that it would be for the king s advantage to have the strength of the Jews divided into two parts lest the nation being of one mind and united upon any attempt for innovation might prove troublesome to kings as it had formerly proved to the kings of Assyria Hereupon Alexander gave the desired per mission to Sanballat who used the utmost diligence and built the temple and made Manasseh the priest and deemed it a great reward that his daughter s children should have that dignity But when the seven months of the siege of Tyre were over and the two months of the siege of Gaza San ballat died Now Alexander when he had taken Gaza made haste to go up to Jerusa lem And Jaddua the high priest when he heard that was in an agony and under ter ror as not knowing how he should meet the Macedonians since the king was displeased at his disobedience He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications and should join with him in offering sacrifice to God whom he besought to protect that nation and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon them God however warned him in a dream which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice that he should take courage and adorn the city and open the gates that the rest should appear in white garments but that he and the priests should meet the king in the habits proper to their order without the dread of any ill consequences which the providence of God would prevent When Jaddua rose from his sleep he greatly rejoiced and declared to all the warning he had received from God and having acted entirely according to his dream he awaited the coming of the king When he understood that Alexander was not far from the city he went out in proces sion with the priests and the multitude of the citizens The procession was venerable and the manner of it different from that of other nations It reached to a place called Sapha which name translated into Greek signifies a prospect for you have thence a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the tem ple and when the Phoenicians and the Chal dees that followed him thought they should have liberty to plunder the city and torment the high priest to death which the king s displeasure fairly promised them the very reverse happened For when the multitude appeared at a distance in white garments while the priests stood clothed with fine linen and the high priest in purple and scarlet clothing with his mitre on his head having the golden plate whereon the name of God was engraven Alexander approached by himself and adored that name and first sa luted the high priest The Jews also did altogether salute Alexander and encompass him about Hereupon the kings of Syria and the rest were surprised at what Alexan der had done and supposed him disordered in his mind However Parmenio alone went up to him and asked him how it came to pass that when all others adored him he should adore the high priest of the Jews To whom he replied I did not adore him but that God who hath honoured him with his high priesthood For I saw this person in a dream in this very habit when I was at Dios in Macedonia Who when I was con sidering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia exhorted me to make no delay but boldly to pass over the sea thither for that he would conduct my army and would give me the dominion over the Persians Whence it is that having seen no other in that habit and now seeing this person in it and remembering that vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream I believe that I bring this army under the divine conduct and shall therewith conquer Darius and destroy the power of the Persians and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind When he had said this to Parmenio and  Cutheans 418 book XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS had given the high priest his right hand the priests ran along by him and he came into the city And when he went up into the temple he offered sacrifice to God according to the high priest s direction and magnifi cently treated both the high priest and the priests And whenf the book of Daniel was shewn to him wherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the Persians he supposed that himself was the person intended And as he was then glad he dismissed the multitude for the pre sent but the next day he called them to him and bade them ask what favours they pleased of him Accordingly the high priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their fore fathers and might pay no tribute the seventh year This was readily granted And when they intreated that he would permit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired And when he said to the multitude that if any of them would enlist themselves in his army on the condition that they should continue under the laws of their forefathers and live according to them he was willing to take them with him many were ready to accompany him in his wars When Alexander had thus settled matters at Jerusalem he led his army into the neigh bouring cities And when all the inhabitants to whom he came received him with great kindness the Samaritans who had then She chem for their metropolis a city situate at mount Gerizzim and inhabited by apostates of the Jewish nation seeing that Alexander had so greatly honoured the Jews determined to profess themselves Jews For such is the disposition of the Samaritans as we have al readyJ declared that when the Jews are in adversity they deny that they are of kin to them and then they confess the truth But when they perceive that some good fortune hath befallen them they immediately pretend to have communion with them saying that they belong to them and derive their gene alogy from the posterity of Joseph Ephraim and Manasseh Accordingly they made their address to the king with splendour and shewed great alacrity in meeting him at a little distance from Jerusalem And when Alexander had commended them the She chemites approached to him taking along with them the troops that Sanballat had sent him and they desired that he would come to their city and do honour to their temple also To whom he promised that when he returned he would come to them And when they petitioned that he would remit the tri bute of the seventh year to them because they did not sow thereon he asked who they were that made such a petition and when they said that they were Hebrews but had the name of Sidonians living at Shechem he asked them again whether they were Jews And when they said they were not Jews It was to the Jews said he that I granted that privilege however when I re turn and am thoroughly informed by you of this matter I will do what I shall think proper And in this manner took leave of the Shechemites but ordered that the troops of Sanballat should follow him into Egypt because there he designed to give them lands which he did a little after in Thebais when he ordered them to guard that country On the death of Alexander j the government was divided among his successors but the temple upon mount Gerizzim remained And if any one were accused by those of Jerusa lem of having eaten thingsÂ common or of having broken the sabbath or of any other crime of the like nature he fled away to the Shechemites and said that he was accused unjustly About this time it was that Jaddua the high priest died and Onias the son took the high priesthood This was the state of the affairs of the people of Jerusalem at this time  The time of the year when Alexander came to Je rusalem seems rightly determined by the Rabbins in Megillath Taanith when they keep the 21st of Casleu a festival in memory of their superiority over the Samari tans at this time as Reland here informs us See the same discourse page 56 Reland informs us farther that the same book says the principal Jews were in white gar ments with other circumstances agreeing with Josephus  The passages shewn to the king upon this occasion might be Dan vii 6 viii 3â 8 20 21 22 xi 3 some or all of them very plain predictions of Alexander s con quests and successes J See Book IX Chap 14 II An 323 Â Here Josephus uses the very word  eating Kwoipwym things common for  eating things unclean as does our New Testament Acts x 14 15 28 xi 8 9 Rom

that end made use of deceit and treachery For as he came into the city on a sabbath day as if he would offer sacrifice he without any trouble gained the city while the Jews did not oppose him For they did not suspect him to be their enemy and he gained it thus because they were free from suspicion of him and because on that day they were at rest and quietness and when he had gained it he ruled over

COD WHEN Alexander had reigned ftwelve years and after him Ptolemy Soter forty years Philadelphus took the kingdom of Egypt and held it forty years within one He procured the Jlaw to be interpreted and liberated those that were come from Jerusa lem into Egypt and were in slavery there who were a hundred and twenty thousand The occasion was this Demetrius Phalerius library keeper to the king was now endea vouring if it were possible to gather toge ther all the books that were in the habitable earth and buying whatsoever was any where valuable or agreeable to the king s inclina tion who was very earnestly set upon col lecting of books to which inclination of his Demetrius was zealously subservient And when once Ptolemy asked him how many thousands of books he had collected he re plied that he had already about two hundred thousand but that in a little time he should have five hundred thousand But he said he had been informed that there were many books of laws among the Jews worthy of inquiring after and worthy of the king s li brary but which being written in characters and in a dialect of their own would cause no small difficulty in getting them translated into the Greek tongue that the character in which they were written seemed like to that of the Syrians and that its sound when pro nounced appeared to be peculiar to them selves Wherefore he said that nothing hin dered why they might not get those books to be translated also For said he while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that fmrpose we may have their books also in this ibrary So the king thought Demetrius was very zealous to procure him abundance of books and that he suggested what was ex ceeding proper for him to do and accord ingly he wrote to the Jewish high priest that he should act accordingly Now there was one Aristeus who was among the king s most intimate friends and on account of his modesty very acceptable to him This Aristeus had frequently resolved to petition the king that he would set all the captive Jews in this kingdom free And he thought this to be a convenient opportunity for making that petition So he discoursed in the first place with the captains of the king s guards Sosibius of Tarentum and An dreas and persuaded them to assist him in what he was going to intercede with the king for Accordingly Aristeus embraced the same opinion with those that have been before mentioned and went to the king and made the following speech to him It is not fit for us O king to overlook things hastily or to deceive ourselves but to lay the truth open For since we have determined not only to get the laws of the Jews transcribed but inter preted also for thy satisfaction by what means can we do this while so many of the  See this fully proved Book XIV chap 10 t These numbers 12 years for Alexander 40 for Ptolemy the son of Lagus and 39 for Ptolemy Phila delphus are very nearly the same which Ptolemy s canon ascribes to them respectively J Of the translation of the other parts of the Old Tes tament by seventy Egyptian Jews in the joint reigns of Ptolemy the son of Lagus and Philadelphus as also of the translation of the Pentateuch by seventy two Jem salem Jews in the seventh year of Philadelphus at Alexandria has given us an account of by Aristeus and thence by Philo and Josephus with a vindication of Aristeus s history see the Appendix to the Literal Ac complishment of the Prophecies at large page 117â 15 which has hitherto received no confutation  it 584 421 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Jews are now slaves in thy kingdom Do thou then what will be agreeable to thy mag nanimity and to thy good nature free them from the miserable condition they are in be cause that God who supporteth the kingdom was the author of their laws as I have learn ed by particular inquiry For both these people and we also worship the same God the framer of all things We call him and that truly by the name of Zriva or Life be cause he breathes life into all men Where fore do thou restore these men to their own country and give them permission to live in it and this do to the honour of God because these men pay a peculiar excellent wor ship to him And know this farther that hough I be not of kin to them by birth nor one of the same country with them yet do I desire these favours to be done them since all men are the workmanship of God and I am sensible that he is well pleased with those that do good I therefore put up this petition to thee to do good to them When Aristeus was saying thus the king looked upon him with a cheerful countenance and said How many thousands dost thou suppose there are of such as want to be made free To which Andreas replied as he stood by and said  A few more than a hun dred thousand The king made answer And is this a small gift that thou askest Aristeus But Sosibius and the rest that stood by said he ought to offer such a thank offering as was worthy of his greatness of soul to that God who had given him his kingdom With this answer he was much pleased and gave order that when they paid the soldiers their wages they should lay down a fhundred and twenty drachmae for every one of the slaves And he promised to publish a mag nificent decree about what they requested which should confirm what Aristeus had pro posed and especially what God willed should be done whereby he said he would not only set those free who had been led away captive  Of Jupiter  t Although this number 120 drachmae of Alexandria or 60 Jewish shekels be here three times repeated and that in all Josephus s copies Greek and Latin yet since all the copies of Aristeus whence Josephus took his rela tion have this sum several times and still has no more than 20 drachma or 10 Jewish shekels and since the sum of the talents to be set down presently which is lit tle above 460 for somewhat more than 100 000 slaves by his father and his army but those who were in his kingdom before and those also if any such there were who had been brought away since And when they said that their redemption money would amount to above four hundred talents he granted it A copy of which decree I have determined to pre serve that the magnanimity of this king may be made known Its contents were as fol lows â Let all those who were soldiers under our father and who when they over ran Sy ria and Phoenicia and laid waste Judea took the Jews captives and made them slaves and brought them into our cities and into this country and then sold them as also those that were in my kingdom before them and if there be any that have lately been brought thither be made free by those who possess them and let them accept of a hundred and twenty drachmae for every slave And let the soldiers receive this redemption money with their pay but the rest out of the king s treasury For I suppose that they were made captives without our father s consent and against equity and that their country was harassed by the insolence of the soldiers and that by removing them into Egypt the soldiers have made a great profit by them Out of regard therefore to justice and out of pity to those who have been tyrannized over contrary to equity I enjoin those that have such Jews in their service to set them at liberty upon receipt of the beforemention ed sum and that no one use any deceit about them but obey what is here commanded And I will that they give in their name within three days after the publication of this edict to such as are appointed to execute the same and to produce the slaves before them For I think it will be for the advantage of my af fairs And let every one that will inform against those that do not obey this decree and I will that their estates be confiscated into the king s treasury and is nearly the same in Josephus and Aristeus does better agree to 20 than 123 drachmae and since the value of a slave of old was at the utmost but 30 shekels or 60 drachmas see Ex xxi 32 while in the present circum stances of these Jewish slaves and those so very nume rous Philadelphus would rather redeem them at a cheaper than a dearer rate there is great reason to prefer Aris teus s copies before Josephus s 3Z2 422 BOOK XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When this decree was read to the king that first contained the rest that is here inserted and omitted only those Jews that had former ly been brought and those brought after wards which had not been distinctly men tioned so he added these clauses out of his humanity and with great generosity He also gave order that the payment which was like ly to be made in a hurry should be divided among the king s ministers and among the officers of his treasury When this was over what the king had decreed was brought to a conclusion in seven days time the number of the talents paid for the captives being above four hundred and sixty and this be cause their masters required the hundred and twenty drachmae for the children also the king having in effect commanded that these should be paid for when he said in his decree that they should receive the aforementioned sum for every slave When this had been done after so magnifi cent a manner according to the king s incli nation he gave order to Demetrius to give him in writing his sentiments concerning the transcribing of the Jewish books For no part of the administration is done rashly by these kings but all things are managed with great circumspection On which account I have subjoined a copy of these epistles and set down the multitude of the vessels sent as gifts to Jerusalem and the construction of every one that the exactness of the artifi cer s workmanship as it appeared to those that saw them and which workman made every vessel may be made manifest and this on account of the excellency of the vessels themselves Now the copy of the epistle was to this purpose DEMETRIUS TO THE GREAT KING When thou O king gavest me a charge concerning the collection of books that were wanting to fill your library and concerning the care that ought to be taken about such as are imperfect I have used the utmost dili gence about these matters And I let you know that we want the books of the Jewish legislation with some others For they are and being in written in Hebrew characters 1  We have a very great encomium of this Simon the Just the son of Gnias I in the fiftieth chapter of Eccle the language of that nation are to us unknown It hath also happened to them that they have been transcribed more carelessly than they ought to have been because they have not had hitherto royal care taken about them Now it is necessary that thou shouldst have accurate copies of them And indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom and en tirely blameless as being the legislation of God For which cause it is as Hecateus of Abdora says that the poets and historians make no mention of it nor of those men who lead their lives according to it since it is a holy law and ought not to be published by profane mouths If then it please thee O king thou mayest write to the high priest of the Jews to send six of the elders out of every tribe and those such as are most skil ful in the laws that by their means we may learn the clear and agreeing sense of these books and may obtain an accurate inter pretation of their contents and so may have such a collection of these as may be suitable to thy desire When this epistle was sent to the king he commanded that an epistle should be drawn up for Eleazar the Jewish high priest con cerning these matters and that they should inform him of the release of the Jews that had been in slavery among them He also sent fifty talents of gold for the making of large basons and vials and cups and an immense quantity of precious stones He also gave order to those who had the custo dy of the chests that contained those stones to give the artificers leave to choose out what sorts of them they pleased at the same time appointing that a hundred talents in money should be sent to the temple for sacrifices and for other uses Now I will give a de scription of these vessels and the manner of their construction but not till after I have set down a copy of the epistle which was written to Eleazar the high priest who had obtained that dignity on the following occa sion When Onias the high priest was dead his son Simon became his successor He was called  Simon the Just because of both his piety towards God and his kind disposi tion to those of his own nation When he siasticus through the whole chapter Nor is it improper to consult that chapter itself upon this occasion ah 27a 423 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS was dead and had left a young son who was called Onias Simon s brother Eleazar of whom we are speaking took the high priest hood And he it was to whom Ptolemy wrote and that in the manner following â King Ptolemy to Eleazar the high priest sendeth greeting There are many Jews who dwell now in my kingdom whom the Persians when they were in power carried captives These were honoured by my father some of them he placed in the army and gave them greater pay than ordinary to others of them when they came with him into Egypt he com mitted his garrisons and the guarding of them that they might be a terror to the Egyptians And when I had taken the go vernment I treated all men with humanity and especially those that are thy fellow citi zens Of whom I have set free above a hun dred thousand that were slaves and paid the price of their redemption to their mas ters out of my own revenues and those that are of a fit age I have admitted into the num ber of my soldiers And for such as are ca pable of being faithful to me and proper for ray court I have put them in such a post as thinking this kindness done to them to be a very great and acceptable gift which I de vote to God for his providence over me And as I am desirous to do what will be grateful to these and to all the other Jews in the ha bitable earth I have determined to procure an interpretation of your law and to have it translated out of Hebrew into Greek and to be deposited in my library Thou wilt there fore do well to choose out and send to me men of a good character who are now el ders in age and six hi number out of every tribe These by their age must be skilful in the laws and of abilities to make an ac curate interpretation of them And when this shall be finished I shall think that I have done a work glorious to myself And I have sent to thee Andreas the captain of my guard and Aristeus men whom I have in very great esteem by whom 1 have sent those first fruits which I have dedicated to the temple and to the sacrifices and to other uses to the value of a hundred talents And if thou wilt  When we have here and presently mention made of Philadelphus s queen and Bister Arsinoe we are to remember with Spanheim that Arsinoe was both his gxster and his wife according to the whole custom of send to let me know what thou wouldest have farther thou wilt do a thing acceptable to me When this epistle was brought to Eleazar he wrote an answer to it with all the respect possible Eleazar the high priest to king Ptolemy sendeth greeting If thou and thy queen Arsinoe and thy children be well we are entirely satisfied When we received thy epistle we greatly rejoiced at thy inten tions And when the multitude were gather ed together we read it to them and thereby made them sensible of the piety thou hast towards God We also shewed them twenty vials of gold and thirty of silver and the five large basons and the table for the shew bread as also the hundred talents for the sacrifices and for the making what shall be needful at the temple Which thing Andreas and Aristeus those most honoured friends of thine have brought us And truly they are persons of an excellent character and of great learning and worthy of thy virtue Know then that we will gratify thee in what is for thy advantage though we do what we used not to do before For we ought to make a return for the numerous acts of kind ness which thou hast done to our country men We immediately therefore offered sacrifices for thee and thy sister with thy children and friends and the multitude made prayers that thy affairs may be to thy mind and that thy kingdom may be preserv ed in peace and that the translation of our law may come to the conclusion thou desirest and be for thy advantage We have also chosen six elders out of every tribe whom we have sent and the law with them It will be thy part out of thy piety and justice to send back the law when it hath been trans lated and to return those to us that bring it in safety Farewell This was the reply which the high priest made But it does not seem necessary to set down the names of the seventy two elders who were sent by Eleazar and carried the law which yet were subjoined at the end of the epistle However I think it not improper to give an account of those very valuable and Persia and of Egypt at this very time nay of the Assy rians long afterward See XX 2 Whence wc have upon the coins of Philadelphus this known inscription Â fwv AfcXuiv or the divine brother and sister 424 BOOK XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS artificially contrived vessels which the king sent to God that all may see how great a regard the king had for God For he allow ed a vast deal of expenses for these vessels and came often to the workmen and viewed their works and suffered nothing of careless ness or negligence to be any damage to their operations And I will relate how rich they were as well as I am able Although per haps the nature of this history may not re quire such a description but I imagine I shall thereby recommend the elegant state and magnanimity of this king to those who read this history And first I will describe what belongs to the table It was indeed in the king s mind to make this table vastly large in its dimen sions But then he gave order that they should learn what was the magnitude of the table which already was at Jerusalem and how large it was and whether there was a possibility of making one larger than it And when he was informed how large that was which was already there and that nothing hindered but a larger might be made he said that he was willing to have one made that should be five times as large as the pre sent table but his fear was that it might be then useless in their sacred ministrations by its too great largeness For he desired that the gifts he presented them should not only be there for shew but should be use ful also in their sacred ministrations Ac cording to which reasoning that the former table was made of so moderate a size for use and not for want of gold he resolved that he would not exceed the former table in largeness but would make it exceed it in the variety and elegance of its materials And as he was sagacious in observing the nature of all things and in having a just no tion of what was new and surprising and where there were no sculptures he would invent such as were proper by his own skill and would shew them to the workmen he commanded that such sculptures should now be made and that those which were deline ated should be most accurately formed by a constant regard to their delineation When therefore the workmen had underta ken to make the table they framed it in length  Two cubits Aristasus as Exod xxy 23 xxxvii 10 and Antiq iii 6 two cubits and a half in breadth one cubit and in height one cubit and a half and the entire structure of the work was of gold They also made a crown of a hand breadth round it with wave work wreathed about it and with an engraving which imitated a cord and was admirably turned on its three parts for as they were of a triangular figure every angle had the same disposition of its sculp tures that when he turned them about the very same form of them was turned about without any variation Now that part of the crown work that was enclosed under the table had its sculptures very beautiful but that part which Went round on the outside was more elaborately adorned with most beautiful ornaments because it was exposed to sight and to the view of the spectators For which reason both those sides which were extant above the rest were acute and none of the angles appeared less than another when the table was turned about Now into the cord work thus turned were precious stones insert ed in rows parallel one to the other enclosed in golden buttons which had ouches in them But the parts that were on the side of the crown and were exposed to the sight were adorned with a row of oval figures obliquely placed of the most excellent sort of precious stones which imitated rods laid close and encompassed the table round about But un der these oval figures thus engraven the workmen had put a crown all round it where the nature of all sorts of fruit was represented by the work of the engraver insomuch that the bunches of grapes hung up And when they had made the stones to re present all the aforementioned kinds of fruits and each in its proper colour they made them fast with gold round the whole table The like dispositions of the oval figures and of the engraved rods was framed under the crown that the table might on each side shew the same appearance of variety and elegance of its ornaments that so neither the position of the wave work nor of the cro Wn might be different although the table were turned on the other side but that the pros pect of the same artificial contrivances might be extended as far as the feet For there was made a plate of gold four fingers broad through the entire breadth of the table into which they inserted the feet and then fast an 377 42 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ened them to the table by buttons and button holes at the place where the crown was situate that so on what side soever of the table one should stand it might exhibit the very same view of the exquisite workman ship and of the vast expense bestowed upon it But upon the table itself they engraved a meander inserting into it very valuable stones in the middle like stars of various colours the carbuncle and the emerald each of which sent out agreeable rays of light to the spectators with such stones of other sorts also as were most curious and best esteemed as being most precious in their kind This meander was surrounded by a texture of net work the middle of which appeared like a rhombus into which were inserted rock crystal and amber which by the appearance they made gave wonderful delight to those that saw them The chapi ters of the feet imitated the first buddings of lilies while their leaves were bent and laid under the table but so that the chives were seen standing upright within them Their bases were made of a carbuncle and the plate at the bottom which rested on that carbuncle was one palm deep and eight fingers in breadth Now they had engraved upon it with a very fine tool and with a great deal of pains a branch of ivy and tendrils of the vine sending forth clusters of grapes that you would guess they were no way dif ferent from real tendrils For they were eo very thin and so far extended at their extremities that they were moved with the wind and made one believe they were the product of nature and not the represen tation of art They also made the entire workmanship of the table appear to be three fold while the joints of the several parts were so united together as to be invisible and the places where they joined could not be distinguished Now the thickness of the table was not less than half a cubit So that this gift by the king s great generosity by the great value of the materials and the va riety of its exquisite structure and the arti ficers skill in imitating nature with graving tools was at length brought to perfection while the king was very desirous that though in largeness it were not to be dif ferent from that which was already dedicated to God yet that in the exquisite workman ship novelty of contrivance and splendour of construction it should far exceed it Now there were two cisterns of gold each of which was engraven with scale work from its basis to its belt like circle with various sorts of stones inchased in the spiral circles Next to which there was upon it a meander of a cubit in height and composed of stones of all sorts of colours And next to this was the rod work engraven and next to that was a rhombus in a texture of net work drawn out to the brim of the bason while small shields made of beautiful stones and of four fingers depth filled up the middle parts About the top of the bason were wreathed the leaves of lilies and of the convolvulus and the tendrils of vines in a circular man ner And this was the construction of the two cisterns of gold each containing two firkins But those which were of silver were much more bright and splendid than looking glasses and you might in them see the images that fell upon them more plainly than in the other The king also ordered thirty vials those of which the parts that were of gold and not filled up with precious stones were shadowed over with the leaves of ivy and of vines artificially engraven And these were the vessels that were after an ex traordinary manner brought to this perfec tion partly by the skill of the workmen who were admirable in such fine work but much more by the diligence and generosity of the king who not only supplied the artificer abundantly and with what they wanted but even suspended public audiences for the time and came and stood by the workmen and saw the whole operation And this was the cause why the workmen were so accurate in their performance because they had regard to the king and to his great concern about the vessels and so the more indefatigably attended to the work And these gifts were sent by Ptolemy to Jerusalem and dedicated to God there But when Eleazar the high priest had devoted them to God and had paid due respects to those that brought them and had given them presents to be carried to the king he let them go back to the king And when they were come and the seventy elders were come also he presently sent for Andreas and Aristeus his ambassadors Accordingly they came to  V 426 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him and delivered him the epistle which they brought from the high priest and answered all the questions he put to them by word of mouth He then hastened to meet the elders that came from Jerusalem for the interpre tation of the laws and he gave command that other men who came on other occasions should be sent away which was a thing sur prising and what he did not use to do For those that were drawn thither upon such oc casions used to come to him on the fifth day but ambassadors at the month s end But when he had sent those away he waited for these that were sent by Eleazar But as the old man came in with the presents which the high priest had given them to bring to the king and with the membranes upon which they had their laws written in golden let ters he put questions ta them concerning those books And when they had taken off the covers wherein they were wrapt up they shewed him the membranes So the king stood admiring the thinness of those mem branes and the exactness of the junctures which could not be perceived so exactly were they connected one with another and this he did for a considerable time He then said that he returned them thanks for com ing to him and still greater thanks to him that sent them arid above all to that God whose laws they appeared to be Then did the elders and those that were present with them cry out with one voice and wished all happiness to the king upon which he was so affected that he burst into tears It being na tural to men to afford the same indications in great joy that they do under sorrows And when he had bidden them to deliver the books to those who were appointed to receive them he saluted the men and said that it was but just to discourse in the first place of the errand they were sent about and then to address himself to them He promised however that he would make this day on which they came to him remarkable and eminent every year through the whole course of his life For their coming to him and the victory which he gained over Antigonus by sea proved to be on the very same day He also gave orders that they should sup with him and gave in charge that they should have excellent lodg ings provided in the upper part of the city Now he that was appointed to take care of the reception of strangers Nicanor by name called for Dorotheus whose duty it was to make provisions for them and bade him pre pare for every one of them what should be requisite for their diet and way of living Which thing was ordered by the king after this manner He took care for those that belonged to every city which did not use the same way of living that all things should be prepared for them according to the cus tom of those that came to him that being feasted according to the usual method of their own way of living they might be the better pleased and might not be uneasy at any thing done to them from which they were naturally averse And this was now done in the case of these men by Dorotheus who was put into this office because of his skill in such matters For he took care of all things which concerned this reception of strangers and appointed them double seats for them to sit on according as the king had commanded For he had ordered that half of their seats should be set at his hand and the other half behind his table and he took care that no respect should be omitted that could be shewn them And when they were thus set down he bade Dorotheus minister to all those who were come to him from Ju dea after the manner they used to be minis tered to For which cause he sent away their sacred heralds and those that slew the sacri fices and the rest that used to say grace But called to one of those that were come to him whose name was Eleazar who was a priest and desired him to say grace  who then stood in the midst of them and prayed that all prosperity might attend the king and those that were his subjects Hereupon an  The Talnradists say that it is not lawful to write the law in letters of gold contrary to this certain and very ancient example See Hudson s and Reland s notes here  This is the most ancient example that I have met with of a grace or a short prayer before meat which as it used to be said by a heathen priest who was one of these seventy two interpreters The next example I have met with is that of the Essenes Of the War II 8 both before and after it The next are those of our Sa viour before it Mark viii 6 John vi 11 23 and St Paul Acts xxvii 35 The next is a form of such a grace or prayer for Christians at the end of the 5th book of the Apostolical Constitutions which seems to have been in tended for both times both before and after meat  nu vn 427 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS â acclamation Wak made by the whole com pany and when that was over they fell to eating their supper and to the enjoyment of what was set before them And at a little interval afterward when the king thought a sufficient time had elapsed he began to talk philosophically to them and he asked every one of them a philosophical question and such a one as might give light in those in quiries And when they had explained all the problems that had been proposed by the king about every point he was pleased with their answers This took up the twelve days in which they were treated And he that pleases may learn the particular ques tions in that book of Aristeus s which he wrote on this very occasion And while not the king only but the phi losopher Menedemus also admired them and said that All things were governed by Providence and that it was probable that thence it was that such force and beauty was discovered in these men s words they then left off asking any more such questions But the king said he had gained very great advantages by their coming for that he had received this profit from them that he had learned how he ought to rule his subjects And Jie gave order that they should have every one three talents given them and that those that were to conduct them to their lodging should do it Accordingly when three days were over Demetrius took them and went over the causeway seven furlongs long It was a bank in the sea to an island And when they had gone over the bridge he proceeded to the northern parts and shewed them where they should meet which was in a house that was built near the shore and was a quiet place and fit for their dis coursing together about their work When he had brought them thither he intreated them now they had all things about them which they wanted for the interpretation of their law that they would suffer nothing to interrupt them in their work Accordingly they made an accurate interpretation with great zeal and great pains And this they continued to do till the ninth hour of the day After which time they relaxed and took care of their body while their food was provided for them in great plenty besides which Dorotheus at the king s command brought them a great deal of what was provided for the king himself But in the morning they came to the court and saluted Ptolemy and then went away to their former place where when they had fwashed their hands and purified themselves they betook them selves to the interpretation of the laws Now when the law was transcribed and the la bour of interpretation was over which came to its conclusion in seventy two days Deme trius gathered all the Jews together to the place where the laws were translated and where the interpreters were and read them over The multitude did also approve of those elders that were the interpreters of the law They also commended Demetrius for his proposal as the inwntor of what was greatly for their happiness and desired that he would give leave to their rulers also to read the law Moreover they all both the priests and the most ancient of the elders and the principal men of their common weal made it their request that since the inter pretation was happily finished it might con tinue in the state it now was and might not be altered And when they all commended that determination of theirs they enjoined that if any one observed either any thing superfluous or any thing omitted that he would take a view of it again and have it laid before them and corrected which was a wise action of them that when the thing was judged to have been well done it might continue for ever So the king rejoiced when he saw that hia design was brought to perfection to so great advantage And he was chiefly delighted with hearing the laws read to him and was astonished at the deep meaning and wisdom of the legislator And he began to ask of De metrius how it came to pass that when this legislation was so wonderful no one either of the poets or of the historians had made men  They were rather political questions and answers tending to the good and religious government of mankind t This purification of the interpreters by washing in the sea before they prayed to God every morning and before they set about translating may be compared with voL I â NOS 35 il 36 the like practice of Peter the apostle in the recognitions of Clement IV 3 V 36 VIII 1 and with the places of the Proseucha or of prayer which were sometimes built near the sea or rivers also Of which matter see XIV 10 and Acts xvi 13 16 4A 428 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tion of it Demetrius replied that no one durst be so bold as to touch upon the descrip tion of these laws because they were divine and venerable and because some that had attempted it were afflicted by God He also told him that Theopompus was desirous of writing somewhat about them but was there upon disturbed in his mind for above thirty days time And upon some intermission of his distemper he appeased God by prayer as suspecting that his madness proceeded from that cause Nay indeed he farther saw in a dream that his distemper befell him while he indulged too great a curiosity about di vine matters and was desirous of publishing them among common men But when he left off that attempt he recovered his under standing again Moreover he informed him of Theodectes the tragic poet concerning whom it was reported that when in a certain dramatic representation he was desirous to make mention of things that were contained in these sacred books he was afflicted with a darkness in his eyes And that upon his being conscious of the occasion of his dis temper and appeasing God by prayer he was free from that affliction When the king had received these books from Demetrius as we have said already he adored them and gave order that great care should be taken of them that they might re main uncorrupted He also desired that the interpreters would come often to him out of Judea and that both on account of the re spect that he would pay them and oh ac count of the presents he would make them For he said it was now but just to send them away although if of their own ac cord they would come to him hereafter they should obtain all that their own wisdom might justly require and what his generosity was able to give them So he then dismissed them and gave to every one of them three garments of the best sort two talents of gold a cup of the value of one talent and the fur niture of the room wherein they were feasted And these were the things he presented to  The use of oil was much greater and the donatives of it much more valuable in Judea and the neighbouring countries than it is amongst us It was also in the days of Josephus thought unlawful for Jews to make use of any oil that was prepared by heathens perhaps on ac count of some superstitions intermixed with its prepara them But by them he sent to Eleazar the high priest ten beds with feet of silver and the furniture to them belonging and a cup of the value of thirty talents And besides these ten garments and purple and a very beautiful crown and a hundred pieces of the finest wove linen as also vials and dishes and vessels for pouring and two golden cis terns to be dedicated to God He also de sired him by an epistle that he would give these interpreters leave if any of them were desirous of coming to him because he highly valued a conversation with men of such learn ing and would be very willing to lay out his wealth upon such men And this was what came to the Jews and was much to their glory and honour from Ptolemy Philadelphus CHAP m OF THE HONOURS AND PRIVILEGES BESTOWED UPON THE NATION OF THE JEWS BY THE KINGS OF ASIA THE Jews also obtained honours from the kings of Asia when they became their auxiliaries For Seleucus Nicator made them citizens in those cities which he built in Asia and in the lower Syria and in the metropolis Antioch and gave them pri vileges equal to those of the Macedonians and Greeks who were the inhabitants inso much that these privileges continue to this very day An argument for which you have in this that whereas the Jews do not make use of oil prepared by foreigners they receive a certain sum of money from the proper officers belonging to their exercises as the value of that oil which money whea the people of Antioch would have deprived them of in the last war Mucianus who was then president of Syria preserved it to them And when the people of Alexandria and of Antioch did after that at the time that Ves pasian and Titus his son governed the ha bitable earth pray that these privileges of citizens might be taken away they did not obtain their request In which behaviour any one may discern the equity and gene rosity of the Romans t especially of Vespa tion by those heathens When therefore the heathens were to make them a donative of oil they paid them money instead of it See Of the War II 19 and Hud son s note on the place before us t This and the like great and just characters of the justice equity and generosity of the old Romans both aN 277 429 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sian and Titus who although they had been at a great deal of pains in the war against the Jews and were exasperated against them because they did not deliver up their wea pons but continued the war to the very last yet did they not take away any of the privi leges belonging to them as citizens but restrained their anger and overcame the prayers of the Alexandrians and Antiochians who were a very powerful people insomuch that they did not yield to them neither out of their favour to these people nor out of their old grudge at those whose wicked op position they had subdued in the war Nor would they alter any of the ancient favours granted to the Jews but said that those who ad borne arms against them and fought them had suffered punishment already and that it was not just to deprive those that had not offended of the privileges they enjoyed We also know that Marcus Agrippa was of the like disposition towards the Jews For the people of Ionia were very angry at them and besought Agrippa that they and they only might have those privileges of citizens which Antiochus the grandson of Seleucus who by the Greeks was called the God had bestowed on them and desired that if the Jews were to be joint partakers with them they might be obliged to worship the gods they themselves worshipped but when these matters were brought to the trial the Jews prevailed and obtained leave to make use of their own customs and this under the patronage of Nicolaus of Damascus For Agrippa gave sentence that he could not innovate And if any one hath a mind to know this matter accurately let him peruse the hundred and twenty third and hundred and twenty fourth books of the history of this Nicolaus Now as to this determination of Agrippa it is not to be admired for that time our nation had not made war against the Romans But one may well be astonished at the generosity of Vespasian and Titus that after so great wars and contests which they had with us they should use such mode ration But I will now return to that part of my history whence I made the present di gression It happened in the reign off Antiochus the Great who ruled over all Asia that the Jews as well as the inhabitants of Coelesyriaj suffered greatly and their land was sorely harassed For while he was at war with PtolemyJ Eupator and with his son who was called Epiphanes it fell out that these na tions were equally sufferers both when he was beaten and when he defeated the others So that they were like a ship in a storm which is tossed by the Waves on both sides and just thus as they were in their situation in the middle between Antiochus s prosperity and its change to adversity But at length when Antiochus had beaten Ptolemy he seiz ed upon Judea And when Philopator was dead his son sent a great army under Scopas the general of his forces against the inhabi tants of Coelesyria who took many of their cities and in particular our nation which when he fell upon them went over to him Yet was it not long afterward when Antiochus overcame Scopas in a battle fought at the fountains of Jordan and destroyed a great part of his army But afterward when An tiochus subdued those cities of Coelesyria which Scopas had gotten into his possession and Samaria with them the Jews of their own accord went over to him and received him into Jerusalem and gave plentiful pro vision to all his army and to his elephants and readily assisted him when he besieged the garrison which was in the citadel of Je rusalem Wherefore Antiochus thought it but just to requite the Jews diligence and zeal in his service So he wrote to the gene rals of his armies and to his friends and gave testimony to the good behaviour of the Jews towards him and informed them what rewards he had resolved to bestow on them to the Jews and other conquered nations afford us a very good reason why Almighty God upon the rejection of the Jews for their wickedness chose them for his people and first established Christianity in that empire Of which matter see Constitut Apost V 90 and Euseb ap Prim Christ Revived III page 456 457 and Josephus XIV 10 XVI il  That this Antiochus was Called Avtiox Â fos or Antiochus the god by the Milesians see Appian Syriac p 210 quoted in the notes on this place t Of this Antiochus the Great and his wars with Pto lemy Philopator and Ptolemy Epiphanes Spanheim and Hudson bid us here consult Polybius V 85 and the Ex cerpta out of Polybius published by Valesius page 70 77 79 and Hieronymus in Daniel xi But note that those parts of Polybius s XVIth book that are quoted presently by Josephus are lost J Or rather Philopator 4 A 1Â 430 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS book XII for that behaviour I will set down presently the epistles themselves which he wrote to his generals concerning them but will first f roduce the testimony of Polybius of Mega opolis for thus does he speak in the six teenth book of his history Now Scopas the general of Ptolemy s army went in haste to the superior parts of the country and in the winter time overthrew the nation of the Jews He also saith in the same book When Scopas was conquered by Antiochus Antiochus received Batanea Samaria Abila and Gadara and that some time afterwards there came in to him those Jews that inhabit ed near that temple which was called Jeru salem concerning which although I have more to say and particularly concerning the presence of God about that temple yet do I put off that history till another opportunity This it is which Polybius relates But we will return to the series of the history when we have first produced the epistles of king Antiochus KING ANTIOCHUS TO PTOLEMY SENDETH GREET ING i Since the Jews upon our first entrance on their country demonstrated their friend ship towards us and when we came to their city Jerusalem received us in a splendid manner and came to meet us with their senate and gave abundance of provisions to our soldiers and to the elephants and joined with us in ejecting the garrison of the Egyp tians that were in the citadel we have thought fit to reward them and to retrieve the condition of their city which hath been greatly depopulated by such accidents as have befallen its inhabitants and to bring those that have been scattered abroad back to the city And in the first place we have determined on account of their piety towards God to bestow on them as a pension for heir sacrifices of animals that are fit for sa crifice for wine and oil and frankincense the value of twenty thousand pieces of sil ver and six sacred artabae of fine flour with one thousand four hundred and sixty medimni of wheat and three hundred and seventy five medimni of salt And these pay ments I would have fully paid them as I have sent orders to you I would also have the work about the temple finished and the cloisters and if there be any thing else that ought to be rebuilt And for the materials of wood let them be brought out of Judea and out of the other countries and out of Liba nus tax free and the same I would have ob served as to those other materials which will be necessary in order to render the temple more glorious And let all of that nation live according to the laws of their own country and let the senate and the priests and the scribes of the temple and the sacred singers be discharged from poll money and the crown tax and other taxes also And that the city may the sooner recover its inhabit ants I grant a discharge from taxes for three years to its present inhabitants and to such as shall come to it until the month Hyperbe reteus We also discharge them for the u ture from a third part of their taxes that the losses they have sustained may be repaired And all those citizens that have been carried away and are become slaves we grant them and their children their freedom and give order that their substance be restored to them Antiochus also published a decree through all his kingdom in honour of the temple which contained what follows â It shall be lawful for no foreigner to come within the limits of the temple round about which thing is forbidden also to the Jews un less to those who according to their own cus tom have purified themselves Nor let any flesh of horses or of mules or of asses be brought into the city whether they be wild or tame nor that of leopards or foxes or hares and in general that of any animal which is forbidden for the Jews to eat Nor let their skins be brought into it nor let any such animal be bred up in the city Let them only be permitted to use the sacrifices derived from their forefathers with which they have been obliged to make acceptable atonements to God And he that transgress eth any of these orders let him pay to the Kriests three thousand drachmae of silver loreover this Antiochus bare testimony to our piety and fidelity in an epistle of his when he was informed of a sedition in Phry gia and Lydia at which time he was in the superior provinces wherein he commanded Zeuxis the general of his forces and his most intimate friend to send some of our ua an 226 431 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tion out of Babylon into Phrygia The epistle was this XING ANTIOCHUS TO ZEUXIS HIS FATHER SEND ETH GREETING If thou be in good health it is well for I am also in health Having been informed that a sedition is arisen in Lydia and Phrygia I thought that matter required great care And upon advising with my friends what was fit to be done it hath been thought proper to remove two thousand families of Jews with their effects out of Mesopotamia and Baby lon unto the castles and places that lie most convenient For I am persuaded that they will be well disposed guardians of our pos sessions because of their piety towards God and because I know that my predecessors have borne witness to them that they are faithful and with alacrity perform what they are desired I will therefore though it be a laborious work that thou remove these Jews under a promise that they shall be permitted to use their own laws And when thou shalt have brought them to the aforementioned daces thou shalt give every one of their amilies a place for building their houses and a portion of land for their husbandry and for the plantation of their vines and thou shalt discharge them from paying taxes of the fruits of the earth for ten years And let them have a proper quantity of wheat for the maintenance of their servants until they re ceive bread corn out of the earth And let a sufficient share be given to such as minister to them in the necessaries of life that by enjoying the effects of our humanity they may shew themselves the more willing and ready about our affairs Take care also of that nation as far as thou art able that they may not have any disturbance given them by any one Now these testimonials which I have pro duced are sufficient to declare the friend ship that Antiochus the Great bare to the Jews CHAP IV OF A LEAGUE BETWEEN ANTIOCHUS AND PTOLEMY J THE OFFENCE GIVEN TO PTOLEMY EUERGETES BY 0NIAS J THE PRUDENT CONDUCT OF JOSEPH J AND THE AFFAIRS OF HIS SON HYRCANU8 AFTER this Antiochus made a friend ship and a league with Ptolemy and gave him his daughter Cleopatra to wife and yielded up to him Coelesyria Samaria Judea and Phoenicia by way of dowry And upon the division of the taxes between the two kings all the principal men farmed the taxes of their several countries and collect ing the sum that was settled for them paid the same to the two kings Now at this time the Samaritans were in a nourishing con dition and much distressed the Jews cut ting off part of their land and carrying off slaves This happened when Onias was high priest For after Eleazar s death hia uncle Manasseh took the priesthood and after he had ended his life Onias received that dignity He was the son of Simon who was called the Just which Simon was the brother of Eleazar as I fsaid before This Onias was one of a little soul and a great lover of money and for that reason because he did not pay that tax of twenty talents of silver which his forefathers paid to these kings out of their own estates he provoked king Ptolemy Euergetes to anger who was the father of Philopator This Euergetes sent an ambassador to Jerusalem and com plained that Onias did not pay his taxes and threatened that if he did not receive them he would seize upon their land and send soldiers to live upon it When the Jews heard this message of the king s they were con founded But so sordidly covetous was Onias that nothing of this nature made him ashamed There was now one Joseph J young in age but of great reputation among the people of Jerusalem for gravity prudence and justice His father s name was Tobias and his mother was the sister of Onias the high priest who informed him of the coming of the ambas sador for he was then sojourning at a vil lage named Phicol where he was born  Spanheim notes here that thh marriage of Ptolemy jyith Cleopatra is related by Appian in bis Syriaca p 88 t Chap Ill t About an 226 ft The name of this place Phicol is the very same with that of the chief captain of Abimelech s host in the 432 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Hereupon he came to Jerusalem and re proved Onias for not taking care of the pre servation of his countrymen but bringing the nation into dangers by not paying this money For which preservation of them he told him he had received the authority over them and had been made high priest But that in case he was so great a lover of money as to endure to see his country in danger on that account and his countrymen suffer the greatest damages he advised him to go to the king and to petition him to remit either the whole or a part of the sum demanded Onias replied that he did not care for his authority and that he was ready if the thing was prac ticable to lay down his high priesthood and that he would not go to the king because he troubled not himself at all about such mat ters Joseph then asked him if he would not give him leave to go ambassador on behalf of the nation He replied that he would give him leave Hereupon Joseph went up into the temple and called the multitude together to a congregation and exhorted them not to be disturbed nor affrighted because of his uncle Onias s carelessness but desired them to be at rest and not terrify themselves with fear about it for he promised that he would be their ambassador to the king and per suade him that they had done him no wrong And when the multitude heard this they re turned thanks to Joseph  So he went down from the temple and treated Ptolemy s ambassador in a hospitable manner He also presented him with rich gifts and feasted him magnificently for many days and then sent him to the king before him and told him that he would soon follow him For he was now more willing to go to the king by the encouragement of the ambas sador who earnestly persuaded him to come into Egypt and promised that he should ob tain every thing that he desired of Ptolemy For he was highly pleased with his frank and liberal temper and with the gravity of his deportment When Ptolemy s ambassador was come into Egypt he told the king of the thoughtless temper of Onias and informed him of the goodness of the disposition of Joseph and days of Abraham Genesis xxi 22 and might possibly br the place of that Phicol s nativity or abode For it that he was coming to him to excuse the multitude as not having done him any harm for that he was their patron In short he was so very warm in his encomiums upon the young man that he disposed both the king and his wife Cleopatra to have a kindness for him before he came So Joseph sent to his friends at Samaria and borrowed money of them and got ready what was necessary for his journey garments and cups and beasts for burden which amounted to about twenty thousand drachmae and went to Alex andria Now it happened that at this time all the principal men and rulers went up out of the cities of Syria and Phoenicia to bid for their taxes For every year the king sold them to the men of the greatest power in every city So these men saw Joseph jour neying on his way and laughed at him for his poverty and meanness But when he came to Alexandria and heard that king Ptolemy was at Memphis he went up thither to meet with him which happened as the king was sitting in his chariot with his wife and his friend Athenion who was the very person who had been ambassador at Jeru salem and been entertained by Joseph As soon therefore as Athenion saw him he pre sently made known to the king how good and how generous a young man he was So Ptolemy saluted him and desired him to come up in his chariot and as Joseph sat there he began to complain of the manage ment of Onias To which he answered Forgive him on account of his age for thou canst not certainly be unacquainted with this that old men and infants have their minds exactly alike But thou shalt have from us who are young men every thing thou desirest and shalt have no cause to complain With this good humour and pleasantry of the young man the king was so delighted that he began already as though he had long experience of him to have a still greater affection for him insomuch that he bade him take his diet in the king s palace and be a guest at his own table every day But when the king was come to Alexandria the principal men of Syria saw him sitting with the king and were much offended at it seems to hare been in the south part of Palestine aa that was an 226 433 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS When the day came on which the king was to let the taxes of the cities to farm and those that were the principal men of dignity in their several countries were to bid for them the sum of the taxes together of Coelesyria and Phoenicia and Judea with Samaria as they were bidden for came to eight thousand talents Hereupon Joseph accused the bid ders as having agreed together to estimate the value of the taxes at too low a rate and he promised that he would himself give twice as much for them but for those who did not pay he would send the king home their whole substance for this privilege was sold together with the taxes themselves The king was pleased to hear that offer and because it augmented his revenues he said he would confirm the sale of the taxes to him But then he asked whether he had any sureties that would be bound for the payment of the money He answered very pleasantly I will give securities and those of persons good and responsible and which you shall have no reason to distrust And when he bade him name them who they were he re plied  I give thee no other persons O king for my sureties than thyself and this thy wife and you shall be security for both par ties So Ptolemy laughed at the proposal and granted him the farming of the taxes without any sureties This procedure was a sore grief to those that came from the cities into Egypt who were utterly disappointed and they returned every one to their own country with shame But Joseph took with him two thousand foot soldiers from the king For he desired he might have some assistance in order to force such as were refractory in the cities to pay And borrowing of the king s friends at Alexandria five hundred talents he hastened into Syria When he was at Ascalon and demanded the taxes of the people they re fused to pay any thing and affronted him also but he seized upon about twenty of the prin cipal men and slew them and gathered what they had together and sent it all to the king and informed him what he had done Ptolemy admired at the prudent conduct of the man and commended him for what he had done and gave him leave to do as he pleased When the Syrians heard of this they were astonished and having before them a sad example in the men of Ascalon that were slain they opened their gates and willingly admitted Joseph and paid their taxes And when the inhabitants of Scythopolis attempted to affront him and would not pay him those taxes which they formerly used to pay with out disputing about them he slew also the principal men of that city and sent their effects to the king By this means he gathered great wealth together and made vast gains by this farming of the taxes and he made use of what estate he had thus gotten in order to support his authority as thinking it a piece of prudence to keep what had been the occasion and foundation of his present good fortune and this he did by the assist ance of what he was already possessed of For he privately sent many presents to the king and to Cleopatra and to their friends and to all that were powerful about the court and thereby purchased their good will to himself This good fortune he enjoyed for twenty two years and was become the father ot seven sons by one wife as he had one other son whose name was Hyrcanus by his bro ther Solymius s daughter whom he married on the following occasion He once came to Alexandria with his brother who had along with him a daughter already marriageable in order to give her in wedlock to some of the Jews of chief dignity there He then supped with the king and falling in love with an actress that was of great beauty and came into the room where they feasted he told his brother of it and intreated him because a Jew is forbidden by their law to come near a foreigner to conceal his offence and to be kind and subservient to him and to give him the opportunity of fulfilling his desires Upon which his brother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him and adorned his own daughter and brought her to him by night and put her into his bed And Joseph being disordered with drink knew not who she was and so lay with his brother s daughter and this he did many times and loved her exceedingly and said to his bro ther that he loved this actress so well that he should run the hazard of his life if he must part with her and yet probably the king would not give him leave to take her with him But his brother bade him be in no con 434 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS cern about that matter and told him he might retain her whom he loved without any danger and might have her for his wife and opened the truth of the matter to him and assured him that he chose rather to have his own daughter abused than to overlook him and see him come to public disgrace So Joseph commended him for his brotherly love and married his daughter by whom he had a eon whose name was Hyrcanus as we said before And when this his youngest son shewed at thirteen years old a mind that was both courageous and wise and was greatly envied by his brethren as being of a genius much above them and such a one as they might well envy Joseph had once a mind to know which of his sons had the best dispo sition to virtue and when he sent them severally to those that had then the best re putation for instructing youth the rest of his children by reason of their sloth and unwil lingness to take pains returned to him foolish and unlearned After them he sent out the youngest Hyrcanus and gave him three hundred yoke of oxen and bade him go two days journey into the wilderness and sow the land there and yet kept back privately the yokes of the oxen that coupled them together When Hyrcanus came to the place and found he had no yokes with him he con temned the drivers of the oxen who advised him to send some to his father to bring them some yokes but thinking that he ought not to lose his time while they should be sent to bring him the yokes he invented a kind of stratagem and what suited an age elder than his own For he slew ten yoke of the oxen and distributed their flesh among the labour ers and cut their hides into several pieces and made him yokes and yoked the oxen together with them By which means he sowed as much land as his father had ap pointed him to sow and returned to him And when he was come back his father was mightily pleased with his sagacity and com mended the sharpness of his understanding and his boldness in what he did And he still loved him the more as if he were his only genuine son while his brethren were much troubled at it But when one told him that Ptolemy had  An 187 a son just born and that all the principal men of Syria and the other countries subject to him were to keep a festival on account of the child s birth day and went away in haste with great retinues to Alexandria he was himself hindered from going by old age but he made trial of his sons whether any of them would be willing to go to the king And when the elder sons excused themselves from going and said they were not courtiers enough for such conversation and advised him to send their brother Hyrcanus he gladly hearkened to that advice and called Hyr canus and asked him whether he would go to the king And upon his promise that he would go and his saying that he should not want much money for his journey because he would live moderately and that accord ingly ten thousand drachma would be suffi cient he was pleased with his son s prudence After a little while the son advised his father not to send his presents to the king from thence but to give him a letter to his steward at Alexandria that he might furnish him with money for purchasing what should be most excellent and most precious So he thinking that the expense of ten talents would be enough for presents to be made the king and commending his son as giving him good advice wrote to Arion his steward that managed all his money matters at Alexan dria which money was not less than three thousand talents on his account For Joseph sent the money he received in Syria to Alex andria And when the day appointed for the payment of the taxes to the king came he wrote to Arion to pay them So when the son had asked his father for a letter to this steward and had received it he hastened to Alexandria And when he was gone his brethren wrote to all the king s friends that they should destroy him But when he was come to Alexandria he delivered his letter to Arion who asked him how many talents he would have hoping he would ask no more than ten or a little more He said he wanted a thousand talents at which the steward was angry and rebuked him as one that intended to live extrava gantly and he let him know how his father had gathered together his estate by pains taking and resisting his inclinations and wished him to imitate the example of his AN 187 435 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS father he assured him withal that he would give him but ten talents and that for the pre sent to the king also The son was irritated at this and threw Arion into prison But when Arion s wife had informed Cleopatra of this with her entreaty that she would re buke the child for what he had done for Arion was in great esteem with her Cleo patra informed the king of it And Ptolemy sent for Hyrcanus and told him that he wondered when he was sent to him by his father that he had not yet come into his pre sence but had laid the steward in prison and he gave order therefore that he should come to him and give an account of the reason of what he had done And they re port that the answer he made to the king s messenger was this that There was a law of his that forbade a child that was born to taste of the sacrifice before he had been at the temple and sacrificed to God Accord ing to which way of reasoning he did not himself come to him in expectation of the Eresent he was to make to him as to one who ad been his father s benefactor and that he had punished the slave for disobeying his commands For said he  it matters not whether a master be little or great so that unless we punish such as these thou thyself mayest expect to be despised by thy sub jects Upon hearing this answer the king burst into laughter and wondered at the great soul of the child When Arion was apprised that this was the king s disposition and that he had no way to help himself he gave the child a thousand talents and was liberated from prison So after three days were over Hyrcanus came and saluted the king and queen They saw him with pleasure and feasted him in an obliging manner out of the respect they bare to his father So he came to the merchants Erivately and bought a hundred boys that ad learning and were in the flower of their age each at a talent a piece as also he bought a hundred maidens each at the same price as the other And when he was invited to feast with the king among the principal men of the country he sat down the lowest of them all because he was little regarded as a child in age still and this by those that S laced every one according to their dignity fow when all those that sat with him had VOl I â NOS 37  38 lain the bones of the several parts on a heap before Hyrcanus for they had themselves taken away the flesh belonging to them till the table where he sat was filled full with them Trypho who was the king s jester and was appointed for jokes and laughter at fes tivals was now asked by the guests that sat at the table to expose him to laughter So he stood by the king and said Dost thou not see my lord the bones that lie by Hyrcanus By this similitude thou mayest conjecture that his father made all Syria as bare as he hath made these bones And the king laughing at what Trypho said and asking of Hyr canus  How he came to have so many bones before him He replied Very rightfully my lord For they are dogs that eat the flesh and the bones together as these thy guests have done looking in the mean time at those guests for there is nothing before them but they are men that eat the flesh and cast away the bones as I who am also a man have now done The king admired this answer which was so wisely made and bade them all make an acclamation as a mark of their approbation of his jest which was truly a facetious one On the next day Hyrcanus went to every one of the king s friends and of the men powerful at court and saluted them but still inquired of the servants what present they would make the king on his son s birth day and when some said that they would give twelve talents and that others of greater dignity wotdd every one give according to the quantity of their riches he pretended to be grieved that he was not able to bring so large a present for that he had no more than five talents And when the servants heard what he said they told their masters and they rejoiced in this prospect that Joseph would be disapproved and would make the king angry by the smallness of his present When the day came the others even those that brought the most offered the king not above twenty talents but Hyrcanus gave to every one of the hundred boys and hundred maidens that he had bought a talent a piece for them to carry and introduced them the boys to the king and the maidens to Cleo patra every body wondering at the unex pected richness of the presents even the king and queen themselves He also pre 4B 436 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sented those that attended about the king with gilts to the value of a great number of talents that he might escape the danger he was in from them for to these it was that Hyrcanus s brethren had written to destroy him Now Ptolemy admired at the young man s magnanimity and commanded him to ask what gift he pleased But he desired nothing else to be done for him by the king than to write to his father and brethren about him So when the king had paid him very great respect and had given him very large gifts and had written to his father and his brethren and all his commanders and officers about him he sent him away But when his brethren heard that Hyrcanus had received such favours from the king and was returning home with great honour they went out to meet him and to destroy him and that with the privity of their father For he was angry at him for the large sum of money that he bestowed for presents and so had no con cern for his preservation However Joseph concealed the anger he had at his son out of fear of the king And when Hyrcanus s brethren came to fight him he slew many others of those that were with them as also two of his brethren themselves but the rest of them escaped to Jerusalem to their father But when Hyrcanus came to the city where nobody would receive him he was afraid for himself and retired beyond the river Jordan and there abode obliging the Barbarians to pay their taxes At this time Seleucus who was called Soter reigned over Asia being the son of Antiochus the Great And now Hyrcanus s father Joseph died He was a good man and of great magnanimity and brought the Jews out of a state of poverty and meanness to one that was more splendid He retained the farm of the taxes of Syria and Phoenicia and Samaria twenty two years His uncle Onias also died about this time and left the high priesthood to his son Simon And when he was dead Onias his son succeeded him in that dignity To fhim it was that Areus king of the Lacedaemonians sent an ambassage with an epistle the copy where of here follows â AREUS KING OF THE LACEDEMONIANS TO ONIAS SENDETH GREETING We have met with a certain writing whereby we have discovered that both the Jews and the Lacedaemonians are of one stock and are derived from the Jkindred of Abraham It is but just therefore that you who are our brethren should send to us about any of your concerns as you please We will also do the same and esteem your concerns as our own and will look upon our concerns as in common with yours De moteles who brings this letter will bring your answer back to us This letter is four square and the seal is an eagle with a dragon in his claws  Thirty six years in one manuscript which is per haps the true number See Prideaux at an 226 t Take here Dean Prideaux s account of this letter at the year 183 which I suppose to be the truth of this case It is says he most likely Josephus mistook the Onias to whom this letter was directed and ascribed that to Onias III which was done only in the time of Onias I For while Onias the first of that name the son of Jad dua was high priest of the Jews there was one Areus king of Lacedaemon which it no way appears there was in the days of Onias the third And from him most likely it was that this letter was written Accordingly Jonathan in his letter to the Lacedaemonians 1 Mace xii 10 Antiq XIII 5 wherein he makes mention of this letter of Areus s says There was a long time passed since it had been sent to them Which could not hare been said by Jonathan in respect of the time in which Onias III was high priest since from the death of that Onias to the time that Jonathan was made prince of the Jews there had passed no more than twelve years J Whence it comes that these Lacedaemonians declare themselves here to be of kin to the Jews as derived both from the same ancestor Abraham I cannot tell Unless as Grotius supposes they were derived from the Dores that came of the Pelasgi These are by Hero dotus in effect called Barbarians and perhaps were derived from the Syrians and Arabians the posterity of Abraham by Keturah see Antiq XIV 10 Of the War I 26 and Grotius on 1 Mace xii 7 We may farther observe from the recognitions of Clement I 33 that Eliezer of Damascus the servant of Abraham Gen xv 2 and xxiv was of old by some taken for his son So that if the Lacedaemonians were sprung from him they might think themselves to be of the posterity of Abraham as well as the Jews who were sprung from Isaac And per haps this Eliezer of Damascus is that very Damascus whom Trogus Pompeius as abridged by Justin makes the founder of the Jewish nation itself Though he afterward blunders and makes Azelus Adores Abraham and Is rael kings of Judea and successors to this Damascus XXXVI 2 It may not be improper to observe far ther that Moses Chorenensis in his history of the Ar menians informs us that the nation of the Parthian also was derived from Abraham by Keturah and her children AN 187 437 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS These were the contents of the epistle which was sent from the king of the Lace daemonians But upon the death of Joseph the people grew seditious on account of his sons For whereas the elders made war against Hyrcanus who was the youngest of Joseph s sons the multitude was divided but the greater part joined with the elders in this war as did Simon the high priest by reason he was of kin to them However Hyrcanus determined not to return to Jeru salem any more but seated himself beyond Jordan and was at perpetual war with the Arabians and slew many of them and took many captives He also erected a strong castle and built it entirely of white stone to the very roof and had animals of a prodi gious magnitude engraven upon it and also encompassed it with a great and deep canal of water He also made caves of many fur longs in length by hollowing a rock that was over against him and then made large rooms in it some for feasting and some for sleeping and living in He introduced also a vast quantity of waters which ran along it and which were very delightful and orna mental in the court But still he made the entrances at the mouths of the caves so very narrow that no more than one person could enter by them at once And the reason why he built them after that manner was for his own preservation lest he should be besieged by his brethren and run the hazard of being caught by them Moreover he built courts of greater magnitude than ordinary which he adorned with vastly large gardens And when he had brought the place to this state he named it Tyre This place is between Arabia and Judea beyond Jordan not far from the country of Heshbon And he ruled over those parts for seven years even all that time that Seleucus was king of Syria But when he was dead his brother Antio chus surnamed Epiphanes took the king dom Ptolemy king of Egypt also died who was besides called Epiphanes He left two sons and both young in age the elder of whom was called Philometor and the younger Physcon As for Hyrcanus when he saw that Antiochus had a great army and feared lest he should be caught by him and brought to punishment for what he had done to the Arabians he slew himself with his own hand and Antiochus seized upon all his substance CHAP V OF THE ftUARRELS WHICH AROSE RESPECTING THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD THE EXPEDITION OF ANTIOCHUS AGAINST JERUSALEM THE CRUELTIES EXECUTED ON THE JEWS ND THE CONDUCT OF THE SAMARITANS UPON the death of Onias the high priest they gave the high priesthood to Jesus his brother for that son which Onias left Onias IV was yet but an infant And in its proper place we will inform the reader of all the circumstances that befell this child But this Jesus who was the brother of Onias was deprived of the high priesthood by the king who was angry with him and gave it to his younger brother whose name also was Onias For Simon had these three sons to each of whom the high priesthood came as we have falready informed the reader This Jesus changed his name to Jason but Onias was called Menelaus Now as the former high priest Jesus raised a sedition against Menelaus who was ordained after him the multitude were divided between them both And the sons of Tobias took the part of Me nelaus but the greater part of the people assisted Jason and by that means Menelaus and the sons of Tobias were distressed and  Chap iv  We have hitherto had but few of those citations where Josephus says that he had elsewhere formerly treated of many things of which yet his present books have not a syllable Our commentators have hitherto been able to give no tolerable account of these citations which are far too numerous and that usually in all his copies both Greek and Latin to be supposed later inter polations which is almost all that has been hitherto said upon this occasion What I have to observe farther is this that we have but very few of these references be fore and very many in and after the history of Antiochus Epiphanes and that Josephus s first work the Hebrew or Chaldee as well as the Greek history of the Jewish war long since lost began with that very history So that the references are most probably made to the edition of the seven books of the war See the several other ex amples I mean besides those in the chapter before us in Antiq XIII 2 and chap 4 6 8 and 13 and Book XVIII chap 2 As for his latter Greek books of that war now extant they are frequetiy cited hereafter also and those citations are still extant therein See Antiq XIII 3 and chap 5 and 10 See also some other places that may give some light to this matter Antiq XIV 6 and chap 7 and XX chap 7 Of the War I 8 IV 8  6 4B2 438 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS retired to Antiochus and informed him that they were desirous to leave the laws of their country and the Jewish customs and to fol low the king s laws and the Grecian mode of living Wherefore they desired his permis sion to build them a gymnasium at Jerusalem Accordingly they left off all the customs that belonged to their own country and imitated the practices of the other nations Now Antiochus upon the agreeable situa tion of the affairs of his kingdom resolved to make an expedition against Egypt both be cause he had a desire to gain it and because he contemned the sons of Ptolemy as not yet of abilities to manage affairs of such conse quence So he came with great forces to Pelusium and circumvented Ptolemy Philo metor by treachery and seized upon Egypt He then came to the places about Memphis and when he had taken them he hastened to Alexandria in hopes of taking it by siege and of subduing Ptolemy who reigned there But he was driven not from Alexandria but out of all Egypt by the declaration of the Romans who charged him to let that country alone I will now give a particular account of what concerns this king how he subdued Judea and the temple For in my former work I mentioned those things very briefly and have therefore now thought it necessary to go over that history again and that with great accuracy King Antiochus returning out of Egypt for ffear of the Romans made an expedition against the city of Jerusalem and when he was there in the hundred and forty thirdJ year of the kingdom of the Seleucidse he took the city without fighting those of his own party opening the gates to him And when he had gotten possession of Jerusalem he slew many of the opposite party and when he had plundered it of a great deal of money he returned to Antioch Now it came to pass after two years in the hundred and forty fifth year on the twenty fifth day of that month which is by us called Casleu and by the Macedonians Apelleus in the hundred and fifty third Olympiad that the king came up to Jerusalem and pretend ing peace he got possession of the city by treachery At which time he spared not so much as those that admitted him into it on account of the riches that lay in the temple But led by his covetous inclination for he saw there was in it a great deal of gold and many ornaments that had been dedicated to it of very great value and in order to plun der its wealth he returned to break the league he had made So he left the temple bare and took away the golden candle sticks and the golden altar of incense and table of shew bread and the altar of burnt offering and did not abstain from even the veils which were made of fine linen and scarlet He also emptied it of its secret treasures and left nothing at all remaining and by this means cast the Jews into great lamentation For he forbade them to offer those daily sacrifices which they used to offer to God according to the law And when he had pillaged the whole city some of the inhabitants he slew and some he car ried captive together with their wives and children so that the multitude of those captives that were taken alive amounted to about ten thousand He also burnt down  Hereabout Josephug begins to follow the first Book of the Maccabees a most excellent and authentic his tory And accordingly it is here with great fidelity and exactness abridged by him Between whose present copies there seem to be fewer variations than in any other sacred Hebrew book of the Old Testament whatsoever for this book also was originally written in Hebrew which is very natural because it was written so much nearer to the times of Josephus than the rest were t What Josephus says here that Antiochus returned out of Egypt from his first expedition thither out of fear of the Romans if it refer to Popilius Laenas and the other Roman ambassadors peremptory threatnings is a great mistake that not happening till two years after wards at his second expedition And that Antiochus now assaulted Jerusalem the 2d of the Maccabees says no thing But since the words before us may possibly refer to some other cause of fear from the Romans of which we know nothing from any other author now extant we cannot with any certainty pronounce it to be a mistake However Spanheim takes notice of this second expedition of Antiochus as made mention of by Polybius in Vale siu9 s Excerpta page 132 and out of Polybius by Dio dorus Siculus in the Supplement to those Excerps page 312 By whom and by Dr Hudson we are referred for his exclusion out of Egypt by the Romans to Livy XIV 18 and to Justin Histor XXXIV who give us re markable accounts of it See the places already cited However I cannot agree with Dean Prideaux who mul tiplies these two expeditions into Egypt into four at the year 171 170 169 168 B C J See 1 Mace i 20 But verses 21 22 contain what Josephus ascribes to the second expedition of Antiochus against Jerusalem I 1 Mace i 29

On which account he fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a garrison of Mace donians However in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the Jewish multitude from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities And when the king had built an idol altar upon God s altar he slew swine upon it and so offered a sacrifice neither according to the law nor the Jewish religious worship in that country He also compelled them to forsake the worship which they paid their own God and to adore those whom he took to be gods and made them build temples and raise idol altars in every city and vil lage and offer swine upon them every day He also commanded them not to circumcise their sons and threatened to punish any that should be found to have transgressed his injunction He also appointed overseers who should compel them to do what he com manded And indeed many Jews there were who complied with the king s commands ei ther voluntarily or out of fear of the penalty that was denounced But the best men and those of the noblest spirits did not regard him but continued to pay a greater respect to the customs of their country than concern as to the punishment which he threatened to the disobedient On this account they every day underwent great miseries and bitter tor ments for they were whipped with rods and their bodies were torn to pieces and were crucified while they were still alive They also strangled those women and their sons whom they had circumcised as the king had appointed hanging their sons about their necks as they were upon the crosses And if there were any sacred book or law found it was destroyed and those with whom they were found miserably perished also When the Samaritans saw the Jews under these sufferings they no longer confessed that they were of their kindred nor that the temple on mount Gerizzim belonged to Almighty God But they now said that they were a colony of Medes and Persians And indeed they were a colony of theirs So they sent ambassadors to Antiochus and an epistle whose contents are these â To king Antiochus Epiphanes the god a memorial from the Sidonians who live at Shechem Our forefathers upon certain fre quent tplagues and as following a certain ancient superstition had a custom of observ ing that day which by the Jews is called the Sabbath And when they had erected a tem ple at the mountain called Gerizzim though without a name they offered upon it the pro per sacrifices Now upon the just treatment of these wicked Jews those that manage thy affairs supposing that we were of kin to them and practised as they do make us liable to the same accusations although we be originally Sidonians as is evident from the public records We therefore beseech thee our benefactor and saviour to give or der to Apollonius the governor of this part of the country and Nicanor the procurator of thy affairs to give us no disturbance nor to lay to our charge what the Jews are ac cused for since we are aliens from their nation and from their customs but let our temple which at present hath no name at all be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius If this were once done we should be no longer disturbed but should be more intent on our occupations with quietness and so bring in a greater revenue to thee When the Samaritans had petitioned for this the king sent them back the following answer in an epistle â King Antiochus to Nicanor The Sido nians who live at Shechem have sent me the memorial enclosed When therefore we were advising with our friends about it the  This citadel of which we have such frequent men tion in the following history both in the Maccabees and in Josephus seems to have been a castle built on a hill lower than mount Sion though upon its skirts and higher than mount Moriah but between them both which hill the enemies of the Jews now got possession of and built on it this citadel and fortified it till a good while afterward the Jews regained it demolished it and levelled the hill itself with the common ground that their enemies might no more recover it and thence might overlook the temple and do them such mischief m they had long undergone from it XIII 6 t See the note in Book IX chap XIV  This allegation of the Samaritans is remarkable that though they were not Jews yet did they from ancient times observe the Sabbath day and as they elsewhere pretend

after the customs of the Greeks Ac cordingly we declare them free from such accusations and order that agreeable to their petition their temple be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius He also sent the like epistle to Apollonius the go vernor of that part of the country in the forty si xthf year and the eighteenth day of the month Hecatombeon CHAP VI OF THE EXPLOITS OF MATTATHIAS GRANDSON TO

or Grecian Jupiter is mentioned in the coins of Syracuse and by Aristophanes and by Pindar also as Spanheim here informs us t Instead of the 46th year in the copies we ought no doubt to read here the 146th year i e of the Seleu cidae to which this rescript naturally belongs But how Hecatombeon an Attic or Athenian name of a month comes into a Syromacedonian rescript we cannot tell Nobody can think it original Nor ought we to suppose it so written by Josephus who does not use to corrupt his ancient monuments so absurdly But how it ought to be corrected does not appear X See 1 Mace ii 1â 14 II This was the first of the twenty four courses of the priests that served in the temple 1 Chron xxiv 7 and because Mattathias undertook to determine for the neces sity of fighting on the sabbath in case they were as saulted by the enemy some have from hence inferred that the people had made choice of him for their high priest but besides that this decision is not sufficient to prove this and that it no where appears that he ever per formed the office of high priest but only put himself at the head of a poor distressed people as being a person of the greatest power and authority among them it is certain that both Menelaus and Alcimus were then alive and though they were wicked men and intruders into the office yet they were nominated by king Antiochus tude were under and he told them that it was better for them to die for the laws of their country than to live so ingloriously as they then did When those that were appointed by the king were come to Modin that they might compel the Jews to do what they ordered and to enjoin those that were there to offer sacrifice as the king had commanded they desired that Mattathias a person of the greatest character among them both on other accounts and particularly on account of such a numerous and so deserving a fa mily of children would begin the sacrifice because his fellow citizens would follow his example and because such a procedure would make him honoured by the king But Mattathias boldly replied he would not do it and that if all the other nations would obey the commands of Antiochus either out of fear or to please him yet would not he nor his sons forsake the religious worship of their country But as soon as he had ended his speech there came one of the Jews into the midst of them and sacrificed as Antio chus had commanded at which Mattathias had great indignation and ran upon him vio lently with his sons who had swords with them and slew both the man himself that sacrificed and Apelles the king s general who then assumed the right of nomination and so were looked upon as high priests Calmet s Dictionary under the word Mattathias B Â That this appellation of Maccabee was not first of all given to Judas

Mattathias as Josephus here informs us Dean Prideaux observes that abbreviations of this and several other kinds were very frequent among the Jews and that the Romans bore upon their ensigns the letters S P Q R Senatus Populusque Romanus but still he adds it must be owned that Judas was called by this name 1 Mace ii 4â 66 before ever he set up this standard and therefore others choose rather to de rive it from the Hebrew words Mak ke baiah i e a con queror in the Lord which explication both the double of which occurs in the word Maccabee and his father s account of Judas viz that he had been mighty and strong even from his youth seem to favour Prideaux s Connection anno 167 and Calmet s Commentary on 1 Mace ii 4 B AN 168 441 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS who compelled them to sacrifice with a few of his soldiers He also overthrew the idol altar and cried out If any one be zealous for the laws of his country and for the wor ship of God let him follow me And when he had said this he hastened into the desert with his sons and left all his substance in the village Many others did the same and fled with their children and wives into the desert and dwelt in caves But when the king s generals heard this they took all the forces they then had in the citadel at Jerusalem and pursued the Jews into the desert And when they had overtaken them they in the first place endeavoured to persuade them to repent and to choose what was most for their advantage and not put them to the ne cessity of using them according to the law of war But when they would not comply with their persuasions but continued to be of a different mind they fought against them on the sabbath day and they burnt them as they were in the caves without resistance and without so much as stopping up the en trances of the caves And they avoided to defend themselves on that day because they were not willing to break in upon the honour they owed the sabbath even in such dis tresses For our law requires that we rest upon that day There were about a thousand with their wives and children who were smothered and died in these caves But many of those that escaped joined them selves to Mattathias and appointed him to be their ruler who taught them to fight even on the sabbath day and told them that unless they would do so they would become their own enemies by observing the law so rigorously while their adversaries would still assault them on this day and they would not then defend themselves and that nothing could hinder but they must all perish with out fighting This speech persuaded them and this rule continues among us to the pre sent time that if there be a necessity we may fight on sabbath days So Mattathias assembled a great army and overthrew their idol altars and slew those that brake the laws even all that he could get under his power For many of them were dispersed among the nations round about them for fear of him He also commanded that those boys which were not yet circumcised should be circumcised now and he drove those away that were appointed to hinder such circum cision But when he had ruled one year and was fallen into a distemper he called for his sons f and set them round about him and said  O my sons I am going the way of all the earth and I recommend to you my reso lution and beseech you not to be negligent in keeping it but to be mindful of the de sired of him who begat you and brought you up and to preserve the customs of your country and to recover your ancient form of government which is in danger of being over turned and not be carried away with those  By the law of Moses the Jews were commanded to do no manner of work on the sabbath day but this was a precept which would admit of some exceptions and what some people took in a more rigorous sense than others The Samaritans for instance thought themselves obliged to observe it to such a degree of strictness as not to stir out of their places on that day because the law is literally so expressed Exod xvi 29 but the Jews were of opinion that they were permitted to make their escape from danger or to walk such a compass of ground which they call a sabbath day s journey if it were for any necessary occasion on that day In our Saviour s time it was allowable they thought to pull any animal out of a pit or a ditch on that day Matt xii 11 but the Talmu dical doctors were for revoking that permission and found fault with him for even healing the sick and the lame on the sabbath Mattathias and his company by sundry experiences were convinced that too scrupulous an observance of the sabbath had brought several cala mities upon their nation that Ptolemy the son of Lagus the first king of Egypt of that name by assaulting Jeru salem on the sabbath day wherein the Jews would do nothing to defend themselves became master of it with out opposition and that but just lately a great number of their brethren had been passively slain because they would not so much as handle their arms on that day and thereupon they came to a resolution to defend themselves whenever they were attacked be the day what it would but we do not find that they came to any decision whe ther they themselves were to attack the enemy on the sabbath On the contrary it seems as if they had de termined that they were only permitted to repel force by force and therefore we read that when Pompey be sieged the temple observing that the Jews did barely defend themselves on the seventh day he ordered his men to offer no hostilities but only to raise the batteries plant their engines and make their approaches on that day being well assured that in doing of this he should meet with no molestation from them and by this means he carried the place much sooner than he otherwise would have done Jemsh Antiq lib 14 c 8 Jewish Wars lib 1 c 5 and Calmefs Commentary on 1 Macca bees ii 14 B t 1 Mace ii 49 442 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS V that either by their own inclination or out of

Mattathias had thus discoursed to his sons and had prayed to God to be their assistant and to recover to the people their former constitution he died a little after ward and was buried at Modin all

ance of God in this time of imminent danger and there assistance of his brethren and of others Judas cast their enemies out of the country and put those of their own country to death who had transgressed its laws and purified the land of all the pollutions that were in it CHAP VII OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE JEWISH ARMS UNDER JUDAS MACCABEUS J AND THE PURIFICATION OF THE TEMPLE WHEN Apollonius f the general of the Samaritan forces heard this he took his army and hastened to go against Judas But having joined battle he was defeated and slain by Judas who seized upon his sword and kept it for himself as a trophy of victory J The number of Apollonius s army that were slain was also very great that of the wounded was still more considerable and the victors took a great deal of prey But when Seron who was general of the army of Coelesyria heard that many had joined themselves to Judas and that he had about him an army sufficient for making war he determined to make an expedition against him as thinking it became him to endeavour to punish those that transgressed the king s injunctions He then got together an army as large as he was able and joined it to the runagate and wicked Jews and came as far as Beth horon a village of Judea and there pitched his camp Judas met him and re solved to give him battle but as his soldiers were backward to fight because their number was small and because they wanted food for they were fasting he encouraged them and reminded them that victory and con quests of enemies are not derived from the multitude in armies but in the exercise of piety towards God and that they had the plainest instances in their forefathers who by their righteousness and exerting them selves on behalf of their own laws and their fore he repaired to Mizpeh a place where the people oftentimes used to assemble to prayer Judges xx 1 1 Kings xv 22 2 Chron xvi 6 Here he and all his army addressed themselves to God in solemn fasting and prayer for his assistance and protection and herein he acted the part of a wise and religious commander as knowing that the battle was the Lord s and that therefore it would be impious to begin any such enterprise without first imploring the divine aid Prideaux s Connection anno 166 6 AN 166 443 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS own children had frequently conquered many thousands By this speech he induced his men to contemn the multitude of the enemy and to tall upon Seron And upon joining battle with him he defeated the Syrians and when their general fell among the rest they all ran away with speed as thinking that to be their best way of escaping So he pur sued them into the plain and slew about eight hundred of the enemy but the rest es caped to the region which lay near to the sea When king Antiochus heard of these things he was very angry at what had happened So he assembled all his own army with many mercenaries whom he had hired from the islands and took them with him and prepared to break into Judea about the be ginning of the spring But upon mustering his soldiers he perceived that his treasures were deficient and there was a want of money in them for all the taxes were not paid by reason of the seditions there had been among the nations he having been so magnanimous and so liberal that what he had was not sufficient for him He there fore resolved first to go into Persia and col lect the taxes of that country Hereupon he left one Lysias who was in great repute with him governor of the kingdom as far as the bounds of Egypt and of the lower Asia and reaching from the river Euphrates and com mitted to him a certain part of his forces and of his elephants and charged him to bring up his son Antiochus with all possible care until he came back and that he should conquer Judea and take its inhabitants for slaves and utterly destroy Jerusalem and abolish the whole nation And when king Antiochus had given these things in charge to Lysias he went into Persia and in the hundred and forty seventh year he passed over Euphrates and went up to the superior provinces Upon this Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes and Nicanor and Gorgias very potent men among the king s friends and delivered to them forty thousand foot soldiers and seven thousand horsemen and sent them against Judea Accordingly they came as far as the city Emmaus and pitched their camp in the plain country There came also to them auxiliaries out of Syria and the country round about as also many of the runagate Jews And besides these came some merchants to buy those that should be carried captives having bonds with them to bind those that should be made prisoners with that silver and gold which they were to pay for their price And when Judas saw their camp and how numerous their enemies were he persuaded his own soldiers to be of good courage and exhorted them to place their hopes of victory in God and to make supplication to him according to the custom of their country clothed in sackcloth and to shew what was their usual habit of supplication in the greatest dangers and thereby to prevail with God to grant them the victory over their enemies So he set them in the ancient order of battle used by their forefathers under their captains of thousands and other officers and dismissed such as were newly married as well as those that had newly gained possessions that they might not fight in a cowardly manner out of an inordinate love of life in order to enjoy those blessings When he had thus disposed his soldiers he encouraged them to fight by the following speech O my fellow soldiers no other time remains more opportune than the present for courage and contempt of danger for if you fight manfully you may recover your liberty which as it is a thing of itself agreeable to all men so it proves to be to us much more desirable by its affording us the liberty of worshipping God You are in such circumstances at present that you must either recover that liberty and so re gain a happy and blessed way of living which is according to our laws and the customs of our country or submit to the most oppro brious sufferings nor will any seed of your nation remain if you be beaten in this battle Fight therefore manfully and suppose that you must die though you do not fight But be lieve that besides such glorious rewards as those of the liberty of your country of your laws and of your religion you shall obtain everlasting glory Prepare yourselves there fore and put yourselves into such a posture that you be ready to fight with the enemy as soon as it is day to morrow morning t  1 Mace iii 27 voL I â NOS 37  38 t 1 Mace iii 58 4C 444 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS And this was the speech which Judas made to encourage them But when the enemy sent Gorgias with five thousand foot and one thousand horse that he might fall upon Judas by night and had for that purpose certain of the runagate Jews as guides the son of Mattathias perceived it and resolved to fall upon those enemies that were in their camp now their forces were divided When they had therefore supped in good time and had left many fires in their camp he marched all night to those enemies that were at Emmaus So that when Gorgias found no enemy in their camp but suspected they were retired and had hidden themselves among the moun tains he resolved to go and seek them where soever they were But about break of day Judas appeared to those enemies that were at Emmaus with only three thousand men and those ill armed by reason of their pov erty And when he saw the enemy skilfully fortified in their camp he encouraged the Jews and told them that they ought to fight though it were with their naked bodies for that God had sometimes of old given such men strength and against such as were more in number and were armed also out of re gard to their great courage So he command ed the trumpeters to sound for the battle And by thus falling upon the enemies when they did not expect it and thereby astonish ing and disturbing their minds he slew many of those that resisted him and went on pur suing the rest as far as Gadara and the plains of Idumea and Ashdod and Jamnia And of these there fell about three thousand Yet did Judas exhort his soldiers not to be too desirous of the spoils for that still they must have a battle with Gorgias and the forces that were with him but that when they had once overcome them then they might secure ly plunder the camp because these were the only enemies remaining and they expected no others And just as he was speaking to his soldiers Gorgias s men looked down into that army which they left in their camp and saw that it was overthrown and the camp burnt for the smoke that arose from it shew ed them even when they were a great way off what had happened When therefore those that were with Gorgias understood that things were in this posture and perceived that those that were with Judas were ready to fight them they also were affrighted and put to flight But then Judas as though he had already beaten Gorgias s soldiers with out fighting returned and seized on the spoils He took a great quantity of gold and silver and purple and blue and then returned home with joy and singing hymns to God for their good success For this vic tory greatly contributed to the recovery of their liberty Lysias was confounded at the defeat of the army which he had sent and the next year he assembled sixty thousand chosen men He also took five thousand horsemen and fell upon Judea and he went up to the hill country at Bethsur f a village of Judea and pitched his camp there where Judas met him with ten thousand men And when he saw the great number of his enemies he prayed to God that he would assist him and joined battle with the first of the enemy that appeared and slew about five thousand of them and became thereby terrible to the rest Nay indeed Lysias observing the great spirit of the Jews how they were prepared to die rather than lose their liberty and be ing afraid of their desperate way of fighting as if it were real strength he took the rest of the army back with him and returned to Antioch where he enlisted foreigners into the service and prepared to fall upon Judea with a greater army When therefore the generals of Antiochus s armies had been defeated so often Judas as sembled the people and told them that after these many victories which God had given them they ought to go up to Jerusalem and purify the temple and offer the appointed sacrifices J But as soon as he with the whole multitude was come to Jerusalem and found the temple deserted and its gates burnt down and plants growing in the temple of their own accord on account of its desertion he and those that were with him began to lament and were quite confounded at the  1 Mace iv 24 t It had been fortified by kingRehoboam 2 Chron xi 7 and was at this time a very important fortress as being one of the keys of Judea on the south side of Idumea Universal History lib 2 c 11 B I See 1 Mace iv 36â 65 AN Ub 165 J ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sight of the temple So he chose out some oi his soldiers and gave them order to fight against those guards that were in the citadel until he should have purified the temple When therefore he had carefully purged it and had brought in new vessels the candle stick the table of shew bread and the altar of incense which were made of gold he hung up the veils at the gates and added doors to them He also took down the altar of burnt offering and built a new one of stones that he gathered together and not of such as are hewn with iron tools So on the five and twentieth day of the month Cas leu which the Macedonians call Apelleus they lighted the lamps that were on the can dlestick and offered incense upon the altar of incense and laid the loaves upon the ta ble of shew bread and offered burnt offerings upon the new altar of burnt offering Now it happened that these things were done on the very same day on which their divine worship had fallen off and was reduced to a profane and common use after three years time For so it was that the temple was made desolate by Antiochus and so con tinued for three years For this desolation happened to the temple in the hundred and forty fifth year on the twenty fifth day of the month Apelleus and on the first year of the hundred and fifty third Olympiad But it was dedicated anew on the same day the twenty fifth of the month Apelleus on the hundred and forty eighth year and on the fourth year of the hundred and fifty fourth Olympiad And this desolation came to pass according to the prophecy of Daniel which was given ffour hundred and eight years before For he declared that the Macedo nians would dissolve that worship for some time Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices at the temple for eight days and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon but he feasted the people upon very rich and splendid sacrifices Â and he honour ed God and delighted them by hymns and psalms Nay they were so very glad at the revival of their customs when after a Ion time of intermission they unexpectedly hai regained the freedom of their worship that they made it a law for their posterity that they should keep a festival on account of the restoration of their temple worship for eight days And from that time to this we cele brate this festival and call it Lights I sup pose the reason was because this liberty be yond our hopes appeared to us and thence was the name given to that festival Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city and reared towers of great height against the incursions of the enemies and set guards therein He also fortified the city Beth sura that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies  Exodus xx 25 t Therefore Daniel in Josephus s copies saw the vision in his 8th chapter not on the 3d of Belshazzar but on the first of Darius the Mede Lit Accompl of Proph Suppl page 106 107 108 And we may also take notice as we did before on a like case in the note on XI 5 with what an unusual accuracy Josephus here determines the beginning and ending of these three years of Antiochus s profanation of the temple and adds to the exact num bers of the years of the Seleucidae which he had out of the first book of the Maccabees the Olympiads under which both its beginning and ending fell and this seems done on purpose by him because of the exact fulfilling of Daniel s prophecy hereby as he observes in this place I For 1096 days or three years II This festival is commemorated in the Gospel John ii 23 and our blessed Saviour we are told came up to Jerusalem on purpose to bear a part in the solemnizing of it Some indeed are of opinion that it was another dedication feast which Christ thus honoured with his pre sence but besides that the dedications both of Solomon s and Zerubbabel s temples who though they were very solemnly celebrated at the first erection of these temples had never any anniversary feast afterwards kept in corn memoration of them the very history of the Gospel which tells us that it was kept in winter confines us to this dedication of Judas only That of Solomon was on the seventh month which fell about the time of the autumnal equinox and that of Zerubbabel was on the twelfth month which fell in the beginning of the spring but that of Judas Maccabeus was on their twenty fifth day of the ninth month which fell in the middle of winter So that the feast of the dedication which Christ was pre sent at in Jerusalem was no other than that which was instituted by Judas in commemoration of his dedication of the temple anew after that it had been cleansed from idolatrous pollutions and from hence Grotius in his Commentary on the Gospel of St John chap x 22 very justly observes that festival days in memory of public blessings may be piously instituted by persons in author ity without a divine command Prideaxuc1  Connection an 166 B Â Sacrifices as to their primary object were designed to appease or honour the Deity and as the accomplish ment of that object was of great importance to those who offered them it appears a proper expression of their joy that they should feast at the same time Hence it became universal to feast upon the sacrifices offered unto God B 4C2 146 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP VIII OF THE CONTINUED SUCCESSES OF THE MACCABEES WHEN these things were over the na tions round about the Jews were very uneasy at the revival of their power and rose up together and destroyed many of them as gaining advantage over them by laying snares for them and making secret conspiracies against them Judas made per petual expeditions against these men and endeavoured to restrain them from those in cursions and to prevent the mischiefs they did to the Jews So he fell upon the Idume ans the posterity of Esau at Acrabattene and slew a great many of them and took their spoils He also shut up the sons of Bean that laid wait for the Jews and he sat down about them and besieged them and burnt their towers and destroyed the men that were in them After this he went thence in haste against the Ammonites who had a great and a numerous army of which Timo theus was the commander And when he had subdued them he seized on the city Ja zer and took their wives and their children captives and burnt the city and then return ed into Judea But when the neighbouring nations understood that he was returned they assembled in great numbers in the land of Gilead and came against those Jews that were at their borders who then fled to the garrison of Dathema and sent to Judas to inform him that Timotheus was endeavour ing to take the place whither they were fled And as soon as these epistles were reading there came other messengers out of Galilee who informed him that the inhabitants of Ptolemais and of Tyre and Sidon and stran gers of Galilee were gotten together Accordingly Judas upon considering what was proper to be done with relation to the necessity both these cases required gave or der that his brother Simon should take three thousand chosen men and go to the assist ance of the Jews in Galilee while he and another of m brothers Jonathan made haste into the land of Gilead with eight thousand soldiers And he left Joseph the son of Zacharias and Azarias to be over the rest of the forces and charged them to keep Ju  1 Mace v 1 2 dea very carefully and to fight no battles with any person until his return According ly Simon went into Galilee and tought the enemy and put them to flight and pursued them to the very gates of Ptolemais and slew about three thousand of them and took the spoils of those that were slain and those Jews whom they had made captives with their baggage and then returned home Now as for Judas Maccabeus and his brother Jonathan they passed over the river Jordan f and when they had gone three days journey they met with the Nabateans who came to meet them peaceably and told them how the affairs of those in the land of Gilead stood and how many of them were in distress and driven into garrisons and into the cities of Galilee and exhorted him to make haste to go against the foreigners and to endeavour to save his own countrymen out of their hands Accordingly Judas returned into the wilderness and in the first place fell upon the inhabitants of Bosor and took the city and beat the inhabitants and destroyed all the males and all that were able to fight and burnt the city Nor did he stop even when night came on but he journeyed in it to the garrison where the Jews happened to be shut up and where Timotheus lay round the place with his army And Judas came upon the city in the morning and when he found that the enemy were making an assault upon the walls and that some of them brought ladders on which they might get upon those walls and that others brought engines to bat ter them he bade the trumpeter sound his trumpet and encouraged his soldiers to un dergo dangers cheerfully for the sake of his brethren and kindred he also parted his ar my into three bodies and fell upon the backs of their enemies But when Timotheus s men perceived that it was Maccabeus that was upon them of whose courage and good suc cess in war they formerly had sufficient ex perience they were put to flight But Judas followed them with his army and slew about eight thousand of them He then turned aside to a city of the foreigners called Malle and took it and slew all the males and burnt the city itself He then removed from thence and overthrew Casphom and t 1 Mace t 24 AN 164 447 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Bosor and many other cities of the land of Gilead But not long after this Timotheus prepared a great army and took many others as aux iliaries and induced some of the Arabians by the promise of rewards to go with him in this expedition and came with his army be yond the brook over against the city Raphon And he encouraged his soldiers if it came to a battle with the Jews to fight courageously and to hinder their passing over the brook for he said to them beforehand If they come over it we shall be beaten And when Judas heard that Timotheus prepared himself to fight he took all his own army and went in haste against his enemy and when he had passed over the brook he fell upon his ene mies and some of them he slew and others of them he so terrified that he compelled them to throw down their arms and fly And some of these escaped but some of them fled to what was called the temple at Car naim and hoped thereby to preserve them selves But Judas took the city and slew them and burnt the temple and so used several ways of destroying his enemies When he had done this he gathered the Jews together with their children and wives and the substance that belonged to them and was going to bring them back into Judea But as soon as he was come to a certain city called Ephron that lay upon the road and as it was not possible for him to go any other way he was not willing to go back again he sent to the inhabitants and desired that they would open their gates and permit them to go on their way through the city for they had stopped up the gates with stones and cut oflT their passage through it And when the inhabitants of Ephron would not agree to this proposal he encouraged those that were with him and encompassed the city round and besieged it and lying round it by day and by night took the city and slew every male in it and burnt it down and so obtained a way through it And the multitude of those that were slain was so great that they went over the dead bodies So they came over Jordan and arrived at the great plain over against which is situate the city Bethshan which is called by the Greeks Scythopolis And going away hastily from thence they came into Judea singing psalms and hymns as they went and indulging such tokens of mirth as are usual in triumphs upon victory They also offered thank offerings both for their good success and for the preservation of their army For fnot one of the Jews was slain in these battles But Joseph the son of Zacharias and Aza rias whom Judas left generals of the forces at the same time when Simon was in Galilee fighting against the people of Ptolemais and Judas himself and his brother Jonathan were in the land of Gilead did also affect the glory of being courageous generals in war in order whereto they took the army that was under their command and came to Jamnia There Gorgias the general of the forces of Jamnia met them and upon joining battle with him they lost Jtwo thousand of their army and fled away and were pursued to the very bor ders of Judea And this misfortune befell them by their disobedience to Judas who had enjoined them not to fight with any one before his return For besides the rest of Judas s sagacious counsels one may won der that this concerning the misfortune that befell the forces commanded by Joseph and Azarias which he understood would happen if they brake any of the injunctions he had given them But Judas and his brethren  The reason why Bethshan was called Scythopolis is well known from Herodotus I page 105 and Syncellus page 214 that the Scythians when they over ran Asia in the days of Josiah seized on this city and kept it as long as they continued in Asia From which time it retained the name of Scythopolis or the city of the Scy thians It is so called by the author of the second book of Maccabees from Jason of Cyrene xii 29 as well as by Josephus and long before him while yet Josephus could not well take it from either of them whose writings or any other such Greek sacred authors he never appears to have seen See Essay on the Old Testament page 184â 195 and Supplement page 45 46 t This most providential preservation of all the reli gious Jews in this expedition which was according to the will of God is observable often among God s people the Jews and some very like it in the changes of the four monarchies which were also highly providential See Prideaux at the years 334 333 and 331 J Here is another great instance of Providence that when even at the very time that Simon and Judas and Jonathan were so miraculously preserved and blessed in the just defence of their laws and religion these other generals of the Jews who went to fight for honour in a vain glorious way and without any commis sion from God or the family he had raised up to deliver them were miserably disappointed and defeated Sec 1 Mace v 61 62 448 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS did not leave off fighting with the Idumeans but pressed upon them on all sides and took from them the city of Hebron and demolished all its fortifications and set its towers on fire and burnt the country of the foreigners and the city Marissa They came also to Ashdod and took it and laid it waste and took away a great deal of the spoils and prey that were in it and returned to Judea CHAP IX CONCERNING THE DEATH OF ANTIOCHUS EFIPHANES J AND THE CONDUCT OF ANTIOCHDS EUPATOR TOWARDS JUDAS MACCABEUS ALSO OF ALCIMUS AND ONIAS ABOUT this time king Antiochus as he was going over the upper countries heard that there was a very rich city in Per sia called Elymais and therein a very rich temple of Diana and that it was full of all sorts of donations dedicated to it as also of weapons and breast plates which upon in quiry he found had been left there by Alex ander the son of Philip king of Macedon And being incited by these motives he went in haste to Elymais and assaulted and be sieged it But as those that were in it were not terrified at his assault nor at his siege but opposed him courageously he was beaten off his hopes For they drove him away from the city and went out and pursued after him insomuch that he fled away as far as Baby lon and lost a great many of his army And when he was grieving for this disappoint ment some persons told him of the defeat of his commanders whom he had left to fight against Judea and what strength the Jews had already gotten When this concern about these affairs was added to the former he was confounded and by the anxiety he was in fell into a distemper which as it lasted a great while and as his pains in creased upon him so he at length perceived he should die in a little time So he called his friends to him and told them that his distemper was severe upon him and con fessed withal that this calamity was sent upon him for the miseries he had brought upon the Jewish nation while he plundered their temple and contemned their God And when he had said this he gave up the ghost Whence one may wonder at Polybius of Megalopolis who though otherwise a good man yet saith that Antiochus died be cause he had a purpose to plunder the tem ple of fDiana in Persia For the purposing to do a thing but not actually doing it is not worthy of punishment But if Polybius could think that Antiochus thus lost his life on that account it is much more probable that this king died on account of his sacrilegious plundering of the temple at Jerusalem But we will not contend about this matter with those who may think that the cause assigned by this Polybius of Megalopolis is nearer the truth than that assigned by us However Antiochus before he died called for Philip who was one of his companions and made him the guardian of his kingdom And gave him his diadem and his garment and his ring and charged him to deliver them to his son Antiochus and desired him to take care of his education and to preserve the kingdom for him This Antiochus died in the hundred and forty ninth year But it was Lysias that declared his death to the multitude and appointed his son Antiochus to be king of whom at present he had the care and called himEupator At this time it was that the garrison in the citadel at Jerusalem with the Jewish run agates did a great deal of harm to the Jews For the soldiers that were in that garrison rushed out upon the sudden and destroyed  1 Mace vi 12 f Dr Hudson observes here that Jerom upon Daniel xi says Polybius and Diodoras both relate how this Antiochus attempted to seize upon the spoils of the temple of Elymais which was full of riches Hudson also notes that Strabo places this temple of Diana at Elymais XVI page 744 See Authentic Records part I page 226 and Prideaux at the year 164 J Since St Paul a Pharisee confesses that he had not known concupiscence or desires to be sinful had not the tenth commandment said Thou shalt not covet Rom vii 7 the case seems to have been much the same with our Josephus who was of the same sect that he had not a deep sense of the greatness of any sins that proceeded no farther than the intention However since Josephus speaks here properly of the punishment of death which is not inflicted by any law either of God or man for the bare intention his words need not be strained to mean that sins intended but not executed were no sins at all II No wonder that Josephus here describes Antiochus Eupator as young and wanting tuition when he came to the crown since Appian informs us Dr Hudson notes here Syriac page 177 that he was then but nine years old AN 163 449 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS such as were going up to the temple in order to offer their sacrifices for this citadel ad joined to and overlooked the temple When these misfortunes had often happened to them Judas resolved to destroy that garri son Accordingly he got all the people to gether and vigorously besieged those that were in the citadel This was in the hun dred and fiftieth year of the dominion of the Seleucidae So he made engines of war and erected bulwarks and very zealously pressed on to take the citadel But there were not a few of the runagates who were in the place that went out by night into the country and got together some other wicked men like themselves and went to Antiochus the king and desired of him that he would not suffer them to be neglected under the great hardships that lay upon them from those of their own nation and this because their sufferings were occasioned on his fa ther s account while they left the religious worship of their fathers and preferred that which he had commanded them to follow that there was danger lest the citadel and those that were appointed to garrison it by the king should be taken by Judas and those that were with him unless he would send them succours When Antiochus who was but a child heard this he was angry and sent for his captains and his friends and gave order that they should get an army of mercenaries together with such men also of his own kingdom as were of an age fit for war Accordingly an army was collected of about a hundred thousand footmen twenty thousand horsemen and thirty two ele phants So the king took this army and marched hastily out 01 Antioch with Lysias who had the command of the whole and came to Idu mea and thence went up to Bethsura a city that was strong and not to be taken without freat difficulty he sat about this city and esieged it And while the inhabitants of Bethsura courageously opposed him and sal lied out upon him and burnt his engines of war a great deal of time was spent in the siege But when Judas heard of the king s coming he raised the siege of the citadel and met the king and pitched his camp in certain straits at a place called Bethzachariah at the distance of seventy furlongs from the enemy But the king soon drew his forces from Bethsura and brought them to those straits And as soon as it was day he put his men in battle array and made his ele phants follow one another through the nar row passes because they could not be set sideways one by another Now round about every elephant there were a thousand foot men and five hundred horsemen The ele phants also had high towers upon their backs and archers in them And he also made the rest of his army to go up the moun tains and put his friends before the rest and gave orders for the army to shout aloud and so he attacked the enemy He also exposed to sight their golden and brazen shields so that a glorious splendour was sent from them and when they shouted the mountains echoed again When Judas saw this he was not terrified but received the enemy with great courage and slew about six hundred of the first ranks But when his brother Eleazar whom they called Auran saw the tallest of all the elephants armed with royal breast plates and supposed that the king was upon him he attacked him with great quickness and bravery He also slew many of those that were about the ele phant and scattered the rest and then went under the belly of the elephant and smote him and slew him So the elephant fell upon Eleazar and by his weight crushed him to death f And thus did this man come to his end when he had first courageously destroyed many of his enemies But Judas seeing the strength of the ene my retired to Jerusalem and prepared to endure a siege As for Antiochus he sent part of his army to Bethsura to besiege it and with the rest of his army he came against Jerusalem But the inhabitants of Bethsura were terrified at his strength and seeing that their provisions grew scarce they de much more authentic history in 1 Mace vi 28 c agrees with him we have no reason to suppose him therein mistaken  Dr Hudson observes here that Jason of Cyrene as epitomized in the second book of the Maccabees chap xiii tells this story very differently from Josephus But then since as I have lately remarked Josephus never appears to have seen those books and since that t 1 Mace vi 46 450 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS livered themselves up upon the security of oaths that they should surfer no hard treat ment from the king And when Antiochus had thus taken the city he did them no other harm than sending them out naked He also placed a garrison of his own in the city But as for the temple of Jerusalem he lay at its siege a long time while they within bravely defended it For whatso ever engines the king set against them they set other engines again to oppose them But then their provisions failed what fruits of the ground they had laid up were spent and the land not being ploughed that year continued unsowed because it was the seventh year on which by our law we are obliged to let it lie uncultivated And withal so many of the besieged ran away for want of necessaries that but a few only were left in the temple U These happened to be the circumstances of such as were besieged in the temple But then because Lysias the general of the ar my and Antiochus the king were informed that Philip was coming upon them out of Persia and was endeavouring to gain the management of public affairs to himself they came into these sentiments to leave the siege and to make haste to go against Philip Yet did they resolve not to let this be known to the soldiers or to the officers But the king commanded Lysias to speak openly to the soldiers and the officers without saying a word about the business of Philip and lo intimate to them that the siege would be very tedious that the place was very strong that they were already in want of provisions that many affairs of the kingdom wanted regulation and that it was much better to make a league with the be sieged and to become friends to their whole  nation by permitting them to observe the laws of their fathers while they broke out into this war only because they were de prived of them and so to depart home When Lysias had discoursed thus both the army and the officers were pleased with this resolution Accordingly the king sent to Judas and  1 Mace vi 62 t If we here understand by Alcimus s or Jacirous s be ing made high priest his being confirmed in that dignity which he had claimed and usurped before both in this to those that were besieged with him and promised to give them peace and to permit them to make use of and live according to the laws of their fathers And they gladly received his proposals And when they had gained security upon oath for their per formance they went out of the temple But when Antiochus came into it and saw how strong the place was he broke his oaths and ordered his army that was there to pluck down the walls to the ground and when he had so done he returned to An tioch he also carried with him Onias the high priest who was also called Menelaus For Lysias advised the king to slay Mene laus if he would have the Jews be quiet and cause him no farther disturbance for that this man was the origin of all the mis chief the Jews had done them by persuad ing his father to compel the Jews to leave the religion of their fathers So the king sent Menelaus to Berea a city of Syria and there had him put to death when he had been high priest ten years He had been a wicked and an impious man and in order to get the government to himself had compelled his nation to transgress their own laws After the death of Menelaus f Alcimus who was also called Jacimus was made high priest But when king Antiochus found that Philip had already possessed him self of the government he made war against him and subdued him and took him and slew him Now as to Onias the son of the high priest who as we before informed you was left a child when his father died when he saw that the king had slain his uncle Menelaus and given the high priest hood to Alcimus who was not of the high priests stock but as induced by Lysias to translate that dignity from this family to another house he fled to Ptolemy king of Egypt And when he found he was in great esteem with him and with his wife Cleopatra he desired and obtained a place in the Nomus of Heliopolis wherein he built a temple like to that at Jerusalem of which therefore we shall hereafter give an account place and in the parallel place 1 Mace vii 5 whence Josephus took the history this will agree with the series of the present transactions otherwise not AW 451 163 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP X OF THE UNSUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION OF BACCHIDES THE GENERAL OF DEMETRIUs s ARMV AGAINST JUDEA J THE SUBSEQUENT DEFEAT OF N1CANOR THE DEATH OF AL CIMUS AND THE SUCCESSION OF JUDAS ABOUT the same time Demetrius the son of Seleucus fled away from Rome and took Tripoli a city of Syria and set the diadem on his own head He also gathered certain mercenary soldiers together and en tered into his kingdom and was joyfully received by all who delivered themselves up to him And when they had taken An tiochus the king and Lysias they brought them to him alive both of whom were im mediately put to death by the command of Demetrius when Antiochus had reigned two years But there were now many of the wicked Jewish runagates that came together to him and with them Alcimus the high priest who accused the whole nation and particularly Judas and his brethren and said that they had slain all his friends and that those in his kingdom that were of his party and waited for his return were by them put to death that these men had ejected them out of their own country and caused them to be sojourners in a foreign land and they desired that he would send some one of his own friends and know from him what mischief Judas s party had done At this Demetrius was very angry and sent Bacchides a friend of Antiochus Epi phanes fa good man and one that had been intrusted with all Mesopotamia and gave him an army and committed Alcimus the high priest to his care and gave him charge to slay Judas and those that were with him So Bacchides made haste and went out of Antioch with his army and when he was come into Judea he sent to Judas and his brethren to discourse with him about a league of friendship and peace For he had a mind to take him by treachery But Judas did not give credit to him for he saw that he came with so great an army as men do not bring  1 Mace vii 2 3 t It is no way probable that Josephus would call Bac chides that bitter enemy of the Jews as our present copies have it av W xflS0V a good man or kind and gentle in which latter sense he uses the word xfISÂ S soon afterward what the author of the first book of voL I â NOS 37  38 when they come to make peace but to make war However some of the people acqui esced in what Bacchides caused to be pro claimed And supposing they should undergo no considerable harm from Alcimus who was their countryman they went over to them and when they had received oaths from both of them that neither they themselves nor those of the same sentiments should come to any harm they intrusted themselves with them But Bacchides troubled not himself about the oaths he had taken but slew threescore of them although by not keeping his faith with those that first went over he deterred all the rest who had intentions to go over to him from doing it But as he was gone out of Jerusalem and was at the village called Bethzetho he sent out and caught many of the deserters and some of the peo ple also and slew them all and enjoined all that lived in the country to submit to Al cimus So he left him there with some part of the army that he might have wherewith to keep the country in obedience and re turned to Antioch to king Demetrius But Alcimus was desirous to have the do minion more firmly assured to him And un derstanding that if he could bring it about that the multitude should be his friends he should govern with greater security he spake kind words to them all and discoursed to each of them after an agreeable and pleasant manner By which means he quickly had a great body of men and an army about him although the greater part of them were of the wicked and the deserters With these whom he used as his servants and soldiers he went all over the country and slew all that he could find of Judas s party But when Judas saw that Alcimus was already become great and had destroyed many good and holy men he also went all over the country and destroy ed those that were of the other party When Alcimus saw that he was not able to oppose Judas nor was equal to him in strength he resolved to apply himself to king Demetrius for his assistance So he came to Antioch Maccabees whom Josephus here follows instead of that character says of him is this that he was a great man in the kingdom and zsigmru Gaifikii faithful to the king Which was very probably Josephus s meaning also Perhaps therefore he wrote wjov faithful for XflS0V good or gentle 4D 452 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and irritated him against Judas and accused him alleging that he had undergone many miseries by his means and that he would do more mischief unless he were prevented and brought to punishment which must be done by sending a powerful force against him So Demetrius being already of opinion that it would be a thing pernicious to his own affairs to overlook Judas now he was becoming so great sent against him Nicanor the most faithful of all his friends For he it was who fled away with him from the city of Rome He also gave him as many forces as he thought sufficient for him to conquer Judas and bade him not to spare the nation at all When Nicanor was come to Jerusalem he did not resolve to fight Judas immediately but judged it better to get him into his power by treachery So he sent a pacific message and said there was no manner of necessity for them to fight and hazard themselves and that he would give him his oath that he would do him no harm For that he only came with some friends in order to let him know what king Demetrius s intentions were and what opinion he had of their nation When Nica nor had delivered this message Judas and his brethren complied with him and suspecting no deceit they gave him assurances of friend ship and received Nicanor and his army But while he was saluting Judas and they were talking together he gave a certain signal to his troops upon which they were to seize upon Judas But he perceived the treachery and ran back to his own soldiers and fled away with them So upon this discovery of his purpose and of the snares laid for Judas Nicanor determined to make open war with him and gathered his army together and prepared for fighting him and upon joining battle with him at a certain village called Capharsalama hef beat Judas and forced him to flee to that citadel which was at Jeru salem When Nicanor came down from the citadel unto the temple some of the priests and elders met him and saluted him and shewed him the sacrifices which they said they offered to God for the king Upon this he blasphemed and threatened them that un less the people would deliver up Judas to him upon his return he would pull down the temple J And when he had thus threatened them he departed from Jerusalem But the priests fell into tears out of grief at what he had said and besought God to deliver them from their enemies Now Nicanor when he was gone out of Jerusalem and was at a cer tain village called Bethoron he there pitched his camp another army out of Syria having joined him And Judas pitched his camp at Adasa another village which was thirty fur longs distant from Bethoron having no more than one thousand soldiers And when he had encouraged them not to be dismayed at the multitude of their enemies nor to regard how many they were against whom they were going to fight but to consider who they themselves were and for what great re wards they hazarded themselves and to attack the enemy courageously he led them out to fight and joining battle with Nicanor he overcame the enemy after a severe con flict and slew many of them and at last Ni canor himself fell as he was fighting glori ously Upon his fall the army did not stay but when they had lost their general they were put to flight and threw down their arms Judas also pursued and slew them and gave notice by sound of trumpet to the neighbouring villages that he had conquered the enemy Which when the inhabitants heard they put on their armour hastily and met their enemies in the face as they were running

the victory to Nicanor contrary to the words following which imply that he who was beaten fled into the citadel which belonged to the city of David or to mount Sion and was in the possession of Nicanor s garrison and not of Judas s As also it is contrary to the express words of Josephus s original author 1 Mace vii 32 who sayR that Nicanor lost about 6000 men and fled to the city of David I

returned into their former state of wars and hazards Now as the high priest Alcimus was re solving to pull down the wall of the sanctu ary which had been there of old time and had been built by the holy prophets he was smitten suddenly by God This stroke made him fall down speechless upon the ground and undergoing torments for many days he at length died when he had been high priest four years And when he was dead the people bestowed the high priesthood on fJudas Who hearing of the powerJ of the Romans and that they had conquered in war Galatia Iberia Carthage and Libya and that besides these they had subdued Greece and the kings Perseus and Philip and Anti ochus the Great he resolved to enter into a league of friendship with them He there fore sent to Rome some of his friends Eupo lemus the son of John and Jason the son of Eleazar and by them desired the Romans that they would assist them and be their friends and would write to Demetrius that he would not fight against the Jews So the senate received the ambassadors that came to Rome from Judns and discoursed with them about the errand on which they came and then granted them a league of assistance They also made a decree concerning it and sent a copy of it into Judea It was also laid up in the capitol and engraven in brass The decree itself was this â The decree of the senate concerning a league of assistance and friendship with the nation of the Jews It shall not be lawful for any that are subject to the Romans to make war with the nation of the Jews nor to assist those that do so either by sending them corn ships or money And if any attack be made upon the Jews the Romans shall assist them as far as they are able And again if any attack be made upon the Ro mans the Jews shall assist them And if the nation of the Jews have a mind to add to or to take away any thing from this league of assistance that shall be done with the com mon consent of the Romans And whatso ever addition shall thus be made it shall be of force This decree was written by Eupolemus the son of John and by Jason the son of Eleazar when Judas was the high priest of the nation and Simon his brother was general of the army And this was the first league that the Romans made with the Jews CHAP XI OF THE SECOND EXPEDITION OF BACCHIDES AGAINST THE JEWS AND THE DEATH OF JUDAS MACCABEUS WHEN Demetrius was informed of the death of Nicanor and of the destruc tion of the army that was with him he sent Bacchides again with an army into Judea Accordingly he marched out of Antioch and came into Judea and pitched his camp at Arbela a city of Galilee and having besieged Megillath Taanith They now fast on that day in me mory of Esther s fast before the days of Purim See 2 Mace xv 36  This account of the miserable death of Alcimus or Jacimus the wicked high priest the first that was not of the family of the high priest and made by a vile heathen Lysias  before the death of Judas and of Judas s suc cession to him as high priest both here and at the con clusion of this book directly contradicts 1 Mace ix 54 57 which places his death after that of Judas and says not a syllable of the high priesthood of Judas This ac count is also inconsistent with Josephus s own most accu rate scheme of the chronology of the Jewish high priests at the end of the Antiquities where instead of any years high priesthood ascrihed to Judas which are three years at the end of this 12th book he makes an interregnum in the pontificate after Alcimus or Jacimus for seven years and allows Alcimus or Jacimus to have been high priest but three years instead of four years here These errors seem to imply that the copy of the first book of Macca bees which Josephus used when he wrote this 12th book had the number four for the duration of Akimus s high priesthood and had a dislocation of the verses above mentioned which then appeared at the end of the 7th chapter and that afterwards he met with a better copy whence he corrected his former errors Which is a thing by no means unusual in the works of this author t That the Asmoneans might be the direct heirs of the high priesthood of Judea upon the extirpation of the old family from Joshua the son of Josedek see Prideaux at the years 153 and 141 J How well the Roman histories agree with this ac count of the conquests and powerful condition of the Ro mans at this time see the notes in Havereamp s edition Only that the number of the senators of Rome was then just 320 is I think only known from 1 Maccabees viii 15 II This subscription is wanting 1 Mace viii 17 29 and must be the words of Josephus who by mistake thought as we have just now seen that Judas was at this time high priest and accordingly reckoned his brother Jonathan to be then general of the army which yet he seems not to have been till after the death of Judas 4D2 454 book XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS find taken those that were there in their caves for many of the people had fled into such places he removed and made all the haste he could to Jerusalem And when he had learned that Judas had pitched his camp at a certain village whose name was Beth zetho he led his army against him They were twenty thousand footmen and two thou sand horsemen Now Judas had no more soldiers than one thousand When these saw the multitude of Bacchides s men they were afraid and left their camp and fled all away excepting eight hundred Now when Judas was deserted by his own soldiers and the enemy pressed upon him and gave him no time to gather his army together he was disposed to fight with Bacchides s army though he had but eight hundred men with him So he exhorted these men to undergo the danger courageously and encouraged them to attack the enemy And when they said they were not a body sufficient to fight so great an army and advised that they should retire now and save themselves and that when he had gathered his own men together he should fall upon the enemy after wards his answer was this Let not the sun ever see such a thing that I should shew my back to the enemy and although this be the time that will bring me to my end and I must die in this battle I will rather stand to it courageously and bear whatever comes upon me than by running away bring re proach upon my former great actions or tarnish their glory This was the speech he made to those that remained with him whereby he encouraged them to attack the enemy But Bacchides drew his army out of their camp and put them in array for the battle He set the horsemen on both wings and the light soldiers and the archers he placed be fore the whole army but he was himself on the right wing And when he had thus put his army in order and was going to join battle with the enemy he commanded the trumpeter to give a signal and the army to make a shout and to fall on the enemy And when Judas had done the same he joined battle with them and as both sides fought valiantly and the engagement continued till sun set Judas saw that Bacchides and the strongest part of the army was in the right wing and therefore took the most coura geous men with him and ran upon that part of the army and fell upon those that were there and brake their ranks and drove them into the middle forced them to run away and pursued them as far as to a mountain called Aza But when those of the left wing saw that the right wing was put to flight they encompassed Judas and pursued him and came behind him and took him into the middle of their army So being not able to flee but encompassed round about with ene mies he stood still and he and those that were with him fought And when he had slain a great many of those that came against him he at last was himself wounded and fell and gave up the ghost and died in a way like to his former famous actions When Judas was dead those that were with him had no one whom they could regard as their commander but when they saw themselves deprived of such a general they fled f But Simon and Jonathan Judas s brethren re ceived his dead body by a treaty from the enemy and carried it to the village Modin where their father had been interred and there buried him while the multitude la mented him many days and performed the usual solemnities of a funeral to him And this was the end that Judas came to He had been a man of valour and a great war rior and mindful of the commands of their father Mattathias and had undergone all difficulties both in doing and suffering for the liberty of his countrymen And when his cha racter was so excellent while he was alive he left behind him a glorious reputation and memorial by gaining freedom for his nation and delivering them from slavery under the Macedonians And when he had retained the high priesthood three years he died  That this copy of Josephus as he wrote it had here not 1000 but 3000 with 1 Mace ix 5 is very plain because though the main part ran away at first even in Josephus as well as in 1 Mace ix 6 yet as there so here 800 are said to have remained with Judas Which would be absurd if the whole number had been no more than 1000 t 1 Mace iz 18 AH 161 455 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK XIII Containing an Interval of Eighty two Years FROM THE DEATH OF JUDAS MACCABEUS TO THE DEATH OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA CHAP I OB THE SUCCESSION OF JONATHAN TO THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER JUDAS AND OK THE WAR WHICH HE TOGETHER WITH HIS BROTHER SIMON WAGED AGAINST BACCHIDES BY what means the nation of the Jews recovered their freedom when they had been brought into slavery by the Mace donians and what struggles and conflicts Judas the general of their army underwent till he was slain as he was fighting for them hath been related in the preceding book But after he was dead all the wicked and those that transgressed the laws of their forefathers sprang up again in Judea and grew upon them and distressed them on every side A famine also assisted their wickedness and afflicted the country till not a few who by reason of their want of necessaries and be cause they were not able to bear up against the miseries that both the famine and their enemies brought upon them deserted their country and went to the Macedonians And now Bacchides gathered those Jews together who had apostatized from their neighbours and committed the care of the country to them Accordingly they caught the friends of Judas and those of his party and deliver ed them up to Bacchides who when he had in the first place tormented them at his plea sure he by that means at length killed them And when this calamity of the Jews was be come so great as they never had experience of the like since their return out of Babylon those that remained of the companions of Judas seeing that the nation was ready to be destroyed after a miserable manner came to his brother Jonathan and desired that he would imitate his brother in that care which he took of his countrymen for whose liberty in general he died also and that he would not permit the nation to be without a go vernor especially in those destructive cir cumstances wherein it now was And when Jonathan said that he was ready to die for them and was indeed esteemed no way infe rior to his brother he was appointed to be the general of the Jewish army When Bacchides heard this and was afraid that Jonathan might prove very troublesome to the king and the Macedonians as Judas had been before him he sought how he might slay him by treachery But this intention was known to Jonathan and to his brother Simon who took all their companions and  Bacchides as soon as he arrived in Judea went after Jonathan but upon his approach Jonathan left Simon his brother with one part of the forces to defend the place whilst himself with the other part took the field to harass the enemy abroad in which capacities they both acted so well Jonathan by cutting off several of their parties and now and then falling upon the outskirts of their army employed in the siege and Simon by making frequent sallies upon them and burning the engines they had brought against the place that Bacchides 1 Macc ix 69â 73 Joseph Antiq lib 12 c 1 and 2 growing weary of this undertaking and not a little enraged at those who were the occasion of his return and disgrace put several of them to death This opportunity Jonathan laid hold on and therefore sent messengers to him to de sire an accommodation which Bacchides readily came into so that a peace was concluded The prisoners whom he had in his custody were all restored and himself took an oath never to molest the Jews any more which accord ingly he fulfilled for as soon as the peace was ratified on both sides he went away and never more returned into the country B 456 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS presently fled into that wilderness which was nearest to the city And when they were come to the lake called Asphar they abode there But when Bacchides was sensible that they were in a low state and were in that place he hastened to fall upon them with all his forces and pitching his camp beyond Jordan he recruited his army But when Jonathan knew that Bacchides was coming upon him he sent his brother John who was also called Gaddis to the Nabatean Arabs that he might deposit his baggage with them until the battle with Bacchides should be over For they were the Jews friends But the sons of Ambri laid an am bush for John from the city Medaba and seized upon him and upon those that were with him and plundered all that they had with them They also slew John and all his companions However they were sufficiently punished for what they now did by John s brethren as we shall relate presently When Bacchides knew that Jonathan had pitched his camp among the lakes of Jordan he observed when their sabbath day came and then assaulted him as supposing that he would not fight because of the law for resting on that day But he exhorted his companions to fight and told them that their lives were at stake since they were encompassed by the river and by their ene mies and had no way to escape for that their enemies pressed upon them before and the river was behind them So after he had prayed to God to give them the victory he joined battle with the enemy and overthrew many and as he saw Bacchides coming up boldly to him he stretched out his right hand to smite him but the other foreseeing and avoiding his stroke Jonathan with his com panions leaped into the river and swam over it and by that means escaped beyond Jor dan while the enemy did not pass over that river but Bacchides returned presently to the citadel at Jerusalem having lost about two thousand of his army He also fortified many cities of Judea whose walls had been demolished Jericho Emmaus Bethoron Bethel Timna Pharatho Tecoa and Gaza ra and built towers in every one of these cities and encompassed them with strong walls that were very large also and put garrisons into them that they might issue out of them and do mischief to the Jews He also fortified the citadel of Jerusalem more than all the rest Moreover he took the sons of the principal Jews as pledges and shut them up in the citadel and in that manner guarded it About the same time one came to Jonathan and to his brother Simon and told them that the sons of Ambri were celebrating a mar riage and bringing the bride who was the daughter of one of the illustrious men among the Arabians from the city Gabatha and that the damsel was to be conducted with pomp and splendour and much riches So Jonathan and Simon thinking this appeared to be the fittest time for them to avenge the death of their brother and that they had forces sufficient for receiving satisfaction from them for his death they made haste to Me daba and lay in wait among the mountains for the coming of their enemies And as soon as they saw them conducting the virgin and her bridegroom and such a great com pany of their friends with them as was to be expected at this wedding they sallied out of their ambush and slew them all and took their ornaments and all the prey that then followed them and so returned and received this satisfaction for their brother John from the sons of Ambri For as well those sons themselves as their friends and wives and children that followed them perished being in number about four hundred Simon and Jonathan then returned to the lakes of the river and abode there But Bacchides when he had secured all Judea with his garrisons returned to the king And then it was that the affairs of Judea were quiet for two year9 t But when the desert ers and the wicked saw that Jonathan and those that were with him lived in the country very quietly by reason of the peace they sent to king Demetrius and excited him to send Bacchides to seize upon Jonathan which they said was to be done without any trouble and in one night s time and that if they fell upon them before they were aware they might slay them all So the king sent Bacchides who when he was come into Ju  One thousand 1 Mace ix 43 t An 159 and 158 B C X AN 153 457 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS dea wrote to all his friends both Jews and auxiliaries that they should seize upon Jona than and bring him to him But when upon all their endeavours they were not able to seize upon Jonathan for he was sensible of the snares they laid for him and very care fully guarded against them Bacchides was angry at these deserters as having imposed upon him and upon the king and slew fifty of their leaders Thereupon Jonathan with his brother and those that were with him retired to Bethagla a village that lay in the wilderness out of his fear of Bacchides He also built towers in it and encompassed it with walls and took care that it should be safely guarded Upon the hearing of which Bacchides led his own army along with him and besides took his Jewish auxiliaries and came against Jonathan and made an assault upon his fortifications and besieged him many days But Jonathan did not abate of his courage at the zeal Bacchides shewed in the siege but courageously opposed him And while he left his brother Simon in the city to fight with Bacchides he went pri vately out into the country and got a great body of men together of his own party and fell upon Bacchides s camp in the night time and destroyed a great many of them His brother Simon knew also of his falling upon them because he perceived that the ene mies were slain by him so he sallied out upon them and burnt the engines which the Macedonians used and made a great slaugh ter of them And when Bacchides saw him self encompassed with enemies he fell into despair as confounded at the unexpected ill success of this siege However he vented his displeasure at these misfortunes upon those deserters who sent for him from the king as having deluded him So he had a mind to finish this siege after a decent man ner if it were possible for him so to do and then to return home  1 Macc ix 72 t This Alexander Bala who certainly pretended to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes and was owned as such by the Jews and Romans and many others and yet is by several historians deemed to be an impostor is however by Josephus believed to have been the real son of that Antiochus and by him always spoken of accordingly And truly since the original contemporary and authentic author of the first book of Maccabees x 1 calls him by his father s name Epiphanes and says he was the son of When Jonathan understood his intentions he sent ambassadors to him about a league of friendship and mutual assistance and that they might restore those whom they had taken captive on both sides So Bacchides thought this a decent way of retiring home and made a league of friendship with Jona than by which it was mutually agreed that they would not any more make war one against another Accordingly he restored the captives and took his own men with him and returned to the king to Antioch And after this departure he never came into Judea again Then did Jonathan take the oppor tunity of this quiet state of things and went and lived in the city Michmash and there governed the multitude and punished the wicked and by that means purged the na tion of them CHAP II OF THE ADVANTAGES GRANTED TO JONATHAN FIRST BY DEMETRIUS AND AFTERWARDS BY ALEXANDER BALA IN ORDER TO OBTAIN HIS ASSISTANCE AND OF THE DEATH OF DEMETRIUS NOW in the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander the tson of Antiochus Epi phanes came up into Syria and took Ptole mais 4 the soldiers within having betrayed it to him For they were at enmity with De metrius on account of his insolence and dif ficulty of access For he shut himself up in a palace that had four towers which he had built himself not far from Antioch and ad mitted nobody He was also slothful and negligent about the public affairs which rendered him odious to his subjects When therefore Demetrius heard that Alexander was in Ptolemais he took his whole army and led it against him he also sent ambas sadors to Jonathan about a league of mutual assistance and friendship For he resolved to be beforehand with Alexander lest the Antiochus I suppose the other writers who are all much later are not to be followed against such evidence though perhaps Epiphanes might have him by a woman of no fami ly  The king of Egypt also Philometor soon gave him his daughter in marriage which he would hardly have done had he believed him to be a counterfeit and of so mean a birth as the historians pretend He is also called Biovarup one of a divine lineage in the coins as Spanheim assures us Nor does any original evidence appear against it  1 Macc x 1 458 book xm ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS other should treat with him first and gain assistance from him And this he did out of the fear he had lest Jonathan should remem ber how ill Demetrius had formerly treated him and should join with him in this war against him He therefore gave orders that Jonathan should be allowed to raise an army and should get armour made and should re ceive back those hostages of the Jewish na tion whom Bacchides had shut up in the citadel of Jerusalem When this good for tune had befallen Jonathan by the concession of Demetrius he came to Jerusalem and read the king s letter in the audience of the people and of those that kept the citadel those wicked men and deserters who were in the citadel were therefore greatly afraid upon the king s permission to Jonathan to raise an army and to receive back the hos tages So he delivered every one of them to their own parents And thus did Jonathan make his abode at Jerusalem renewing the city to a better state and reforming the buildings as he pleased For he gave orders that the walls of the city should be rebuilt with square stones that it might be more secure from their enemies And when those that kept the garrisons that were in Judea saw this they all left them and fled to An tioch excepting those that were in the city Bethsura and those that were in the citadel of Jerusalem For the greater part of these consisted of the wicked Jews and deserters and on that account these did not deliver up their garrisons When Alexander knew what promises De metrius had made Jonathan and withal knew his courage and what great things he had  1 Mace x 15 t Since Jonathan did not put on the pontifical robes till seven or eight years after the death of his brother Judas or not till the feast of tabernacles in the 160th of the SeleucidsB 1 Mace x 21 Petitus s emendation seems here to deserve consideration who instead of After four years since the death of his brother Judas would have us read And therefore after eight years since the death of his brother Judas This would tole rably well agree with the date in the Maccabees and with Josephus s own exact chronology at the end of the XXth book of these Antiquities which the present text cannot be made to do J From the time of the return from the Babylonish captivity the office of high priest had been in the family of Josodek and in a lineal descent was transmitted down to Onias the third of that name He was sup done when he fought the Macedonians and besides what hardships he had undergone by the means of Demetrius and of Bacchides the general of Demetrius s army he told his friends that he could not at present find any one that might afford him better assistance than Jonathan who was both courageous against his enemies and had a particular ha tred against Demetrius as having both suf fered many hard things from him and acted many hard things against him If therefore they were of opinion that they should make him their friend against Demetrius it was more for their advantage to invite him to as sist them now than at another time It being therefore determined by him and his friends to send to Jonathan he wrote to him this epistle â King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting We have long ago heard of thy courage and fidelity and for that rea son have sent to thee to make with thee a league of friendship and of mutual assist ance I therefore do ordain thee this day the high priest of the Jews and appoint that thou shall be called my friend I have also sent thee as presents a purple robe and a golden crown and desire that now thou art by me honoured thou wilt in like manner respect me also When Jonathan had received this letter he fput on the pontifical robe at the feast of tabernacles four years after the death of his brother Judas For at that time no high priest had been made J So he raised great forces and had abundance of armour got ready This greatly grieved Demetrius when he heard of it and made him blame planted by Jason his brother as Jason was by his brother Menelaus and after the death of Menelaus Alcimus who was of a different family was put into the office by the command of the king of Syria Whether the Asmoneans were of the race of Josedek or not it is no where said but it is certain that they were of the course of Joarib 1 Mace ii 1 which was the first class of the sons of Aaron and therefore upon the failure of the former pontifical family they had the best right to succeed With this right it was that Jonathan took the office and in his family it became settled and continued for several descents until the time of Herod who from an office of inheritance changed it into that of arbitrary will and plea sure Whoever had the power after him put the high priests in or out as they thought fit till at length the office was extinguished by the destruction of the temple by the Romans Prideaux s Connection an 253 B i AN 459 150 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS himself for his slowness that he had not pre vented Alexander and got the good will of Jonathan but had given him time so to do However he also wrote a letter to Jonathan and to the people the contents whereof are these â King Demetrius to Jonathan and to the nation of the Jews sendeth greeting Since you have preserved your friendship for us and when you have been tempted by our ene mies you have not joined yourselves to them I both commend you for your fidelity and ex hort you to continue in the same disposition for which you shall receive rewards from us For I will free you from the greatest part of the tributes and taxes which you formerly paid to the kings my predecessors and to myself And I do now set you free from those tributes which you have ever paid and be sides I forgive you the tax upon salt and the value upon crowns which you used to offer to me And instead of the third part of the fruits of the field and the half of the fruits of the trees I relinquish my part of them from this day And as to the poll money which ought to be given me for every head of the inhabitants of Judea and of the three topar chies that adjoin to Judea Samaria Galilee and Perea that I relinquish to you for all time to come I will also that the city of Jerusalem be holy and inviolable and free from tithes and taxes unto its utmost bounds And I so far recede from my title to the citadel as to permit Jonathan your high priest to possess it that he may place such a garrison in it as he approves of for fidelity and good will to himself that they may keep it for us I also make free all those Jews that have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom and give order that the beasts of the Jews be not pressed for our service And let their sabbaths and all their festivals and three days before each of them be free from any imposition In the same manner I set free the Jews that are inhabitants in my kingdom and order that no injury be done them I also give leave to such of them as are willing to enlist themselves in my army that they may do it and those as far as thirty thousand which Jewish soldiers whereso ever they go shall have the same pay that my own army hath And some of them I will place in my garrisons and some as guards about mine own body and as rulers over those that are in my court I give them also permission to use the laws of their forefa thers and I will that they have power over the three toparchies that are added to Judea and it shall be in the power of the high priest to take care that no one Jew shall have any other temple for worship but only that at Jerusalem I bequeath also out of my own revenues yearly for the expenses about the sacrifices one hundred and fifty thousand drachmae and what money is to spare shall be your own I also release to you those ten thousand drachmae which the kings received from the temple because they appertain to the priests that minister in that temple And whosoever shall flee to the temple at Jerusa lem or to the places thereto belonging or who owe the king money or are there on any other account let them be set free and let their goods be in safety I give you leave to repair and rebuild your temple and that all be done at my expense I also allow you to build the walls of your city and to erect high towers and that they be erected at my charge And if there be any fortified town that would be convenient for the Jewish country to have very strong let it be so built at my expense This was what Demetrius promised and granted to the Jews by this letter But king Alexander raised a great army of mercenary soldiers and of those that deserted to him out of Syria and made an expedition against Demetrius And when they came to a bat tle the left wing of Demetrius

that upon his horse s falling down he could not escape being killed For when his enemies saw what had befallen him they returned back en compassed him round and all threw their darts at him He being now on foot fought bravely but at length received so many wounds that he was not able to bear up any longer but fell And this is the end that Demetrius came to when he had reigned feleven years CHAP III OF THE FRIENDSHIP THAT SUBSISTED BETWEEN ONIAS AND PTOLEMY PHILOMETOR J AND OF THE TEMPLE WHICH ONIAS BUILT IN EGYPT LIKE TO THAT AT JERUSALEM rilHE son of Qnias the high priest who I was of the same name with his father and who fled to Ptolemy Philometor lived now at Alexandria as we have Jsaid al ready When this Onias saw that Judea was oppressed by the Macedonians and their kings out of desire to purchase to himself a memorial and eternal fame he resolved to send to king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to ask leave of them that he might build a temple in Egypt like to that at Jerusalem and might ordain Levites and priests out of their own stock The chief reason why he was desirous so to do was that he relied upon the prophet Isaiah who lived about six hundred years before and foretold that there certainly was to be a temple built to Almighty God in Egypt by a man that was a Jew Accordingly Onias was elevated with this prediction and wrote the following epistle to Ptolemy and Cleopatra â Having done many and great things for you in the affairs of the war by the assistance of God and that in Coelesyria and Phoenicia I came at length with the Jews to Leontopo lis and to other places of your nation Where I found that the greatest part of your people had temples in an improper manner and that on this account they bare ill will one against another which happens to the Egyptians by reason of the multitude of the temples and the difference of opinions about divine worship Now I found a very fit place in a castle that hath its name from the country Diana this place is full of materials of seve ral sorts and replenished with sacred ani mals I desire therefore that you will grant me leave to purge this holy place which be longs to no master and is fallen down and to build there a temple to Almighty God after the pattern of that in Jerusalem and of the same dimensions that may be for the benefit of thyself and thy wife and children that those Jews which dwell in Egypt may have a place whither they may come and meet together in mutual harmony one with another and be subservient to thy advan tages For the prophet Isaiah foretold that jjthere should be an altar in Egypt to the Lord God Â And many such things did he prophesy relating to that place  1 Mace x 50 t Since the rest of the historians now extant give this Demetrius 13 years and Josephus only 11 years Dean Prideaux does not amiss in ascribing to him the mean number 12 t Book XII chap 9 II Isaiah xix 19 Â It seems to me contrary to the opinion of Josephus and of the moderns both Jews and Christians that this prophecy of Isaiah xix 10 c In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt c directly foretold the building of the temple of Onias in Egypt and was a sufficient warrant to the Jews for building it and for worshipping the God of Israel therein See Authentic Records part II page 755 God indeed seems to have better accepted of the sacrifices and prayers here offered him than of those at Jerusalem And truly the marks of Jewish corruption or interpolation in this ext in order to discourage their people from approving of the worship of God here are very strong and highly deserve our consideration and correction The fore going verse in Isaiah runs thus in our common copies In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan the Hebrew language shall be full of Jews whose sacred books were in Hebrew and swear to the Lord of Hosts One or the first shall be called the city of Destruction Isa xx 18 A strange name City of Destruction upon so joyful an occasion and a name never heard of in the land of Egypt or per haps any other nation The old reading was evidently the City of the Sun or Heliopolis and Onkelos in effect and Symmachus with the Arabic version entirely con fess that to be the true reading The Septuagint also though they have the text disguised in the common copies and call it Asedek the City of Righteousness yet in two or three other copies the Hpbrew word itself for the sun Achares or Thares is preserved And since Onias insists with the king and queen that Isaiah s pro AN 461 149 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS And this was what Onias wrote to king Ptolemy whose piety and that of his sister and wife Cleopatra will appear by that epis tle which they wrote in answer to it For they laid the blame and the transgression of the Jaw upon the head of Onias And this was their reply King Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to Onias send greeting We have read thy petition wherein thou desirest per mission to purge that temple which is fallen down at Leontopolis in the Nomus of Helio polis and which is named from the country Bubastis On which account we cannot but wonder that it should be pleasing to God to have a temple erected in a place so unclean and so full of sacred animals But since thou sayest that Isaiah the prophet foretold this long ago we give thee leave to do it if it may be done according to your law and so that we may not appear to have at all offended God herein Accordingly Onias took the place and built a temple and an altar to God like in deed to that in Jerusalem but smaller and poorer 1 do not think it proper for me now to describe its dimensions or its vessels which have been already described in my seventh book of The Wars of the Jews However Onias found other Jews also like to himself together with priests and Levites that there performed divine service Now it came to pass that the Alexandrian Jews and those Samaritans who payed their worship to the temple that was built in the days of Alexander at mount Gerizzim did now make a sedition one against another and disputed about their temples before Ptolemy himself the Jews saying that according to the laws of Moses the temple was to be built at Jerusalem and the Samaritans saying that it was to be built at Gerizzim They desired therefore that the king would sit with his friends and hear the debates about these matters and punish those with death who were baffled Now Sabbeus and Theodosius managed the argument of the Samaritans and Andronicus the son of Messalamus for the people of Jerusalem And they took an oath by God and the king to make their demonstrations according to the law And they desired of Ptolemy that whosoever he should find that transgressed what they had sworn to he would put him to death Ac cordingly the king took several of his friends into the council and sat down in order to hear what the pleaders said Now the Jews that were at Alexandria were in great con cern for those men whose lot it was to con tend for the temple at Jerusalem For they took it very ill that any should pretend to take away the reputation of that temple which was so ancient and so celebrated all over the habitable earth Now when Sabbeus and Theodosius had given leave to Andronicus to speak first he began to demon strate out of the law and out of the succes sions of the high priests how they every one in succession from his father had received j that dignity and ruled over the temple and how all the kings of Asia had honoured that temple with their donations and with the most splendid gifts But as for that at Ge rizzim he made no account of it nor re garded it as if it had ever had a being By this speech and other arguments Andronicus persuaded the king to determine that the phecy contained many other predictions relating to this place besides the words by him recited it is highly pro bable that these were especially meant by him and that one main reason why he applied this prediction to him self and to his prefecture of Heliopolis which Dean Prideaux well proves was in that part of Egypt and why he chose to build in that prefecture of Heliopolis though otherwise an improper place was that he had the same authority for building this temple in his own prefecture of Heliopolis as in Egypt Dean Prideaux has much difficulty to avoid seeing this corruption of the Hebrew But it being in support of his own opinion about this temple he durst not see it and indeed he reasons here in the most injudicious manner See him at the year 149  See War of the Jews Book VII chap 10 t A very unfair disputation this while the Jewish disputant knowing that he could not properly prove out of the Pentateuch that the place which the Lord their God should choose to place his name there so often re ferred to in the book of Deuteronomy was Jerusalem any more than Gerizzim that being not determined till the days of David see VII 13 proves only what the Samaritans did not deny that the temple at Jerusalem was much more ancient and much more celebrated and honoured than that at Gerizzim which was nothing to the present purpose The whole evidence by the very oaths of both parties being obliged to be confined to the law of Moses or to the Pentateuch alone However worldly policy and interest and the multitude prevailing the court gave sentence as usual on the stronger side and Sabbeus and Theodosius the Samaritan disputants were martyred and this so far as appears without any direct hearing at all Which is like the usual practice of such political courts about matters of religion Our copies say that the body of the Jews were in great concern 4 E 2 462 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS temple at Jerusalem was built according to the laws of Moses and to put Sabbeus and Theodosius to death And these were the events that befell the Jews at Alexandria in the days of Ptolemy Philometor CHAP IV OF THE HONOURS CONFERRED UPON JONATHAN BY ALEXAN DER KING OF SYRIA AND OF THE AFFAIRS OF DEME TRIUS WHO AFTERWARD MADE A LEAQUE OF FRIENDSHIP WITH JONATHAN DEMETRIUS being slain in battle as we have already related Alexander took the kingdom of Syria and wrote to Ptolemy Philometor desiring his daughter in marriage for he said it was but just that he should be joined in affinity to one who had now received the principality of his forefathers and had been promoted to it by God s providence and had conquered De metrius and who was on other accounts not unworthy of being related to him Ptolemy received this proposal gladly and wrote him an answer saluting him on account of his having received the kingdom of his fore fathers and promising that he would give him his daughter in marriage and would ac company her as far as Ptolemais where he desired that he would meet him When Ptolemy had written thus he came suddenly to Ptolemais and brought his daughter Cleo patra along with him And as he found Alex ander there before him according as he had desired he gave him his child in marriage and for her portion gave her as much silver and gold as became such a king to give When the wedding was over Alexander wrote to Jonathan the high priest and de sired him to come to Ptolemais So when he came to these kings and had made them magnificent presents he was honoured by them both Alexander compelled him also to put off his own garments and to take a purple garment and made him sit with him in his throne commanding his captains that they should go with him into the middle of the city and proclaim that it was not per mitted to any one to speak against him or to give him any disturbance And when the captains had thus done those that were prepared to accuse Jonathan and who bare him ill will when they saw the honour that was done him by proclamation and that by the king s order ran away and were afraid lest some mischief should befall them Nay king Alexander was so very kind to Jona than that he set him down as the principal of his friends But upon the hundred and sixty fifth year Demetrius the son of Demetrius came from Crete with a great number of mercenary sol diers which Lasthenes the Cretan brought him and sailed to Cilicia This cast Alex ander into great concern and disorder when he heard it So he hastened immediately out of Phoenicia and came to Antioch that he might put matters in a safe posture there before Demetrius should come He also left fApollonius Daus governor of Coelesyria J about those men in the plural who were to dispute for their temple at Jerusalem whereas it seems here they had but one disputant Andronicus by name Perhaps more were prepared to speak on the Jews side but the first having answered to his name and overcome the Sa maritans there was no necessity for any other defender of the Jerusalem temple  Chap II t This Apollonius Daus was by his account the son of Apollonius who had been made governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia by Seleucus Philopator and was himself a confidant of his son Demetrius the father and restored to his father s government by him but afterwards revolted from him to Alexander but not to Demetrius the son J Apollonius was a common name among the Syro Macedonians and Greeks and in the history of the Mac cabees we find so many mentioned of that name that for the prevention of mistakes it may not be improper to give some account of the several persons who bore it The first that we meet with of that name is Apollonius the son of Thraseas 2 Mace iii 5 who was governor â f Co lesyriÂ and Phoenicia under Seleucus Philopator when Heliodorus came to Jerusalem to rob the temple He was chief minister of state to Seleucus but on the accession of his brother Antiochus Epiphanes to the crown he left Syria and retired to Miletus He had i son of his own name that was bred up at Rome and re sided with Demetrius the son of Seleucus Philopator who was then a hostage in that place When Demetrius recovered the crown of Syria this Apollonius became his prime favourite and was made governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia the same government which his father held un der Seleucus Philopator and this I take to be the same Apollonius who being continued in the same government by Alexander now revolted from him to embrace the in terest of Demetrius the son of his old master and to en gage Jonathan to do the like marched his forces against him Another Apollonius is spoken of 2 Mace iv 21 as the chief minister of Antiochus Epiphanes who from him was sent as ambassador first to Rome and afterwards to Ptolemy Philometor king of Egypt and him I take to be the same that with a detachment of two and twenty thou sand men was sent to destroy Jerusalem and build a for tress on mount Acra There are besides these two other AN 148 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS who coming to Jamnia with a great army sent to Jonathan the high priest and told him that it was not right that he alone should live at rest and with authority and not be subject to the king that this thing had made him a reproach among all men that he had not yet made him subject to the king Do not thou therefore deceive thyself said he and sit still among the mountains and pre tend to have forces with thee But if thou hast any dependance on thy strength come down into the plain and let our armies be compared together and the event of the bat tle will demonstrate which of us is the most courageous However take notice that the most valiant men of every city are in my army And that these are the very men who have always defeated thy progenitors But let us have the battle in such a place of the country where we fight with weapons and not with stones and where there may be no place whither those that are beaten may flee With this Jonathan was irritated and choosing out ten thousand of his soldiers he went out of Jerusalem in haste with his bro ther Simon and came to Joppa and pitched his camp on the outside of the city because the people of Joppa had shut their gates against him For they had a garrison in the city put there by Apollonius But when Jo nathan was preparing to besiege them they were afraid he would take them by force and therefore they opened the gates to him Apollonius hearing that Joppa was taken by Jonathan took three thousand horsemen and eight thousand footmen and came to Ashdod and removing thence he made his journey silently and slowly and going up to Joppa he made as if he were retiring from the place and so drew Jonathan into the plain as valuing himself highly upon his horsemen and having his hopes of victory principally in them However Jonathan sallied out and pursued Apollonius to Ashdod But as soon as Apollonius perceived that his enemy was in the plain he came back and gave him battle Now Apollonius had laid a thousand horsemen in ambush in a valley that they might be seen by their enemies as behind them Jonathan however was under nÂ consternation on perceiving them but or dering his army to stand in a square battle array he gave them a charge to fall on the enemy on both sides and set them to face those that attacked them both before and behind And while the fight lasted till the evening he gave part of his forces to his brother Simon and ordered him to attack the enemies but for himself he charged those that were with him to cover themselves with their armour and receive the darts of the horsemen Accordingly the enemies horse men while they threw their darts till they had no more left did them no harm for the darts that were thrown did not enter into their bodies being thrown upon the shields that were united and conjoined together the closeness of which easily overcame the force of the darts and they flew about without any effect But when the enemy grew remiss in throwing their darts from morning till late at night Simon perceived their weariness and fell upon the body of men before him And because his soldiers shewed great alac rity he put the enemy to flight And when the horsemen saw that the foot ran away neither did they stay themselves but they being weary by the duration of the fight till evening and their hope from the infantry being quite gone they basely ran away and that in great confusion also till they were separated one from another and scattered over all the plain Hereupon Jonathan pur sued them as far as Ashdod and slew a great many of them and compelled the rest in despair of escaping to flee to the temple of Dagon which was at Ashdod But Jonathan took the city on the first onset and burnt it and the villages about it nor did he abstain from the temple of Dagon itself but burnt it also and destroyed those that had fled to it Now the entire multitude of the enemies that fell in the battle and were consumed in the temple were eight thousand When Jona than therefore had overcome so great an persons in the history of the Maccabees mentioned under the name of Apollonius The former of these being governor of Samaria in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes 1 Mace iii 10 was slain in battle by Judas Maccabeus and the latter who is called the son of Gennens 2 Mace xii 2 being governor of some toparchy in Palestine under Antiochus Eupator did then signalize himself by being a great enemy to the Jews Prideaux i Connection anno 148 B 464 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS army he removed from Ashdod and came to Ascalon And when he had pitched his camp without the city the people of Ascalon came out and met him bringing him hos pitable presents and honouring him so he accepted of their kind intentions and re turned thence to Jerusalem with a great deal of prey which he brought thence when he conquered his enemies But when Alexan der heard that Apollonius the general of his army was beaten he pretended to be glad of it because he had fought with Jona than his friend and ally against his direc tions Accordingly he sent to Jonathan and gave testimony to his worth and gave him honorary rewards as a goIden button which it is the custom to give the king s kinsmen and allowed him Ekron and its toparchy for his own inheritance About this time king Ptolemy who was called Philometor led an army partly by the sea and partly by land and came to Syria to the assistance of his son in law Alexander And accordingly all the cities received him willingly as Alexander had commanded them to do and conducted him as far as Ashdod where they all made loud com plaints about the temple of Dagon which was burnt and accused Jonathan of having laid it waste and destroyed the country ad joining with fire and slain a great number of them Ptolemy heard these accusations but said nothing Jonathan also went to meet Ptolemy as far as Joppa and obtained from him hospitable presents and those glorious in their kinds with all the marks of honour And when he had conducted him as far as the river called Eleutherus he returned again to Jerusalem f But as Ptolemy was at Ptolemais he was very near to a most unexpected destruction For a treacherous design was laid for his life by Alexander by the means of Ammonius who was his friend And as the treachery was very plain Ptolemy wrote to Alexander and required of him that he should bring Ammonius to condign punishment informing him what snares had been laid for him by Ammonius and desiring that he might be punished accordingly But when Alexander did not comply with his demands lie per ceived that it was he himself who laid the design and he was very angry at him J Al exander had also formerly been on very ill terms with the people of Antioch for they had suffered very much by his means Yet did Ammonius at length undergo the punish ment his insolent crimes had deserved For he was killed in an opprobrious manner like a woman while he endeavoured to conceal himself in a feminine habit Hereupon Ptolemy blamed himself for having given his daughter in marriage to Alexander and for the league he had made with him to assist him against Demetrius So he dissolved his relationship by taking his daughter away from him and immedi ately sent to Demetrius and offered to make a league of mutual assistance and friendship with him and agreed with him to give him his daughter in marriage and to restore him to the principality of his fathers Demetrius was well pleased with this ambassage and accepted of his assistance and of the mar riage of his daughter But Ptolemy had still one more hard task to do and that was to persuade the people of Antioch to receive Demetrius because they were greatly dis pleased at him on account of the injuries his father Demetrius had done them Yet did he bring this about For as the people of Antioch hated Alexander on Ammonius s account as we have shewn already they were easily prevailed with to cast him out of Antioch He accordingly retired to Cilicia while Ptolemy came to Antioch and was made king by its inhabitants and by the army So that he was forced to put on two diadems the one of Asia the other of Egypt But being naturally a good and a righteous man and not desirous of what belonged to others and besides these dispositions being also a wise man in reasoning about futurities he determined to avoid the envy of the Ro  Dr Hudson observes here that the Phoenicians and Romans used to reward such as had deserved well of them by presenting to them a golden button This golden button or buckle which was worn upon the shoulder was a very singular mark of distinction both among the Greeks and the Persians from whom the Macedonians took it and was generally made the re ward of great and gallant actions in war Calmet t Com mentary on 1 Mace x 89 B t 1 Mace xi 7  This is related very differently in our copies of the first book of Maccabees AN 465 145 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS mans So he called the people of Antioch together and persuaded them to receive Demetrius and assured them that he would not be mindful of what they did to his father in case he should now be obliged by them and lie undertook that he would himself be a good monitor and governor to him and pro mised that he would not permit him to at tempt any bad actions But that for his own part he was contented with the kingdom of Egypt By which discourse he persuaded the people of Antioch to receive Demetrius In the mean time Alexander assembled a numerous army and came out of Cilicia into Syria and burnt the country belonging to Antioch and pillaged it Whereupon Pto lemy and his son in law Demetrius brought their army against him for he had already given him his daughter in marriage and beat Alexander and put him to flight And accordingly he fled into Arabia Now it hap pened in the time of battle that Ptolemy s horse upon hearing the noise of an elephant cast him off his back and threw him on the ground Upon the sight of this accident his enemies fell upon him and gave him many wounds upon his head and brought him into danger of death for when his guards caught him up he was so very ill that for four days time he was not able either to understand or to speak However Zabdiel a prince among the Arabians cut off Alexander s head and sent it to Ptolemy Who recovering of his wounds and returning to his understanding on the fifth day heard at once a most agree able hearing and saw a most agreeable sight which were the death and the head of Alex ander Yet a little after this joy for the death of Alexander with which he was so greatly satisfied he also departed this life Now Alexander who was called Balas reigned over Asia five years But when Demetrius who was styled fNi cator had taken the kingdom he was so wicked as to treat Ptolemy s soldiers very hardly neither remembering the league of mutual assistance that was between them nor that he was his son in law and kinsman by Cleopatra s marriage to him So the soldiers fled from his wicked treatment to Alexandria But Demetrius kept his elephants In the mean time Jonathan the high priest levied an army out of all Judea and attacked the citadel at Jerusalem and besieged it It was held by a garrison of Macedonians and by some of those wicked men who had deserted the customs of their forefathers These men at first despised the attempts of Jonathan for taking the place as depending on its strength But some of those wicked men went out by night and came to Demetrius and informed him that the citadel was besieged He was accordingly irritated with what he heard and took his army and came from Antioch against Jonathan And when he was at Antioch he wrote to him and commanded him to come to him quickly to Ptolemais Jonathan did not intermit the siege of the citadel but took with him the elders of the people and the priests and carried with him gold and silver and garments and a great number of pre sents of friendship and came to Demetrius and presented him with them and thereby pacified the king s anger So he was ho noured hy him and received from him the confirmation of his high priesthood as he had possessed it by the grants of the kings his predecessors And when the Jewish de serters accused him Demetrius was so far from giving credit to them that when he pe titioned him that he would demand no more than three hundred talents for the tribute of all Judea and the three toparchies of Sa maria Perea and Galilee he complied with the proposal and gave him a letter confirm ing all those grants whose contents were as follow â King DemetriusJ to Jonathan his hro  An 145 B C t This name Demetrius Nicator or Demetrius the Conqueror is so written on his coins still extant as Hudson and Spanheim informs us The latter of whom gives us here the entire inscription  King Demetrius the god Philadelphns Nicator J Dr Hudson observes that Josephus gives us this epistle of king Demetrius to Jonathan in purer Greek than does the translator of the first book of Maccabees where also it is preserved 1 Mace xi 30â 37 whence he gathers how careful Josephus was of elegance in the Greek tongue Nor is this other than Josephus s usual custom in producing his other ancient records which he loves to give us as much as possible in his own language However as I take it the most material reason of the different purity of these two versions of the present epistle is this that Josephus wrote the purer Attic and the translator of the first book of Maccabees the coarser Hellenistic dialect which would naturally produce this inequality 466 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ther and to the nation of the Jews sendeth greeting We have sent you a copy of that epistle which we have written to Lasthenes our kinsman that you may know its contents King Demetrius to Lasthenes our father sendeth greeting I have determined to re turn thanks and to shew favour to the nation of the Jews which hath observed the rules of justice in our concerns Accordingly I remit to them the three prefectures Aphe rime Lydda and Ramatha which have been added to Judea out of Samaria with their appurtenances As also what the kings my predecessors received from those that offered sacrifices in Jerusalem and what are due from the fruits of the earth and of the trees and what else belongs to us with the salt pits and the crowns that used to be presented to us Nor shall they be compelled to pay any of these taxes from this time to all fu turity Take care therefore that a copy of this epistle be taken and given to Jonathan and be set up in an eminent place of their holy temple Now when Demetrius saw that there was peace every where and that there was no danger nor fear of war he disbanded the greatest part of his army and diminished their pay and even retained in pay no others than such foreigners as came up with him from Crete and from the other islands How ever this procured him ill will and hatred from the soldiers on whom he bestowed nothing from this time while the kings be fore him used to pay them in times of peace as they did before that they might have their good will and that they might be ready to undergo the difficulties of war if occasion should require it CHAP V OF THE REVOLT OF TRYPHO WHO AFTER HE HAD DE FEATED DEMETRIUS DELIVERED THE KINGDOM TO ANTI OCHUS THE SON OF ALEXANDER AND GAINED JONATHAN FOR HIS ASSISTANT AND CONCERNING THE ACTIONS AND EMBASSIES OF JONATHAN NOW there was a certain commander of Alexander s forces of Apamia by birth his name was Diodotus but he was also called Trypho This man took notice of the ill will the soldiers bare to Demetrius and went to Malchus the Arabian who brought up Antiochus the son of Alexander and told him what ill will the armies bare Demetrius and persuaded him to give him Antiochus because he would make him king and re cover to him the kingdom of his father Mal chus at first opposed him in this attempt be cause he could not believe him but Trypho over persuaded him to comply with his in tentions and intreaties But Jonathan the high priest being de sirous to get clear of those that were in the citadel of Jerusalem and of the Jewish de serters and wicked men as well as of those in all the garrisons in the country sent pre sents and ambassadors to Demetrius and intreated him to take away his soldiers out of the strong holds of Judea Demetrius made answer that after the war which he was now deeply engaged in he would not only grant him that but greater things also And he desired he would send him some assistance and informed him that his army had deserted him So Jonathan chose out three thousand of his soldiers and sent them to Demetrius Now the people of Antioch hated Deme trius both on account of what mischief he had himself done them and because they were his enemies also on account of his father Demetrius who had greatly abused them So they watched some opportunity which they might lay hold on to fall upon him And when they were informed of the assist ance that was coming to Demetrius from Jonathan and considered at the same time that he would raise a numerous army unless they prevented him and seized upon him they took their weapons immediately and encompassed his palace in the way of a siege and seizing upon all the ways of get ting out they sought to subdue their king And when he saw that the people of Antioch were become his bitter enemies and that they were thus in arms he took the merce nary soldiers which he had with him and those Jews who were sent by Jonathan and assaulted the Antiochians But he was over powered by their numbers and was beaten But when the Jews saw that the Antiochians were superior they went up to the top of the palace and shot at them from thence And because they were so remote from them by their height that they suffered nothing on their side but did great execution on the AN 145 467 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS others as fighting from such an elevation they drove them out of the adjoining houses and immediately set them on fire Where upon the flame spread itself over the whole city and burnt it all down This happened by reason of the closeness of the houses and because they were generally built of wood So the Antiochians when tliey were not able to help themselves nor to stop the fire were put to flight And as the Jews leaped from the top of one house to the top of another and pursued them after that manner it thence happened that the pursuit was very surprising But when the king saw that the Antiochians were busied in saving their chil dren and their wives and so did not fight any longer he fell upon them in the narrow pas sages and fought them and slew a great many of them till at last they were forced to throw down their arms and to deliver them selves up to Demetrius so he forgave their insolent behaviour and put an end to the sedition And when he had given rewards to the Jews of the rich spoils he had gotten and had returned them thanks as the cause of his victory he sent them away to Jeru salem to Jonathan with an ample testimony of the assistance they had afforded him Yet did he prove an ill man to Jonathan after ward and brake the promises he had made and he threatened he would make war upon him unless he would pay all that tribute which the Jewish nation owed to the first kings of Syria And this he had done if Trypho had not hindered him and diverted his preparations against Jonathan to a con cern for his own preservation For he now returned out of Arabia into Syria with the child Antiochus for he was yet in age but a youth and put the diadem on his head And as the whole forces that had left Demetrius because they had no pay came to his assist ance he made war upon Demetrius and joining battle with him overcame him in the fight and took from him both his elephants and the city Antioch Upon this defeat Demetrius retired into Cilicia but the child Antiochus sent ambas sadors and an epistle to Jonathan to make him his friend and confederate and con firmed to him the high priesthood and yielded up to him the four prefectures which had been added to Judea Moreover he sent him vessels and cups of gold and a purple gar ment and gave him leave to use them He also presented him with a golden button and styled him one of his principal friends and appointed his brother Simon to be the general over the forces from the ladder of Tyre into Egypt So Jonathan was so pleased with these grants made him by An tiochus that he sent ambassadors to him and to Trypho and professed himself their friend and confederate and he said he would join with them in a war against Demetrius for that he had made no proper returns for the kindnesses he had done him but on the con trary he for such good turns had requited him with injuries So Antiochus gave Jonathan leave to raise a numerous army out of Syria and Phoenicia and to make war against Demetrius s gene rals Whereupon he went in haste to the several cities which received him splendidly indeed but put no forces into his hands And when he was come from thence to Ascalon the inhabitants of Ascalon came and brought him presents and met him in a splendid man ner He exhorted them and every one of the cities of Coclesyria to forsake Demetrius and to join with Antiochus to endeavour to punish Demetrius for what offences he had been guilty of against themselves and told them there were many reasons for that pro cedure if they had a mind so to do And when he had persuaded those cities to pro mise their assistance to Antiochus he came to Gaza in order to induce them also to be friends to Antiochus But he found the in habitants of Gaza much more alienated from him than he expected for they had shut their gates against him and although they had deserted Demetrius they had not re solved to join themselves to Antiochus This provoked Jonathan to besiege them and to harass their country For as he set a part of his army round about Gaza itself so with the rest he overran their land and spoiled it and burnt what was in it f When the inhabitants of Gaza saw themselves in this state of afflic tion and that no assistance came to them from Demetrius that what distressed them  1 Mace xi 57â 59 voL I â NOS 39  40 t 1 Mace xi 61 4F 468 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS was at hand but what should profit them was still at a great distance and it was uncer tain whether it would come at all or not they thought it prudent to leave off any longer continuance with him and to cultivate friendship with the other So they sent to Jonathan and professed the would be his friends and afford him assistance For such is the temper of men that before they have had the trial of great afflictions they do not understand what is for their advantage but when they find themselves to be under such afflictions they then change their minds and what it had been better for them to have done before they had been at all damaged they choose to do but not till after they have suffered such damages However he made a league of friendship with them and took from them hostages for their performance of it and sent these hostages to Jerusalem while he went himself over all the country as far as Damascus Now the generals of Demetrius s forces came to the city Cadesh between the land of the Tyrians and Galilee For they sup posed they should hereby draw Jonathan out of Syria in order to preserve Galilee and that he would not overlook the Galileans who were his own people when war was made upon them But Jonathan went to meet them having left Simon in Judea who raised as great an army as he was able out of the country and then sat down before Bethsura and besieged it that being the strongest place in all Judea and a garrison of Deme trius s kept it as we have already related But as Simon was raising banks and bringing his engines of war against Bethsura and was very earnest about the siege of it the gar rison was afraid lest the place should be ta ken of Simon by force and they put to the sword So they sent to Simon and desired the security of his oath that they should come to no harm from him and that then they would leave the place and go away to Demetrius Accordingly he gave them his oath and ejected them out of the city and he put therein a garrison of his own But Jonathan removed out of Galilee and from the waters which are called Gennesar  Chap 2 t 1 Mace xi 73 for there he was before encamped and came into the plain that is called Asor with out knowing that the enemy was there When therefore Demetrius s men knew a day be forehand that Jonathan was coming against them they laid an ambush in the mountain who were to assault him on the sudden while they themselves met him with an army in the plain Which army when Jonathan saw ready to engage him he also got ready his own soldiers for the battle as well as he was able But those that were laid in ambush by Demetrius s generals being behind them the Jews were afraid lest they should be caught in the midst between two bodies and perish So they ran away in haste and indeed all the forces forsook Jonathan excepting about fifty who stayed with him and with them Mattathias the son of Absalom and Judas the son of Chapseus who were commanders of the whole army These marched boldly and like men desperate against the enemy and so pushed them that by their courage they daunted them and with their weapons in their hands they put them to flight And when those soldiers of Jonathan that had retired saw the enemy giving way they got together after their flight and pursued them with great violence And this they did as far as Cadesh where the camp of the ene my lay f Jonathan having thus obtained a glorious victory and slain two thousand of the enemy returned to Jerusalem So when he saw that all his affairs prospered according to his mind by the providence of God he sent am bassadors to the Romans being desirous of renewing that friendship which their nation had with them Jformerly He enjoined the same ambassadors that as they came back they should go to the Spartans and put them in mind of their friendship and kindred So when the ambassadors came to Rome they went into the senate and said what they were commanded by Jonathan the high priest to say how he had sent them to confirm their friendship The senate then confirmed what had been formerly decreed concerning their friendship with the Jews and gave them letters to carry to all the kings of Asia J See Book XII chap 10 AN 469 144 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and Europe and to the governors of the cities that they might safely conduct them to their own country Accordingly as they returned they came to Sparta and delivered the epistle which they had received of Jona than to them A copy of which here follows Jonathan the high priest of the Jewish nation and the senate and body of the peo ple of the Jews to the Ephori and senate and people of the Lacedaemonians send greeting If you be well and both your public and private affairs be agreeable to your mind it is according to our wishes We are well also When in former times an epistle was brought to Onias who was then our high priest from Areus who at that time was your king by Demoteles concerning the kindred that was between us and you a copy of which is here subjoined we both joyfully received the epistle and were well pleased with Demoteles and Areus Although we did not need such a demonstration because fwe were satisfied about it from the sacred writings yet did not we think fit first to be gin the claim of this relation to you lest we should seem too early in taking to ourselves the glory which is now given us by you It is a long time since this relation of ours to you hath been renewed and when we upon holy and festival days offer sacrifices to God we pray to him for your preservation and victory As to ourselves although we have had many wars that have compassed us round by rea son of the covetousness of our neighbours yet did not we determine to be troublesome either to you or to others that were related to us But since we have now overcome our  See Book XII chap 4 t This clause is otherwise rendered in the first book of Maccabees xii 9 For that we have the holy books of Scripture in our hands to comfort us The Hebrew original being lost we cannot certainly judge which was the truest version Only the coherence favours Josephus But if this were the Jews meaning that they were satis fied out of their Bible that the Jews and Lacedaemonians were of kin that part of their Bible is now lost for we find no such assertion in our present copies J Those that suppose Josephus to contradict himself in hil three several accounts of the notions of the Pharisees this here and that earlier one which is the largest Of the War II 8 and that later Antiq XVIII I as if he some times said they introduced an absolute fatality and denied all freedom of human actions is almost wholly groundless He ever as the learned Casaubon here truly observes  asserting that the Pharisees were between the Essenes and enemies and have occasion to send Nume nius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason who are both honourable men belonging to our senate to the Romans we give them this epistle to you also that they might renew that friendship which is between us You will therefore do well to write to us and send an account of what you stand in need of from us since we are in all things disposed to act according to your de sires So the Lacedaemonians received the ambassadors kindly and made a decree for friendship and mutual assistance and sent it to them At this time there were three sects among the Jews who had different opinions concern ing human actions The one was called the sect of the Pharisees another the sect of theSadducees and the other the sect of the Essenes Now the JPharisees say that some actions but not all are the works of fate and some of them are in our own power and that they are liable to fate but are not caused by it But the sect of the Essenes affirm that fate governs all things and that nothing befalls men but what is according to its determination And for theSadducees they say there is no such thing as fate and that the events of human affairs are not at its disposal but they suppose that all our actions are in our own power so that we are ourselves the causes of what is good and receive what is evil from our own folly However I have given a more exact account of these opinions in the second book of the Jewish War Now the generals of Demetrius being will ing to recover the defeat they had sustained Sadducees and did only so far ascribe all to fate or Divine Providence as was consistent with the freedom of human actions However their perplexed way of talking about fate or Providence as overruling all things made it com monly thought they were willing to excuse their sins by ascribing them to fate as in the Apostolical Constitutions VI 6 and Jerom advers Pelag 10 Perhaps under the same general name some difference of opinions in this point might be propagated as is very common in all par ties especially in points of metaphysical subtility How ever our Josephus who in his heart was a great admirer of the piety of the Essenes was in practice a Pharisee as he himself informs us in his own life And his account of this doctrine of the Pharisees is certainly agreeable to his own opinion who ever both fully allowed the free dom of human actions and yet strongly believed the pow erful interposition of Divine Providence See concerning this matter a remarkable clause Antiq XVI 11 4 F2 470 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS gathered a greater army together than they had before and came against Jonathan But as soon as he was informed of their coming he went suddenly to meet them to the coun try of Hamath for he resolved to give them no opportunity of coming into Judea So he fritched his camp at fifty furlongs distance rom the enemy and sent out spies to take a view of their camp and after what manner they were encamped When his spies had given him full information and had seized upon some of them by night who told him the enemy would soon attack him he pro vided for his security and placed watchmen beyond his camp and kept all his forces armed all night And he gave them a charge to be of good courage and to have their minds prepared to fight in the night time if they should be obliged so to do lest their enemies designs should seem concealed from them But when Demetrius s commanders were informed that Jonathan knew what they intended their counsels were disorder ed and it alarmed them to find that the ene my had discovered their intentions Nor did they expect to overcome them any other way now they had failed in the snares they had laid for them For should they hazard an open battle they did not think they should be a match for Jonathan s army So they resolved to flee and having lighted many fires that when the enemy saw them they might suppose they were there still they re tired But when Jonathan came to give them battle in the morning and found their camp deserted and understood they were fled he pursued them Yet could not he overtake them for they had already passed over the river Eleutherus and were out of danger So when Jonathan returned thence he went into Arabia and fought against the Naba teans and drove away a great deal of their prey and took many captives and came to Damascus and there sold off that he had taken About the same time it was that Si mon his brother went over all Judea and Palestine as far as Ascalon and fortified the strong holds and when he had made them very strong both in the edifices erected and in the garrisons placed in them he came to Joppa and when he had taken it he brought a great garrison into it For he heard that the people of Joppa were disposed to deliver up the city to Demetrius s generals When Simon and Jonathan had finished these affairs they returned to Jerusalem There Jonathan gathered all the people to gether and took counsel to restore the walls of Jerusalem and to rebuild the wall that encompassed the temple which had been thrown down and to make the places ad joining stronger by very high towers and besides that to build another wall in the midst of the city in order to exclude the market place from the garrison which was in the citadel and by that means to hinder them from any plenty of provisions and moreover to make the fortresses that were in the country much stronger and more defensi ble than they were before And when these things were approved of by the multitude as rightly proposed Jonathan himself took care of the building that belonged to the city and sent Simon to make the fortresses in the country more secure than formerly But Demetrius passed over the Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia as desirous to contain that country still as well as Babylon and when he should have obtained the do minion of the upper provinces to lay a foun dation for recovering his entire kingdom For those Greeks and Macedonians who dwelt there frequently sent ambassadors to him and promised that if he would come to them they would deliver themselves up to him and assist him in fighting against fArsa ces the king of the Parthians So he was elevated with these hopes and came hastily to them as having resolved that if he had once overthrown the Parthians and gotten  Since the Nabatean Arabians were now in amity with the Jews  ch 1 perhaps the reading in 1 Mace xii 31 may be the truer where these people are called Zabadeans Otherwise Grotius s conjecture set down by Dr Hudson must be allowed that the Nabateans not now following Antiochus the son of Alexander Balas but his and Jona than s enemy Demetrius Nicator Jonathan endeavoured by force to oblige them to come into his measures and to acknowledge his friend Antiochus as king of Syria t This king who was of the famous race of Arsaces is both here and 1 Mace xiv 2 called by the family name Arsaces but Appian says his proper name was Phraates He is here also called by Josephus the king of the Par thians as the Greeks used to call them but by the elder author of the first book of Maccabees the king of the Persians and Medes according to the language of the eastern nations See Authent Rec Pt II page 1108 aw 144 471 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS an army of his own he would make war against Trypho and eject him out of Syria And the people of that country received him with great alacrity So he raised forces with which he fought against Arsaces but he lost all his army and was himself taken prisoner CHAP VI OF THE TREACHEROUS ASSASSINATION OF JONATHAN THE SUCCESSION OF SIMON AS GENERAL AND HIGH PRIEST OF THE JEWS  AND THE COURAGEOUS ACTIONS HE PERFORMED AGAINST TRVPHO WHEN Trypho knew what had befallen Demetrius he was no longer firm to Antiochus but contrived by subtilty to kill him and then take possession of his kingdom But the fear that he was in of Jonathan was an obstacle to his design for Jonathan was a friend to Antiochus For which cause he resolved first to take Jonathan out of the way and then to set about his design rela ting to Antiochus But he judging it best to take him off by deceit and treachery came from Antioch to Bethshan which by the Greeks is called Scythopolis at which place Jonathan met him with forty thousand chosen men for he thought that he came to fight him But when he perceived that Jonathan was ready to fight he attempted to gain him by presents and kind treatment and gave order to his captains to obey him and by these means was desirous to give him assu rance of his good will and to take away all suspicions out of his mind that so he might make him careless and inconsiderate and might take him when he was unguarded He also advised him to dismiss his army because there was no occasion for bringing it with him when there was no war but all was in eace However he desired him to retain a ew about him and go with him to Ptolemais for that he would deliver the city up to him and would bring all the fortresses that were in the country under his dominion and he told him that he came with those very de signs  1 Mace xii 39â 45 t 1 Mace xii 52 J The commendation which the author of the first hook ef the Maccabees chap xiv 4 c bestows npon Simon is worth our observation for he therein tells us that he Yet did not Jonathan suspect any thing at all by this management but believed that Trypho gave him this advice out of kindness and with a sincere design Accordingly he dismissed his army and retained no more than three thousand of them with him and left two thousand in Galilee and he himself with one thousand came with Trypho to Ptolemais But when the people of Ptole mais had shut their gates as it had been com manded them by Trypho to do he took Jonathan alive and slew all that were with him He also sent soldiers against those two thousand that were left in Galilee in order to destroy them But those men having heard the report of what had happened to Jonathan prevented the execution and be fore those that were sent by Trypho came they covered themselves with their armour and went away out of the country Now when those that were sent against them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives they gave them no disturbance but returned back to Trypho When the people of Jerusalem heard that Jonathan was taken and that the soldiers who were with him were destroyed they deplored his sad fate f and there was earnest inquiry made about him by every body and a great fear fell upon them and made them sad lest now they were deprived of the courage and conduct of Jonathan the nations about them should bear them ill will and as they were before quiet on account of Jona than they should now rise up against them and by making war with them should force them into the utmost dangers And indeed what they suspected really befell them For when those nations heard of the death of Jonathan they began to make war with the Jews as now destitute of a governor And Trypho himself assembled an army and had an intention to go up to Judea and make war against its inhabitants But when Simon saw that the people of Jerusalem were terrified at the circumstances they were in he desired to make a speech to them J and thereby to render them more resolute in opposing Try sought the fjood of the nation in every thing so that his authority always pleased them well that during his ad ministration whilst Syria and other neighbouring king doms were almost destroyed by wars the Jews lived quietly every man under his own vine and fig tree enÂ 472 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS pho when he should come against them He then called the people together into the temple and thence began thus to encourage them O my countrymen you are not ignorant that our father myself and my brethren have ventured to hazard our lives and that wil lingly for the recovery of your liberty Since 1 have therefore such plenty of examples be fore me and we of our family have deter mined with ourselves to die for our laws and our divine worship there shall no terror be so great as to banish this resolution from our souls nor to introduce in its place a love of life and a contempt of glory Do you there fore follow me with alacrity whithersoever I shall lead you as not destitute of such a captain as is willing to suffer and to do the greatest things for you For neither am I better than my brethren that I should be sparing of my own life nor so far worse than they as to avoid and refuse what they thought the most honourable of all things I mean to undergo death for your laws and for that worship of God which is peculiar to you I will therefore give such proper de monstrations as will shew that I am their own brother And I am so bold as to expect that I shall avenge their blood upon our enemies and deliver you all with your wives and chil dren from the injuries they intend against you and with God s assistance to preserve your temple from destruction by them For I see that these nations have you in contempt as being without a governor and that they hence are encouraged to make war against you By this speech Simon inspired the multi tude with courage and as they had been be fore dispirited through fear they were now raised to a good hope of better things inso much that the whole multitude cried out all at once that Simon should be their leader and that instead of Judas and Jonathan his brethren he should have the government over them and they promised that they would readily obey him in whatsoever he should command them So he immediately assem bled all his own soldiers that were fit for war and made haste in rebuilding the walls of the city and strengthened them by very high and strong towers and sent his friend Jonathan the son of Absalom to Joppa and gave him order to eject the inhabitants out of the city For he was afraid lest they should deliver up the city to Trypho But he him self stayed to secure Jerusalem Now Trypho removed from Ptolemais with a great army and came into Judea and brought Jonathan with him in bonds Simon also met him with his army at the city Adida which is upon a hill and beneath it lie the plains of Judea And when Trypho knew that Simon was made governor of the Jews he sent to him and would have imposed upon him by deceit and treachery and desired him if he would have his brother Jonathan released that he would send him a hundred talents of silver and two of Jonathan s sons as hostages that when he should be released he might not make Judea revolt from the king for that at present he was kept in bonds on account of the money that he had bor rowed of the king and now owed to him But Simon was aware of the craft of Trypho and although he knew that if he gave him the money he should lose it and that Trypho would not set his brother free and withal should deliver the sons of Jonathan to the enemy yet because he was afraid that he should have a calumny raised against him among the multitude as the cause of his bro ther s death if he neither gave the money nor sent Jonathan s sons he gathered his army together and told them what offers Trypho had made and added that the offers joying without fear the fruits of their labours and be holding with pleasure the flourishing state of their coun try their trade increased by the reduction of Joppa and other maritime places their territories enlarged their armies well disciplined their towns and fortresses well garrisoned their religion and liberties secured their land freed from Heathen enemies and Jewish apostates and their friendship courted by all the nations about them even by the Romans and the Lacedaemonians He ob serves farther that this Simon was no less zealous for the service of God in exterminating apostacy superstition idolatry and every thing else that was contrary to his laws that he was a great protector of the true Israelites and a friend to the poor that he restored the service of the temple to its ancient splendour and repaired the number of its sacred vessels so that we need not wonder if the Jewish Sanhedrim thought no dignity of honour while he lived and when he was so basely and barbarously cut off no grief and lamentation too great for a man of his uncommon merit  Universal History lib 2 c 11 B  1 Macc xiii 8 AN 143 473 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS were ensnaring and treacherous and yet that it was more eligible to send the money and Jonathan s sons than to be liable to the imputation of not complying with Trypho s offers and thereby refusing to save his bro ther Accordingly Simon sent the sons of Jonathan and the money But when Trypho had received them he did not keep his pro mise nor set Jonathan free but took his army and went about all the country and resolved to go up afterward to Jerusalem by the way of Idumea while Simon went over against him with his army and invariably pitched his own camp over against him When those that were in the citadel had sent to Trypho and besought him to make haste and come to them and to send them Erovisions he prepared his cavalry as though e would be at Jerusalem that very night But so great a quantity of snow fell in the night that it covered the roads and made them so deep that there was no passing especially for the cavalry and this prevented him from coming to Jerusalem Trypho there fore removed thence and came into Coele syria and falling vehemently upon the land of Gilead he slew Jonathan there and when he had given order for his burial he returned to Antioch However Simon sent some to the city Basca to bring away his brother s bones and buried them in their own city Modin And all the people made great la mentation over him Simon also erected a very large monument for his father and his brethren of white and polished stone and raised it a great height and so as to be seen at a considerable distance and made clois ters about it and set up pillars which were of one stone apiece Moreover he built seven pyramids for his parents and his brethren  An 143 B C t There is some error in the copies here when no more than four years are ascribed to the high priesthood of Jonathan We know by Josephus s last Jewish chro nology XX 10 that there was an interval of seven years between the death of Alcimus or Jacimns the last high priest and the real high priesthood of Jonathan to whom yet those seven years seem here to be ascribed as part of them were to Judas before XII 10 Now since be sides those seven years interregnum in the pontificate we are told XX 10 that Jonathan s real high priesthood lasted seven years more these two seven years will make up fourteen years which I suppose was Josephus s own number in this place instead of the four in our present copies one for each of them which were made very surprising both for their largeness and beauty and which have been preserved to this day And we know that it was Simon who bestowed so much zeal about the burial of Jonathan and the building of these monu ments for his relations Now Jonathan died when he had been high priest ffour years and had been also the governor of his nation And these were the circumstances that con cerned his death But Simon who was made high priest by the multitude on the very first year of his high priesthood set his people free from their slavery under the Macedonians and permit ted them to pay tribute to them no longer Which liberty and freedom from tribute they obtained after a Jhundred and seventy years of the kingdom of the Assyrians which was after Seleucus who was called Nicator got the dominion over Syria Now the affection of the multitude toward Simon was so great that in their contracts one with another and in their public records they wrote In the first year of Simon the benefactor and eth narch of the Jews For under him they were very happy and overcame the enemies that were round about them For Simon overthrew the cities Gazara Joppa and Jamnia He also took the citadel of Jerusa lem by siege and cast it down to the ground that it might not be any more a place of re fuge to their enemies when they took it to do them a mischief as it had been till now And when he had done this he thought it advisable and most for their advantage to level the very mountain itself upon which that citadel happened to stand that so the temple might be higher than it And when he had called the multitude to an assembly J These 170 years of the Assyrians mean no more as Josephus explains himself here than from the era of Se leucus which as it is known to have begun on the 312th year before the Christian era from its spring in the first book of Maccabees and from its autumn in the second book of Maccabees so did it not begin at Babylon till the next spring on the 311th year See Prideaux at the year 312 And it is truly observed by Dr Hudson on this place that the Syrians and Assyrians are sometimes confounded in ancient authors according to the words of Justin the Epitomizer of Trogus Pompeius who says that The Assyrians were afterwards called Syrians I 11 See Of the War V 9 where the Philistines themselves at the very south limit of Syria in its utmost extent are called Assyrians by Josephus as Spanheim observes 474 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS he persuaded them to have it so demolished and this by putting them in mind what mise ries they had suffered by its garrison and the Jewish deserters and what miseries they might hereafter suffer in case any foreigner should obtain the kingdom and put a gar rison into that citadel This speech induced the multitude to a compliance because he exhorted them to nothing but what was for their own good So they all applied them selves to the work and levelled the moun tain and in that work spent both day and night without any intermission which cost them three whole years before it was re moved and brought to a level with the plain of the rest of the city After which the temple was the highest of all the buildings now the citadel as well as the mountain whereon it stood were demolished And these actions were thus performed under Simon CHAP VII of simon s alliance with antiochus pius and his wars against trypho and against cendebeus the general of antiochus s army also of his assassi nation by his son in law ptolemy NOWf after Demetrius had been carried into captivity Trypho his governor J destroyed Antiochus the son of Alexander who was also called j the God and this when he had reigned four years Though he caused it to be reported that he died under the hands of the surgeons He then sent his friends and those that were most intimate with him to the soldiers and promised that he would give them a great deal of money if they would make him king He intimated to them that Demetrius was taken captive by the Parthians and that Demetrius s brother Antiochus if he came to be king would do them a great deal of mischief in way of re venge for their revolting from his brother So the soldiers in expectation of the wealth they should get by bestowing the kingdom on Trypho made him their ruler However when Trypho had gained the management of affairs he demonstrated his disposition to be wicked For while he was a private person he cultivated a familiarity with the multitude and pretended to great moderation and so drew them on artfully to whatsoever he pleased But when he had once taken the kingdom he laid aside any farther dissimu lation and appeared in his true colours This behaviour made his enemies superior to him for the soldiery hated him and re volted from him to Cleopatra the wife of Demetrius who was then shut up in Se leucia with her children But as Antiochus the son of Demetrius who was called Soter was not admitted by any of the cities on ac  An 142 141 140 B C t It must here be diligently noted that Josephus s copy of the first book of Maccabees which he had so carefully followed and faithfully abridged as fir as the 50th verse of the 13th chapter seems there to have ended What few things there are afterward common to both might probably be learned by him from some other more im perfect records However we must exactly observe here what the remaining part of that book of the Macca bees informs us of and what Josephus would never have omitted had this copy contained so much that this Simon the Great the Maccabee made a league with Antiochus Soter the son of Demetrius Soter and brother to the other Demetrius who was now a captive in Parthia that upon his coming to the crown about the 140th year before the Christian era he granted great privileges to the Jewish nation and to Simon their high priest and ethnarch which privileges Simon seems to have taken of his own accord about three years before In particular he gave him leave to coin money for his country with his own stamp and as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary that they should be free or as the vulgar Latin hath it holy and free 1 Mace xv 6 7 which I take to be the truer read ing as being the very words of his father s concession offered to Jonathan several years before x 31 Antiq XIII 2 Now what makes this date and these grants greatly remarkable is the state of the remaining genuine shekels of the Jews with Samaritan characters which seem to have been most of them at least coined in the four first years of this Simon the Asmonean and having upon them these words on one side Jerusalem the holy and on the reverse  In the year of freedom 1 or 2 or 3 4 Which shekels therefore are original monu ments of these times and undeniable marks of the troth of the history in these chapters though it be in a great measure omitted by Josephus See Essay on the Old Testament p 157 158 The reason why I rather sup pose that his copy of the Maccabees wanted these chap ters than that his own copies are here imperfect is this that all their contents are not here omitted though much the greatest part be See a pattern of these genuine she kels with the inscriptions in Samaritan letters at the bot tom of my Description of the Temples I How Trypho killed this Antiochus the Epitome of Livy informs us chap 55 viz that he corrupted his phy sicians or surgeons who falsely pretending to the people that he was perishing with the stone as they cut him for it killed him which exactly agrees with Josephus  That this Antiochus the son of Alexander Balas was called the God is evident from his coins which Spanheim assures us bear this inscription King Antiochus the God Epiphanes the victorious AN 140 475 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS count of Trypho Cleopatra sent to him and invited him to marry her and to take the kingdom The reasons why she made this invitation were that her friends persuaded her to it and that she was afraid for herself in case some of the people of Seleucia should deliver up the city to Trypho As Antiochus was now come to Seleucia and his forces increased every day he marched to fight Trypho and having de feated him he ejected him out of the Upper Syria into Phoenicia and pursued him thi ther and besieged him in Dora which was a fortress hard to be taken whither he had fled He also sent ambassadors to Simon the Jewish high priest about a league of friendship and mutual assistance Who rea dily accepted of the invitation and sent to Antiochus great suras of money and pro visions for those that besieged Dora and thereby supplied them very plentifully So that for a little while he was looked upon as one of his most intimate friends But still Trypho fled from Dora to Apamia where he was taken during the siege and put to death when he had reigned fthree years However Antiochus forgot the kind assist ance that Simon had afforded him in his ne cessity by reason of his covetous and wicked disposition and committed an army of sol diers to his friend Cendebeus and sent him at once to ravage Judea and to sieze Simon When Simon heard of Antiochus s breaking his league with him although he were now in years yet provoked with the unjust treat ment he had met with from Antiochus and taking a resolution brisker than his age could well bear he went like a young man to act as general of his army He also sent his sons before among the most hardy of his soldiers and he himself marched on with his army another way and laid many of his men in ambushes in the narrow valleys be tween the mountains Nor did he fail of suc cess in any one of his attempts but was too hard for his enemies in every one of them So he led the rest of his life in peace and also made a league with the Romans Now he was the ruler of the Jews in all Jcight years but his death was at length caused at a banquet by the treachery of his son in law Ptolemy who caught also his wife and two of his sons and kept them in bonds He also sent some to kill John the third son whose name was Hyrcanus But the young man perceiving them coming avoided the danger he was in and hastened into the city Jerusalem as relying on the good will of the multitude because of the benefits they had received from his father and because of the hatred the same multitude bore to Ptolemy So that when Ptolemy was endeavouring to enter the city by another gate they drove him away as having already admitted Hyrcanus CHAP VIII HYRCANUS RECEIVES THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AND EJECTS PTOLEMY OUT OF THE COUNTRY ANTIOCHUS MAKES WAR AGAINST HYRCANUS AND AFTERWARD MAKES A LEAGUE WITH HIM PTOLEMYÂ retired to one of the for tresses that was above Jericho which was called Dagon But Hyrcanus took the high priesthood that had been his father s before and propitiated God by sacrifices he then made an expedition against Ptolemy and when he made his attacks upon the place in other points he was too hard for him but was rendered weaker than he by the commiseration he had for his mother and brethren and by that only For Ptolemy brought them upon the wall and tormented them in the sight of all and threatened that he would throw them down headlong unless Hyrcanus would raise the siege And as he thought that so far as he relaxed as to the siege and taking of the place so much favour did he shew to those that were dearest to him by preventing their misery his zeal about it was cooled

remiss on her ac count but indulge his indignation so much the more and that he would do his utmost to take the place quickly in order to get their enemy under his power and then to avenge upon him what he had done to those that were dearest to himself For that death to her would be sweet though attended with torment if that enemy of theirs might but be brought to punishment for his wicked deal ings to them Now when his mother said so he resolved to take the fortress immediately but when he saw her beaten and torn to pieces his courage failed him and he could not but sympathize with what his mother suffered and was thereby overcome And as the siege was drawn out into length by these means that year on which the Jews use to rest came on for the Jews observe this rest every seventh year as they do every seventh day So Ptolemy being for this cause re leased from the war slew the brethren of Hyrcanus and his mother And when he had so done he fled to Zeno surnamed Co tylas who was then tyrant of the city Phila delphia But Antiochus being very uneasy at the miseries that Simon had brought upon him invaded Judea in the fourth year of his reign and the first year of the principality of Hyr canus in the fhundred and sixty second Olympiad And when he had burnt the country he shut up Hyrcanus in the city which he encompassed round with seven encampments but did nothing at the first because of the strength of the walls and the valour of the besieged although they were once in want of water which yet they were delivered from by a copious shower of rain which fell at the Jsetting of the Pleiades However about the north part of the wall where it happened the city was upon a level with the outward ground the king raised a hundred towers of three stories high and placed bodies of soldiers upon them and as he made his attacks every day he cut a double ditch deep and broad and confined the inhabitants within it as within a wall But the besieged contrived to make frequent sallies and if the enemy were not any where upon their guard they fell upon them and did them a great deal of mischief and if they perceived them they then retired into the city with ease But because Hyrcanus discerned the inconvenience of so great a number of men in the city while the pro visions were the sooner spent by them and yet as is natural to suppose those great numbers did nothing he separated the use less part and excluded them out of the city and retained that part only which were in the flower of their age and fit for war How ever Antiochus would not let those that were excluded go away Who therefore wandering about between the walls and consuming away by famine died miserably But when the feast of the tabernacles was at hand those that were within commiserated their condition and received them in again And when Hyrcanus sent to Antiochus and de sired there might be a truce for seven days because of the festival he gave way to this piety towards God and made that truce ac cordingly And besides that he sent in a magnificent sacrifice bulls with their homs  Hence we learn that in the days of this excellent high priest John Hyrcanus the observance of the sab batic year as Josephus supposed required a rest from war as did that of the weekly sabbath from work I mean this unless in the case of necessity when the Jews were attacked by their enemies in which case indeed and in which alone they allowed defensive fighting to be lawful even on the sabbath day as we see in several places of Josephus Antiq XII 6 XIII 1 XIV 4 XVHI 9 Of the War I 7 IV 2 But then it must be noted that this rest from war no way appears in the first book of Maccabees chap xvi but the direct contrary Though indeed the Jews in the days of Antiochus Epi phanes did not venture upon fighting on the sabbath day even in the defence of their own lives till the Asmo neans or Maccabees decreed so to do 1 Mace ii 32â 41 Antiq XII 6  Josephus s copies both Greek and Latin have here a gross mistake when they say that this first year of John Hyrcanus which we have just now seen to have been a sabbatic year was in the 162d Olympiad whereas it was certainly the second year of the 161st See the like before XII 7 J This heliacal setting of the Pleiades or seven stars was in the days of Hyrcanus and Josephus early in the spring about February the time of the latter rain in Ju dea And this so far as I remember is the only astrono mical character of time besides one eclipse of the moon in the reign of Herod that we meet with in all Josephus The Jews being little accustomed to astronomical obser vations any farther than for the use of their calendar and utterly forbidden those astrological uses which the Heathens commonly made of them  Dr Hudson tells us here that the custom of gilding the horns of those oxen that were to be sacrificed is a known thing both in the poets and orators AN 135 J 477 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS gilded with all sorts of sweet spices and with cups of gold and silver So those that were at the gates received the sacrifices from those that brought them and led them to the temple Antiochus in the mean time feasting his army This was quite a different con duct from that of Antiochus Epipbanes who when he had taken the city offered swine upon the altar and sprinkled the temple with the broth of their flesh in order to vio late the laws of the Jews and the religion they derived from their forefathers for which reason our nation made war with him and would never be reconciled to him But for this Antiochus all men called him Antiochus the Pious for the great zeal he had about religion Accordingly Hyrcanus took this modera tion kindly and when he understood how re ligious he was towards the Deity he sent an ambassage to him and desired that he would restore the settlements they received from their forefathers So he rejected the counsel of those that would have him utterly destroy the nation by reason of their way of living which was to others unsociable and did not regard what they said But being persuaded that all they did was out of a religious mind he answered the ambassadors that if the be sieged would deliver up their arms and pay tribute for Joppa and the other cities which bordered upon Judea and admit a garrison of his on these terms he would make war against them no longer But the Jews al though they were content with the other conditions did not agree to admit the gar rison because they could not associate with other people nor converse with them Yet were they willing instead of the admission of the garrison to give him hostages and five hundred talents of silver Of which they paid down three hundred and sent the hostages immediately which king Antio chus accepted One of those hostages was Hyrcanus s brother But still he brake down the fortifications that encompassed the city And upon these conditions Antiochus raised the siege and departed Now Hyrcanus topened the sepulchre of David who excelled all other kings in riches and took out of it three thousand talents f He was also the first of the Jews that rely ing on this wealth maintained foreign troops He likewise made a league of friendship and mutual assistance with Antiochus and admit ted him into the city and furnished him with  This account in Josephus that the present Antiochus was persuaded though in vain not to make peace with the Jews but to cut them off utterly is fully confirmed by Dio doras Siculus in Photius s extracts out of his 34th book f See the note on Book VII chap 15 I Josephus tells us that Hyrcanus to find some money for this and other occasions of the government broke up the sepulchre of David and took from thence three thou sand talents and that Herod the Great did afterwards the like Antiq lib XVII c 16 and lib XVI c 11 But both these stories are highly improbable David had now been dead near nine hundred years and what is told of this treasure supposes it to have been buried with him all this time It supposes that as oft as the city of Jeru salem the palace and the temple during the reigns of the kings of Judah had been plundered of all their wealth and treasure by prevailing enemies this dead stock still remained safe from all rifle or violation It supposes that as oft as these kings were forced to take all the trea sure that was found in the house of the Lord as well as in their own to relieve the exigencies of the state they never meddled with this that was uselessly buried with David in his grave It supposes that when one of the worst of their kings 2 Kings xv 8 c and 2 Chron xxviii 28 c plundered the temple of its sacred vessels and cut them in pieces to melt them down into money for his common occasions and that when one of the best of them 2 Kings xviii 15 16 was forced to cut off the gold wherewith the gates and pillars of the tem ple were overlaid to bribe a destroying enemy this use less treasure still continued untouched Nay it supposes that when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed both the city and temple of Jerusalem so that for many years they both lay in rubbish this treasure in David s sepulchre lay all the while safe and secure under it and that when An tiochus Epiphanes in like manner destroyed the city and robbed the temple of all that he could find this trea sure still escaped his rapacious hands nor was ever mo lested till Hyrcanus at this time was forced to make bold with it all which suppositions seem highly impro bable and beyond belief There is this however to be said in the matter that as there certainly was a bank or treasury in the temple where money was laid up for the support of the poor for the relief of widows and father less children and for the maintenance of divine service and where the great men and rich men of the nation were used to deposit their wealth for its better security it is not improbable that upon the account of the fre quent invasions and depredations they were liable to this treasure might be kept in some secret and subterraneous place unknown to all but such as were at the head of affairs that Hyrcanus being now under great difficulty to raise money might borrow it out of this bank till bet ter times enabled him to repay it and that Herod when he plundered it quite might trump up this plausible story that it neither belonged to church nor poor nor any private person but had been deposited there by David and his successors as a proper supply for the state in times of need Prideaux s Connection anno 135 and Universal History lib 2 c 11 B 4G2 178 book xm ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS whatsoever his army wanted in great plenty and marched along with him when he made an expedition against the Parthians Of which Nicolaus of Damascus is a witness for us who in his history writes thus When Antiochus had erected a trophy at the river Lycus upon his conquest of Indates the ge neral of the Parthians he stayed there two days It was at the desire of Hyrcanus the Jew because it was such a festival derived to them from their forefathers whereon the law of the Jews did not allow them to travel And he did not speak falsely in saying so for that festival which we call Pentecost did then fall out to be the next day to the sabbath Nor is it lawful for us to journey either on a sabbath day or on a festival But when Antiochus joined battle with Ar saces king of Parthia he lost a great part of his army and was himself slain And his brother Demetrius succeeded in the kingdom of Syria by the permission of Arsaces who freed him from his captivity at the same time that Antiochus attacked Parthia CHAP IX OF THE EXPEDITION OF HYRCANUS AGAINST SVRIA AND HIS CONCLUSION OF A LEAOUE WITH THE ROMANS ALSO OF THE DEATH OF KING DEMETRIUS AND ALEX ANDER HEN Hyrcanus fheard of the death of Antiochus he presently made an ex w pedition against Jthe cities of Syria hoping to find them destitute of fighting men and of such as were able to defend them How ever it was not till the sixth month that he took Medaba and that not without the great distress of his army After this he took Sa mega and the neighbouring places And besides these Shechem and Gerizzim and the nation of the Cutheans who dwelt at the temple which resembled that temple which was at Jerusalem and which Alexander per mitted Sanballat the general of his army to build for the sake of Manasseh who was son in law to Jaddua the high priest as we have formerly related Which temple was now deserted Â two hundred years after it was built Hyrcanus also took Dora and Ma rissa cities of Idumea and subdued all the Idumeans and permitted them to stay in that country if they would adopt the rite of circumcision and make use of the laws of the Jews And they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers that they submitted At which time therefore this be fell them that they were hereafter no other than Jews But Hyrcanus the high priest was de sirous to renew that league of friendship they had with the Romans Accordingly he sentff an ambassage to them And when the senate had received their epistle they made a league of friendship with them after the manner following â  The Jews were not to march or journey on the sab bath or on such a great festival as was equivalent to the sabbath any farther than a sabbath day s journey or 2000 cubits See the Note on XX 8 t An 130 J Those within the limits of Judea II See Book XI chap 8 Â It was exactly 202 years viz from an 332 to an 130 B C  This account of the Idumeans admitting circumci sion and the entire Jewish law from this time or from the days of Hyrcanus is confirmed by their subsequent history See XIV 8 XV 7 XVII 12 Of the War II 3 IV 4 This in the opinion of Josephus made them proselytes of juslice or entire Jews as here and elsewhere XIV 8 So Dio XXXVII page 41 How ever Anti onus the enemy of Herod though Herod were derived from surh a proselyte of justice for several gene rations will allow him to be no more than a half Jew XIV 15 But still take out of Dean Prideaux at the year 129 the words of Ammonius which fully confirm this account of the Idumeans in Josephus The Jews says he are such by nature and from the beginning ivhile the Idumeans were not Jews from the beginning but Phoenicians and Syrians but being afterward sub dued by the Jews and compelled to be circumcised and to unite into one nation and to be subject to the same laws they were called Jews Dio also says as the Dean there quotes him from Book XXXVI page 37 That country is called Judea and the people Jews And this name is given also to as many others as embrace their religion though of other nations But then upon what foundation so good a governor as Hyrcanus took upon him to compel these Idumeans either to become Jews or to leave their country deserves great consideration I suppose it was because they had long ago been driven out of the land of Edom and had seized on and pos sessed the tribe of Simeon and all the southern parts ot the tribe of Judah which was the peculiar inheritance ot the worshippers of the true God without idolatry as the reader may learn from Reland Palestin part I page I54 305 and from Prideaux at the years 740 and 165 Nor do I remember that ever the like violence was used by him or his predecessors with any country which was not a part of that promised land though the other kings after him intended it to all their conquests in or out of that promised land See Prideaux at the year 10G and Antiq XIII 15 tt An 128 AN 128 479 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Fanius the son of Marcus the praetor gathered the senate together on the eighth day before the ides of February in the senate house when Lucius Manlius the son of Lu cius of the Mentine tribe and Caius Sempro nius the son of Caius of the Falernian tribe were present The occasion was that the ambassadors sent by the people of the Jews Simon the son of Dositheus Apollonius the son of Alexander and Diodorus the son of Jason who were good and virtuous men had somewhat to propose about that league of friendship and mutual assistance which sub sisted between them and the Romans and about other public affairs who desired that Joppa and the havens and Gazara and the springs of Jordan and the several other cities a nd countries of theirs which Antiochus had taken from them in the war contrary to the decree of the senate might be restored to them and that it might be lawful for the king s troops to pass through their country and the countries of those that are subject to them And that what attempts Antiochus had made during that war without the de cree of the senate might be made void and that they would send ambassadors who should take care that restitution be made them of what Antiochus had taken from them and that they should make an esti mate of the country that had been laid waste in the war and that they would grant them letters of protection to the kings and free people in order to their quiet return home It was therefore decreed as to these points to renew their league of friendship and mutual assistance with these good men who were sent by a good and a friendly people But as to the letters desired their answer was that the senate would consult about that matter when their own affairs would give them leave and that they would en deavour for the time to come that no like injury should be done them and that their praetor Fanius should give them money out of the public treasury to bear their ex penses home And thus did Fanius dismiss the Jewish ambassadors and gave them money out of the public treasury and gave the decree of the senate to those that were to conduct them and to take care that they should return home in safety j And thus stood the affairs of Hyrcanus the high priest But as for king Demetrius who was inclined to make war against Hyr canus there was no opportunity for it while both the Syrians and the soldiers bare ill will to him because he was an ill man But when they had sent ambassadors to Ptolemy Physcon that he would send them one of the family of Seleucus in order to take the king dom and he had sent them Alexander who was called Zebina with an army and there had been a battle between them Demetrius was defeated and fled to Cleopatra his wife to Ptolemais but his wife would not receive him He went thence to Tyre and was there caught and fwhen he had suffered much from his enemies he was slain by them So Alexander took the kingdom and made a league with Hyrcanus Yet when Alexander afterward fought with Antiochus the son of Demetrius who was called Gry pus he was also defeated and slain CHAP X UPON THE QUARREL BETWEEN ANTIOCHUS GRYPUS AND ANTIOCHUS CYZICENUS RESPECTING THE KINGDOM HYR CANUS TAKES AND DEMOLISHES SAMARIA AND AFTER WARD JOINS HIMSELF TO THE SECT OF THE SADDUCEES WHEN Antiochus had taken the king dom he was afraid to make war against Judea because he heard that his brother by the same mother who was also called Antiochus was raising an army against him out of Cyzicum So he stayed in his own land and resolved to prepare himself for the attack he expected from his brother who was called Cyzicenus because he had been brought up in that city He was the son of Antiochus called Soter who died in Parthia He was the brother of Demetrius the father of Grypus For it had so hap  In this decree of the Roman senate it seems that these ambassadors were sent from the people of the Jews as well as from their prince or high priest John Hyrcanus f This clause that Demetrius suffered much from his enemies before his death is noted here by Dr Hudson to b sagree with the accounts of Trogus Pompeius in Justin and with Porphyry Whether Josephus or those authors were here imposed upon cannot now be determined But if this were a part of the Chronicles of John Hyrcanus a most authentic and contemporary record as it seems to be there is no doubt but Josephus s account ought to be preferred J An 122 480 book xnr ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS pened that one and the same Cleopatra was married to two who were brethren as we have related elsewhere But Antiochus Cyzicenus coming into Syria continued many years at war with his brother Now Hyrca nus lived all this while in peace For after the death of Antiochus he frevolted from the Macedonians nor did he any longer pay them the least regard either as their sub ject or their friend but his affairs were in a very improving and flourishing condition in the time of Alexander Zebina and especially under these brethren For the war which they had with one another gave Hyrcanus an opportunity of enjoying himself in Judea quietly insomuch that he got an immense quantity of money However when Antio chus Cyzicenus distressed his land he then openly shewed what he meant And when he saw that Antiochus was destitute of Egyptian auxiliaries and that both he and his brother were in an ill condition in the struggles they had one with another he despised them both So he made an expedition against Sama ria which was a very strong city of whose present name Sebaste and its rebuilding by Herod we shall speak at a proper time But he made his attack against it and besieged it with a great deal of pains For he was dis pleased with the Samaritans for the injuries they had done to the people of Marissa a colony of the Jews and confederate with them and this in compliance with the kings of Syria When he had therefore drawn a ditch and built a double wall round the city which was eighty furlongs long he set his sons Anligonus and Anstobulus over the siege This brought the Samaritans to such great distress by famine that they were forced to eat what used not to be eaten and to call for Antiochus Cyzicenus to help them Accordingly he came to their as sistance but was beaten by Aristobulus and when he was pursued as far as Scytho polis by the two brethren he got away So they returned to Samaria and shut them again within the wall till they were forced  See chap 7 t Dean Prideaux takes notice at the year 133 that Jus tin in agreement with Josephus says The power of the Jews was now grown so great that after this Antiochus they would not have any Macedonian king over them to send for the same Antiochus a second time to help them He then procured about six thousand men from Ptolemy Lathyrus which were sent them without his mother s consent who had then in a manner turned him out of his government With these Egyptians Antiochus at first overran and ravaged the country of Hyrcanus after the manner of a robber for he durst not meet him openly to fight with him as not having an army sufficient for that purpose but only from this supposal that by thus harassing his land he should force Hyrcanus to raise the siege of Samaria But because he fell into snares and lost many of his soldiers therein he went away to Tripoli and committed the prosecution of the war against the Jews to Callimander and Epicrates But Callimander attacked the enemy too rashly and was put to flight and destroyed immediately And as to Epicrates he was such a lover of money that he openly be trayed Scythopolis and other places near it to the Jews but was not able to make them raise the siege of Samaria And when Hyr canus had taken that city after a year s siege he demolished it entirely and brought rivulets to it to drown it For he dug such hollows as might let the water run under it Nay he took away the very marks that there had ever been such a city there Now a very surprising thing is related of this high priest Hyrcanus now God came to dis course with him For they say that on the very same day on which his sons fought with Antiochus Cyzicenus he was alone in the temple as high priest offering incense and heard a Jvoice informing him that his sons had just then overcome Antiochus And this he openly declared before all the multitude upon his coming out of the temple And it accordingly proved true Now it happened at this time that not only those Jews who were at Jerusalem and in Judea were in prosperity but also those of them who were in Egypt and Cyprus For Cleopatra the queen was at variance with her son Ptolemy Lathyrus and appointed for and that they set up a government of their own and in fested Syria with great wars J The oracle of Urim See the note on Book III chap 8 AN no 481 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS her generals Chelcias and Ananias the sons of that Onias who built the temple in the prefecture of Heliopolis like to that at Je rusalem as we have elsewhere related Cleopatra entrusted these men with her ar my and did nothing without their advice as fStrabo of Cappadocia attests when he saith thus Now the greater part both those that came to Cyprus with us and those that were sent afterward thither revolted to Ptolemy immediately Only those that were called Onias s party being Jews continued faithful because their countrymen Chelcias and Ana nias were in chief favour with the queen This prosperous state of affairs however moved the Jews to envy Hyrcanus but they that were the worst disposed to him were the JPharisees who are one of the sects of the Jews as we have observed already These have so great a power over the multitude that when they say any thing against the king or against the high priest they are pre sently believed Now Hyrcanus was a dis ciple of theirs and greatly beloved by them And when he once invited them to a feast and entertained them very kindly when he saw them in a good humour he began to say to them that they knew he was desirous to be a righteous man and to do all things whereby he might please God which was the Â rofession of the Pharisees also However e desired that if they observed him offending in any point and going out of the right way they would recall him back and correct him On this occasion they attested to his being entirely virtuous with which commendation he was well pleased But still there was one of his guests there whose name was Â Elea zar a man of an ill temper and delighting in seditious practices This man said Since thou desirest to know the truth if thou wilt be righteous in earnest lay down thy high priesthood and content thyself with the civil government of the people And when he de sired to know for what cause he ought to lay down the high priesthood the other replied We have heard it from old men that thy mother had been a captive under the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes This story was false and both Hyrcanus and all the Pharisees had a very great indignation against him Now there was one Jonathan a great friend of Hyrcanus s but of the sect of the Saddu cees whose notions are quite contrary to those of the Pharisees He told Hyrcanus that Eleazar had cast such a reproach upon  Book XII chap 9 t We may observe here that this and nine more of Josephus s citations out of Strabo are not now extant nay that no more than one of his ten citations out of him are now extant which is that taken out of his geography The occasion is evident that though Strabo s geography be extant yet are all his historical writings lost See Fabricius on Strabo Biblioth Graec IV 1 7 I The origin of the Sadducees as a considerable party among the Jews being contained in this and the two fol lowing sections take Dean Prideaux s note upon this their first public appearance which I suppose to be true Hyrcanus says he went over to the party of the Sadducees that is by embracing their doctrine against the traditions of the elders added to the written law and made of equal authority with it but not their doctrine against the resurrection and a future state For this can not be supposed of so good and righteous a man as John Hyrcanus is said to be It is most probable that at this time the Sadducees had gone no farther in the doctrines of that sect than to deny all their unwritten traditions which the Pharisees were so fond of For Josephus mentions no other difference at this time between them neither doth he say that Hyrcanus went over to the Sad ducees in any other particular than in the abolishing of all the traditionary constitutions of the Pharisees which our Saviour condemned as well as they II Chap 5 Â This slander that arose from a Pharisee has been preserved by their successors the Rabbins to these latter ages For Dr Hudson assures us that David Ganz in his Chronology S Pr page 77 in Vorstius s version re lates that Hyrcanus s mother was taken captive in mount Modiith Sec chap 13 and Reland in Palaestin page 901  In what sense the Sadducees denied the existence of angels it is difficult to determine since they certainly acknowledge the authority of the Pentateuch Some pretend that they accounted the invention of angels but a novel thing and that their very name was never heard of until the return from the captivity and therefore they rejected them whilst others suppose that they looked upon them as the inseparable powers of God which like the rays of the sun without being parted from that planet shine and shed their influence here below But now considering that the Sadducees received the five books of Moses they could hardly entertain any such notions as these As therein they read of frequent appa ritions of angels they could not fancy them a new inven tion of Rabbins that had returned from the captivity As they saw in these books that they properly came down from heaven upon earth they could not imagine that they were beings inseparable from the Deity and therefore we may suppose that they rather looked upon them only as so many phantasms and that as the bodies which these angels put on had perhaps only the appear ance of human bodies the same notion they might have of the spirits which animated them because every thing except God in their opinion was material Basnage s History of the Jews lib 1 c 6 Mr Basnage though he allows the question to be difficult seems to be of a contrary 482 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him according to the common sentiments of all the Pharisees and that this would be made manifest if he would but ask them the question what punishment they thought this man merited For that he might depend upon it that the reproach was not laid on him with their approbation if they were for punishing him as his crime deserved So the Pharisees made answer that he deserved stripes and bonds but that it did not seem right to punish reproaches with death And indeed the Pharisees even upon other occa sions are not apt to be severe in punish ments At this gentle sentence Hyrcanus was very angry and thought that this man reproached him by their approbation It was this Jonathan who chiefly irritated him and influenced him so far that he made him leave the party of the Pharisees and abolish the decrees they had imposed on the peo ple and to punish those that observed them From this source arose that hatred which he and his sons met with from the multitude But of these matters we shall speak here after What I would now explain is this that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by suc cession from their fathers which are not written in the laws of Moses and for that reason it is that the sect of the Sadducees opinion 1st Because the Sadducees taught and prayed in the temple where the prophets and other holy writers were read as appears from the example of Christ who explained a passage out of Isaiah 2dly Because Jose phiis who ought to have been well acquainted with the principles of his sect relates of them lib VI c 9 that they received what was written And 3dly Because the Pharisees in their disputes with them about the doctrine of the resurrection quote not only the writings of Moses but those of the prophets likewise and other hagiogra phers whose authority the others do not deny but only endeavour to elude the force of the passages that are hence produced against them Upon the whole there fore Scaliger Elench Trihser c 16 is of opinion that these Sadducees did not absolutely reject all the sacred writings but rather looked upon them as books composed by holy men whose memoirs they reverenced though they could not believe them of the like authority with the law of Moses which to them was the only rule of faith But notwithstanding this the account which is j iven us in the Gospel says the learned Prideaux of the disputation which Christ had with the Sadducees plainly proves the contrary For seeing there are so many texts in the prophets and hagiographa which plainly and directly prove a future state and the resurrection from the dead no other reason can be given why Christ waved all these proofs and drew his argument only by consequence from what is said in the law but that he knew that the Sadducees had rejected the prophets and the hagiographa and therefore would admit of no argu ments but from the law only Anno 107 B  The Pharisees were so called from the Hebrew word Pharas which signifies to separate because the prevail ing passion or rather ambition of this sect was to dis tinguish and separate itself from the rest of the people by a greater degree of holiness and piety but accom panied with very much affectation and abundance of vain observances Vide Lamifs Introduction and Prideaux s Connection At what time this sect began first to ap pear is no easy matter to determine Josephus makes mention of them in the government of Jonathan a hun dred and forty years before Christ as a very powerful body of men at that time nor is it improbable that their origin was somewhat earlier and that as soon as the Sadducees discovered their principles to the world these men of different sentiments might not long after rise up in opposition to them for it is evident from the character which the Jewish historian gives of them that in the main articles of their belief they were entirely repugnant to the Sadducees Joseph de Bella Jvd lib II c 12 The Pharisees believe in a fate says he and attribute all things to it but nevertheless they acknow ledge the freedom of man but how they made these two apparent incompatibles consist together is no where sufficiently explained They teach that God will one day judge the world and punish or reward men accord ing to their merits They maintain that souls are im mortal and that in the other world soine will be shut up in an eternal prison and others sent back again but with this difference that those of good men shall enter into the bodies of men those of wicked men into the bodies of beasts which exactly agrees with the famous transmigration of Pythagoras Their adherence to the law was so exact that for fear of violating the least pre cept of it they scrupulously observed every thing that had the least relation to it even though the law had nei ther commanded nor forbidden them Their zeal for the traditions of the elders was such that they derived tbem from the same fountain with the written word itself pre tending that Moses received both of them from God on mount Sinai and therefore ascribing an equal authority to both They had a notion that good works were me ritorious and therefore they invented a great number of supererogatory ones upon which they valued themselves more than upon a due observance of the law itself Their frequent washings and ablutions Matt vi 5 c their long prayers in public places Luke vii 39 their nice avoidance of reputed sinners their fasting and great ab stinence their penance and mortification their minute payment of tithes their strict observance of the Sabbath and ostentatious enlargement of phylacteries were all works of this kind which nevertheless gained them such esteem and veneration that while the common people loved the great ones dreaded them so that their power and authority in the state was considerable though gene rally attended with pernicious consequences because their hearts were evil for notwithstanding their shew oi mighty zeal and great austerity they were in reality no better than what our Saviour calls them vain and osten tatious spiteful and malicious griping and voracious lovers of themselves only and despisers of others inso much that it was hard to say which was most predomi nant in them their insatiable avarice their insupportable pride or abominable hypocrisy B AN 107 483 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS reject them and say that we are to esteem those observances to be obligatory which are in the written word but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers And concerning these things it is that great disputes and differences have arisen among them The Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich and have not the populace obsequious to them but the Pharisees have the multitude on their side But about these two sects and that of the Essenes I have treated accurately in the second book of Jewish affairs After Hyrcanus had put an end to this se dition he lived happily and administered the government in the best manner for tthirty one years and then Jdied leaving behind him five sons He was esteemed by God worthy of three of the greatest privileges the government of his nation the dignity of the high priesthood and prophecy For God was with him and enabled him to know fu turities and to foretel this in particular that as to his two eldest sons he foretold that they would not long continue in the government of public affairs Their unhappy catastrophe will be worth our description that we may thence learn how much they were inferior to their father s happiness CHAP XI OF THE SUCCESSION OF ARISTOBULUS TO THE GOVERN MENT J HIS ASSUMPTION OF REGAL HONOURS HIS CRU ELTY TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS BRETHREN AND HIS MISERABLE DEATH WHEN Hyrcanus was dead his eldest son Aristobulus intending to change the government into a kingdom first of all put a diadem upon his head four hundred and eighty one years and three months after the people had been delivered from the Ba bylonish slavery and were returned to their own country again This Aristobulus loved his next brother Antigonus and treated him as his equal but the others he held in bonds He also cast his mother into prison because she disputed the government with him for Hyrcanus had left her to be mistress of all He even proceeded to that degree of barba rity as to starve her to death in prison Nay he was alienated from his brother Antigonus by calumnies and added him to the rest whom he slew yet he seemed to have an affection for him and made him above the rest a part ner with him in the kingdom Those calum nies he at first did not give credit to partly because he loved him and so did not give heed to what was said against him and partly because he thought the reproaches were de rived from the envy of the relators But when Antigonus was once returned from the army and the feast of tabernacles was at hand it happened that Aristobulus was fallen sick and that Antigonus went up most splendidly adorned and with his soldiers about him in their armour to the temple to celebrate the feast and to offer up prayers for the recovery of his brother Now some wicked persons who had a great mind to raise a difference between the brethren made use of this op portunity of the pompous appearance of An tigonus and of the great actions which he had done and went to the king and spite fully aggravated his pompous shew at the feast and pretended that all these circum stances were not like those of a private per son that these actions were indications of an affectation of royal authority and that  See Of the War Book II chap 8 t From an 136 to an 107 B C J Here

Aristobulus This is in perfect agreement with Josephus excepting hat Strabo omits the first king Aristobulus who reigning but a single year seems hardly to have come to his knowledge Nor indeed does Aristobulus the son of Alexander pretend that the name of king was taken be fore his father Alexander took it himself XIV 3 See also chap 12 which favour Strabo also Also indeed if we may judge from the very different characters of thq Egyptian Jews under high priests and of the Palestine Jews under kings in the two next centuries we may well suppose that the divine Shechinah was removed into Egypt and that the worshippers at the temple of Oniai were better men than those at the temple of Jerusalem 4H  484 book xm ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS his coming with a strong body of men must be with an intention to kill him and that his way of reasoning was this that it was a silly thing in him while it was in his power to reign himself to look upon it as a great fa vour that he was honoured with a lower dig nity by his brother Aristobulus yielded to these imputations but took care both that his brother should not suspect him and that he himself might not run the hazard of his own safety so he ordered his guards to lie in a certain place that was under ground and dark he him self then lying sick in the tower which was called Antonia and he commanded them that in case Antigonus came in to

plot against Anti gonus persuaded the messenger to tell him the direct contrary how his brother had heard that he had made himself a fine suit of armour for war and desired him to come to him in that armour that he might see how fine it was So Antigonus suspecting no treachery but depending on the good will of his brother came to Aristobulus arm ed as he used to be with his entire armour in order to shew it to him But when he was come at a place which was called Strato s tower where the passage happened to be exceeding dark the guards slew him This catastrophe of his demonstrates that nothing is stronger than envy and calumny and that nothing does more certainly divide the good will and natural affections of men than those passions But here one may take occasion to wonder at one Judas who was of the sect of the Essenes and who never missed the truth in his predictions For this man when he saw Antigonus passing by the temple cried out to his companions and friends who abode with him as his scholars in order to learn the art of foretelling things to come It would be good for me to die now since Antigonus is still alive and I see him passing by although I foretold he should die at the  Hence we learn that the Essenes pretended to have rules whereby men might foretell things to come and that this Judas the Essene taught those rules to his icholars But whether their pretences were of an as place called Strato s Tower this very day while yet the place is six hundred furlongs off where 1 predicted he should be slain and a great part of the day is already past so that I I am in danger of proving a false prophet As he was saying this in a melancholy tone the news came that Antigonus was slain in a place under ground which was also called Strato s Tower or of the same name with that Cesarea which is seated at the sea But Aristobulus repented immediately of this slaughter of his brother on which ac count his disease increased upon him and he was disturbed in his mind upon the guilt of such wickedness insomuch that his entrails were corrupted by his intolerable pain and he vomited blood At which time one of the servants that attended upon him and was carrying his blood away did by Divine Pro vidence as I suppose slip down and shed part of his blood at the very place where there were spots of Antigonus s blood still remaining And when there was a cry made by the spectators as if the servant had on purpose shed the blood in that place Aris tobulus heard it and inquired what the mat ter was And as they did not answer him he was the more earnest to know it being natural to men to suspect that what is thus concealed is very bad So upon his threat ening and forcing them to speak they at length told him the truth Hereupon he shed many tears in that disorder of mind which arose from his consciousness of what he had done and gave a deep groan and said 1 am not therefore 1 perceive to be concealed from God in the impious and horrid crimes I have been guilty of but a sudden punish ment is coming upon me for shedding the blood of my relations And now 0 thou most impudent body of mine how long wilt thou retain a soul that ought to die in order to appease the ghosts of my brother and mother Why dost thou not give it all up at once And why do I deliver up my blood drop by drop to those whom I have so wick edly murdered In uttering these last words he died having reigned one year He was called a lover of the Grecians and trological or magical nature which yet in such religious Jews who were utterly forbidden such arts is no way probable or to any Bath Col spoken of by the later Rabbins or otherwise I cannot tell See of the War U 8 ks 107 485 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS had conferred many benefits on his own country and made war against Iturea and added a great part of it to Judea and com pelled the inhabitants if they would continue in that country to be circumcised and to live according to the Jewish laws He was naturally a man of candour and of great modesty as Strabo bears witness in the name of Timagenes who says thus This man was a person of candour and very ser viceable to the Jews for he added to them a part of the nation of the Itureans and uni ted them by the bond of circumcision CHAP XII op Alexander s succession to the government his expedition against ptolemais and the war which ptolemy lathyrus made against him WHEN Aristobulus was dead his wife Salome who by the Greeks was called Alexandra liberated his brethren from prison for Aristobulus had kept them in bonds as we have said already and made Alexander Janneus king who was the supe rior in age and in moderation This child happened to be hated by his father as soon as he was born and was never permitted to come into his father s sight till he died The occasion of which hatred is thus report ed When Hyrcanus chiefly loved the two eldest of his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus God appeared to him in his sleep Of whom he inquired which of his sons should be his successor Upon God s representing to him the countenance of Alexander he was griev ed that he was to be the heir of all his goods and suffered him to be brought up in â Galilee However God did not deceive Hyrcanus for after the death of Aristobulus he took the kingdom and one of his breth ren who affected the kingdom he slew but the other who chose to live private he held in esteem When Alexander Janneus had settled the government in the manner that he judged best he made an expedition against Ptole mais And having overcome the men in bat tie he shut them up in the city and sat round about it and besieged it For of the maritime cities there remained only Ptolemais and Gaza to be conquered besides Strato s Tower and Dora which were held by the tyrant Zoilus Now while Antiochus fPhi lometor and Antiochus who was called Cy zicenus were making war against each other and destroying one another s armies the people of Ptolemais could have no assistance from them But when they were distressed with this siege Zoilus who possessed Strato s Tower and Dora and maintained a legion of soldiers and on occasion of the contest be tween the kings affected tyranny himself came and brought some small assistance to the people of Ptolemais Nor indeed had the kings such a friendship for them as that they should hope for any advantage from them Both those kings were in the case of wres tlers who finding themselves deficient in strength and yet being ashamed to yield put off the contest by lying still as long as they can The only hope they had remain ing was from the kings of Egypt and from Ptolemy Lathyrus who came to Cyprus when he was driven from the government of Egypt by Cleopatra his mother So the people of Ptolemais sent to this Ptolemy Lathyrus and desired him to come as a confederate to deliver them now they were in such dan ger out of the hands of Alexander And the ambassadors gave him hopes that if he would pass over into Syria he would have the people of Gaza on the side of those of Ptolemais and that Zoilus with the Sido nians and many others would assist them so that he was elevated at this and got his fleet ready as soon as possible In the mean time however Demetrius one that was of abilities to persuade men to do as he would have them and a leader of the populace made those of Ptolemais change their opinions and said to them that it was better to run the hazard of being subject to the Jews than to admit of evident slavery by delivering themselves up to a master and besides that to have not only a war at  The reason why Hyrcanus suffered not this son of his whom he did not love to come into Judea but or dered him to be brought up in Galilee is suggested by Dr Hudson that Galilee was not esteemed so happy and well cultivated a country as Judea See Matt xxvi 73 Job vii 52 Acts ii 7 Although another obvious reason occurs also that he was farther out of his sight in Galilee than he would have been in Judea t The same with Antiochus Grypus chap 10 4H2 486 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS firesent but to expect a much greater war rom Egypt For that Cleopatra would not overlook an army raised by Ptolemy for him self out of the neighbourhood but would come against them with a great army of their own and this because she was labour ing to eject her son out of Cyprus also that as for Ptolemy if he failed of his hopes he could still retire to Cyprus but that they would be left in the greatest danger possible Now Ptolemy although he had heard of the change that was made in the people of Pto lemais yet did he still go on with his voyage and came to the country called Sycamine and there set his army on shore This army including horse and foot consisted of about thirty thousand men with which he marched near to Ptolemais and there pitched his camp But when the people of Ptolemais neither received his ambassadors nor would hear what they had to say he was under great concern But when Zoilus and the people of Gaza came to him and desired his assistance be cause their country was laid waste by the Jews and by Alexander Alexander raised the siege for fear of Ptolemy And when he had drawn off his army into his own country he used a stratagem afterwards by privately inviting Cleopatra to come against Ptolemy but publicly pretending to desire a league of friendship and mutual assistance with him And promising to give him four hundred talents of silver he desired that by way of requital he would take off Zoilus the tyrant and give his country to the Jews Hereupon Ptolemy made such a league of friendship with Alexander and subdued Zoilus But when he afterward heard that he had privily sent to Cleopatra his mother he brake the league with him which yet he had confirmed with an oath and fell upon him and besieg ed Ptolemais because it would not receive him However leaving his generals with eome part of his forces to go on with the eiege ne went himself immediately with the rest to ravage Judea And when Alexander understood this to be Ptolemy s intention he also got together about fifty thousand sol diers out 01 his own country nay as some writers have said eighty thousand He then took his army and went to meet Ptolemy But Ptolemy fell upon Asochis a city of Galilee and took it by force on the sabbath day and there he took about ten thousand slaves and a great deal of other prey He then attempted to take Sepphoris a city not far from that which was destroyed but lost many of his men Yet did he then go to fight with Alexander who met him at the river Jordan near a certain place called Saphoth and pitched his camp near to the enemy He had however eight thousand in the first rank whom he styled fhecatontoma chi having shields of brass But Ptolemy s soldiers in other respects were inferior to those of Alexander and thereupon were the more fearful of running hazards But Phi lostephanus the camp master put great courage into them and ordered them to pass the river which was between their camps Nor did Alexander think fit to hin der their passage over it for he thought that if the enemy had once gotten the river on their back that he should the easier take them prisoners when they could not flee out of the battle When the engagement began the acts on both sides were alike and a great slaughter was made by both the ar mies But Alexander was superior till Philostephanus opportunely brought up the auxiliaries to help those that were giving way But as there were no auxiliaries to afford help to that part of the Jews that gave way it fell out that they fled and those near them did not assist them but fled along with them However Ptolemy s soldiers acted quite otherwise For they followed the Jews and killed them till at length those that slew them pursued after them when they had made them all run away and slew them so long that their weapons of iron were blunted and their hands quite tired with the slaughter For the report was that thirty thousand men were then slain Timagenes says they were fifty thou  From this and other occasional expressions dropped by Josephus we may learn that where the sacred books Â f the Jews were deficient he had several other histories then extant but now most of them lost which he faith fully followed in his own history Nor indeed have we any other records of those times relating to Judea that can be compared to these accounts of Josephus though when we do meet with authentic fragments of such ori ginal records they almost always confirm his history t Each able of himself to fight a hundred men AM 103 487 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sand As for the rest they were part of them taken captives and the other part ran away to their own country After this victory Ptolemy overran all the country and when night came on he abode in certain villages of Judea where he com manded his soldiers to strangle the women and children and to cut them in pieces and to cast them into boiling caldrons and then to devour their limbs as sacrifices This com mandment was given that such as fled from the battle and came to them might suppose their enemies were cannibals and might on that account be still more terrified at them upon such a sight And both Strabo and Nicolaus of Damascus affirm that they used these people after this manner Ptolemy also took Ptolemais by force CHAP XIII OF Alexander s expedition against ccelesyria his DESTRUCTION OF THE CITY GAZA AND OF MANY THOU SANDS OF JEWS THAT REBELLED AGAINST HIM ALSO CONCERNING ANTIOCHUS GRYPUS SELEUCUS ANTIOCHUS CYZICENUS ANTIOCHUS PIUS AND OTHERS WHEN Cleopatra saw that her son was grown great and laid Judea waste without disturbance and had gotten the city of Gaza under his power Bhe resolved no longer to overlook what he did when he was almost at her gates and she concluded that now he was so much stronger than before he would be very desirous of the dominion over the Egyptians But she immediately marched against him with a fleet at sea and an army oi foot at land and made fChelcias and Ana nias the Jews generals of her whole army while she sent the greatest part of her riches with her grandchildren and her testament to the people of JCos Cleopatra also ordered her son Alexander to sail with a great fleet to Phoenicia and when that country had re volted she came to Ptolemais and because the people of Ptolemais did not receive her she besieged the city But Ptolemy went out of Syria and hastened into Egypt supposing that he should find it destitute of an army and soon take it though he failed of his hopes At this time Chelcias one of Cleopatra s generals happened to die in Coslesyria as he was in pursuit of Ptolemy When Cleopatra heard of her son s attempt and that his Egyptian expedition did not suc ceed according to his expectations she sent thither part of her army and drove him out of that country So when he was returned out of Egypt he abode during the winter at Gaza In which time Cleopatra took the garrison that was in Ptolemais by siege as well as the city And when Alexander came to her he gave her presents and such marks of respect as were but proper since under the miseries he endured by Ptolemy he had no other refuge but her Now there were some of her friends who persuaded her to seize Alexander and to overrun and take possession of the country and not to sit still and see such a multitude of brave Jews sub ject to one man But Ananias s counsel was contrary to theirs who said that she would do an unjust action if she deprived a man that was her ally of that authority which belonged to him and this a man who is related to us For said he  I would not have thee igno rant of this that what injustice thou doest to him will make all that are Jews to be thy enemies This desire of Ananias s Cleopatra complied with and did no injury to Alexander but made a league of mutual assistance with him at Scythopolis a city of Coslesyria So when Alexander was delivered from the fear he was in of Ptolemy he presently made an expedition against Coelesyria He then took Gadara after a siege often months He took also Amathus a very strong fortress be longing to the inhabitants above Jordan where Theodorus the son of Zeno had his chief treasure and what he esteemed most precious This Zeno fell unexpectedly upon the Jews and slew ten thousand of them and seized upon Alexander s baggage Yet did not this misfortune terrify Alexander but he made an expedition upon the maritime parts of the country Raphia and Athedon the name of which king Herod afterward changed to Agrippias and took even that by force  An 103  The sons of Onias IV that high priest who built the temple in Egypt See Book XIII chap 3 and 10 J This city or island Cos is not that remote island in the Egean sea famous for the

Cleopatra and the Jews see XIV 7 II An 102 488 book XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS but when Alexander saw that Ptolemy was retired from Gaza to Cyprus and his mother Cleopatra was returned to Egypt he grew angry at the people of Gaza because they had invited Ptolemy to assist them and be sieged their city and ravaged their country But as Apollodorus the general of the army of Gaza fell upon the camp of the Jews by night with two thousand foreign and ten thousand of his own forces while the night lasted those of Gaza prevailed because the enemy were made to believe that it was Pto lemy who attacked them But when day came on and that mistake was corrected and the Jews knew the truth of the matter they came back again and fell upon those of Gaza and slew of them about a thousand But as those of Gaza stoutly resisted and would not yield for either their want of any thing nor for the great multitude that were slain for they would rather suffer any hardship what ever than come under the power of their ene mies Aretas king of the Arabians a person then very illustrious encouraged them to go on with alacrity and promised them that he would come to their assistance But it hap pened that before he came Apollodorus was slain for his brother Lysimachus envying him for the great reputation he had gained among the citizens slew him and got the army together and delivered upf the city When Alexander came in at first he lay quiet but afterward set his army upon the inhabitants of Gaza and gave them leave to punish them So some went one way and some another and slew the inhabitants of Gaza Yet were not they of cowardly hearts but opposed those that came to slay them and slew as many of the Jews and some of them when they saw themselves deserted burnt their own nouses that the enemy might get none of their spoils Nay some of them with their own hands slew their wives and children having no other way of avoiding slavery But the senators who were in all five hundred fled to Apollo s temple for this at tack happened to be made as they were sit ting whom Alexander slew and when he had utterly overthrown their city he returned to Jerusalem having spent a year in that siege About this time JAntiochus Grypus died His death was caused by Heracleon s trea chery when he had lived forty five years and had reigned twenty nine His eon Se leucus succeeded him in the kingdom and made war with Antiochus his father s bro ther who was called Antiochus Cyzicenus and defeated him and took him prisoner and slew him But after a while Â Antiochus the son of Cyzicenus who was called Pius came to Aradus and put the diadem on his own head and made war with Seleucus and drove him out of all Syria But when he fled out of Syria he came to Mopsuestia again and levied money upon them But when Antio chus the son of Cyzicenus was king of Syria Antiochus the brother of Seleucus made war upon him and was overcome and de stroyed he and his army After him his bro ther Philip put on the diadem and reigned over some part of Syria But Ptolemy Lathy rus sent for his fourth brother Demetrius who was called Eucerus from Cnidus and made him king of Damascus Both these brothers did Antiochus vehemently oppose but presently died For when he was come as an auxiliary to ffLaodice JJ queen of the Gileadites when she was making war against the Parthians and he was fighting coura

Syriac page 132 here cited by Spanheim II Porphyry says that this Antiochus Grypus reigned but 26 years as Dr Hudson observes Â The copies of Josephus both Greek and Latin have here so grossly false a reading Antiochus and Antonius or Antonius Pius for Antiochus Pius that the editors are forced to correct the text from the other historians who all agree that this king s name was nothing more than Antiochus Pius  These two brothers Antiochus and Philippus are called twins by Porphyry the fourth brother was king of Damascus Both which are the observations of Span heim tt Or Laodicea of Gilead JJ This Laodicea was a city of Gilead beyond Jordan However Porphyry says that this Antiochus Pius did not die in this battle but running away was drowned in the river Orontes Appian says that he was deprived of the kingdom of Syria by Tigranes But Porphyry makes this Laodice queen of the Calamans All which is noted hy Spanheim In such confusion of the later historians we have no reason to prefer

going to sacrifice the nation rose upon him and pelted him with citrons which they then had in their hands because the law of the Jews required that at the feast of tabernacles every one should have branches of the palm and citron tree which things we have elsewhere related They also reviled him as tderived from a captive and so un worthy of his dignity and of sacrificing At this he was in a rage and slew about six thou sand of them He also built a partition wall of wood round the altar and the temple as far as that partition within which it was only lawful for the priests to enter J And by this means he obstructed the multitude from coming at him He also maintained foreigners of Pisidia and Cilicia For as to the Syrians he was at war with them and so made no use of them He also overcame the Arabians such as the Moabites and Gileadites and made them bring tribute Moreover he de molished Amathus while Theodorus durst not fight with him But as he had joined battle with Obedas king of the Arabians and fell into an ambush in places that were rug ged and difficult to be travelled over he was thrown down into a deep valley by the multitude of the camels at Gadara a village of Gilead and hardly escaped with his life From thence he fled to Jerusalem where be sides his other ill success the nation insulted him and he fought against them six years and slew no fewer than fifty thousand of them And when he desired that they would desist from their ill will to him they hated him so much the more on account of what had al ready happened And when he had asked them what he ought to do They all cried out that he ought to kill himself They also sent to Demetrius Eucerus and desired him to make a league of mutual defence with them CHAP XIV OF THE AFFAIRS OF DEMETRIUS EUCERUS AND ALEXANDER ALSO CONCERNING THE DEATH OF DEMETRIUS OW Demetrius came with an army and took those that invited him with him N  See Book III chap 10 t This reproach upon Alexander that he was sprung from a captive seems only the repetition of the Phari saical calumny upon bis father Chap 10 and pitched his camp near the city Shechem Upon which Alexander with his six thousand two hundred mercenaries and about twenty thousand Jews who were of his party went against Demetrius who had three thousand horsemen and forty thousand footmen Great exertions were made on both sides Deme trius trying to bring off the mercenaries that were with Alexander because they were Greeks and Alexander endeavouring to bring off the Jews that were with Demetrius How ever when neither of them could persuade them so to do they came to a battle in which all Alexander s mercenaries were killed when they had given demonstration of their fidelity and courage A great number of Demetrius s soldiers were slain also notwith standing he gained the victory Now as Alexander fled to the mountains six thousand of the Jews came together to him from Demetrius out of pity at the change of his fortunes Hereupon Demetrius retired out of the country after which the Jews fought against Alexander but being beaten they were slain in great numbers in the several battles which they had And when he had shut up the most powerful of them in the city Bethome he besieged them therein And when he had taken the city and gotten the men into his power he brought them to Jeru salem and committed a most barbarous ac tion For as he was feasting with his concu bines in the sight of all the city he caused about eight hundred of them to be crucified and while they were living he ordered the throats of their wives and children to be cut before their eyes This inhuman punishment was indeed by way of revenge for the injuries they had done him for he had by their means come to the last degree of hazard both of his life and of his kingdom while they were not satisfied by themselves only to fight against him but introduced foreigners also for the same purpose Nay at length they reduced him to that degree of necessity that he was compelled to deliver back to the king of Arabia the land of Moab and Gilead which he had subdued and the places that were in them that they might not join with J An 91 II This Theodorus was the son of Zeno and was in possession of Amathus 490 BOOK XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them in the war against him as they had done ten thousand other things that tended to affront and reproach him However this barbarity seems to have been without anjr necessity and in consequence of it he bore the name of a Thracian among the Jews The soldiers that had fought_ against him being about eight thousand in number now ran away by night while Alexander being now freed from any farther disturbance from them reigned the rest of his time in the utmost tranquillity When Demetrius was departed out of Ju dea he went to Berea and besieged his bro ther Philip having with him ten thousand footmen and a thousand horsemen How ever Strato the tyrant of Berea the confede rate of Philip called in Zizon the ruler of the Arabian tribes and Mithridates Sinax the ruler of the Parthians who coming with a great number of forces and besieging De metrius in his encampment into which they had driven him with their arrows com pelled those that were with him by thirst to deliver up themselves So they took a great many spoils out of the country and Deme trius himself whom they sent to Mithridates who was then king of Parthia But as to those whom they took captives of the people of Antioch they restored them to the Antio chians without any reward Now Mithri dates the king of Parthia had Demetrius in great honour till Demetrius ended his life by sickness So Philip presently after the battle was over came to Antioch and took it and reigned over Syria CHAP XV OF THE EXPEDITIONS OF ANTIOCHUS CALLED DIONYSIUS AND OF ARETAS AGAINST JUDEA â AND OF THE CON QUESTS AND DEATH OF ALEXANDER AFTER this Antiochus who was called tDionysius and was Philip s brother aspired to the dominion and came to Damas cus and got the supreme power into his hands But as he was making war against the Ara bians his brother Philip heard of it and came to Damascus where Milesius who had been left governor of the citadel and the Damas cenes themselves delivered up the city to him Yet because Philip was become ungrateful and had bestowed upon him nothing of that in hopes whereof he had received him into the city but had a mind to have it believed that it was rather delivered up out of fear than by the kindness of Milesius and because he had not rewarded him as he ought to have done he became suspected by him and so he was obliged to leave Damascus again For Mile sius caught him marching out into the JHip Bodrome and shut him up in it and kept â amascus for Antiochus Eucerus who hear ing how Philip s affairs stood came back out of Arabia He also made an expedition against Judea with eight thousand armed footmen and eight hundred horsemen So Alexander out of fear of his coming dug a deep ditch beginning at Chabarzaba which is now called Antipatris to the sea of Joppa on which part only his army could be brought against him He also raised a wall and erected wooden towers with intermediate redoubts for a hundred and fifty furlongs in length and there expected the coming of Antiochus But he soon burnt them all and made his army pass by that way into Arabia The Arabian king Aretas at first retreated but afterward appeared suddenly with ten thousand horsemen Antiochus gave them the meeting and fought desperately but when he had gained the victory and was bringing some auxiliaries to that part of his army that was in distress he was slain When Antiochus was fallen his army fled to the village Cana where the greatest part of them perished by famine After him Aretas reigned over Coelesyria being called to the government by those that held Damascus by reason of the hatred they bore to Ptolemy Menneus He also made thence an expedition against Judea and defeated Alexander near a place called  This name Thracida which the Jews gave Alexan der must by the coherence denote as barbarous as a Thracian or somewhat like it But what it properly signifies is not known t Spanheim takes notice that this Antiochus Dionysius the brother of Philip and of Demetrius Eucerus and of two others was the fifth son of Antiochus Grypus and that he is styled on the coins Antiochus Epiphanes Dionysius J The

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Adida yet did he upon certain conditions retire out of Judea But Alexander marchcd again to the tcity Dios and took it and then made an expedition against Es3a where was the best part of Zeno s treasures and there he encom passed the place with three walls And when he had taken the city he marched to Golan and Seleucia And when he had reduced them he took that valley which is called the valley of Antiochus as also the fortress Ga mala He also accused Demetrius who was governor of those places of many crimes and turned him out And after he had spent three years in this war he returned to his own country when the Jews joyfully re ceived him upon this his good success At this time the Jews were in possession of the following cities that had belonged to the Syrians Idumeans and Phoenicians At the sea side Strato s Tower A po I Ionia Joppa Jamnia Ashdod Gaza Anthedon Raphia and Rhinocolura In the middle of the country near to Idumea Adera and Ma rissa near the country of Samaria mount Carmel and mount Tabor Scythopolis and Gadara Of the country of Gaulonitis Se leucia and Gabala In the country of Moab Heshbon and Medaba Lemba and Oronas Gelithon Zara the valley of the Cilices and Pella The last of these they utterly de stroyed because its inhabitants would not bear to Jchange their religious rites for those peculiar to the Jews The Jews also pos sessed others of the principal cities of Syria which had been destroyed After this king Alexander although he fell into a distemper by hard drinking and had a quartan ague which held him three years yet would not leave off going out with his army till he was quite exhausted with the labours he had undergone and died in the bounds of Ragaba a fortress beyond Jor dan But when his queen saw that he was and at Damascus as we learn from Josephus in many places and from St Paul 2 Cor xi 32 See the Note on XVI 9  An 84 B C t See Book XIV chap 1 j We may here take notice that whatever

they should be left in and said to him To whom dost thou thus leave me and my children who are destitute of all other supports and this when thou knowest how much ill will thy nation bears thee He replied that she need but follow what he would suggest to her in order to retain the kingdom securely with her children That she should conceal his death from the soldiers till she should have taken that place that after this she should go in triumph as upon a victory to Jerusalem and put some of her authority into the hands of the Phari sees for that they would commend her for the honour she had done them and would reconcile the nation to her For he told her that they had great authority among the Jews both to do hurt to such as they hated and to bring advantages to those to whom they were friendly disposed For that they are then believed best of all by the multitude when they speak any severe thing against others though it be only out of envy at them And he said that it was by their means that he had incurred the displeasure of the nation whom indeed he had injured Do thou therefore said he when thou art come to Jerusalem send for the leading men among Ihem and shew them my body and with great appearance of sincerity give them leave to use it as they please whether they will dishonour me by refusing it burial as having severely suffered by my means or whether in their anger they will offer any other injury to that body Promise them also that thou wilt do nothing without them in the affairs of the kingdom If thou dost but act thus I shall have the honour of a more sumptuous funeral from them than thou couldest have made for me and when it is tants to leave their idolatry and to receive the law of Moses as proselytes of justice or else banished them into other

XVI OF ALEXANDRA S CONDUCT TOWARD THE PHARISEES HER GOVERNMENT AND DEATH ALEXANDRA having taken the fortress acted as her husband had suggested and spake to the Pharisees and put all things into their power both as to the dead body and as to the affairs of the kingdom and thereby pacified their anger against Alex ander and made them bear good will and friendship to him Accordingly they came among the multitude and laid before them the actions of Alexander and told them that they had lost a righteous king and by the commendations they gave him they brought them to grieve and to be in heaviness for him so that he had a funeral more splendid than had any of his predecessors Alexan der left behind him two sons Hyrcanus and Aristobulus but committed the kingdom to Alexandra Now as to these two sons Hyr canus was indeed unable to manage public affairs and delighted rather in quiet life But the younger Aristobulus was an active and a bold man And Alexandra was be loved by the multitude because she seemed displeased at the offences her husband had been guilty of So she made Hyrcanus high priest because he was the elder but more particularly be cause he cared not to meddle with politics and she permitted the Pharisees to do every thing requiring the multitude to be obedient   It seems by this dying advice of Alexander Janneus to his wife that he had himself pursued the measures of his father Hyrcanus and taken part with the Sadducees who closely adhered to the written law against the Pha risees who had introduced their own traditions see chap 16 and that he now saw a political necessity of submitting to the Pharisees and their traditions hereafter if his widow and family wished to retain their monarchi cal government or tyranny over the Jewish nation Which sect yet thus supported were at last in a great measure the ruin of the religion government and nation of the Jews and brought them into so wicked a state that the vengeance of God came upon them to their utter excision Just thus did Caiaphas politically advise the to them She also restored those practices which the Pharisees had introduced accord ing to the traditions of their forefathers and which her father in law Hyrcanus had abro gated so she had the name of the regent but the Pharisees had the authority For it was they who restored such as had been banished and set such as were prisoners at liberty and in short they differed nothing from lords The queen however took care of the affairs of the kingdom and got toge ther a great body of mercenary soldiers and increased her own army to such a degree that she became terrible to the neighbouring tyrants and took hostages of them And the country was entirely at peace excepting the Pharisees for they disturbed the queen and desired that she would kill those who persuaded Alexander to slay the eight hun dred men J After which they cut the throat of one of them named Diogenes and after him they did the same to several one after another till the men that were the most potent came into the palace and Aristobulus with them for he seemed to be displeased at what was done and it appeared openly that if he had an opportunity ne would not permit his mother to go on so These reminded the queen of the great dangers they had gone through and the great things they had done whereby they had demonstrated the firmness of their fidelity to their master insomuch that they had received the greatest marks of favour from him And they begged of her that she would not utterly blast their hopes as it now happened that when they had es caped the hazards that arose from their open enemies they were to be cut off at home by their private enemies like brute beasts without any assistance They said also that if their adversaries would be satisfied with those Jewish Sanhedrim John xi 50 That it was expe dient for them that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not And this in con sequence of their own political supposal verse 48 that If they let Jesus alone with his miracles all men would believe on him and the Romans would come and take away both their place and nation Which political cruÂ cifixion of Jesus of Nazareth brought down the vengeance of God upon them and occasioned those very Romans of whom they seemed so much afraid that to prevent it they put him to death actually to come

patiently on account of their natural love to their governors but if they must expect the same for the future also they implored of her a dismission from her service For they could not bear to think of attempting any method for their deliverance without her but would rather die wiHingly before the palace gate in case she would not forgive them And that it was a great shame both for themselves and for the queen that when they were neglected by her they should come under the lash of her husband s ene mies For that Aretas the Arabian king and the monarchs would give any reward if they could get such men as foreign aux iliaries to whom their very names might perhaps be terrible But if they could not obtain this their second request and if she had determined to prefer the Pharisees be fore them they still insisted that she would place them every one in her fortresses For that if some fatal demon had a constant spite against Alexander s house they would be willing to bear their part and to live in a private station there As these men spake thus and called upon Alexander s ghost for commiseration of those already slain and those in danger of death all the bystanders burst into tears But Aris tobulus chiefly manifested what were his sen timents and used many reproachful expres sions to his mother saying Nay indeed the case is this that they have been themselves the authors of their own calamities who have permitted a woman who against reason was mad with ambition to reign over them when there were sons in the flower of their age fit ter for it So Alexandra not knowing what to do with any decency committed the for tresses to them all but Hyrcania Alexan drium and Macherus where her principal treasures were After a little while also she Bent Aristobulus with an army to Damascus against Ptolemy who was called Menneus But he did nothing considerable there and so returned home About this time news was brought that Ti granes king of Armenia had made an irrup tion into Syria with five hundred thousand soldiers and was coming against Judea This intelligence as may well be supposed terrified the queen and the nation Accord ingly they sent ambassadors to him with many valuable presents as he was besieging Ptolemais For Selene who was also called Cleopatra ruled then over Syria having per suaded the inhabitants to exclude Tigranes So the Jewish ambassadors interceded with him and intreated him that he would deter mine nothing that was severe about their queen or nation He commended them for the respects they paid him at so great a dis tance and gave them good hopes of his fa vour But as soon as Ptolemais was taken news came to Tigranes that Lucullus in his pursuit of Mithridates could not overtake him for he had fled into Iberia and was laying fwaste Armenia and besieging its cities Now when Tigranes knew this he returned home After this when the queen was fallen into a dangerous distemper Aristobulus resolved to attempt seizing upon the government Accordingly he stole away secretly by night with only one of his servants and went to the fortresses wherein his friends that were such from the days of his father were settled For as he had been a great while displeased at his mother s conduct so he was now much more afraid lest upon her death their whole family should be under the power of the Phariseesi For he saw the inability of his brother who was to succeed her in the government Nor was any one conscious of what he was doing but only his wife whom he left at Jerusalem with their children He first of all came to Agaba where was Galestes one of the po tent men beforementioned and was received by him When it was day Alexandra per ceived that Aristobulus was fled and for some time she supposed that his departure was not in order to make any innovation But when messengers came one after another  See Of the War Book I chap 20 t The number of 600 000 or even 300 000 as one Greek copy with the Latin copies have it for

the second and all the places for as boon as one had begun they all submitted to his disposal but the queen and the nation were in the greatest disorder For they were aware that it would not be long ere Aristo bulus would be able to set himself firmly in the government what they were principally afraid of was this that he would inflict punish ment upon them from the mad treatment his house had had from them So they resolved to take his wife and children into custody and keep them in the fortress that was over the temple Now there was a great conflux of people that came to Aristobulus from all parts insomuch that he had a kind of royal attendance about him For in little more than fifteen days he got twenty two strong places which gave him the opportunity of raising an army from Libanus and Tra chonitis and the fmonarchs For men are easily led by the greater number and easily submit to them And besides this they sup posed that by affording him their assistance when he could not expect it as well as he should have the advantages that would come by his being king because they had been the occasion of his gaining the kingdom Now the elders of the Jews and Hyrcanus with them went unto the queen and de sired that she would give them her senti ments about the present posture of affairs For that Aristobulus was in effect lord of almost all the kingdom by possessing so many strong holds and that it was absurd for them to take any counsel of themselves how ill soever she were while she was alive and that the danger would be upon them in no long time But she bade them do what they thought proper to be done that they  This fortress castle citadel or tower whither the wife and children of Aristobulus were now sent and which overlooked the temple could be no other than what Hyrcanus I built XVIII 4 and Herod had many circumstances in their favour still remaining a nation in good heart an army and money in their several treasuries for that she had small concern about public affairs now when the strength of her body already failed her Now a little while after she had said this to them she died when she had reigned Jnine years and had lived seventy three A woman she was who shewed no signs of weakness in her sex for she was sagacious to the greatest degree in her ambition of governing and demonstrated by her doings at once that her mind was fit for action and that sometimes men themselves shew the lit tle understanding they have by the frequent mistakes they make in point of government For she always preferred the present to fu turity and preferred the power of an impe rious dominion above all things and in com parison of that had no regard to what was good or what was right However she brought the affairs of her house to such an unfortunate condition that she was the occa sion of the taking away that authority from it and that in no long time afterward which she had obtained by a vast number of haz ards and misfortunes and this out of a de sire of what does not belong to a woman and all by a compliance in her sentiments with those that bore ill will to their family and by leaving the administration destitute of a proper support of great men And indeed her management during her administration while she was alive was such as filled the palace after her death with calamities and disturbance However although this had been her way of governing she preserved the nation in peace And this is the conclu sion of the affairs of Alexandra the Great rebuilt and called the tower of Antonio XV 11 t See Of the War Book I chap 20 t From an

AND HYRCANU9 THEIR AGREEMENT RELATIVE TO THE KINGDOM AND THE SUB SEQUENT FLIGHT OF HYRCANUS WE have related the affairs of queen Alexandra and her death in the foregoing book and will now speak of what followed and was connected with those his tories declaring before we proceed that we have nothing so much at heart as to omit no facts either through ignorance or indolence For we are treating upon the his tory and explication of such things as the greatest part of our readers are unacquaint ed with because of their distance from our times and we aim to do it with a beauty of style so far as that is derived from proper words harmonically disposed and from such ornaments of speech as may contribute to the pleasure of our readers that they may entertain the knowledge of what we write with some degree of satisfaction and plea sure But the principal end that authors ought to aim at above all the rest is to speak accurately and to speak truly for the satisfaction of those that are otherwise unacquainted with such transactions and are obliged to believe what these writers inform them of Hyrcanus then began his high priesthood on the fthird year of the hundred and seventy seventh Olympiad when Quintus Horten sius and Quintus Metellus who was called Metellus of Crete were consuls at Rome when presently Aristobulus began to make war against him And as it came to a battle with Hyrcanus at Jericho many of his sol diers deserted him and went over to his bro ther Upon this Hyrcanus fled into the cita del where Aristobulus s wife and children were imprisoned by their mother as we have Jsaid already and attacked and overcame those adversaries that fled thither and lay within the walls of the temple So when he had sent a message to his brother about com promising the matters between them he laid aside his enmity to him on these conditions that Aristobulus should be king and that he should live without intermeddling with public affairs and quietly enjoy the estate he had acquired When they agreed upon these terms in the temple and had confirmed the agreement with oaths and the giving one another their right hands and embracing one another in the sight of the whole mul titude they departed Aristobulus to the palace and Hyrcanus as a private man to the former house of Aristobulus But there was a certain friend of Hyrca  Reland observes here very justly how Josephus s declaration that it was his great concern not only to write an agreeable accurate and a true history but also distinctly not to omit any thing of consequence either through ignorance or indolence implies that he could not consistently with that resolution omit the mention of no famous a person as Jesus Christ t Langius well observes that this beginning of Hyr canus s reign is rightly stated by Josephus and implies that he began before the middle of the 69th year be fore the Christian Era De Annis Christi II 18 page 336 J See Book XIII chap 16 II This is I think the first mention of confirming agree ments by giving each other the right hand in Josephus which however frequently occurs afterward 496 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS nus s an Idumean called Antipater who was very rich and in his nature an active and seditious man he was at enmity with Aristobulus and had differences with him on account of his good will to Hyrcanus Nicolaus of Damascus indeed says that Antipater was of the stock of the principal Jews who came out of Babylon into Judea But that assertion of his was to gratify Herod who was his son and who by certain revo lutions of fortune came afterward to be king of the Jews whose history we shall give you in its proper place hereafter How ever this Antipater was at first called An tipas and that was his father s name also Of whom they relate that king Alexander and his wife made him general of all Idumea and that he made a league of friendship with those Arabians Gazites and Ascalonites that were of his own party and had by many and large presents made them his fast friends But now this younger Antipater was suspicious of the powers of Aristobulus and was afraid of some mischief he might do him because of his hatred to him So he stirred up the most powerful of the Jews and talked against him to them privately and said it was unjust to overlook the con duct of Aristobulus who had assumed the government unrighteously and had ejected his brother who was the elder and ought to retain what belonged to him by the preroga tive of his birth And the same speeches he perpetually made to Hyrcanus and told him that his own life would be in danger unless he guarded himself and got rid of Aristobulus For he said that the friends of Aristobulus omitted no opportunity of ad vising him to kill him as being then and not before sure to retain his principality But Hyrcanus gave no credit to these words as being of a gentle disposition and one that did not easily admit of calumnies against other men This temper of his not dis posing him to meddle with public affairs occasioned him to appear to spectators to be degenerate and unmanly while Aristo bulus was of a contrary temper an active  That the famous Antipater s or Antipas s father was also Antipater or Antipas which two may justly be es teemed one and the same name the former with a Greek or Gentile the latter with a Hebrew or Jewish termina tion Josephus here assures us Though Eusebius indeed man and one of a great and generous soul Since therefore t Antipater saw that Hyrca nus did not attend to what he said he never ceased day by day to charge feigned crimes upon Aristobulus and to calumniate him before him as if he had a mind to kill him And so by urging him perpetually he per suaded him to flee to Aretas king of Arabia and promised that if he would comply with his advice he would also himself assist him and go with him When Hyrcanus heard this he said that it was for his advantage to flee away to Aretas However he sent An tipater first to the king of Arabia in order to receive assurances that when he should come in the manner of a supplicant to him he would not deliver him up to his enemies So Antipater having received such assurances returned to Jerusalem and took Hyrcanus and stole out of the city by night and con ducted him to the city called retra where the palace of Aretas was And as he was a very familiar friend of that king s he per suaded him to bring back Hyrcanus into Ju dea and this persuasion he continued every day without any remission He also pro posed to make him presents on that account At length he prevailed with Aretas in his suit Moreover Hyrcanus promised him that when he had been brought thither and had received his kingdom he would restore that country and those twelve cities which his father Alexander had taken from the Arabians viz Medaba Naballo Libias Tharabassa Agalla Athone Zoar Orone Marissa Rudda Lussa and Oruba CHAP II OF THE EXPEDITION OP ARETAS AND HYRCANUS AGAINST ARISTOBULUS THEIR INVESTMENT OF JERUSALEM J THE INTERFERENCE OF SCAURUS THE ROMAN GENERAL J AND THE DEATH OF ONIAS AFTER these promises had been given to Aretas he made an expedition against Aristobulus with an army of fifty thousand horse and foot and defeated him in battle Hist Eccl I 6 says it was Herod I am clearly of Dr Hudson s and Noldius s minds that we ought to follow Josephus rather than Eusebius in this matter See Nold de Vit and Gest Herod Â 1â 6 t An 65 in 65 497 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS And when after that victory many went over to Hyrcanus ass deserters Aristobulus was left desolate and fled to Jerusalem Hereupon the king of Arabia took all his army and made an assault on the temple and besieged Aristobulus therein the people still support ing Hyrcanus and assisting him in the siege while none but the priests continued with Aristobulus So Aretas united the forces of the Arabians and of the Jews together and pressed on the siege vigorously As this hap pened at the season when the feast of unlea vened bread was celebrated which we call the passover the principal men among the Jews left the country and fled into Egypt Now there was one whose name was Onias a righteous man and beloved of God who in a certain drought had prayed to God to put an end to the intense heat and whose prayers God had heard and had sent them rain This man had concealed himself be cause he saw that this sedition would last a great while However they brought him to the Jewish camp and desired that as by his prayers he had once put an end to the drought so he would in like manner make impreca tions on Aristobulus and those of his faction And when upon his refusal and the excuses that he made he was still by the multitude compelled to speak he stood up in the midst of them and said O God the king of the whole world since those that now stand with me are thy people and those that are be sieged are also thy priests I beseech thee that thou wilt neither hearken to the prayers of those against these nor bring to effect what these pray against those But as soon as he had made this prayer the wicked Jews who stood about him stoned him to death But God punished them immediately for this barbarity and took vengeance upon them for the murder of Onias in the following man ner While the priests and Aristobulus were besieged it happened that the feast called the passover was come At which it is our cus tom to offer a great number of sacrifices to God But those who were with Aristobulus wanted sacrifices and desired that their coun trymen without would furnish them with such sacrifices and assured them that they should have as much money for them as they should desire and when they required them to pay a thousand drachmae for each head of cattle Aristobulus and the priests willingly under took to pay for them accordingly And those within lowered down the money over the walls and gave it them But when the others had received it they did not deliver the sac rifices but arrived at that height of wicked ness as to break the assurances they had given and to be guilty of impiety towards God by not furnishing those that wanted them with sacrifices And when the priests found they had been cheated and that the agreements they had made were violated they prayed to God that he would avenge them on their countrymen Nor did he de lay that punishment but sent a strong and vehement storm of wind that destroyed the fruits of the whole country till a modius of wheat was sold for eleven drachmae In the mean time Pompey sent Scaurus into Syria while he was himself in Armenia and making war with Tigranes But when Scau rus was come to Damascus and found that Lollius and Metellus had newly taken the city he came himself hastily into Judea And when he was come thither ambassadors came to him both from Aristobulus and Hyrcanus and both desired he would assist them And when both of them promised to give him mo neyâ Aristobulus Hour hundred talents and Hyrcanus no less â he accepted of Aristobu lus s promise for he was rich and had a great soul and desired to obtain nothing but what was moderate Whereas the other was poor and tenacious and made incredible promises in hopes of greater advantages For it was not the same thing to take a city that was exceeding strong and powerful as it was to eject out of the country some fugitives with a greater number of Nabateans who were no very warlike people He therefore made an agreement with Aristobulus for the reasons beforementioned and took his money and raised the siege and ordered Aretas to de part or else he should be declared an enemy to the Romans So Scaurus returned to Da  This miraculous grant of rain in the time of dearth related here by Josephus on the prayers of this holy

POSSESSED A LITTLE afterward Pompey came to Damascus and marched over Coele syria At which time there came ambassa dors to him from all Syria and Egypt and out of Judea also For Aristobulus had sent him a great present which was a golden vine of the value of five hundred talents Now Strabo of Cappadocia mentions this present in these words There came also an ambassage out of Egypt and a crown of the value of four thousand pieces of gold And out of Judea there came another whe ther you call it a vine or a garden They called the thing Teg uXÂ i the delight How ever we ourselves saw that present deposit ed at Rome in the temple of Jupiter Capito linus with this inscription The giftf of Alexander king of the Jews It was valued at five hundred talents And the report is that Aristobulus the governor of the Jews sent it In a little time afterward came ambassa dors again to him Antipater from Hyrcanus and Nicodemus from Aristobulus which last also accused such as had taken bribes first Gabinius and then Scaurus the one three hundred talents and the other four hundred By which procedure he made these two his enemies besides those he had before And when Pompey had ordered those that had controversies one with another to come to him in the beginning of the spring he brought his army out of their winter quar ters and marched into their country of Da mascus And as he went along he demolished the citadel that was at Apamia which An tiochus Cyzicenus had built and took cog nizance of the country of Ptolemy Menneus a wicked man and not less so than Dionysius of Tripoli who had been beheaded who was also his relation by marriage Yet did he buy off the punishment of his crimes for a thousand talents with which money Pom pey paid his soldiers their wages He also conquered the place called Lysias of which Silas a Jew was tyrant And when he had passed over the cities of Heliepolis and Chalcis and got over the mountain which is on the limit of Coelesyria he came from Pella to Damascus And there he heard the causes of the Jew3 and of their governors Hyrcanus and Aristobulus who were at dif ference one with another as also of the na tion against them both which did not desire to be under regal government Because the form of government they received from their forefathers was that of subjection to the priests of that God whom they worshipped and they complained that though these two were the posterity of priests yet did they seek to change the government of their na tion to another form in order to enslave them Hyrcanus complained that although he was the elder brother he was deprived of the prerogative of his birth by Aristobu lus and held but a small part of the country under him Aristobulus having taken away the rest by force He also accused him that the incursions which had been made into their neighbours countries and the piracies that had been at sea were owing to him and that the nation would not have revolted unless Aristobulus had been a man given to  This golden vine or garden seen by Strabo at Rome has its inscription here as if it were the gift of Alexander the father of Aristobulus and not of Aristobulus himself to whom yet Josephus ascribes it and in order to prove the truth of that part of his history introduces this testi mony of Strabo s So that the ordinary copies seem to be here either erroneous or defective and the original read ing seerns to have been either Aristobulus instead of Alexander with one Greek copy or else Aristobulus the son of Alexander with the Latin copies which last seems to me the most probable For as to archbishop Usher s conjectures that Alexander made it and dedicated it to God in the temple and that thence Aristobulus took it and sent it to Pompey they are both very improbable and no way agreeable to Josephus who would hardly have avoided the recording both those uncommon points of history had he known any thing of them Nor would cither the Jewish nation or even Pompey himself then have approved such a flagrant instance of sacrilege See Dr Hudson s note here t Or of Aristobulus the son of Alexander AN 63 49ft ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS violence and disorder And there were no fewer than a thousand Jews of the best esteem among them who confirmed this ac cusation which confirmation was procured by Antipater But Aristobulus alledged against him that it was Hyrcanus s own tem per which was inactive and on that account contemptible which caused him to be de prived of the government and that for him self he was necessitated to take it upon him lest it should be transferred to others And that as to his title of king it was no other than what his father had taken before him He also called for witnesses of what he said some persons who were both young and in solent whose purple garments fine heads of hair and other ornaments were detested by the court and which they appeared in not as though they were to plead their cause in a court of justice but as if they were march ing in a pompous procession When Pompey had heard the causes of these two and had condemned Aristobulus for his violent procedure he spake civilly to them and dismissed them with an assurance that when he came again into their country he would settle all their affairs after he had first taken a view of the affairs of the Naba teans In the mean time he ordered them to be quiet and treated Aristobulus civilly lest he should make the nation revolt and hinder his return This however Aristobu lus did for without expecting any farther determination which Pompey had promised them he went to the city Delius and thence marched into Judea At this behaviour Pompey was angry and taking with him that army which he was leading against the Nabateans and the aux iliaries that came from Damascus and the other parts of Syria with the other Roman legions which he had with him he made an expedition against Aristobulus But as he passed by Pella and Scythopolis he came to Coreae which is the first entrance into Judea when one passes over the midland countries There he came to a most beau tiful fortress that was built on the top of the mountain called Alexandrium whither Aristobulus had fled and thence Pompey sent his commands to him that he should come to him Accordingly at the persuasions of many that he would not make war with the Romans he came down And when he had disputed with his brother about his rights to the government he went up again to the citadel as Pompey gave him leave to do And this he did two or three times flatter ing himself with the hopes of having the kingdom granted to him So that he still pretended he would obey Pompey in what soever he commanded although at the same time he retired to his fortress that he might not depress himself too low and that he might be prepared for a war in case it should rove as he feared that Pompey would trans fer the government to Hyrcanus But when Pompey enjoined Aristobulus to deliver up the fortresses he held and to send an injunc tion to their governors under his own hand for that purpose for they had been forbid den to deliver them up upon any other com mands he submitted to do so but still he retired in displeasure to Jerusalem and made preparation for war A little after this cer tain persons came out of Pontus and inform ed Pompey as he was on the way and con ducting his army against Aristobulus

promised to give him money and received him into Jerusalem and desired that he would leave off the war and do what he pleased peaceably So Pom pey upon his intreaty forgave him and sent Gabinius and soldiers with him to receive the money and the city Yet was no part of this performed but Gabinius came back being both excluded out of the city and re ceiving none of the money promised because Aristobulus s soldiers would not permit the agreements to be executed At this Pompey was very angry and put Aristobulus into prison and came himself to the city which was strong on every side excepting the north which was not so well fortified For there was fa broad deep ditch that encom passed the city and included within it the temple which was itself encompassed about with a very strong stone wall Now there was a sedition of the men that were within the city who did not agree what was to be done in their present circumstances Some thought it best to deliver up the city to Pompey but Aristobulus s party exhorted them to shut the gates because he was kept in prison Now these prevented the others and seized upon the temple and cut off the bridge which reached from it to the city and prepared themselves to sustain a siege But the others admitted Pompey s army and delivered up both the city and the king s palace to him So Pompey sent his lieutenant Piso with an army and placed garrisons both in the city and in the palace to secure them and fortified the house that joined to the temple and all those which were more distant and without it And in the first place he offered terms of accommodation to those within but when they would not comply with what was desired he encompassed all the places thereabout with a wall Hyrcanus gladly assisting him on all occasions But Pompey pitched his camp within the wall on the north part of the temple where it was most practicable But even on that side there were great towers and a ditch had been dug and a deep valley begirt it round about For on the parts towards the city were pre cipices and the bridge on what Pompey had gotten in was broken down however a bank was raised day by day with a great deal of labour while the Romans cut down materials for it from the places round about And when this bank was sufficiently raised and the ditch filled up though but poorly by reason of its immense depth he brought his mechanical engines and battering rams from Tyre and placing them on the bank he battered the temple with the stones that were thrown against it And had it not been our practice from the day of our forefathers to rest on the seventh days this bank could never have been completed by reason of the opposition the Jews would have made For though our law gives us leave then to defend ourselves against those that begin to fight with us and assault us yet does it not permit us to meddle with our enemies while they do any thing else When the Romans understood this matter on those days which we call sabbaths they threw nothing on the Jews nor came to any battle with them but raised up their earthen banks and brought their engines into such forwardness that they might do execution the next day And any one may hence learn how very great piety we exercise toward God and the observance of his laws since the priests were not at all hindered from their sacred ministrations by their fear during this siege but did still twice a day in the morning and about the ninth hour offer their sacrifices on the altars Nor did they omit  The fourth book of the Maccabees chap xxxvi says nothing of this submission of Aristobulus to the Ro man general but tells us that Pompey marched directly against Jerusalem where observing the situation of the place the strength of its walls tower c he resolved to try to gain Aristobulus by fair means that he invited him to come into his camp and promised him all the safety that he could desire that accordingly he came to him and engaged to deliver up all the treasure of the temple if he would but declare for him but that the or esis having refused to ratify the king s promise this made the general lay siege to the temple Universal History lib 2 c 1 r B t The particular depth and breadth of this ditch whence the stones for the wall about the temple were probably taken are omitted in our copies of Josephus but set down by Strabo XIV page 763 from whom we learn that this ditch is 60 feet deep and 250 feet broad However its depth is said by Josephus to be immense which exactly agrees with Strabo s description and the numbers in Strabo are a strong confirmation of the truth of Josephus s description also AN 62 501 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS those sacrifices if any melancholy accident happened by the stones that were thrown among them For although the city was ta ken on the third month on the day of the fast upon the hundred and seventy ninth Olympiad when Caius Antonius and Marcus Tullius Cicero were consuls and the enemy then fell upon them and cut the throats of those that were in the temple yet could not those that offered the sacrifices be compelled to run away neither by the fear they were in of their own lives nor by the number that were already slain As thinking it better to suffer whatever came upon them at their very altars than to omit any thing that their laws required of them And that this is not a mere boast or an encomium to manifest a degree of our piety that was false I appeal to those that have written of the acts of Pompey and among them to fStrabo and Nicolaus of Damascus and besides these to Titus Livius the writer of the Roman histo ry who all bear witness to this thing J But when the battering engine was brought near the greatest of the towers was shaken by it and fell down and brake down a part of the fortifications So the enemy poured in apace and Cornelius Faustus the son of Sylla with his soldiers first of all ascended the wall and next to him Furius the cen turion with those that followed on the other part while Fobius who was also a centu rion ascended it in the middle with a strong body of men after him And now all was full of slaughter some of the Jews being slain by the Romans and some by one an other Nay some there were who threw themselves down the precipices or set fire  That is on the 23d of Sivan the annual fast for the defection and idolatry of Jeroboam who made Israel to sin See Harm of the Evang page 152 153 Or pos sibly some other fast might fall in that month before and in the days of Josephus t To these testimonies of Strabo Nicolaus of Damas cus and Titus Livius Hudson and Spanheim desire us to add Tacitus Histor V 9 but that is for the taking of Jerusalem by Pompey only And since almost all that Tacitus knew in earnest about the Jews was by him di rectly taken out of Josephus it is not necessary that he should be often quoted as a distinct authority from him Only we may here observe by the way that our Josephus never quotes any Latin author but Titus Livius and him in this place only  It deserves here to be noted that this Pharisaical su perstitious notion that offensive fighting was unlawful to to their houses and burnt them as not able to bear the miseries they were under Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand but of the Romans very few Absalom who was at once both uncle and father in law to Aristo bulus was taken captive And no small enormities were committed about the temple which in former ages had been inaccessible and seen by none For Pompey went into it and not a few of those that were with him also and saw all which it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests There were in that temple the golden table the holy candlestick and the pouring vessels and a great quantity of spi ces and besides these there were among the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money Yet did Pompey touch nothing of all this on account of his regard to religion and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it and to bring what offerings the law required to God and re stored the high priesthood toHyrcanus both because he had been useful to him in other respects and because he hindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him He also cut off those that had been the authors of that war and bestowed proper rewards on Faustus and those others that mounted the wall with such alacrity and he made Jeru salem tributary to the Romans and took away those cities of Coelesyria which the in habitants of Judea had subdued and put them under the government of the Roman president and confined the whole nation Jews even under the utmost necessity on the Sabbath day of which we hear nothing before the times of the Maccabees was the proper occasion of Jerusalem s being taken by Pompey by Sosius and by Titus as appears from the places already quoted in the note on XIII 8 and partly by Ptolemy Logi also XI 1 which scrupulous superstition as to the observance of such a rigorous rest upon the Sabbath day our Saviour always opposed when the Pharisaical Jews insisted on it as is evident in many places in the New Testament Though he still intimated how pernicious that superstition might prove to them in their flight from the Romans Matt Xxiv 20 I This is fully confirmed by the testimony of Cicero who says in his oration for Flacus that Cneius Pompeius when he was conqueror and had taken Je rusalem did not touch any thing belonging to that temple 4K2 502 book xiv ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS which had elevated itself so high before within its own bounds Moreover he Re built Gadara which had been demolished a little before to gratify Demetrius of Gadara who was his freed man and restored the rest of the cities Hippos Scythopolis Pella Dios and Samaria as also Marissa Ashdod Jamnia and Arethusa to their own inhabit ants these were in the inland parts Besides those that had been demolished and also of the maritime cities Gaza Joppa Dora and Strato s Tower which last Herod re built after a glorious manner and adorned with havens and temples and changed its name to Caesarea All these Pompey left in a state of freedom and joined them to the province of Syria Now the occasions of this misery which came upon Jerusalem were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus by raising a sedition one against the other For now we lost our liberty t and became subject to the Romans and were deprived of that country which we had gained by our arms from the Syrians and were com pelled to restore it to them The Romans also exacted of us in a little time above ten thousand talents And the royal authority which was a dignity formerly bestowed on those that were high priests by the right of their family became the property of private men But of these matters we shall treat in their proper places Now Pompey committed Coelesyria as far as the river Euphrates and Egypt to Scaurus with two Roman legions and then went away to Cilicia and made haste to Rome He also carried with him Aristobulus and his children For he had two daughters and as many sons one of which ran away but the younger Antigonus w as carried to Rome together with his sisters CHAP V OF THE LEAGUE OF BTOTUAL ASSISTANCE WHICH SCAURUS MADE WITH ARETAS J AND WHAT GABINIUS DID IN JCDF A AFTER HE HAD CONQUERED ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS SCAURUS now made an expedition against Petra in Arabia and set on fire all the surrounding places because of the great difficulty of access to it And as his army was pinched by famine Antipater fur nished him with corn out of Judea and with whatever else he wanted and this at the com mand of Hyrcanus And when he was sent to Aretas as an ambassador by Scaurus be cause he had lived with him formerly he persuaded Aretas to give Scaurus a sum of money to prevent the burning of his country and undertook to be his surety for three hun dred talents So Scaurus upon these terms ceased to make war any longer which was done as much at Scaurus s desire as at the desire of Aretas Some time afterward when Alexander the son of Aristobulus made an incursion into Judea Gabinius came from Rome to Syria as commander of the Roman forces He did  Of the destruction of Gadara here presupposed and its restoration by Pompey see the note On the War I 7 Of this Demetrius of Gadara Pompey s freed man we have mention both by Seneca and Plutarch as Dr Hudson here notes and from the restitution of these cities an aera of the Greeks takes date in the Greek collections for Eusebius set down in Scaliger and was taken from the 179th Olympiad as Spanheim observes t Before this the government had been managed under the prince by two sorts of councils or courts of justice one consisting of twenty three persons called the Lesser Sanhedrim and the other of seventy two called the Greater Sanhedrim Of the first sort there was one in every city only in Jerusalem because of the greatness of the place there were two which sat apart from each other in two distinct rooms Of the latter sort there was only one in the whole land The Lesser Sanhedrim des patched all affairs of justice arising within the respective cities where they sat and the precincts belonging to them The Great Sanhedrim presided over the affairs of the whole nation received appeals from the Lesser Sanhedrims interpreted the laws and by new institutions from time to time regulated the execution of them All this Gabinius abolished and instead thereof erected five courts or Sanhedrims and invested them all with sovereign power independent of each other The first of them he placed at Jerusalem the second at Jericho the third at Gadara the fourth at Amathus and the fifth at Sepphoris and having under these five cities divided the land into five provinces he ordered the inhabitants of each to repair to the court which he had there erected and from which there was no appeal except it was to Rome Besides the two sorts of Sanhedrims abovementioned there was a third court among the Jews which was not affected by any of these alterations and that was the court of three insti tuted for the deciding all controversies about bargains sales contracts and all other such matters of common right between man and man In all which cases one of the litigants chose one judge and the other another and these two chose a third which three constituted a court to hear and ultimately determine the matter in contest Talmud in Sanhedrim Lightfoofs

not yet able to oppose his power but was already attempting to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem which Pompey had overthrown although the Romans who were there re strained him from that design However Alexander went over all the country round about and armed many of the Jews and sud denly assembled ten thousand armed footmen and fifteen hundred horsemen and fortified Alexandrium a fortress near to Coreae and Macherus near the mountains of Arabia Gabinius therefore came upon him having sent Marcus Antonius with other command ers before These armed such Romans as followed them and together with them such Jews as were subject to them whose leaders were Pitholaus and Malichus they also took with them their friends that were with Antipater and met Alexander while Gabinius himself followed with his legion Hereupon Alexander retired to the neigh bourhood of Jerusalem where they came to a pitched battle in which the Romans slew of their enemies about three thousand and took a like number alive At this time Gabinius came to Alexandrium and invited those that were in it to deliver it up on certain conditions promising that their former offences should be forgiven But as a great number of the enemy had pitched their camp before the fortress whom the Romans attacked Marcus Antonius fought bravely and slew a great number and seemed to come off with the greatest honour So Gabi nius left part of his army there in order to take the place and he himself went into other parts of Judea and gave order to re build all the cities that he met with that had been demolished At which time were re built Samaria Ashdod Scythopolis Anthe don Raphia Dora Marissa and Gaza and not a few others besides And as the men acted according to Gabinius s command it came to pass that at this time these cities were securely inhabited which had been desolate for a long time When Gabinius had done thus in the coun try he returned to Alexandrium and when he urged on the siege of the place Alexander sent an ambassage to him desiring that he would pardon his former offences he also delivered up the fortresses Hyrcania and Macherus and at last Alexandrium itself These fortresses Gabinius demolished But when Alexander s mother who was on the side of the Romans as having her husband and other children at Rome came to him he granted her whatsoever she asked And when he had settled matters with her he brought Hyrcanus to Jerusalem and com mitted the care of the temple to him And when he had ordained five councils he dis tributed the nation into the same number of parts So these councils governed the people the first was at Jerusalem the second at Gadara the third at Amathus the fourth at Jericho and the fifth at Sepphoris in Gali lee So the Jews were now freed from mo narchical authority and were governed by an aristocracy CHAP VI ARISTOBULUS ESCAPES FROM ROME INTO JUDEA BUT IS DEFEATED AND RETAKEN GABINIUS OVERCOMES ALEX ANDER AND THE NABATEANS IN BATTLE NOW Aristobulus ran away from Rome to Judea and set about the building of Alexandrium which had been recently demolished Hereupon Gabinius sent sol diers against him under the command of Si senna Antonius and Servilius in order to hinder him from getting possession of the country and to take him again And indeed many of the Jews ran to Aristobulus on ac count of his former glory as also they should be glad of an innovation Now there wa3 one Pitholaus a lieutenant at Jerusalem who deserted to him with a thousand men al though a great number of those that came to him were unarmed And when Aristobulus had resolved to go to Macherus he dismissed those people because they were unarmed so they could not be useful to him in what actions he was going about But he took with him eight thousand that were armed and marched on And as the Romans fell upon them severely the Jews fought stoutly  Dean Prideaux well observes that  Notwithstanding the clamour against Gabinius at Rome Josephus gives him a laudable character as if he had acquitted himself with honour in the charge committed to him in Judea At the year 65 Marg 504 book xiy ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS but were defeated in the battle and put to flight About five thousand were slain on this occasion and the rest being dispersed tried as well as they were able to save them selves However Arislobulus had with him still above a thousand men and with them he fled to Macherus and fortified the place and though he had had ill success he still had some hope of his affairs But when he had struggled against the siege for two days time and had received many wounds he was brought as a captive to Gabinius with his son Antigonus who also fled with him from Rome And this was the fortune of Aristo bulus who was sent back again to Rome and was there retained in bonds having been both king and high priest for three years and six months and was indeed an eminent person and one of a great soul However the senate let his children go upon Gabinius s writing to them that he promised their mother so much when she delivered up the fortresses to him And ac cordingly they returned into Judea Now when Gabinius was making an expc dition against the Parthians and had already passed over Euphrates he changed his mind and resolved to return into Egypt in order to restore Ptolemy to his kingdom Anti pater supplied his army which he sent against Archelaus with corn and weapons and money He also made those Jews who were above Pelusium his friends and confederates and had been the guardians of the passes that led into Egypt But when he came back out of Egypt he found Syria in disorder with seditions and troubles for Alexander the son of Aristobulus having seized on the go vernment a second time by force made many Jews revolt to him and so he marched over the country with a great army and slew all the Romans he could meet with and pro ceeded to besiege the mountain called Geriz zim whither they had retreated But when Gabinius found Syria in such a state he sent Anti pater who was a prudent man to those that were seditious to try whether he could cure them of their madness and persuade them to return to a better mind And when he came to them he in  This history is best illustrated by Dr Hudson out of Livy Epit cv who says that  A Gabinius the procon sul restored Ptolemy to his kingdom of Egypt and duced many of them to do what they ought But he could not restrain Alexander for he had an army of thirty thousand Jews and met Gabinius and joining battle with him was beaten and lost ten thousand of his men about mount Tabor So Gabinius settled the affairs which be longed to the city Jerusalem as was agree able to Antipater s inclination and went against the Nabateans and overcame them in battle He also sent away in a friendly manner Mithridates and Orsanes who were Parthian deserters and came to him though the report went abroad that they had run away from him And when Gabinius had performed great and glorious actions in his management of the affairs of war he returned to Rome and delivered the government to Crassus Now Nicolaus of Damascus and Strabo of Cappadocia both describe the ex peditions of rompey and Gabinius against the Jews while neither of them say any thing new which is not in the other CHAP VII OF THE PILLAGING OF THE TEMPLE BY CRASSUS PREVIOUS TO HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS IN WHICH HE PERISHED WITH HIS ARMY OF THE EXPLOITS OF CASSIUS AND OF THE DEATH OF ARISTOBULUS AND HIS SON ALEXANDER NOW fCrassus as he was going upon his expedition against the Parthians came upon Judea and carried off the money that was in the temple which Pompey had left being two thousand talents and was dis posed to spoil it of all the gold belonging to it which was eight thousand talents He also took a beam which was made of solid beaten gold of the weight of three hundred minse each of which weighed two pounds and a half It was the priest who was guar dian of the sacred treasures and whose name was Eleazar that gave him this beam not out of a wicked design for he was a good and a righteous man but being intrusted with the custody of the veils belonging to the temple which were of admirable beauty and of very costly workmanship and hung clown from this beam when he saw that Crassus ejected Archelaus whom they had set up for king fee See Prideaux at the years 64 and 65 t An 54 B C ah 54 505 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS was busy in gathering money and was in fear for the entire ornaments of the temple he gave him this beam of gold as a ransom for the whole but not till he had given his oath that he would remove nothing else out of the temple but be satisfied with this only which he should give him being worth many thousand shekels Now this beam was con tained in a wooden beam that was hollow but was known to no others but Eleazar alone Yet did Crassus take away this beam upon the condition of touching nothing else that belonged to the temple and then brake his oath and carried away all the gold that was in the temple And let no one wonder that there was so much wealth in our temple since all the Jews throughout the habitable earth and those that worshipped God nay even those of Asia and Europe sent their contributions to it and this from very ancient times Nor is the largeness of these sums without its at testation nor is that greatness owing to our vanity as raising it without ground to so great a height But there are many witnesses to it and particularly Strabo of Cappadocia who says thusâ Mithridates sent to Cos and took the money which queen Cleopatra had deposited there as also eight hundred talents belonging to the Jews Now we have no public money but what appertains to God And it is evident that the Asiatic Jews removed this money out of fear of Mithridates For it is not probable that those of Judea who had a strong city and temple should send their money to Cos Nor is it likely that the Jews who are inhabitants of Alexandriaf should do so neither since they were in no fear of Mithridates And Strabo himself bears witness to the same thing in another place and at the same time that Sylla passed over into Greece in order to fight against Mithridates he sent Lucullus to put an end to a sedition that our nation of whom the habitable earth is full had raised in Cyrene Where he speaks thus There were four classes of men among those of Cy rene that of citizens that of husbandmen  The proselytes t Spanheim here takes notice of a great deal of other evidence for the privileges the Jews had at the city Alex andria See his note on this place  Thia citation I suppose is wanting However see the third of strangers and the fourth of Jews Now these Jews are already gotten into all cities and it is difficult to find a place in the habitable earth that hath not admitted this tribe of men and is not possessed by it And it hath come to pass that Egypt and Cyrener as having the same governors and a great number of other nations imitate their way of living and maintain great bodies of these Jews in a peculiar manner and grow up to greater prosperity with them and make use of the same laws with that nation Accord ingly the Jews have places assigned them in Egypt wherein they inhabit besides what is peculiarly allotted to this nation at Alex andria which is a large part of that city There is also an ethnarch allowed them who governs the nation and distributes justice to them and takes care of their contracts and of the laws to them belonging as if he were the ruler of a free republic In Egypt there fore this nation is powerful because the Jews were originally Egyptians and because the land wherein they inhabit since they went thence is near to Egypt They also removed into Cyrene because that this land adjoined to the government of Egypt as well as does Judea or rather was formerly under the same government When Crassus had settled all things as he pleased he marched into Parthia where both himself and all his army perished as hath been Jrelated elsewhere But Cassiusy as he fled from Rome to Syria took posses sion of it and was an impediment to the Par thians who by their victory over Crassus made incursions upon it And as he cam back to Tyre he went up into Judea alsor and fell upon Taricheoe and presently took it and carried about thirty thousand Jews captives and slew Pitholaus who succeeded Anstobulus in his seditious practices and that by the persuasion of Antipater who proved to have great interest in him and was at that time in great repute with the Idu means also for he married a wife who was the daughter of one of their eminent men and her name was Cypros by whom he Of the War Book 1 chap 8 II Dr Hudson observes that the name of this wife of Antipater in Josephus was Cypres as a Hebrew termi nation but not Cypris the Greek name for Venus as some critics were induced to correct it 506 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS had four sons Phasael Herod who was af terward made king Joseph and Pheroras and a daughter named Salome This Anti pater cultivated also a friendship and mutual kindness with other potentates but espe cially with the king of Arabia to whom he committed his children while he fought against Aristobulus So Cassius removed his camp and marched to Euphrates to meet those that were coming to attack him as hath been related by others But some time afterward Caesar when he had taken Rome and after Pompey and the senate were fled beyond the Ionian Sea freed Aristobulus from his bonds and resolved to send him into Syria and delivered two legions to him that he might set matters right as be ing a potent man in that country But Aristo bulus had no enjoyment of what he hoped for from the power that was given him by Caesar for those of Pompey s party prevented it and destroyed him by poison And those of Caesar s party buried him His dead body also lay for a considerable time in honey till Antony afterward sent it to Judea and caused him to be buried in the royal sepulchre But Scipio upon Pompey s sending him to slay Alexander the son of Aristobulus because the young man was accused of what offences he had been guilty of at first against the Ro mans cut off his head And thus did he die at Antioch But Ptolemy the son of Menneus who was the ruler of Chalcis under mount Libanus took his brethren to him and sent his son Philippion to Ascalon to Aristobulus s wife and desired her to send back with him her son Antigonus and her daughters The one of which whose name was Alexandra Philippion fell in love with and married though afterward his father slew him and married Alexandra and continued to take care of her brethren CHAP VIII OF THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THE JEWS GAVE TO CESAR IK HIS BXPEDITION AGAINST EGYPT THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS OF ANTIPATER AND HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH CESAR AND THE HONOURS WHICH THE JEWS RECEIVED FROM THE ROMANS AND ATHENIANS OW after Pompey was dead f Antipater who managed the Jewish affairs became N  An 49 t An 48 very useful to Caesar when he made war against Egypt and that by the order of Hyr canus For when Mithridates of Pergamus was bringing his auxiliaries and was not able to continue his march through Pelusium but obliged to stay at Ascalon Antipater came to him conducting three thousand armed Jews He had also taken care the principal men of the Arabians should come to his assistance And on his account it was that all the Syrians assisted him also as not willing to appear behind hand in their alacrity for Caesar viz Jamblicus the ruler and Ptolemy his son and Tholomy the son of Sohemus who dwelt at mount Libanus and almost all the Jcities So Mithridates marched out of Syria and came to Pelusium And when its inhabitants would not admit him he besieged the city Now Antipater signalized himself here and was the first who plucked down a part of the wall and so opened a way to the rest whereby they might enter the city and by this means Pelusium was taken But it happened that the Egyptian Jews who dwelt in the country called Onion would not let Antipater and Mithridates with their soldiers pass to Caesar But Antipater persuaded them to come over to their party because he was of the same people with them and that chiefly by shewing them the epistles of Hyrcanus the high priest wherein he exhorted them to cultivate friend ship with Caesar And accordingly when they saw Antipater and the high priest of the same sentiments they did as they were desired And when the Jews about Memphis heard that these Jews had come over to Caesar they also invited Mithridates to come to them So he came and received them also into his army When Mithridates had gone over all the Delta as the place is called he came to a pitched battle with the enemy near a place called the Jewish camp Now Mithridates had the right wing and Antipater the left And when it came to an engagement that wing where Mithridates was gave way and was likely to suffer extremely unless Anti pater had come running to him with his own soldiers along the shore when he had al ready defeated the enemy that opposed him So he delivered Mithridates and put those Egyptians who had been too hard for him to I Free cities ah 48 507 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS flight He also took their camp and con tinued in the pursuit of them He then re called Mithridates who had been worsted and was retired a great way off Of whose soldiers eight hundred fell but of Antipater s fifty So Mithridates sent an account of this battle to Caesar and openly declared that Antipater was the author of this victory and of his own preservation Insomuch that Caesar commended Antipater and made use of him in all the rest of that war in the most hazard ous undertakings he happened also to be wounded in one of those engagements However when Caesar after some time had finished that war and was sailed away for Syria he honoured Antipater greatly and confirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood and bestowed on Antipater the privilege of a citizen of Rome and a freedom from taxes every where It is reported indeed by many that Hyrcanus went along with Antipater in this expedition and came himself into Egypt and Strabo of Cappadocia bears witness to this when he says thus in the name of Asi nius After Mithridates had invaded Egypt and with him Hyrcanus the high priest of the Jews The same Strabo says thus again in another place in the name of Hypsicrates that Mithridates at first went out alone but Antipater who had the care of the Jewish affairs was called by him to Ascalon and that he had three thousand soldiers ready to go along with him and encouraged other governors of the country to go along with him also and Hyrcanus the high priest was also present in this expedition But Antigonus the son of Aristobulus came at this time to Caesar and lamented his father s fate and complained that it was by Antipater s means that Aristobulus was taken off by poison and his brother was beheaded by Scipio and desired that he would take pity on him who had been ejected out of that principality which was due to him He also accused Hyrcanus and Antipater as governing the nation by violence and offering injuries to himself Antipater was present and made his defence as to the accusations that were laid against him He demonstrated that An tigonus and his party were given to innova tion and were seditious persons He also reminded Caesar of the difficulties and ser vices he had undergone when he assisted him in his wars and discoursed about what he was a witness of himself He added that Aristobulus was justly carried away to Rome as one that was an enemy to the Romans and could never be brought to be a friend to them and that his brother had no more than he deserved from Scipio as being seized in committing robberies And that this punish ment was not inflicted on him in a way of vio lence or injustice by him that did it When Antipater had made this speech Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest and gave Antipater what principality he should choose leaving the determination to himself So he made him procurator of Judea He also gave Hyrcanus leave to raise up the walls of his own city upon his asking that favour of him for they had been demolished by Pompey And this grant he sent to the consuls to Rome to be engraven in the capi tol The decree of the senate was as follows Lucius Valerius the son of Lucius the praetor referred this to the senate upon the ides of December in the temple of Concord There were present at the writing of this de cree Lucius Coponius the son of Lucius of the Colline tribe and Papirius of theQuirine tribe concerning the affairs which Alexander the son of Jason and Numenius the son of  Take Dr Hudson s note upon this place which I suppose to be the truth Here is some mistake in Jose phus For when he had promised us a decree for the restoration of Jerusalem he brings in a decree of far greater antiquity and that a league of friendship and union only One may easily believe that Josephus gave order for one thing and his amanuensis performed ano ther by transposing decrees that concerned the Hyrcani and as deluded by the sameness of their names For that belongs to the first high priest of this name John Hyrca nus which Josephus here ascribes to one that lived later SHyrcanus the son of Alexander Janneus However the ecree which he proposes to set down follows a little lower in the collection of Roman decrees that concerned VOL I â NOS 43  44 the Jews and is that dated when Caesar was consul the fifth time But when he finds at the beginning of this decree the ides of December and here at the end of the 9th of Hyrcanus and yet presently the month Panemus which answers to part of the Julian June and July it is clear these months December and Panemus are incon sistent Petitus therefore seems to be in the right when he separates Panemus from the former decree and refers it to the next that follows it which is certainly dated in that month and as esteeming both in the same year the 9th of Hyrcanus Though perhaps a word or two may have been dropped out of our copies that if extant would have made some conjecture more certain See Dean Prideaux at the year 27 4L 508 book xiy ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Antiochus and Alexander the son of Dosi theus ambassadors of the Jews good and worthy men proposed who came to renew that league of good will and friendship with the Romans which was in being before They also brought a shield of gold as a mark of confederacy valued at fifty thousand pieces of gold and desired that letters might be given them directed both to the free cities and to the kings that their country and their havens might be at peace and that no one among them might receive any injury It therefore pleased the senate to make a league of friendship and good will with them and to bestow on them whatsoever they stood in need of and to accept of the shield which was brought by them This was done in the ninth year of Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch in the month of Panemus Hyrcanus also received honours from the people of Athens as having been useful to them on many occasions And when they wrote to him they sent him the following decree â Under the Prutaneia and priesthood of Dionysius the son of Esculapius on the fifth day of the latter part of the month Panemus this decree of the Athenians was given to their commanders when Agathocles was archon and Eucles the son of Menander of Alimusia was the scribe In the fmonth Munychion on the eleventh day of the Pru taneia a council of the presidents was held in the theatre Dorotheus the high priest and the fellow presidents with him put it to the vote of the people and Dionysius the son of Dionysius gave the sentence Since Hyr canus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews continues to bear good will to our people in general and to every one of our citizens in particular and treats them with all sorts of kindness and when any of the Athenians come to him either as ambassadors or on any private occasion he receives them in an obliging manner and sees that they are conducted back in safety of which we have had several former testimo nies it is now decreed at the report of The odosius the son of Theodorus and upon his putting the people in mind of the virtue of this man and that his purpose is to do us all the good that is in his power to honour him with a crown of gold the usual reward according to the law and to erect his statue in brass in the temple of Demus and of the graces and that this present of a crown shall be pro claimed publicly in the theatre in the Dio nysian shows while the new tragedies are acting and in the Panathenean Eleusinian and Gymnical shows also and that the com manders shall take care while he continues in his friendship and preserves his good will to us to return all possible honour and favour to this man for his affection and generosity That by this treatment it may appear how our people receive the good kindly and re pay them a suitable reward and he may be induced to proceed in his affection towards us by the honours we have already paid him That ambassadors be also chosen out of all the Athenians who shall carry this decree to him and desire him to accept of the honours we do him and to endeavour always to be doing some good to our city And this shall suffice as to the honours that were paid by the Romans and the people of Athens to Hyrcanus CHAP IX ANTIPATER BESTOWS THE GOVERNMENT OF GALILEE OS HEROD AND THAT OF JERUSALEM ON PHASAELUS BUT HEROD UPON THE JEWS ENVY AT ANTIPATER IS AC CUSED BEFORE HYRCANUS NOWJ when Caesar had settled the af fairs of Syria he sailed away And as soon as Antipater had conducted him out of Syria he returned to Judea He then raised up the wall which had been thrown down by Pompey and by coming thither he pacified that tumult which had been in the country and this by both threatening and advising them to be quiet For he said if they were of Hyrcanus s side they would live happily and lead their lives without disturbance in the enjoyment of their own possessions but if they were addicted to the hopes of what might come by innovation and aimed to get wealth thereby they should have him a severe master instead of a gentle governor and Hyrcanus a tyrant instead of a king and the Romans together with Caesar their bitter  An 127 t Read here the first of Munychion and the 10th of the Prutaneia X An 44 AN 44 509 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS enemies instead of rulers For that they would never suffer him to be set aside whom they had appointed to govern And when Antipater had said this to them he settled the affairs of this country And seeing that Hyrcanus was of a slow and slothful temper he made Phasaelus his eldest son governor of Jerusalem and of the places adjacent but committed Galilee to Herod his next son who was then fifteen years of age That youth of his however was no impediment to him but as he pos sessed a great mind he presently met with an opportunity of signalizing his courage For finding that there was one Hezekias a cap tain of a band of robbers who overran the neighbouring parts of Syria he seized and slew him as well as a great number of the robbers that were with him By this action he acquired the love of the Syrians for when they were very desirous to have their country freed from this nest of robbers he purged it of them So they sang songs in his commen dation in their villages and cities as having procured them peace and the secure enjoy ment of their possessions And on this ac count it was that he became known to Sextus Caesar who was the relation of the great Caesar s and was now president of Syria Now Phasaelus Herod s brother was moved with emulation at his actions and envied the fame he had acquired and became ambitious not to be behind hand with him in deserving it So he made the inhabitants of Jerusalem bear him the greatest good will while he held the city himself but did neither manage its affairs improperly nor abuse his authority therein This conduct procured from the nation of Antipater such respect as is due to kings and such honours as he might partake of if he were absolute lord of the country Yet did not this splendour of his as frequently happens in the least diminish in him that kindness and fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus But now the principal men among the Jews when they saw Antipater and his sons to grow so much in the good will of the na tion and in the revenues which they received out of Judea and out of Hyrcanus s own wealth became ill disposed to him For in deed Antipater had contracted a friendship with the Roman emperors and when he had prevailed with Hyrcanus to send them money he took it to himself and purloined the pre sent intended and sent it as if it were his own and not Hyrcanus s gift to them Hyr canus heard of this management but took no care about it nay he was rather glad of it But the chief men of the Jews were in fear because they saw that Herod was a violent and bold man and very desirous of acting tyrannically So they came to Hyrcanus and accused Antipater openly and said to him How long wilt thou be quiet under such actions as are now done Or dost thou not see that Antipater and his sons have already seized upon the government and that it is  Take Reland s and Hudson s notes

a king which is given thee But do not thou suffer these things to be hidden from thee nor do not thou think to es cape danger by being so careless of thyself and of thy kingdom For Antipater and his sons are not now stewards of thine affairs do not thou deceive thyself with such a notion they are evidently absolute lords For Herod Antipater s son hath slain Hezekias and those that were with him and hath thereby trans gressed our law which hath forbidden to slay any man even though he were a wicked man unless he had been first condemned to suffer death by the Sanhedrim Yet hath he been so insolent as to do this without any authority from thee Upon Hyrcanus s hearing this he complied with them The mothers also of those that had been slain by Herod excited his indigna tion For these women continued every day in the temple persuading the king and the people that Herod might undergo a trial be fore the Sanhedrim for what he had done Hyrcanus was at length so moved by these complaints that he summoned Herod to take his trial for what was charged upon him And accordingly he came But his father had persuaded him to come not like a private man but with a guard for the security of his person and that when he had settled the af fairs of Galilee in the best manner he could for his own advantage he should come to his trial but still with a body of men sufficient for his security on his journey Yet so that he should not come with so great a force as might look like terrifying Hyrcanus but still such a one as might not expose him naked and unguarded to his enemies However Sextus Caesar president of Syria wrote to Hyrcanus desiring him to clear Herod and dismiss him at his trial and threatening him beforehand if he did not do it Which epis tle of his was the occasion of Hyrcanus s de livering Herod from suffering any harm from the Sanhedrim for he loved him as his own son But when Herod stood before the San hedrim with his body of men about him he affrighted them all and no one of his former accusers durst after that bring any charge against him But there was a deep silence and nobody knew what was to be done When affairs stood thus one whose name was tSameas a righteous man and for that reason above all fear rose up and said â O ye that are assessors with me and 0 thou that art our king I neither have ever myself known such a case nor do I suppose that any one of you can name its parallel that one who is called to take his trial by us ever stood in such a manner before us But every one whosoever he be that comes to be tried by this Sanhedrim presents himself in a sub missive manner and like one that is in fear of himself and that endeavours to move us to compassion with his hair dishevelled and in a black and mourning garment But this admirable man Herod who is accused of murder and called to answer so heavy an ac cusation stands here clothed in purple and with the hair of his head finely trimmed and with his armed men about him that if we shall condemn him by our law he may slay us and by overbearing justice may himself escape death Yet do not I make this com plaint against Herod himself He is to be sure more concerned for himself than for the laws But my complaint is against yourselves and your king who give him a license so to do However take notice that God is great and this very man whom you are going to ab solve and dismiss for the sake of Hyrcanus will one day punish both you and your king also Nor did Sameas mistake in any part of this prediction For when Herod had received the kingdom J he slew Hyrcanus and all the members of this Sanhedrim excepting Sa meas For he had a great honour for him on account of his righteousness and because when the city was afterward besieged by Herod and Sosius he persuaded the people to admit Herod into it and told them that  It is here worthy of remark that none could be put to death in Judea but by the approbation of the Jewish Sanhedrim there being an excellent provision in the law of Moses that even in criminal causes and particularly where life was concerned an appeal should lie from the lesser councils of 7 in the other cities to the supreme council of 71 at Jerusalem And this is exactly accord ing to our Saviour s words when he says It could not be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem Luke xiii 33 t This account as Reland observes is confirmed by the Talmudists who call this Sameas Simeon the son of Shetach The like foreboding speech of Sulla concerning Julius Caesar is in Suetonius JuJ Caes I as Havercamp here takes notice t See Book XV chap 1 AN 44 511 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS For their sins they would not be able to es cape his hands Which things will be re lated in their proper places But when Hyrcanus saw that the members of the Sanhedrim were ready to pronounce the sentence of death upon Herod he put oft the trial till another day and sent privately to Herod and advised him to flee out of the city for that by this means he might escape So he retired to Damascus as though he fled from the king And when he had been with Sextus Caesar and had put his own affairs in a secure posture he resolved to do thus that in case he were again summoned before the Sanhedrim to take his trial he would not obey that summons Hereupon the members of the Sanhedrim were highly incensed and endeavoured to persuade Hyrcanus that all these things were against him This indeed he was not ignorant of but his temper was so unmanly and so foolish that he was able to do nothing at all But when Sextus had made Herod general of the army of Coelesy ria for he sold him that post for money Hyrcanus was in fear lest Herod should make war upon him Nor was the effect of what he feared long in coming upon him For Herod came and brought an army along with him to fight with Hyrcanus as being angry at the trial he had been summoned to undergo before the Sanhedrim But his father Antipater and his brother Phasaelus met him and hindered him from assaulting Jerusalem They also pacified his vehement temper and persuaded him to do no rash ac tion but merely to affright them with threat enings and to proceed no farther against one who had given him the dignity he had they also desired him not only to be angry that he was summoned and obliged to come to his trial but to remember withal how he was dismissed without condemnation and how he ought to give Hyrcanus thanks for the same So they desired him to consider that since it is God that turns the balance of war there is great Uncertainty in the issue of battle and that therefore he ought not to expect the victory when he should fight with his king and him that had supported him and bestowed many benefits upon him and had  If we read here for a5tjXov uncertainty a5ixov in justice as in the history Of the War I 10 the sense will run very clear otherwise the two accounts will done nothing very severe to him for that his accusation which was derived from evil counsellors and not from himself had rather the suspicion of some severity than any thing really severe in it Accordingly Herod was persuaded by these arguments and believed that it was sufficient for his future hopes to have made a shew of his strength before the nation And in this state were the affairs of Judea at this time CHAP X OF THE HONOURS THAT WERE PAID THE JEWS AND THE LEAGUES THAT WERE MADE BY THE ROMANS AND OTHER NATIONS WITH THEM NOW when Caesar was come to Rome he was ready to sail into Africa to fight against Scipio and Cato when Hyrcanus sent ambassadors to him desiring that he would ratify that league of friendship and mutual alliance which was between them And it seems necessary here to give an ac count of all the honours that the Romans and their emperors have paid to our nation and of the leagues of mutual assistance they have made with it that all the rest of mankind may know what regard the kings of Asia and Europe have had to us and that they have been abundantly satisfied of our courage and fidelity For whereas many will not believe what hath been written about us by the Per sians and Macedonians because those writ ings are not every where to be met with nor do lie in public places but among ourselves and certain other barbarous nations while there is no contradiction to be made against the decrees of the Romans for they are laid up in the public places of the cities and are extant still in the capitol and engraven upon pillars of brass Nay besides this Julius Caesar made a pillar of brass for the Jews at Alexandria and declared publicly that they were citizens of Alexandria Out of these evidences will I demonstrate what I say and will now set down the decrees made both by the senate and by Julius Caesar which re late to Hyrcanus and to our nation Caius Julius Caesar imperator and high priest and dictator the second time to the be somewhat different and tne sense of the place more doubtful 512 book xit ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS magistrates senate and people of Sidon sendeth greeting If you be in health it is well I also and the army are well I have sent you a copy of that decree registered on the tables which concerns Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews that it may be laid up among the public records And I will that it be openly proposed in a table of brass both in Greek and in Latin It is as follows â I Julius Caesar imperator the second time and high priest have made this decree with the ap probation of the senate Whereas Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the Jew hath demon strated his fidelity and diligence about our affairs and this both now and in former times both in peace and in war as many of our generals have borne witness and came to our assistance in the last AIexandrian war with fifteen hundred soldiers and when he was sent by me to Mithridates shewed him self superior in valour to all the rest of that army for these reasons I will that Hyrca nus the son of Alexander and his children be ethnarchs of the Jews and have the high priesthood of the Jews for ever according to the customs of their forefathers and that he and his sons be our confederates and that besides this every one of them be reckoned among our particular friends I also ordain that he and his children retain whatsoever privileges belong to the office of high priest or whatsoever favours have been hitherto granted them And if at any time hereafter there arise any question about the Jewish customs I will that he determine the same And I think it not proper that they should be obliged to find us winter quarters or that any money should be required of them The decrees of Caius Caesar consul containing what hath been granted and de termined are as follows That Hyrcanus and his children bear rule over the nation of the Jews and have the profits of the places to them bequeathed and that himself as the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews defend those that are injured And that ambassa dors be sent to Hyrcanus the son of Alex ander the high priest of the Jews that may discourse with him about a league of friend ship and mutual assistance and that a table of brass containing the premises be openly proposed in the capitol and at Sidon and Tyre and Ascalon and in the temple en graven in Roman and Greek characters that this decree may also be communicated to the quaestors and pretors of the several cities and to the friends of the Jews and that the am bassadors may have presents made them and that these decrees be sent every where Caius Caesar imperator dictator consul hath granted that out of regard to the honour and virtue and kindness of the man and for the advantage of the senate and of the people of Rome Hyrcanus the son of Alexander and his children be high priests and priests of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation by the same right and according to the same laws by which their progenitors have held the priesthood Caius Caesar t consul the fifth time hath decreed that the Jews shall possess Jerusa lem and may encompass that city with walls and that Hyrcanus the son of Alex ander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews retain it in the manner he himself pleases and that the Jews be allowed to de duct out of their tribute every second year the land is let in the sabbatic period a corus of that tribute And that the tribute they pay be not let to farm nor that they pay al ways the same tribute Caius Caasar imperator the second time hath ordained that all the country of the Jews excepting Joppa do pay a tribute yearly Jfor the city Jerusalem excepting the seventh which they call the sabbatical year because thereon they neither receive the fruits of their trees nor do they sow their land and that they pay their tribute in Sidon on the  That Hyrcanus was himself in Egypt along with Antipater at this time to whom accordingly the bold and prudent actions of his deputy Antipater are here ascribed as this decree of Julius Caesar supposes we are farther assured by the testimony of Strabo already produced by Josephus chap 8 But as for the other niceties in these decrees on behalf of the Jews most of which are but lately recovered in our editions of Jose phus but which are of the most authentic authority as compared with the Roman customs and other records and what light arises from them to the other Roman au thors and antiquities they only belong to the learned in the Roman affairs and shall not therefore be dwelt upon in this English version Jacobus Gronovius c in Ha vercamp s edition will generally afford the inquisitive reader abundant satisfaction t See the note on chap 8 X Probably to rebuild the walls or to keep them in repair AN 44 513 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS second year of that sabbatical period the fourth part of what was sown And besides this they are to pay the same tithes to Hyr canus and his sons which they paid to their forefathers And that no one neither presi dent lieutenant nor ambassador raise aux iliaries within the bounds of Judea Nor may soldiers exact money of them for winter quar ters or under any other pretence but they are to be free from all sorts of injuries And whatsoever they shall hereafter have and are in possession of or have bought they shall retain It is also our pleasure that the city Joppa which the Jews had originally when they made a league of friendship with the Romans shall belong to them as it formerly did and that Hyrcanus the son of Alexan der and his sons have as tribute of that city from those that occupy the land for the country and for what they export every year to Sidon twenty thousand six hundred and seventy five modii every year the seventh year which they call the sabbath year ex cepted whereupon they neither plough nor receive the product of their trees It is also the pleasure of the senate that as to the vil lages which are in the great plain which Hyrcanus and his forefathers formerly pos sessed Hyrcanus and the Jews have them with the same privileges with which they formerly had them also and that the same original ordinances remain still in force which concern the Jews with regard to their high priests and that they enjoy the same bene fits which they have had formerly by the concession of the people and of the senate and let them enjoy the like privileges in Lydda It is also the pleasure of the senate that Hyrcanus the ethnarch and the Jews retain those places countries and villages which belonged to the kings of Syria and Phoenicia the confederates of the Romans and which they had bestowed on them as their free gifts it is also granted to Hyrcanus and to his sons and to the ambassadors by them sent to us that in the fights between single gladiators and in those with beasts they shall sit among the senators to see those shows And that when they desire an audi  Dr Hudson justly supposes that these Roman impe rators or generals of armies who gave testimony to Hyr canus s and the Jews fidelity and good will to the Ro mans before the senate and people of Rome were prin ence they shall be introduced into the senate by the dictator or by the general of the horse And when they have introduced them their answers shall be returned in ten days at the farthest after the decree of the senate is made about their affairs Caius Caesar imperator dictator the fourth time and consul the fifth time de clared to be perpetual dictator made this speech concerning the priests and privileges of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews Since those imperators that have been in the provinces before me have borne witness to Hyrcanus the high priest of the Jews and to the Jews themselves and this before the senate and people of Rome when the people and senate returned their thanks to them it is good that we also now remember the same and pro vide that a requital be made to Hyrcanus to the nation of the Jews and to the sons of Hyrcanus by the senate and people of Rome and that suitably to the good will they have shewn us and to the benefits they have be stowed upon us Julius Caius the praetor and consul of Rome to the magistrates senate and people of the Parians sendeth greeting The Jews of Delos and some other Jews that sojourn there in the presence of your ambassadors signified to us that by a decree of yours you forbid them to make use of the customs of their forefathers and their way of sacred wor ship Now it does not please me that such decrees should be made against our friends and confederates whereby they are forbid den to live according to their own customs or to bring in contributions for common sup pers and holy festivals while they are not forbidden so to do even at Rome itself For even Caius Caesar our imperator and consul in that decree wherein he forbade the Bac chanal rioters to meet in the city did yet permit these Jews and these only both to bring in their contributions and to make their common suppers Accordingly when I forbid other Bacchanal rioters I permit these Jews to gather themselves together accord ing to the customs and laws of their forefa cipally Pompey Scaurus and Gabinius Of all whom Josephus had already given us the history so far as the Jews were concerned with them 514 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS thers and to persist therein It will be there fore good for you if you have made any de cree against these our friends and confede rates to abrogate the same by reason of their virtue and kind disposition towards us Now after Caius was slain when Marcus Antonius and Publius Dolabella were con suls they both assembled the senate and in troduced Hyrcanus s ambassadors into it and discoursed of what they desired and made a league of friendship with them The senate also agreed to grant them all they desired I add the decree itself that those who read the present work may have ready by them a demonstration of the truth of what we say The decree of the senate copied out of the treasury from the public tables belonging to the quaestors when Quintus Rutilius and Caius Cornelius were quaestors and taken out of the second table of the first class On the third day before the ides of April in the temple of Concord There were present at the writing of this decree Lucius Culpurnius Piso of the Menenian tribe Servius Papi nius Potitus of the Lemonian tribe Caius Caninius Rebilius of the Tarentine tribe Publius Tidetius Lucius Apulinus the son of Lucius of the Sergian tribe Flavius the son of Lucius of the Lemonian tribe Pub lius Platius the son of Publius of the Papy rian tribe Marcus Acilius the son of Mar cus of the Mecian tribe Lucius Erucius the son of Lucius of the Stellatine tribe Marcus Quintius Plancillus the son of Marcus of the Pollian tribe and Publius Serius Publius Dolabella and Marcus Antonius the consuls made this reference to the senate that as to those things which by the decree of the se nate Caius Caesar had adjudged about the Jews and yet had not hitherto that decree brought into the treasury it is our will as it is also the desire of Publius Dolabella and Marcus Antonius our consuls to have these decrees put into the public tables and brought to the city quaestors that they may take care to have them put upon the double tables This was done before the fifth of the ides of February in the temple of Concord Now the ambassadors from Hyrcanus the high priest were Lysimachus the son of Pau sanias Alexander the son of Theodorus Patroclus the son of Chereas and Jonathan the son of Onias Hyrcanus sent also one of these ambassa dors to Dolabella who was then the prefect of Asia and desired him to dismiss the Jews from military services and to preserve to them the customs of their forefathers and to permit them to live according to them And when Dolabella had received Hyrcanus s let ter without any farther deliberation he sent an epistle to all the Asiatics and particularly to the city of the Ephesians the metropolis of Asia about the Jews A copy of which epistle here follows â When Artemon was prytanis on the first day of the month Leneon Dolabella impera tor to the senate and magistrates and people of the Ephesians sendeth greeting Alexan der the son of Theodorus the ambassador of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews appeared before me to shew that his countrymen could not go into their armies because they are not allowed to bear arms or to travel on the sab bath days nor there to procure themselves those sorts of food which they have been used to eat from the times of their forefathers I therefore grant them a freedom from going into the army as the former prefects have done and permit them to use the customs of their forefathers in assembling together for sacred and religious purposes as their law requires and for collecting oblations neces sary for sacrifices and my will is that you write this to the several cities under your jurisdiction Those were the concessions that Dolabella made to our nation when Hyrcanus sent an ambassage to him But Lucius the consul s decree ran thus I have at my tribunal set those Jews who are citizens of Rome and follow the Jewish religious rites and yet live at Ephesus free from going into the army on account of the superstition they are under This was done before the

Marcus Piso the lieutenant lived in our city who was also appointed over the choice of the soldiers he called us and many others of the citizens and gave order that if there be here any Jews who are Ro man citizens no one is to give them any dis turbance about going into the army because Cornelius Lentulus the consul freed the Jews from going into the army on account of the superstition they are

their forefathers and that they may not be prevented therefrom because they are our friends and confederates and that nobody may injure them in our provinces Now although the Trallians there present contradicted them and were not pleased with these decrees yet didst thou give order that they should be observed and inform edst us that thou hadst been desired to write this to us about them We

sabbaths and to per form their sacred rites received from their forefathers and to manage the fruits of the land according to their ancient custom and that he had himself been the promulger of your degree according as your laws require I would therefore have you know that upon hearing the pleadings on both sides I gave sentence that the Jews should not be prohi bited from making use of their own customs The decree of those of Pergamus When Cratippus was prytanis on the first day of the month Desius the decree of the praetors was this Since the Romans following the conduct of their ancestors undertake dan gers for the common safety of all mankind and are ambitious to settle their confederates and friends in happiness and in firm peace  We haye here a most remarkable and authentic at testation of the citizens of Pergamus that Abraham was and since the nation of the Jews and their high priest Hyrcanus sent as ambassadors to them Strabo the son of Theodatus Apol lonius the son of Alexander Eneas the son of Antipater Aristobulus the son of Amyn tas and Sosipater the son of Philip worthy and good men who gave a particular ac count of their affairs the senate thereupon made a decree about what they had desired of them that Antiochus the king the son of Antiochus should do no injury to the Jews the confederates of the Romans and that the fortresses and the havens and the coun try and whatsoever else he had taken from them should be restored and that it may be lawful for them to export their goods out of their own havens and that no king nor peo ple may have leave to export any goods ei ther out of the country of Judea or out of their havens without paying customs but only Ptolemy king of Alexandria because he is our confederate and friend and that according to their desire the garrison that is in Joppa may be ejected Now Lucius Pet tius one of our senators a worthy and good man gave order that we should take care that these things should be done according to the senate s decree and that their ambas sadors might return home in safety Accor dingly we admitted Theodorus into our se nate and took the epistle out of his hands as well as the decree of the senate And as he discoursed with great zeal about the Jews and described Hyrcanus s virtue and gene rosity and how he was a benefactor to all men in common and particularly to every body that comes to him we laid up the epistle in our public records and made a decree ourselves that since we also are in confederacy with the Romans we would do every thing we could for the Jews according to the senate s decree Theodorus also who brought the epistle desired of our praetors that they would send Hyrcanus a copy of that decree as also ambassadors to signify to him the affection of our people and to exhort them to preserve and augment their friendship for us and be ready to bestow other benefits upon us as justly expecting to receive proper requitals from us and de siring them to remember that

holiness and since we aim to follow the peo ple of the Romans who are the benefactors of all men and what they have written to us about a league of friendship and mutual as sistance between the Jews and our city and that their sacred offices and accustomed fes tivals and assemblies may be observed by them we have decreed that as many men and women of the Jews as are willing so to do may celebrate their sabbaths and per form their holy offices according to the Jew ish laws and may make their proseuchae at the sea side according to the custom of their forefathers And if any one whether he be a magistrate or private person hinder them from so doing he shall be liable to a fine to be applied to the uses of the city The decree of the Sardians This de cree was made by the senate and people upon the representation of the praetors Whereas those Jews who are our fellow citi zens and live with us in this city have ever had great benefits heaped upon them by the people and have come now into the senate and desired of the people that upon the res titution of their law and their liberty by the senate and people of Rome they may assem ble together according to their ancient legal custom and that we will not bring any suit against them about it and that a place may be given where they may have their con gregations with their wives and children and may offer as did their forefathers their prayers and sacrifices to God now the senate and people have decreed to permit them to assemble together on the days formerly ap pointed and to act according to their own laws and that such a place shall be set apart for them by the praetors for the build ing and inhabiting the same as they shall esteem fit for that purpose And that those who take care of the provisions for the city shall take care that such sorts of food as they esteem fit for their eating may be im ported into the city The decree of the Ephesians When Menophilus was prytanis on the first day of the month Artemisius this decree was made by the people and Nicanor the son of Eu phemus pronounced it upon the representa tion of the praetors Since the Jews that dwell in this city have petitioned Marcus Ju lius Pompeius the son of Brutus the procon sul that they may be allowed to observe their sabbaths and to act in all things according to the customs of their forefathers without impediment from any body the praetor hath granted their petition Accordingly it was decreed by the senate and people that in this affair that concerned the Romans no one of them should be hindered from keeping the sabbath day nor be fined for so doing but that they be allowed to do all things ac cording to their own laws Now there are fmany such decrees of the senate and imperators of the Romans and those different from these before us which have been made in favour of Hyrcanus and of our nation as also there have been more and that the public acts of their city then extant confirmed the same This evidence is too strong to be evaded by our present ignorance of the particular occasion of such ancient friendship and alliance between those people See the like full evidence of the kindred of the Lacedaemoni ans and the Jews and that because they were both the posterity of Abraham by a public epistle of these people to the Jews preserved in the first book of the Maccabees xii 19â 23 and thence by Josephus in his Antiquities XII 4 both which authentic records are highly valuable It is also worthy of observation what Moses Chorenensis the principal Armenian historian informs us of page 83 that Arsaces who raised the Parthian empire was of the seed of Abraham by Chetura and that thereby was ac complished that prediction which said Kings of nations shall proceed from thee Gen xvii 6  See the note on Book XII chap 2 t If we compare Josephus s former promises to produce all the public decrees of the Romans in favour of the Jews with his excuse here for omitting many of them we may observe that when he came to transcribe all those decrees he had collected he found them so numerous that he thought he should too much tire his readers if he had attempted it which he thought a sufficient apology for his omitting the rest of them Yet do those by him produced afford such a strong confirmation to his history and give such great light to even the Roman antiquities themselves that I believe the curious are not a little sorry for such omissions 4M2 518 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS decrees of the cities and rescripts of the praetors to such epistles as concerned our rights and privileges And certainly such as are not ill disposed to what we write may believe that they are all to this purpose and that by these specimens which we have in serted For since we have produced evident marks that may still be seen of the friend ship we have had with the Romans and de monstrated that those marks are engraven upon columns and tables of brass in the capitol that are still in being and preserved to this day we have omitted to set them all down as needless and uninteresting For I cannot suppose any one so perverse as not to believe the friendship we have had with the Romans while they have demonstrated the same by such a great number of their decrees relating to us Nor will they doubt of our fidelity as to the rest of those decrees since we have shewn the same in those we have produced And thus have we sufficient ly explained that friendship and confederacy we at those times had with the Romans CHAP XI MARCUS SUCCEEDS TO THE PRESIDENCY OF SYRIA ON THE ASSASSINATION OF SEXTUS CESAR CASSItTS COMES INTO SYRIA AND DISTRESSES JUDEA AND MALICHUS AFTER TREACHEROUSLY KILLING ANTIPATER IS SLAIN BY HEROD ABOUT this timet the affairs of Syria were in great disorder on the following occasion Cecilius Bassus one of Pompey s party laid a treacherous design against Sex tus Caesar and slew him and then took his army and got the management of public af fairs into his own hands So there arose a great war about Apamia while Caesar s ge nerals came against him with an army of horsemen and footmen To these Antipater also sent succours and his sons with them as calling to mind the kindnesses they had received from Caesar and on that account he thought it but just to require punishment for him and to take vengeance on the man that had murdered him And as the war wasJ drawn out into a great length Marcus came from Rome to take Sextus s government upon him But Caesar was slain by Cassius and Brutus in the senate house after he had retained the government three years and six months As the war that arose upon the death of Caesar was now begun and the principal men were all gone some one way and some another to raise armies Cassius came from Rome into Syria in order to receive the army that lay in the camp at Apamia and having raised the siege he brought over both Bassus and Marcus to his party He then went over the cities and got together weapons and sol diers and laid great taxes upon those cities And he chiefly oppressed Judea and exacted of it seven hundred talents But Antipater when he saw the state to be in so great con sternation and disorder he divided the col lection of that sum and appointed his two sons to gather it And so that part of it was to be exacted from Malichus who was ill dis posed to him and part by others And be cause Herod did exact what was required of him from Galilee before others he was in the greatest favour with Cassius For he thought it prudent to cultivate a friendship with the Romans and to gain their good will at the expense of others Whereas the curators of the other cities with their citizens were sold for slaves and Cassius reduced four cities into a state of slavery the two most potent of which were Gophna and Emmaus and besides these Dydda and Thamna Nay Cassius was so very angry at Malichus that he would have killed him had not Hyrcanus by the means of Antipater sent him a hun dred talents of his own and thereby pacified his anger After Cassius was gone out of Judea Ma lichus laid snares for Antipater as thinking that his death would be the preservation of Hyrcanus s government But Antipater per ceived his design and retired beyond Jordan  For Marcus this president of Syria sent as successor to Sextus Caesar the Roman historians require us to read Murcus in Josephus and this perpetually both in these Antiquities and in his history of the War as the learned generally agree Whether he himself originally wrote the name Marcus or Murcus or whether the transcribers have not put a usual for an unusual name which is sup posed to have been a practice not uncommon amongst them cannot now be known t An 45 j The reason of the protraction of this war at Apamia before the murder of Caesar Dr Hudson observes may be seen in Strabo XVI page 752 though the entire pas sage be too large for this place See Prideaux at the years 46 45 44 43 11 An 44 AN 43 519 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and got together an army partly of Arabs and partly of his own countrymen How ever Malichus being one of great cunning denied that he had laid any snares for him and made his defence with an oath both to himself and his sons and said that while Phasaelus had a garrison in Jerusalem and Herod had the weapons of war in his custody he could never have a thought of any such thing So Antipater perceiving the distress that Malichus was in was reconciled to him and made an agreement with him This was when Marcus was president of Syria who yet perceiving that this Malichus was making a disturbance in Judea proceeded so far that he had almost killed him but still at the intercession of Antipater he saved him Antipater however little thought that by saving Malichus he had preserved his own murderer For now Cassius and Marcus had got together an army and entrusted the en tire care of it with Herod and made him general of the forces of Coelesyria and gave him a fleet of ships and an army of horse men and footmen and promised that after the war was over they would make him king of Judea For a war was already begun be tween Antony and the younger Caesar But as Malichus was most afraid of Antipater he took him out of the way and by the offer of money persuaded the butler of Hyrcanus with whom they were both to feast to kill him by poison This being done and he having armed men with him settled the af fairs of the city But when Antipater s sons Herod and Phasaelus were acquainted with this conspiracy against their father and had indignation at it Malichus denied all and utterly disclaimed any knowledge of the murder And thus died Antipater a man that had distinguished himself for piety and justice and love to his country And where as Herod resolved immediately to revenge his father s death and was coming upon Malichus with an army for that purpose the eldest of his sons Phasaelus thought it best rather to get this man into their hands by policy lest they should appear to begin a civil war in the country So he accepted of Malichus s defence for himself and pretend  An 43 ed to believe him that he had no hand in the violent death of Antipater his father but erected a fine monument for him Herod also went to Samaria and when he found them in great distress he revived their spi rits and composed their differences A short time after this Herod upon the approach of a festival came with his soldiers into the city whereupon Malichus was alarm ed and persuaded Hyrcanus not to permit him to come into the city Hyrcanus com plied and for a pretence of excluding him alledged that a rout of strangers ought not to be admitted when the multitude were tpurifying themselves But Herod had little regard to the messengers that were sent to him and entered the city in the night time and affrighted Malichus Yet did he remit nothing of his former dissimulation but wept for Antipater and bewailed him as a friend of his with a loud voice But Herod and his friends thought it proper not openly to con tradict Malichus s hypocrisy but to give him tokens of mutual friendship in order to prevent his suspicion of them However Herod sent an account of his father s murder to Cassius who knowing what sort of man Malichus was as to his morals sent him back word that he should revenge his father s death and also sent pri vately to the commanders of his army at Tyre with orders to assist in the execution of a very just design Now when Cassius had taken Laodicea they all went together to him and carried him garlands and money and Herod thought that Malichus might be punished while he was there But he was somewhat apprehensive of the thing and de signed to make some great attempt and be cause his son was then a hostage at Tyre he went to that city and resolved to steal him away privately and to march thence into Judea and as Cassius was in haste to march against Antony he thought to bring the coun try to revolt and to procure the government for himself But Providence opposed his counsels and Herod being a shrewd man and perceiving what his intention was sent a servant thither beforehand in appearance indeed to get a supper ready for he had said before that he would feast them all t See John xi 55 520 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS there but in reality to the commanders of the army whom he persuaded to go out against Malichus with their daggers So they went out and met him near the city upon the sea shore and stabbed him Hyrcanus was so astonished that his speech failed him and when after some difficulty he had recovered himself he asked Herod what the matter could be and who it was that slew Mali chus And when he said that it was done by the command of Cassius he commended the action for that Malichus was a very wicked man and one that conspired against his own country And this was the punish ment that was inflicted on Malichus for what he wickedly did to Antipater But when Cassius was marched out of Sy ria disturbances arose in Judea for Felix who was left at Jerusalem with an army made a sudden attempt against Phasaelus and the people themselves rose in arms But Herod went to Fabius the prefect of Damas cus and was desirous to run to his brother s assistance but was hindered by a distemper that seized upon him till Phasaelus by him self had been too hard for Felix and had shut him up in the tower and there on cer tain conditions dismissed him Phasaelus also complained of Hyrcanus that although he had received many benefits from them yet did he support their enemies For Malichus s brother had caused many places to revolt and kept garrisons in them and particularly Mas sada the strongest fortress of them all In the mean time Herod recovered of his disease and came and took from Felix all the places he had gotten and upon certain conditions dismissed him also CHAP XII HEROD EJECTS ANTIGONUS THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS OUT OF JUDEX AND GAINS THE FRIENDSHIP OF ANTONY BY SENDING HIM MUCH MONEY ANTONY WRITES TO THE TYRIANS ON BEHALF OF THE JEWS OW Ptolemy the son of Menneus brought back into Judea Antigonus N the son of Aristobulus who had already raised an army and had by money made Fabius his friend and this because he was of kin to him Marion also gave him assist ance He had been left by Cassius to tyran nize over Tyre for this Cassius was a man that seized on Syria and then kept it under in the way of a tyrant Marion also marched into Galilee which lay in his neighbourhood and took three of its fortresses and put gar risons into them to keep them But when Herod came he took all from him But the Tyrian garrison he dismissed in a very civil manner nay to some of the soldiers he made presents out of his good will to that city When he had despatched these affairs and was gone to meet Antigonus he joined battle with nim and defeated him and drove him out of Judea when he was just come to its borders But when he was come to Jerusa lem Hyrcanus and the people put garlands about his head For he had already con tracted an affinity with the family of Hyrca nus by having espoused a descendant of his and for that reason Herod took the greater care of him as being to marry the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus and the grand daughter of Hyrcanus by which wife he became the father of three male and two female children He had also married before this another wife out of a lower family of his own nation whose name was Doris by whom he had his eldest son Antipater Now Antonius and Cresar had beaten Cas sius near Philippi as others have related But after the victory Caesar went into tGaul and Antony marched for Asia When he was arrived at Bithynia he had ambassadors that met him from all parts The principal men also of the Jews came thither to accuse Phasaelus and Herod and they said that Hyrcanus had indeed the appearance oi reigning but that these men had all the power But Antony paid great respect to Herod who was come to him to make his defence against his accusers On which ac  In this and the following chapters the reader will easily remark how truly Gronovius observes in his notes on the Roman decrees in favour of the Jews that their rights and privileges were commonly purchased of the Romans with money Many examples of this sort both as to the Romans and others in authority will occur in our Josephus both now and hereafter and need not be taken particular notice of on the several occasions in these notes Accordingly the chief captain confesses to St Paul that with a great sum he had obtained his free dom Acts Kii 28 As had St Paul s ancestors very probably purchased the like freedom for their family by money as the same author justly conclude also t For TaXXiaf or Gaul the Roman historians and Jo AN 521 43 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS count his adversaries could not so much as obtain a hearing This favour Herod had gained by money but still when Antony was come to Ephesus Hyrcanus the high priest and our nation sent an ambassage to him which carried a crown of gold with them and desired that he would write to the gov ernors of the provinces to set those Jews free who had been carried captive by Cas sius and this without their having fought against him and to restore them that coun try which in the days of Cassius had been taken from them Antony thought the Jews desires were just and wrote immediately to Hyrcanus and to the Jews He also sent at the same time a decree to the Tyrians the contents of which were to the same purpose Marcus Antonius imperator to Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews sendeth greeting If you be in health it is well I am also in health with the army Lysimachus the son of Pausanius and Jose phus the son of Menneus and Alexander the son of Theodorus your ambassadors met me at Ephesus and have renewed that ambas sage which they had formerly been upon at Rome and have diligently acquitted them selves of the present ambassage which thou and thy nation have entrusted to them and have fully declared the good will thou hast for us I am therefore satisfied both by your actions and your words that you are well disposed to us and I understand that your conduct of life is constant and religious So I reckon upon you as our own But when those that were adversaries to you and to the Roman people and abstained neither from cities nor temples and did not observe the agreement they had confirmed by oath it was not only on account of our own contest with them but on account of all mankind in common that we have taken vengeance on those who have been the authors of great in justice towards men and of great wickedness towards the gods For the sake of which we suppose it was that the sun turned away his light from us as unwilling to view the horrid crime they were guilty of in the case of Caesar We have also overcome their conspiracies which threatened the gods them selves which Macedonia received as it is a climate peculiarly proper for impious and in solent attempts and we have overcome that confused rabble half mad with spite against us which they got together at Philippi in Macedonia when they seized on the places that were proper for their purpose and as it were walled them round with mountains to the very sea and where the passage was open only through a single gate This vic tory we gained because the gods had con demned these men for their wicked enter prises Now Brutus when he had fled as far as Philippi was shut up by us and became a partaker of the same perdition with Cassius And now these have received their punish ment we suppose that we may enjoy peace for the time to come and that Asia may be at rest from war We therefore make that peace which God hath given us common to our confederates also insomuch that the body of Asia is now recovered out of that distemper it was under by the means of our victory I therefore bearing in mind both thee and your nation shall take care of what may be for your advantage I have also sent epistles in writing to the several cities that if any persons whether freemen or bondmen have been sold funder the spear by Caius Cassius or his subordinate officers they may be set free And I will that you kindly make use of the favours which I and Dolabella have granted you I also forbid the Tyrians to use any violence with you and for what places of the Jews they now possess 1 order them to restore them I have withal accept ed of the crown which thou sentest me Marcus Antonius imperator to the ma gistrates senate and people of Tyre sendeth greeting The ambassadors of Hyrcanus high priest and ethnarch of the Jews appear ed1

Italy For thither went Octavius Caesar after he and Antony had beaten Brutus and Cassius at Philippi Whence Antony went into Asia as Josephus agrees with them  This clause plainly alludes to that well known but unusual and very long darkness of the sun which hap pened upon the murder of Julius Caesar by Brutus and Cassius which is taken great notice of by Virgil Pliny and other Roman authors See

obtaining the go vernment and have taken care to do what was agreeable to piety and justice and have brought to punishment those that had neither any remembrance of the kindnesses they had received nor had kept their oaths I will that you be at peace with those that are our confederates as also that what you have taken by the means of our adversaries shall not be reckoned your own but be returned to those from whom you took them For none of them took their provinces or their armies by the gift of the senate but they seized them by force and bestowed them by violence upon such as became useful to them in their unjust proceedings Since therefore those men have received the punishment due to them we desire that our confederates may retain whatsoever it was that they formerly possessed without disturbance and that you restore all the places which belonged to Hyrcanus the ethnarch of the Jews which you have had though it were but one day before Caius Cassius began an unjustifiable war against us and entered into our province Nor do you use any force against him in or der to weaken him that he may not be able to dispose of that which is his own But if you have any contest with him about your respective rights it shall be lawful for you to plead your cause when we come upon the places concerned For we shall alike pre serve the rights and hear all the causes of our confederates Marcus Antonius imperator to the ma gistrates senate and people of Tyre sendeth greeting I have sent you my decree of which 1 will that you take care that it be engraven on the public tables in Roman and Greek letters and that it stand engraven in the most illustrious places that it may be read by all Marcus Antonius imperator one of the triumvirate over the public affairs made this declaration Since Caius Cassius in the revolt he hath made hath pillaged that province which belonged not to him and was held by garrisons there encamped while they were our confederates and hath spoiled that nation of the Jews that was in friendship with the Roman people as in war and since we have overcome his madness by arms we now correct by our decrees and judicial de terminations what he hath laid waste that those things may be restored to our confede rates And as for what hath been sold of the Jewish possessions whether they be bodies or possessions let them be released the bodies into that state oi freedom they were originally in and the possessions to their former owners I also will that he who shall not comply with this decree of miue shall be punished for his disobedience And if such a one be caught I will take care that the offender suffer condign punishment The same thing did Antony write to the Sidonians the Antiochians and the Aradians We have produced these decrees therefore as marks for futurity of the truth of what we have said that the Romans had a great con cern about our nation CHAP XIII HEROD AND PHASAELUS ARE MADE TETRARCHS AFTER HAVING BEEN ACCUSED TO NO PURPOSE THE PAR THIANS BRING ANTIGONUS INTO JUDEA AND TARE HYRCANUS AND PHASAELUS CAPTIVES HEROD SAVES HIMSELF BY FLIGHT WHEN Antony came into Syria he fell in love with queen Cleopatra who met him in Cilicia There came now also a hundred of the most potent of the Jews to accuse Herod and those about him and set men of the greatest eloquence among them to speak But Messala contradicted l hem on behalf of the young men and this in the presence of Hyrcanus who was tHerod s father in law already When Antony had heard on both sides at Daphne he asked Hyrcanus who they were that governed the nation best He replied Herod and his friends Hereupon Antony by reason of the old friendship he had made with his father Antipater when he was with Gabinius made both Herod and Phasaelus tetrarchs and committed the public affairs of the Jews to  An 41 t We may here observe that espousals alone were of old esteemed a sufficient foundation for affinity Hyrcanus being here called father in law to Herod because his grand daughter Mariamne was betrothed to him although the marriage was not completed till four years afterward Thus does Virgil style Chorebus the son in law to Prk mus before he had actually married his daughter Ened II v 344 See the notes here see also Matth i 16 with Grotius s note upon that place AW 41 523 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them and wrote letters to that purpose He also bound fifteen of their adversaries and would have put them to death but that Herod obtained their pardon Yet did not these men continue quiet when they were come back but a thousand of the Jews came to Tyre to meet him there whither the report was that he would come But Antony was corrupted by the money which Herod and his brother had given him and so he gave order to the governor of the place to punish the Jewish ambassadors who were for making innovations and to settle the government upon Herod But Herod went out hastily to them and Hyrcanus was with him for they stood upon the shore be fore the city and he charged them to go their ways because great mischief would befall them if they went on with their accu sation But as they did not acquiesce the Romans ran upon them with their daggers and slew some and wounded more of them and the rest fled away and went home and lay still in great consternation And when the people made a clamour against Herod Antony was so provoked at it that he slew the prisoners Now in the second year Pacorus the king of Parthia s son and Barzapharnes a commander of the Parthians possessed them selves of Syria Ptolemy the son of Men neus also was now dead and Lysanias his son took his government and made a league of friendship with Antigonus the son of Aris tobulus and in order to obtain it made use of that commander who had great interest in him Now Antigonus had promised to five the Parthians a thousand talents and ve hundred women upon condition they would take the government from Hyrcanus and bestow it upon him and withal kill Herod And although he did not give them what he had promised yet did the Parthians make an expedition into Judea on that ac count and carried Antigonus with them Pacorus went along the maritime parts but the commander Barzapharnes through the midland Now the Tyrians excluded Paco rus but the Sidonians and those of Ptole mais received him However Pacorus sent a troop of horsemen into Judea to take a view of the state of the country and to assist Antigonus and he sent the king s butler of voL i â NOS 43  44 the same name with himself So when the Jews that dwelt about mount Carmel came to Antigonus and were ready to march with him into Judea Antigonus hoped to get some part of the country by their assistance The place is called Dry mi and when some others came and met them the men privately fell upon Jerusalem And when some more were come to them they got together in great numbers and came against the king s palace and besieged it But as Phasaelus s and Herod s party came to the other s assistance and a battle ensued in the market place the young men beat their enemies and pursued them into the temple and sent some armed men into the adjoining houses to keep them in who yet being destitute of such as should support them were burnt and the houses with them by the people who rose up against them But Herod was revenged on these seditious adversaries a little afterward when he fought with them and slew a great num ber of them But while there were daily skirmishes the enemy waited for the coming of the multitude out of the country to the feast of Pentecost And when that day was come many thou sands of the people were gathered together about the temple some in armour and some without Now those that came guarded both the temple and the city excepting what be longed to the palace which Herod guarded with a few of his soldiers And Phasaelus had the charge of the wall while Herod with a body of his men sallied out upon the enemy who lay in the suburbs and fought courageously and put many thousands to flight some fleeing into the city some into the temple and some into the outer fortifica tions for some such fortifications there were in that place Phasaelus came also to his assistance Yet was Pacorus the general of the Parthians at the desire of Antigonus ad mitted into the city with a few of his horse men under pretence indeed as if he would appease the sedition but in reality to assist Antigonus in obtaining the government And when Phasaelus met him and received him kindly Pacorus persuaded him to go himself as ambassador to Barzapharnes which was done fraudulently Accordingly Phasaelus  Probably of Antony s coming into Asia 4N 524 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS suspecting no harm complied with his pro posal while Herod did not give his consent to what was done because of the perfidious ness of these Barbarians but desired Pha saelus rather to fight those that were come into the city So both Hyrcanus and Phasaelus went on the ambassage But Pacorus left with Herod two hundred horsemen and ten men who were called the free men and conducted the others on their journey And when they were in Galilee the governors of the cities there met them in their arms Barzapharnes also received them at first with cheerfulness and made them presents though he after ward conspired against them And Phasa elus with hie horsemen were conducted to the sea side But when they heard that An tigonus had promised to give the Parthians a thousand talents and five hundred women to assist him against them they soon had a suspicion of the Barbarians Moreover there was one who informed them that snares were laid for them by night while a guard came about them secretly and they had then been seized upon had they not waited for the seizure of Herod by the Parthians that were about Jerusalem lest upon the slaughter of Hyrcanus and Phasaelus he should have an intimation of it and escape out of their hands And these were the circumstances they were now in and they saw who they were that guarded them Some persons in deed would have persuaded Phasaelus to flee away immediately on horseback and not stay any longer And there was one Ophel lius who above all the reBt was earnest for him to do so For he had heard of this treachery from Saramalla the richest of all the Syrians at that time who also promised to provide him ships to carry him off for the sea was just by them But he had no mind to desert Hyrcanus nor to bring his brother into danger But he went to Barzapharne6 and told him he did not act justly when he made such a contrivance for that if he wanted money he would give him more than Antigonus And besides that it was a hor rible thing to slay those that came to him upon the security of their oaths and that when they had done them no injury But the Barbarians swore to him that there was no truth in any of his suspicions but that he Mas troubled with nothing but false suppo sals and then went away to Pacorus But as soon as he was gone away some men came and bound Hyrcanus and Phasa elus while Phasaelus greatly reproached the Parthians for their perjury However that butler who was sent against Herod had it in command to get him without the walls of the city and seize upon him But messengers had been sent by Phasaelus to inform Herod of the perfidiousness of the Parthians And when he knew that the enemy had seized upon them he went to Pacorus and to the most potent of the Parthians as to the lords of the rest But although they knew the whole matter they dissembled with him in a deceitful way and said that he ought to go out with them before the walls and meet those who were bringing him his letters for that they were not taken by his adversaries but were coming to give him an account of the good success Phasaelus had had Herod did not give credit to what they said for he had heard that his brother was seized upon by others also And the daughter of Hyr canus whom he had espoused also advised him not to credit them which made him still more suspicious of the Parthians for al though other people did not give heed to her yet did he believe her as a woman of very great wisdom Now while the Parthians were in consulta tion what was fit to be done for they did not think it proper to make an open attempt upon a person of his character and while they put off the determination to the next day Herod was under great disturbance of mind and rather inclining to believe the re ports he had heard about his brother and the Parthians than to give heed to what was said on the other side he determined that when the evening came on he would make use of it for his flight and not make any longer delay as if the dangers from the enemy were not yet certain He therefore removed with the armed men whom he had with him and set his wives upon the beasts as also his mother and sister and her whom he was about to marry Mariamne the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus with her mother the daughter of Hyrcanus and his  Alexandra AN 41 525 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS youngest brother and all their servants and the rest of the multitude that was with him and without the enemies privity pursued his way to Idumea Nor could any enemy of his who then saw him in this case be so hard hearted but would have commiserated his fortune while the women drew along their infant children and left their own country and their friends in prison with tears in their eyes and sad lamentations and in expecta tion of nothing but what was of a melancholy nature Herod however raised his mind above the miserable state he was in and was of good courage in the midst of his misfortunes and as he passed along bade them every one be of good cheer and not to give themselves up to sorrow because that would hinder them in their flight which was now the only hope of safety they had Accordingly they tried to bear with patience the calamity they were under as he exhorted them to do Yet was he once almost going to kill himself upon the overthrow of a waggon and the danger his mother was then in of being killed and this on two accounts because of his great con cern for her and because he was afraid lest by this delay the enemy should overtake him in the pursuit But as he was drawing his sword and going to kill himself therewith those that were present restrained him and told him that he ought not to desert them and leave them a prey to their enemies for that it was not the part of a brave man to free himself from the distresses he was in and to overlook his friends that were in the same distresses also so that he was compelled to let that horrid attempt alone partly out of shame at what they said to him and partly out of regard to the great number of those that would not permit him to do what he in tended So he encouraged his mother and took all the care of her the time would allow and proceeded with the utmost haste to the fortress of Massada And though he had many skirmishes with such of the Parthians as attacked and pursued him he was con queror in them all Nor indeed was he free from the Jews all along as he was in his flight For by that time he was gotten sixty furlongs out of the city and was upon the road they fell upon him and fought hand to hand with him but he put them to flight and overcame them not like one that was in distress and in ne cessity but like one that was excellently pre pared for war and had what he wanted in great plenty And on this very place where he now overcame the Jews he some time afterward built a most excellent palace and a city round about it and called it Herodium And when he was come to Idumea at a place called Thressa his brother Joseph met him and he then held a council to take advice about his affairs and what was fit to be done in his circumstances since he had a great multitude that followed him besides his mer cenary soldiers and the place Massada whi ther he proposed to retreat was too small to contain so great a multitude So he sent away the greater part of his company being above nine thousand and bade them go some one way and some another and so save themselves in Idumea and gave them what would buy them provisions in their journey but he took with him those that were least encumbered and were most intimate with him and came to the fortress and placed there his wives and his followers being about eight hundred in number there being in the place a sufficient quantity of corn and water and other necessaries and went directly for Petra in Arabia But when it was day the Parthians plundered all Jerusalem and the palace and abstained from nothing but Hyr canus s money which was three hundred talents A great deal of Herod s money es caped and principally all he had been so provident as to send to Idumea beforehand Nor indeed did what was in the city suffice the Parthians but they went out into the country and plundered it and demolished the city Marissa Thus was Antigonus brought back into Judea by the king of the Parthians and re ceived Hyrcanus and Phasaelus for his pri soners But he was greatly cast down be cause the women had escaped whom he had intended to have given the enemy as having promised they should have them with the money for their reward But being afraid that Hyrcanus who was under the guard of the Parthians might have his kingdom re stored to him by the multitude he cut offhis ears and thereby took care that the high priesthood should never come to him any 4N2 â v v  526 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS more because he was maimed while the law required that this dignity should belong to none but such as had all their members entire But now one cannot but here admire the fortitude of Phasaelus who perceiving that he was to be put to death did not think death any terrible thing at all but to die thus by the means of his enemy he thought most pitiable and dishonourable and therefore since he had not his hands at liberty but the bonds he was in prevented him from killing himself thereby he dashed his head against a great stone and thereby took away his own life which he thought to be the best thing he could do in such distress as he was in It is also reported that when he had made a great wound in his head Antigonus sent phy sicians to him in order to cure it and by ordering them to infuse poison into the wound killed him However Phasaelus hearing before he was quite dead by a certain wo man that his brother Herod had escaped the enemy underwent his death cheerfully since he now left behind him one who would re venge his death and who was able to inflict punishment on his enemies CHAP XIV ov the ingratitude of the kino of arabia and of herod s successful application to the roman se nate BY WHOM HE IS MADE KING OF THE JEWS THE great misfortunes of Herod did not discourage his mind but propelled him to new and surprising undertakings For he went to Malchus king of Arabia whom he had formerly been very kind to in order to receive somewhat by way of requital now he was in more than ordinary want of it and desired he would let him have some money either by way of loan or as his free gift on account of the many benefits he had received from him For not knowing what was be come of his brother he was in haste to re deem him out of the hand of his enemies as willing to give three hundred talents for the price of his redemption He also took with him the son of Phasaelus a child of but seven years of age that he might be a hostage for the repayment of the money But there came messengers from Malchus to meet him by whom he was desired to be gone for that the Parthians had laid a charge upon him not to entertain Herod This however was only a pretence which he made use of that he might not be obliged to repay what he owed him and this he was farther induced to by the principal men among the Arabians that they might cheat him of what sums they had received from his father Antipater and which he had committed to their fidelity He made answer that he did not intend to be trouble some to them by his coming thither but that he desired only to discourse with them about certain affairs that were to him of the greatest importance Hereupon he resolved to go away and accordingly took the road to Egypt And then it was that he lodged in a certain tem ple for he had left a great many of his fol lowers there On the next day he came to Rhinocolura and there he heard what bad befallen his brother Though Malchus soon repented of what he had done and came run ning after Herod but with no manner of success For he was gone a great way off and made haste into the road to Pelusium And when the stationary ships that lay there hindered him from sailing to Alexandria he went to their captains by whose assistance and that out of great regard to him he was conducted into Alexandria and was retained there by Cleopatra Yet was she not able to prevail with him to stay there because he was making haste to Rome even though the weather was stormy and he was informed that the affairs of Italy were very tumultuous and in great disorder So he set sail for Pamphylia and falling into a violent storm he had much difficulty to escape to Rhodes with the loss of the ship s burden And there it was that two of his friends Sappinas and Ptolemeus met with him And as he found that city very much damaged in the war against Cassius though he were in necessity himself he neglected not to do it a kindness but did what he could to recover it to its former state He also built there a three decked ship and set sail thence with his friends for Italy and  This law of Moses that the priests were to be with out blemish as to all the parts of their bodies is in Lerit wi 17â 24 And Spanheim on the parallel place of the history Of the War I 9 13 observes that the same law obtained at Athens also AN 40 327 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS came to the port of Brundusium And when he was come from thence to Rome he first related to Antony what had befallen him in Judea and that Phasaelus his brother was seized on by the Parthians and put to death by them that Hyrcanus was detained cap tive by them and that they had made Anti gonus king who had promised them a thou sand talents with five hundred women who were to be of the principal families and of the Jewish stock and that he carried off the women by night and that by undergoing a great many hardships he had escaped the hands of his enemies As also that his own relations were in danger of being besieged and taken and that he had sailed through a storm and contemned all these terrible dan gers in order to come as soon as possible to him who was his hope and only succour at this time This account made Antony commiserate the change that had happened in Herod s condition And reasoning with himself that this was a common case among those that are placed in such great dignities and that they are liable to the mutations that come from fortune he was very ready to give him the assistance he desired and this because he recollected the friendship he had had with Antipater because Herod offered him money to make him a king as he had formerly given it him to make him tetrarch and chiefly be cause of his hatred to Antigonus for he took him to be a seditious person and an enemy to the Romans f Caesar was also the forwarder to raise Herod s dignity and to give him his assistance in what he desired on account of the toils of war which he had himself under gone with Antipater his father in Egypt and of the hospitality he had treated him withal and the kindness he had always shewn him as also to gratify Antony who was very zealous for Herod So a senate was convened and Massala first and then Atra tinus introduced Herod into it and enlarged upon the benefits they had received from his father and reminded them of the good will he had borne the Romans At the same time they accused Antigonus and declared him an enemy not only because of his former oppo sition to them but that he had now over looked the Romans and taken the govern ment from the Parthians Upon this the se nate was irritated and Antony informed them farther that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king This seemed good to all the senators and they made a decree accordingly This was the principal instance of Antony s affection for Herod that he not only pro cured him a kingdom which he did not ex pect for he did not come with an intention to ask the kingdom for himself which he did not suppose the Romans would grant him who used to bestow it on some of the royal family but intended to desire it for his wife s brother who was grandson by his father to Aristobulus and to Hyrcanus by his mother but that he procured it for him so suddenly that he obtained what he did not expect and departed out of Italy in seven days This Jyoung man the grandson Herod afterward took care to have slain as we shall shew in its proper place But when the senate was dissolved Antony and Caesar went out of the senate house with Herod between them and with the consuls and other magistrates before them in order to offer sacrifices and to lay up their decrees in the capitol Antony also feasted Herod the first day of his reign And thus did this man receive the kingdom having obtained it in the hundred and eighty fourth Olympiad when Caius Domitius Calvinus was consul the second time and Caius Asi nius Pollio the first time In the mean time Antigonus besieged those that were in Massada who had plenty of all other necessaries but were only in want of  Concerning the chronology of Herod and the time when he was first made king at Rome and concerning the time when he began his second reign without a rival upon the conquest or slaughter of Antigonus both prin cipally derived from this and the two next chapters in Jo gephus see the Harm of the Evang page 150â 155 and the note on chap 15 It is however very strange that in such a violent haste as Herod now was Josephus should use such words and that both here and in the history Of the War I 14 as almost imply his building a great ship at Rhodes in his passage to Italy for which to be sure he now had no time at all Spanheim says on the place Of the War now quoted that he only hired a ship now at Rhodes and that as Josephus s affirmation also which though not at all unlikely in itself but rather highly pro bable yet has no foundation in the copies See also for this chronology of Herod Josephus s own speech to the Jews Of the War V 9 t See Chap 13 J Aristobulus jun See Book XV chap 3 II This grievous want of water at Maseada till the place had like to have been taken by the Parthians men 328 book xrr ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS water Insomuch that on this occasion Jo seph Herod s brother was contriving to run away from it with two hundred of his de pendents to the Arabians For he had heard that Malchus repented of the offences he had been guilty of with regard to Herod But God by sending rain in the night time pre vented his going away for their cisterns were thereby filled and he was under no ne cessity of removing on that account But they were now of good courage and the more so because the sending that plenty of water which they had been sadly in want of seemed a mark of Divine providence So they made a sally and fought hand to hand with Antigonus s soldiers and destroyed a great number of them At the same time Ventidius the general of the Romans was sent out of Syria to drive the Parthians out of it and marched after them into Judea in pretence indeed to succour Joseph but in reality the whole affair was no more than a stratagem in order to get money of Antigo nus So they pitched their camp very near to Jerusalem and obtained a great deal of money from Antigonus and then he retired himself with the greater part of the army But that the wickedness he had been guilty of might not be found out he left a certain part of his soldiers under the command of Silo with whom also Antigonus cultivated an acquaintance that he might cause him no disturbance and was still in hopes that the Parthians would come again and defend him CHAP XV OF HEROd s RETURN FROM ITALY AND HIS SUCCESSES AGAINST HIS ENEMIES BY this time Herod had sailed out of Italy to Ptolemais and had gotten together a numerous army both of strangers and of his own countrymen and marched through Galilee against Antigonus Silo also and Ventidius came and assisted him being per suaded by Dellius who was sent by Antony to assist in bringing back Herod Now Ven tidius was employed in appeasing the disturb ances that had been made in the cities by the means of the Parthians And Silo was in Judea but corrupted by Antigonus How ever as Herod went along his army increased every day and all Galilee with some small exceptions joined him But as he was march ing to those that were in Massada for he was obliged to endeavour to save those that were in that fortress now they were be sieged because they were his relations Joppa was a hindrance to him For it was necessary for him to take that place first it being a city at variance with him that no strong hold might be left in his enemies hands behind him when he should goto Jerusalem And when Silo made this a pretence for ri sing up from Jerusalem and was thereupon pursued by the Jews Herod fell upon them with a small body of men and both put the Jews to flight and saved Silo when he was very unable to defend himself But when Herod had taken Joppa he made haste to liberate those of his family that were in Mas sada Now of the people of the country some joined him because of the friendship they had had with his father and some because of the splendid appearance he made and others by way of requital for the benefits they had received from both of them but the greatest number came to him in hopes of getting somewhat from him afterward if he were once firmly settled in the kingdom Herod had now a strong army And as he marched on Antigonus laid snares and ambushes in the passes and places most pro per for them But in truth he thereby did little or no damage to the enemy So Herod received those of his family out of Massada and the fortress Ressa and then went on for Jerusalem The soldiery also that was with Silo accompanied him all along as did many of the citizens being afraid of his power And as soon as he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city the soldiers that were set to guard that part shot their arrows and threw their darts at him And when some sallied out in a crowd and came to fight hand to hand with the first ranks of Herod s army he gave orders that they should in the first place make proclamation about the wall that he came for the good of the people and for the preservation of he tioned both here and Of the War I 15 is an indication that it was now summer time which agrees to my deter mination of the time of the year when Herod was made king at Rome See Harm of the Evang page 150 151  An 39 AN 39 529 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS city and not to bear any old grudge at even his most open enemies but was ready to forget the offences which his greatest adver saries had done him But Antigonus by way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed and this before the Romans and before Silo also said that they would not do justly if they gave the kingdom to Herod who was no more than a private man and an Idumean i e a half Jew whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal family as their custom was For that in case they at present bare any ill will to him and had resolved to deprive him of the kingdom as having received it from the Parthians yet were there many others of his family that might by their flaw take it and these such as had no way offended the Ro mans and being of sacerdotal family it would be an unworthy thing to put them by Now while they said thus one to another and fell to reproaching one another on both sides Antigonus permitted his own men that were upon the wall to defend themselves Who using their bows and shewing great alacrity against their enemies easily drove them away from the towers And now it was that Silo discovered that he had taken bribes For he set a good number of his soldiers to complain aloud of the want of provisions they were in and to require money to buy them food and that it was fit to let them go into places proper for winter quarters since the places near the city were a desert by reason that Antigonus s soldiers had carried all away So he set the army upon removing and endeavoured to inarch away But Herod pressed Silo not to depart and exhorted Silo s captains and soldiers not to desert him when Caesar and Antony and the senate had sent him thither For that he would provide them plenty of all the things they wanted and easily procure them a great abundance of what they re quired After which entreaty he immediately went out into the country and left not the least pretence to Silo for his departure For  This affirmation of Antigonus s spoken in the days of Herod and in a manner to his face that he was an Idumean i e a half Jew seems to me of much greater authority than that pretence of his favourite and flatterer Nicolaus of Damascus that he derived his pedigree from the Jews as far hackward as the Babylonish captivity chap 1 Accordingly Josephus always esteems him an he brought an unexpected quantity of provi sions and sent to those friends of his who inhabited about Samaria to bring down corn and wine and oil and cattle and all other provisions to Jericho that there might be no want of a supply for the soldiers for the time to come Antigonus was sensible of this and sent presently over the country such as might restrain and lie in ambush for those that went out for provisions So these men obeyed the orders of Antigonus and got together a great number of armed men about Jericho and sat about the mountains and watched those that brought the provisions However Herod was not idle in the mean time For he took ten bands of soldiers of whom five were of the Romans and five of the Jews with some mercenaries among them and with some few horsemen and came to Jericho And as they found the city de serted but that five hundred of them had settled themselves on the tops of the hills with their wives and children those he took and sent away But the Romans fell upon the city and plundered it and found the houses full of all sorts of good things So the king left a garrison at Jericho and came back again and sent the Roman army to take their winter quarters in the countries that were come over to him Judea and Galilee and Samaria And so much did An tigonus gain of Silo for the bribes he gave him that part of the army should be quar tered at Lidda in order to please Antony So the Romans laid their weapons aside and lived in plenty of all things Herod however was not pleased with lying still but sent out his brother Joseph against Idumea with two thousand armed footmen and four hundred horsemen while himself came to Samaria and left his mother and his other relations there for they were already gone out of Massada and went into Galilee to take certain places which were held by the garrisons of Antigonus And he passed on to Sepphoris as God sent a snow while Antigonus s garrisons withdrew them Idumean though he says his father Anti pater was of the same people with the Jews chap 8 and hy birth a Jew XX 8 as indeed all such proselytes of justice as the Idu means XIII 9 were in time esteemed the very same people with the Jews t Deut xvii 15 530 book ht ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS selves and had great plenty of provisions He also went thence and resolved to destroy those robbers that dwelt in the caves and did much mischief in the country So he sent a troop of horsemen and three compa nies of armed footmen against them They were very near a village called Arbela And on the fortieth day after he came himself with his whole army And as the enemy sallied out boldly upon him the left wing of his army gave way But appearing with a body of men put those to flight who were already conquerors and recalled his men that ran away He also pressed upon his enemies and pursued them as far as the river Jordan though they ran away by different roads So he brought over to him all Gali lee excepting those that dwelt in the caves and distributed money to every one of his soldiers giving them a hundred and fifty drachmae apiece and much more to their captains and sent them into winter quarters At which time Silo came to him and his com manders with him because Antigonus would not give them provisions any longer for he supplied them for no more than one month Nay he had sent to all the country about and ordered them to carry off the provisions that were there and retire to the mountains that the Romans might have no provisions to live upon and so might perish by famine But Herod committed the care of that matter to Pheroras his youngest brother and ordered him to repair Alexandrium Accordingly he quickly made the soldiers abound with great plenty of provisions and rebuilt Alexandrium which had been before desolate About this time it was that Antony con tinued some time at Athens and Ventidius who was now in Syria sent for Silo and com manded him to assist Herod in the first place to finish the present war and then to send for their confederates for the war they them selves were engaged in But as for Herod he went in haste against the robbers that were in the caves and sent Silo away to Ven tidius while he marched against them These caves were in mountains that were exceeding abrupt and in their middle were no other than precipices with certain entrances into the caves and those caves were encom passed with sharp rocks And in these did the robbers lie concealed with all their fa milies about them But the king caused cer tain chests to be made in order to destroy them and to be hung down bound about with iron chains by an engine from the top of the mountains It being not possible to get up to them by reason of the sharp ascent of the mountains nor to creep down to them from above Now these chests were filled with armed men who had long hooks in their hands by which they might pull out such as resisted them and then tumble them down and kill them by so doing But the letting the chests down proved to be a matter of great danger because of the vast depth they were to be letdown although they had their provisions in the chests themselves But when the chests were let down and not one of those in the mouths of the caves durst come near them but lay still out of fear some of the armed men girt on their armour and by both of their hands took hold of the chain by which the chests were let down and went into the mouths of the caves because they fretted that such delay was made by the rob bers not daring to come out of the caves And when they were at any of these mouths they first killed many of those that were in the mouths with their darts and afterward pulled those to them that resisted them with their hooks and tumbled them down the pre cipices and afterwards went into the caves and killed many more and then went into their chests again and lay still there But upon this terror seized the rest when they heard the lamentations that were made and they despaired of escaping However when the night came on that put an end to the whole work And as the king proclaimed pardon by a herald to such as delivered themselves up to him many accepted of the offer The same method of assault was made use of the next day and they went farther and got out in baskets to fight them and fought them at their doors and sent fire among them and set their caves on fire for there was a great deal of combustible matter within them Now there was one old man who was caught within one of these caves with a wife and seven children these prayed him to give them leave to go out and yield themselves up to the enemy but he stood at the cave s mouth and always slew that child of his who went out until he had destroyed AN 39 531 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS them every one and after that he slew his wife and cast their dead bodies down the precipice and himself after them and so un derwent death rather than slavery But be fore he did this he greatly reproached Herod with the meanness of his family although he was then king Herod also saw what he was doing and stretched out his hand and offered him all manner of security for his life By which means all these caves were at length subdued entirely When the king had sent Ptolemy over these parts of the country as his general he went to Samaria with six hundred horsemen and three thousand armed footmen as intending to fight Antigonus But still this command of the army did not succeed well with Pto lemy but those that had been troublesome to Galilee before attacked him and slew him and when they had done this they fled among the lakes and places almost inaccessible laying waste and plundering whatsoever they could come at in those places But Herod soon returned and punished them for what they had done For some of these rebels he slew and others of them who had fled to the strong holds he besieged and both slew them and demolished their strong holds And when he had thus put an end to their rebel lion he laid a fine upon the cities of a hun dred talents In the mean time Pacorus was fallen in a battle and the Parthians were defeated when Ventidius sent Macheras to the assistance of Herod with two legions and a thousand horsemen while Antony encouraged him to make haste But Macheras at the instiga tion of Antigonus without the approbation of Herod as being corrupted by money went about to take a view of his affairs But Anti gonus suspecting this intention of his coming did not admit him into the city but kept him at a distance with slinging stones at him and plainly shewed what he himself meant But when Macheras was sensible that Herod had given him good advice and that he had made a mistake in not hearkening to that ad vice he retired to the city Emmaus and what Jews he met with he slew whether they were enemies or friends out of the rage he was in at what hardships he had undergone  On the 18th of July according to Pagi VOL I â NOS 45  46 The king was provoked at this conduct and went to Samaria and resolved to go to An tony about these affairs and to inform him that he stood in no need of such helpers who did him more mischief than they did his ene mies and that he was able of himself to beat Antigonus But Macheras followed him and desired that he would not go to Antony or if he were resolved to go that he would join his brother Joseph with him and let them fight against Antigonus So he was reconciled to Macheras upon his earnest entreaties Ac cordingly he left Joseph there with his army but charged him to run no hazards nor to quarrel with Macheras But for his own part he hastened to An tony who was then at the siege of Samo sata a place upon Euphrates with his troops both horsemen and footmen to be auxiliaries to him And when he came to Antioch and met there a great number of men that were very desirous to go to Antony but durst not venture to go out of fear because the Barba rians fell upon men on the road and slew many he encouraged them and became their conductor upon the road Now when they were within two days march of Samosata the Barbarians had laid an ambush to disturb those that came to Antony and where the woods made the passes narrow as they led to the plains there they laid not a few of their horsemen who were to lie still until those passengers were gone by into the wide place Now as soon as the first ranks were gone by for Herod brought on the rear those that lay in ambush who were about five hundred fell upon them on the sudden and when they had put the foremost to flight the king came riding hard with the forces that were about him and immediately drove back the enemy By which means he emboldened his own men to go on insomuch that those who ran away before now returned back and the Barba rians were slain on all sides The king also went on killing them and recovered all the baggage among which were a great number of beasts for burden and of slaves and pro ceeded on in his march And whereas there were a great number of those in the woods that attacked them and were near the passage that led into the plain he made a sally upon these also with a strong body of men and put them to flight and slew many of them and 4 O 532 book XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS thereby rendered the way safe for those that came after And these called Herod their saviour and protector And when he was near to Samosata An tony sent out his army in all their proper ha biliments to meet him in order to pay Herod this respect and because of the assistance he had given him For he had heard what attacks the Barbarians had made upon him in Judea He also was very glad to see him there as having been made acquainted with the great actions he had performed upon the road So he entertained him very kindly and could not but admire his courage An tony also embraced him as soon as he saw him and saluted him after a most affectionate manner and gave him the upper hand as having himself lately made him a king And in a little time Antiochus delivered up the fortress and on that account this war was at an end Then Antony committed the rest to Sosius and gave him orders to assist Herod and went himself to Egypt Accordingly Sosius sent two legions before into Judea to the assistance of Herod and he followed him self with the body of the army Now Joseph was already slain in Judea in the following manner He forgot what charge his brother Herod had given him when he went to Antony And when he had pitched his camp among the mountains for Mache ras had lent him five regiments he went hastily to Jericho in order to reap the corn thereto belonging And as the Roman regi ments were but newly raised and were un skilful in war for they were in great part collected out of Syria he was attacked by the enemy and caught in those places of dif ficulty and was himself slain as he was fighting bravely and the whole army was lost For there were six regiments slain So when Antigonus had got possession of the dead bodies he cut off Joseph s head al though Pheroras his brother would have re deemed it at the price of fifty talents After this defeat the Galileans revolted from their commanders and took those of Herod s party and drowned them in the lake and a great part of Judea was become seditious But Mache ras fortified the place Gitta in Samaria At this time messengers came to Herod and informed him of what had been done and when he was come to Daphne by Antioch they told him of the ill fortune that had befal len his brother But this he had expected from certain visions that appeared to him in his dreams which clearly foreshewed his brother s death So he hastened his march and when he came to mount Libanus he received about eight hundred of the men of that place having already with him also one Roman legion and with these he came to Ptolemais He also marched thence by night with his army and proceeded along Galilee Here it was that the enemy met him and fought him and were defeated and shut up in the same place of strength whence they had sallied out the day before So he attacked the place in the morning But by reason of a great storm that was then very violent he was able to do nothing but drew off his army into the neighbouring villages Yet as soon as the other legion that Antony sent him was come to his assistance those that were in garrison in the place were afraid and deserted it in the night time Then did the king march hastily to Jericho intending to avenge himself on the enemy for the slaughter of liis brother And when he had pitched his tents he made a feast for the principal commanders and after this collation was over and he had dis missed his guests he retired to his own cham ber And nere may one see what kindness God had for the king For the upper part of the house fell down when no body was in it and so killed none insomuch that all the people believed that Herod was beloved of God since he had escaped such a great and surprising danger But the next day six thousand of the enemy came down from the tops of the mountains to fight the Romans which greatly terrified them And the soldiers that were in light armour came near and pelted the king s guards that were come out with darts and stones and one of them struck him on the side with a dart Antigonus also sent a com mander against Samaria whose name was Pappus with some forces being desirous to shew the enemy how potent he was and that he had men to spare in his war with them He sat down to oppose Macheras But He rod when he had taken five cities took such as were left in them being about two thou sand and slew them and burnt the cities themselves and then returning to go against AH 38 533 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Pappus who was encamped at a village call ed lsanas And there ran in to him many out of Jericho and Judea near to which places he was and the enemy fell upon his men so stout were they at this time and joined battle with them But he defeated them in the fight and in order to be revenged on them for the slaughter of his brother he pursued them sharply and killed them as they ran away And as the houses were full of armed men and many of them ran as far as the tops of the houses he got them under his power and pulled down the roofs of the houses and saw the lower rooms full of soldiers that were caught and lay all on a heap So they threw stones down upon them as they lay piled one upon another and thereby killed them Nor was there a more frightful spectacle in all the war than this where beyond the walls an immense multitude of dead men lay heaped one upon another This action it was which chiefly damped the spirits of the enemy who expected now what would come For there appeared a mighty number of people that came from places far distant that were now about the village but then ran away And had it not been for the depth of winter which then restrained them the king s army had pre sently gone to Jerusalem as being very cou rageous at this good success and the whole work had been done immediately For Anti gonus was already considering how he might flee away and leave the city At this time the king gave order that the soldiers should go to supper for it was late at night while he went into a chamber to use the bath for he was very weary And here it was that he was in the greatest danger which yet by God s providence he escaped For he was naked and had but one servant that followed him to be with him while he was bathing in an inner room certain of the enemy who were in their armour and had fled thither out of fear were then in the place And as he was bathing the first of them came out with his sword drawn and went out at the doors and after him a second and a third armed in like manner and were un der such a consternation that they did no hurt to the king and thought themselves to have come off very well in suffering no harm themselves in their getting out of the house However on the next day he cut off the head of Pappus for he was already slain and sent it to Pheroras as a punishment of what their brother had suffered by his means for he was the man that slew him with his own hand Whenf the rigour of winter was over He rod removed his army and came near to Je rusalem and pitched his camp hard by the city Now this was the third year since he had been made king at Rome And as he remoi ed his camp and came near that part of the wall where he could be most easily assaulted he pitched that camp before the temple intending to make his attacks in the same manner as did Pompey So he encom passed the place with three bulwarks and erected towers and employed a great many hands about the work and cut down the trees that were round about the city and when he had appointed proper persons to oversee the works even while the army lay before the city he himself went to Samaria to complete his marriage and to take to wife the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus For he had betrothed her al ready as I have Jbefore related CHAP XVI HEROD AFTER HIS MARRIAGE WITH MARIANNE TAKES JERUSALEM BV FORCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SO SIUS AND PUTS AN END TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ASMONEANS AFTER the wedding was over Sosius came through Phoenicia having sent his army over the midland parts He also who was their commander came himself with a great number of horsemen and foot men The king also came from Samaria and brought with him a numerous army be sides that which was there before for they were about thirty thousand And they all met together at the walls of Jerusalem and  It may be worthy our observation here that these soldiers of Herod s coold not have gotten upon the tops of these houses which were full of enemies

ladders on the outside See Matt xxiv 17 Mark xiii 15 Luke v 19 xvii 31 t An 37 J See chap 12 402 534 book xiv ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS encamped at the north wall of the city being now an army of eleven legions armed men on foot and six thousand horsemen with other auxiliaries out of â Syria The generals were two viz Sosius sent by Antony to assist He rod and Herod on his own account in order to take the government from Antigonus who was declared an enemy at Rome and that he might himself be king according to the decree of the senate Now the Jews that were enclosed within the walls of the city fought against Herod with great alacrity and zeal for the whole nation was gathered together they also gave out many prophecies respecting the temple and many things agreeable to the people as if God would deliver them out of the dangers they were in They had also carried off what was out of the city that they might not leave any thing to afford sustenance for men or for beasts and by private robberies they made the want of necessaries greater When Herod understood this he opposed ambushes in the fittest places against their private rob beries and sent legions of armed men to bring in provisions and that from remote places so that in a little time they had great plenty Now the three bulwarks were easily erected because so many hands were conti nually at work upon them For it was sum mer time and there was nothing to hinder them in raising their works neither from the air nor from the workmen So they brought their engines to bear and shook the wall of the city and tried all manner of ways to get in Yet did not these within discover any fear but they also contrived not a few en gines to oppose those of the besiegers They also sallied out and burnt not only those en gines that were not yet perfected but those that were and when they came hand to hand their attempts were not less bold than those of the Romans though they were inferior to them in skill They also erected new works when the former were ruined and making mines under ground they met each other and fought there and making use of brutish cou rage rather than of prudent valour they per sisted in this war to the very last And this they did while a mighty army lay round about thetn and while they were distressed by famine and the want of necessaries for this happened to be a sabbatic year The first that scaled the walls were twenty chosen men the next were Sosius s centurions t or the first wall was taken in forty days and the second in fifteen more when some of the cloisters that were about the temple were burnt which Herod gave out to have been burnt by Antigonus in order to expose him to the hatred of the Jews And when the outer court of the temple and the lower city were taken the Jews fled into the inner court of the temple and into the upper city But now fear ing lest the Romans should prevent them from offering their daily sacrifices to God they sent an ambassage and desired that they would only permit them to bring in beasts for sa crifices This Herod granted hoping they were going to yield But when he saw that they did nothing of what he supposed but bitterly opposed him in order to preserve the kingdom to Antigonus he made an assault upon the city and took it by storm And now all parts were full of those that were slain by the rage of the Romans at the long duration of the siege and by the zeal of the Jews that were on Herod s side who were not willing to leave one of their adversaries alive So they were murdered continually in the narrow streets and in the houses by crowds and as they were fleeing to the temple for shelter and there was no pity taken of either infants or the aged nor did they spare so much as the weaker sex Nay although the king sent about and besought them to spare the people yet nobody restrained their hand from slaughter but as if they were a com pany of madmen they fell upon persons of all ages without distinction And then Anti gonus without regard to either his past or present circumstances came down from the citadel and fell down at the feet of Sosius He however took no pity of him in the change of his fortune but insulted him be yond measure and called him  Antigone Yet  did not he treat him as if he were a woman by letting him go at liberty but put him into bonds and kept him in close custody And now Herod had overcome his enemies his care was to govern those foreigners who had been his assistants For the crowd of strangers rushed to see the temple and the sacred things it contained But the king thinking a victory to be a more severe al  Antigone is the name of a woman an 38 535 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS fliction than a defeat if any of those things which it was not lawful to see should be seen by them used entreaties and threatenings and even sometimes force itself to restrain them He also prohibited the ravage that was made in the city and many times asked Sosius whether the Romans would empty the city both of money and men and leave him king of a desert and told him that he es teemed the dominion over the whole habitable earth as by no means an equivalent satisfac tion for such a murder of his citizens And when Sosius said that this plunder was justly to be permitted the soldiers for the siege they had undergone he replied that he would give every one their reward out of his own money And by this means he redeemed what re mained of the city from destruction and he performed what he had promised For he gave a noble donation to every soldier and a proportionable present to their commanders but a most royal present to Sosius himself till they all went away laden with money This destruction befell the city of Jerusa lem when Marcus Agrippa and Caninius Gal lus were consuls of Rome t on the hundred and eighty fifth Olympiad on the third month on the solemnity of the fast As if a periodical revolution of calamities had re turned since that which befell the Jews under Pompey For the Jews were taken by him on the same day and this was after twenty seven years time So when Sosius had dedi cated a crown of gold to God he marched away from Jerusalem and carried Antigonus with him in bonds to Antony But Herod was afraid lest Antigonus should be kept in prison only by Antony and that when he was carried to Rome by him he might get his cause to be heard by the senate and might demonstrate as he was himself of the royal blood and Herod but a private man that therefore it belonged to his sons to haye the kingdom on account of the family they were of in case he had himself offended the Ro mans by what he had done Out of Herod s fear of this it was that he by giving Antony a great deal of money endeavoured to persuade him to have Antigonus slain which if it were once done he should be free from that fear And thus did the government of the Asmo neans cease a hundred and twenty six years after it was set up This family was a splen did and illustrious one both on account of the nobility of their stock and of the dignity of the high priesthood as also for the glori ous actions their ancestors had performed for our nation But these men lost the govern ment by their dissensions with each other and it then came to Herod the son of Anti pater who was of a vulgar family and of no eminent extraction but one that was subject to other kings And this is what history tells us was the end of the Asmonean family  Note here that Josephus fully and frequently assures us that there passed above three years between Herod s first obtaining the kingdom at Rome and his second obtaining it upon the taking of Jerusalem and death of Antigonus The present history of this interval twice mentions the army s going into winter quarters which perhaps belonged to two several winters chap 15 And though Josephus says nothing how long they lay in those quarters yet does he give such an account of the long and studied delays of Ventidius Silo and Macheras who were to see Herod settled in his new kingdom but seem not to have had sufficient force for that purpose and were certainly all corrupted by Antigonus to make the longest delays possible and gives us such particular ac counts of the many great actions of Herod s during the same interval as fairly imply that interval before Herod went to Samosata to have been very considerable How ever what is wanting in Josephus is fully supplied by Moses Chorenensis the Armenian historian in his history of the same interval II 18 19 50 Where he directly assures us that Tigranes when king of Armenia and the manager of this Parthian war reigned two years after Herod was made king at Rome and yet Antony did not hear of his death in that very neighbourhood at Samo sata till he was come thither to besiege it After which Herod brought him an army which was 340 miles march and through a difficult country full of enemies also and joined with him in the siege of Samosata till that city was taken After which Herod and Sosius marched back with their larger armies the same number of 340 miles and when in a little time they sat down to besiege Jerusalem they were not able to take it but by a siege of five months All which put together fully supplies what is wanting in Josephus and secures the entire chronology of these times beyond contradiction But then if we inquire into the true occasions of this long delay in the settlement of Herod in his new kingdom after he had been declared king at Rome we shall easily find by Josephus himself that the Roman lieutenants Ventidius Silo and Mache ras who were to see Herod settled in the kingdom were not in earnest to do it Nor was any such design shewn in earnest till after he had been with Antony himself and assisted him in the taking of Samosata Upon which a new general Sosius was sent with a sufficient force and full commission to see it done effectually and after which it appears that the war went on in earnest continually against Antigonus till Jerusalem and himself were taken by Sosius and Herod and Herod was fully settled in the kingdom of Judea t On the third year of the 185th Olympiad 536 book xv ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK XV Containing an Interval of Eighteen Years FROM THE DEATH OP ANTIGONUS TO THE FINISHING OF THE TEMPLE BY HEROD CHAP I CONCERNING FOLLIO AND SAMEAS HEROD SLAYS THE PRINCIPAL OF ANTIOONUS S FRIENDS AND SPOILS THE CITY OF ITS WEALTH ANTONY BEHEADS ANTIGONUS HAVING already related the reduction of Jerusalem by Sosius and Herod and the taking of Antigonus captive we will now proceed in the narration And since Herod had now the government of all Judea put into his hands he promoted such of the private men in the city as had been of his party but never left off avenging and punish ing every day those that had adhered to the party of his enemies But Pollio the Pha risee and Sameas a disciple of his were honoured by him above all the rest For when Jerusalem was besieged they advised the citizens to receive Herod for which advice they were well requited But this Pollio at the time when Herod was once upon his trial of life and death foretold in way of reproach to Hyrcanus and the other judges how this Herod whom they suffered now to escape would afterward inflict pun ishment on them all Which had its com pletion in time while God fulfilled the words he had spoken Herod having Jerusalem now under his power carried off all the royal ornaments and spoiled the wealthy men of what they had gotten and when by these means he had amassed a great quantity of silver and gold he gave it to Antony and to his friends that were about him He also slew forty five of the principal men of Antigonus s party and set guards at the gates of the city that nothing might be carried out together with their dead bodies They also searched the dead and whatsoever was found either of silver or gold or other treasure it was carried to the king Nor was there any end of the miseries he brought upon them and this distress was partly occasioned by the covetousness of the prince regnant and partly by the sabbatic year which was still going on and forced the country to lie still uncultivated since we are forbidden to sow our land in that year Now when Antony had received Antigonus as his captive he determined to keep him against his triumph But when he heard that the na tion grew seditious and that out of their ha tred to Herod they continued to bear good will to Antigonus he fresolved to behead him at Antioch for otherwise the Jews could no way be brought to be quiet J And Strabo  How Josephus could say as it now stands in all his copies but one that it was Pollio the master and not Sameas the sdholar who foretold that Herod would one day slay the Sanhedrim of the Jews and Hyrcanus whereas he had lately told us in all his copies that it was Sameas and not Pollio XIV 9 does not appear Yet since one copy even in this place says it was Sameas that may well be supposed to be the true reading Other wise it must be allowed as a slip of either Josephus s pen or memory which now and then happens to the most careful writers t That Antony put this Antigonus to death is con firmed besides the testimony of Strabo produced here in the text by Josephus himself by Plutarch and Dio as Dean Aldrich takes notice upon this occasion in his notes On the War I 18 and Hudson and Reland on the place before us I Herod not thinking himself safe in his kingdom as long as this remainder of the old royal family continued alive never left soliciting Antony till at length by a great sum of money he obtained that this poor prince should be put to death to which he having been condemned by a kÂ 37 537 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS of Cappadocia attests to what I have said when he thus speaks Antony ordered An tigonus the Jew to be brought to Antioch and there to be beheaded And this Antony seems to have been the very first man who beheaded a king as supposing he could no other way bend the minds of the Jews so as to receive Herod whom he had made king in his stead For by no torments could they be forced to call him king so great a fondness they retained for their former king So he thought that this dishonourable death would diminish the value they had for Antigonus s memory and at the same time would dimi nish their hatred to Herod CHAP II OF THE LIBERATION OF HYRCANUS BY THE PARTHIANS AND OF THE ACTIONS OF ALEXANDRA WHEN SHE HEARD THAT ANANELUS WAS MADE HIGH PRIEST NOW after Herod was in possession of the kingdom Hyrcanus the high priest who was then a captive among the Parthians came to him again and was set free from his captivity in the following manner Barza pharnes and Pacorus the generals of the Par thians took Hyrcanus who was first made high priest and afterward king and Herod s brother Phasaelus captives and were car rying them away into Parthia Phasaelus in deed could not bear the reproach of being in bonds and thinking that death with glory was better than any life whatsoever he be came his own executioner as I have for merly related But when Hyrcanus was brought into Par thia the king Phraates treated him after a very gentle manner as having already learn ed of what an illustrious family he was On which account he set him free from his bonds and gave him a habitation at fBabylon where there were Jews in great numbers The Jews honoured Hyrcanus as their high formal sentence in Judicature this sentence was executed upon him in the same manner as upon a common crimi nal by the rods and axe of the victor which the Romans never before subjected any crowned head to Prideaux s Connection part II book 7 B priest and king as did all the Jewish nation that dwelt as far as Euphrates This respect was very much to his satisfaction But when he was informed that Herod had received the kingdom new hopes came upon him as hav ing been himself from the beginning of a kind disposition towards him and expecting that Herod would bear in mind what favour he had received from him when he was upon his trial and when he was in danger that a capi tal sentence would be pronounced against him he delivered him from that danger and from all punishment Accordingly he talked of that matter with the Jews that came often to him with great affection But they en deavoured to retain him among them and de sired that he would stay with them remind ing him of the kind offices and honours they did him and that those honours they paid him were not inferior to what they could pay to either their high priests or their kings And what was a greater motive to determine him they said was this that he could not have those dignities in Judea because of that maim in his body which had been in flicted on him by Antigonus and that kings do not use to requite men for those kindnesses which they received when they were private persons the height of their fortune making usually no small changes in them Now although they suggested these argu ments to him for his own advantage yet did Hyrcanus still desire to depart Herod also wrote to him and persuaded him to desire of Phraates and the Jews that were there that they should not grudge him the royal autho rity which he should have jointly with him self For that now was the proper time for himself to make him amends for the favours he had received from him as having been brought up by him and saved by him also as well as for Hyrcanus to receive it And as he wrote thus to Hyrcanus so did he send also Saramallas his ambassador to Phraates  See Book XIV chap 13 t The city here called Babylon by Josephus seems to be one which was built by some of the Seleucidae upon the Tigris which long after the utter desolation of old Babylon was commonly so called and I suppose not far from Seleucia Just as the latter adjoining city Bagdat had been and is often called by the same old name of Babylon till this very day And a plain reason occurs here which shews that Josephus meant no other than a city built on the Tigris and this from his own way of speaking immediately that not only the Jews at this Ba bylon but over all the country as far as Euphrates paid this honour to Hyrcanus Which surely implies that this Babylon did not lie upon Euphrates as the old Babylon certainly did See Prideaux at the year 239 at large 38 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS â and many presents with him and desired him in the most obliging way that he would be no hindrance to his gratitude toward his benefactor But this zeal of Herod s did not flow from that principle but because he had been made governor of that country without having any just claim to it he was afraid afterward of a change in his condi tion and so made what haste he could to get Hyrcanus into his power or indeed to put him quite out of the way Which last thing he effected Accordingly when Hyrcanus came full of assurance by the permission of the king of Parthia and at the expense of the Jews who supplied him with money Herod received him with all possible respect and gave him the upper place at public meetings and set him above all the rest at feasts and thereby deceived him He called him his father and endeavoured by all the ways possible that he might have no suspicion of any treacherous design against him He also did other things in order to secure his government which yet occasioned a sedition in his own family For being cautious how he made any illustrious person the high priest of God he sent for an obscure priest out of Babylon whose name was Ananelus and bestowed the high priest hood upon him However Alexandra the daughter of Hyr canus and wife of Alexander the son of Aristobulus the king who had also brought Alexander two children could not bear this indignity Now this son was one of the greatest comeliness and was called Aristo bulus and the daughter Mariamne was mar ried to Herod and eminent for her beauty also This Alexandra was much disturbed and took the indignity offered to her son exceeding ill that while he was alive any one else should be sent for to have the dig nity of the high priesthood conferred upon him Accordingly she wrote to Cleopatra a musician assisting her in taking care to have her letters carried to desire her in tercession with Antony in order to gain the high priesthood for her son But as Antony was slow in granting this request his friend fDellius came into Judea upon some affairs and when he saw Aristo bulus he stood in admiration at the tallness and handsomeness of the child and no less at Mariamne the king s wife and was open in his commendations of Alexandra as the mother of most beautiful children And when she came to discourse with him he persuaded her to get pictures drawn of them both and to send them to Antony for that when he saw them he would deny her nothing that she should ask Accordingly Alexandra was elevated with these words of his and sent the pictures to Antony Dellius also talked extravagantly and said that these children seemed not derived from men but from some god His design in doing so was to entice Antony into lewd pleasures with them He was ashamed to send for the damsel as being the wife of Herod and avoided it because of the reproaches he should have from Cleo patra on that account but he sent in the most decent manner he could for the young man but added this withal Unless he thought it hard upon him so to do When this letter was brought to Herod he did not think it safe to send one so handsome as was Aristobulus in the prime of his life for he was sixteen years of age and of so noble a family and particularly not to Antony the principal man among the Romans and the one that would abuse him in his amours and besides one that openly indulged himself in such pleasures as his power allowed him without control He therefore wrote back to him that If this boy should only go out of the country all would be in a state of war and uproar because the Jews were in hopes of a change in the government and to have another king over them When Herod had thus excused himself to  Here we have an eminent example of Herod s worldly and profane politics when by the abuse of his unlawful and usurped power to make whom he pleased high priest in the person of Ananelus he occasioned such disturbances in his kingdom and in his own family as suffered him to enjoy no lasting peace or tranquillity ever afterward And such is frequently the effect of profane court politics about matters of religion in other ages and nations The Old Testament is full of the miseries of the people of the Jews derived from such court politics especially in and after the days of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin who gave the most per nicious example of it who brought on the grossest cor ruption of religion by it and the punishment of whose family for it was most remarkable The case is too well known to require particular citations t Of this wicked Dellius see the note On the War I 15 An 36 539 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Antony he resolved that he would not en tirely permit the child or Alexandra to be treated dishonourably But his wife Mari amne urged him vehemently to restore the high priesthood to her brother and he judged it was for his advantage so to do because if he once had that dignity he could not go out of the country So he called his friends to gether and told them that Alexandra pri vately conspired against his royal authority and endeavoured by means of Cleopatra so to bring it about that he might be deprived of the government and that by Antony s means this youth might have the management of public affairs in his stead And that this pro cedure of hers was unjust since she would at the same time deprive her daughter of the dignity she now had and would bring dis turbances upon the kingdom for which he had taken a great deal of pains and had got ten it with extraordinary hazards that yet while he well remembered her wicked prac tices he would not leave off doing what was right himself but would even now give the youth the high priesthood and that he for merly set up Ananelus because Aristobulus was then so very young a child Now when he had said this not at random but as he thought with the best discretion he had in order to deceive the women and those friends whom he had taken to consult withal Alex andra out of the great joy she had at this un expected promise and out of fear from the suspicions she lay under burst into tears and made the following apology for herself and said that As to the high priesthood she was very much concerned for the disgrace her son was under and so did her utmost en deavours to procure it for him but that as to the kingdom she had made no attempts and that if it were offered her for her son she would not accept it And that now she would be satisfied with her son s dignity while he himself held the civil government  When Josephus says here in his Greek copies that this Ananelus the new high priest was of the stock of the high priests we must remember that the Latin version in all copies has not a syllable of any such clause And since in all copies he had been just telling us that he was a priest of an obscure family or character chap 2 it is not probable that he could so soon say that he was of the stock of the high priests However Josephus here makes a remarkable observation that this Ananelus was the third that was ever unjustly and wickedly turned out voL I â NOS 45  46 and she had thereby the security that arose from his peculiar ability in governing to all the remainder of her family that she was now overcome by his benefits and thankfully accepted of this honour shewn by him to her son and that she would hereafter be entirely obedient And she desired him to excuse her if the nobility of her family and that freedom of acting which she thought that allowed her had made her act too precipi tately and imprudently in this matter So when they had spoken thus to one another they came to an agreement and all suspi cions seemed to have vanished away CHAP III ARISTOBULUS IS HADE HIGH PRIEST BUT AFTERWARDS MURDERED BY THE ORDER OF HEROD WHO APOLOGIZES TO ANTONY ALSO CONCERNING JOSEPH AND MAR1AMNE HEROD now took the high priesthood from Ananelus who as we said be fore was not of this country but one of those Jews that had been carried captive beyond Euphrates For there were many thousands of this people who had been carried captive and dwelt about Babylonia whence Ananelus came He was one of the stock of the high priests and had been of old a particular friend of Herod s And when he was first made king he conferred that dignity upon him and now put him out of it again in or der to quiet the troubles in his family though what he did was plainly unlawful For on no preceding occasion was any one that had once been in that dignity deprived of it It was Antiochus Epiphanes who first brake that law and deprived Jesus and made his brother Onias high priest in his stead Aristobulus was the second that did so and took that dignity from his brother Hyrcanus And this Herod was the third who took that high office from Ananelus and gave it to this young man Aristobulus of the high priesthood by the civil power No king or governor having ventured to do so that Josephus knew of but that heathen tyrant and persecutor Antiochus Epi phanes that barbarous parricide Aristobulus the first that assumed royal authority among the Maccabees and this tyrant king Herod the Great although afterward that infamous practice became frequent till the very de struction of Jerusalem when the office of high priesthood was at an end 4 P 540 book TV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS â Herod now seemed to have healed the di visions in his family Yet was he not without suspicion as is frequently the case of people seeming to be reconciled to one another but as Alexandra had already made attempts tending to innovations so did he fear that she would go on therein if she found a fit oppor tunity for so doing So he gave a command that she should dwell in the palace and med dle with no public affairs Her guards also were so careful that nothing she did in pri vate life every day was concealed These hardships gradually put her out of patience and she began to hate Herod For as she had the pride of a woman to the utmost de gree she had great indignation at this sus picious guard that was about her as desirous rather to undergo any thing that could befall her than to be deprived of her liberty of speech and under the notion of an honorary guard to live in a state of slavery and terror She therefore sent to Cleopatra and made a long complaint of the circumstances she was in and entreated her to do her utmost for her assistance Cleopatra hereupon advised her to take her son with her and come away im mediately into Egypt This advice pleased her and she had this contrivance for getting away She got two coffins made as if they were to carry away two dead bodies and put herself into one and her son into the other and gave orders to such of her servants as knew of her intentions to carry them away in the night time Now their road was to be thence to the sea side and there was a ship ready to carry them into Egypt Now Esop one of her servants happened to meet with Sabbion one of her friends and spake of thio matter to him as thinking he had known of it before When Sabbion knew this who had formerly been an enemy of Herod s and been esteemed one of those that laid snares for and gave the poison to his father Antipa ter he expected that this discovery would change Herod s hatred into kindness So he told the king of this private stratagem of Alexandra s Whereupon he suffered her to proceed to the execution of her project and caught her in the very fact But still he passed by her offence and though he had a great mind to do it he durst not inflict any thing that was severe upon her For he knew that Cleopatra would not bear that he should have her accused on account of her hatred to him but made a shew as if it were rather the generosity of his soul and his great mode ration that made him forgive them How ever he fully proposed to himself to put this young man out of the way by one means or other But he thought he might probably be better concealed if he did it not immediately after what had lately happened Now upon the approach of the feast of tabernacles which is a festival very much ob served among us he let those days pass over and both he and the rest of the people were very merry Yet did the envy which at this time arose in him cause him to hasten the execution of his design For when this youth Aristobulus who was now in the seventeenth year of his age went up to the altar accord ing to the law to offer the sacrifices and this with the ornaments of his high priesthood and when he performed the sacred offices he seemed to be exceeding comely and taller than men usually were at that age and to exhibit in his countenance a great deal of that high family he was sprung from and a warm zeal and affection towards him ap peared among the people and the memory of the actions of his grandfather Aristobulus was fresh in their minds And their affections got so far the mastery of them that they could not forbear shewing their inclinations to him They at once rejoiced and were confounded and mingled with good wishes their joyful acclamations which they made to him till the good will of the multitude was made too evident and they more rashly proclaimed the happiness they had received from his family than was prudent under the existing govern ment Hereupon Herod resolved to com plete what he had intended against the young man When therefore the festival was over and he was feasting at fJericho with Alex andra who entertained them there he was  This entirely confutes the Talmudists who as Re land here notes pretend that no one under twenty years of age could officiate as high priest among the Jews t A Hebrew chronicle cited by Reland says this drowning was at Jordan not at Jericho and this even when he quotes Josephus Which reading of Jericho is yet fully confirmed by the last chapter of these Antiqui ties I suspect the transcriber of the Hebrew chronicle mistook the name and wrote Jordan for Jericho AN 35 541 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS very pleasant with the young man and drew him into a lonely place and at the same time played with him in a juvenile and ludicrous manner Now the nature of that place was hotter than ordinary so they went out in a body and of a sudden and in a vein of mad ness and as they stood by the fish ponds of which there were large ones about the house they went to cool themselves by bathing be cause it was in the midst of a sultry day At first they were only spectators of Herod s ser vants and acquaintance as they were swim ming But after a while the young man at the instigation of Herod went into the water among them while such of Herod s acquaint ance as he had appointed to do it dipped him as he was swimming and plunged him under water in the dark of the evening as if it had been done in sport only Nor did they desist till he was entirely suffocated And thus was Aristobulus murdered Hav ing lived no more than eighteen years and kept the high priesthood one year only Which high priesthood Ananelus now reco vered again When this j ad accident was related the joy of Mis women was soon changed to lamenta tion at the sight of the dead body that lay before them and their sorrow was immode rate The city of Jerusalem also upon the spreading of this news were in very great grief every family looking on this calamity as if it had not belonged to another but that one of themselves was slain But Alexandra was more deeply affected upon her know ledge that he had been wilfully destroyed But she was under a necessity of bearing up under it out of her prospect of a greater mischief that might otherwise follow And she oftentimes came to an inclination to kill herself with her own hands But still she re strained herself in hopes she might live long enough to revenge the unjust murder thus privately committed Nay she farther re solved to endeavour to live longer and to give no occasion to think she suspected that her son was slain on purpose and supposed that she might be in a capacity of revenging it at a proper opportunity However Herod endeavoured that none abroad should believe that the child s death was caused by any de sign of his And for this purpose he exhibit ed not only the ordinary signs of sorrow but even burst into tears and seemed to evince a real confusion of soul And perhaps his affections were overcome on this occasion when he saw the child s countenance so young and so beautiful although his death were supposed to tend to his own security So far at least this grief served as to make some apology for him He also took care that his funeral should be very magnificent by making great preparation of a sepulchre to lay his body in and providing a great quan tity of spices and burying many ornaments together with him till the very women who were in such deep sorrow were astonished at it and received in this way some conso lation None of these things however could overcome Alexandra s grief but the remem brance of this miserable case made her sor row both deep and obstinate Accordingly she wrote an account of this treacherous scene to Cleopatra and informed her by what means her son had been murdered Cleopatra as she had formerly been desi rous to give her what satisfaction she could and commiserating Alexandra s fortunes made the case her own and excited An tony to punish the child s murder For that it was an unworthy thing that Herod who had been by him made king of a country that no way belonged to him should be guilty of such horrid crimes against those that were of the royal blood Antony was persuaded by these arguments And when he came to Laodicea the sent and commanded Herod to come and make his defence as to what he had done to Aristobulus for that such a treacherous design was not well done if he had any hand in it Herod was now in fear both of the accusation and of Cleopatra s ill will to him which was such that she was ever endeavouring to make Antony hate him He therefore determined to obey his sum place before us In the first book Of the War chap 22 he is said to be seventeen when he was made high priest and soon after murdered  The reading of one of Josephus s Greek MSS and of Zonaras seems here to be right that Aristobulus was not eighteen years old when he was drowned For he was not seventeen when he was made high priest chap 2 and he continued in that office but one year as in the t An 34 4P2 542 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS mons for he had no possible way to avoid it So he left his uncle Joseph procurator for his government and for the public affairs and gave him a private charge that if Antony should kill him he also should kill Mariamne immediately For that he had a tender affection for her and was afraid of the injury that should be offered him if after his death she for her beauty should be engaged to some other man But his inti mation was nothing but this at the bottom that Antony had fallen in love with her when he had formerly heard somewhat of her beauty So when Herod had given Jo seph this charge and had no sure hopes of escaping with his life he went away to Antony But as Joseph was administering the pub lic affairs of the kingdom and for that reason was very frequently with Mariamne both because his business required it and because of the respects he ought to pay to the queen he frequently entered into conversation about Herod s kindness and great affection towards her and when the women especially Alexan dra used to turn his discourses into raillery Joseph was so over desirous to demonstrate the king s inclinations that he proceeded so far as to mention the charge he had received and thence drew his demonstration thpf He rod was not able to live without her and that if he should come to any ill end Jre could not endure a separation from heiyeven after he was dead The women however as was natural did not take this to be an instance of Herod s strong affection but of his severe usage of them that they could not escape destruction nor a tyrannical death even when he was dead himself And this saying of Joseph s was a foundation for the women s severe suspicions about him afterwards At this time a report went about the city Jerusalem among Herod s enemies that An tony had tortured Herod and put him to death This report as is natural disturbed those that were about the palace but chiefly the women Upon which Alexandra endea voured to persuade Joseph to go out of the palace and flee away with them to the en signs of the Roman legion which then lay encamped about the city as a guard to the  Of the four Josephs in these histories see the note kingdom under the command of Julius For that by this means if any disturbance should happen about the palace they should be in greater security as having the Romans fa vourable to them And that besides they hoped to obtain the highest authority if An tony did but once see Mariamne by whose means they should recover the kingdom and want nothing which was reasonable for them to hope for because of their royal ex traction But as they were in the midst of these de liberations letters were brought from Herod about all his affairs and proved contrary to the report and of what they before expected For when he was come to Antony he soon recovered his interest with him by the pre sents which he had carried with him from Jerusalem and he soon induced him upon discoursing with him to leave off his indig nation at him So that Cleopatra s persua sions had less force than the arguments and presents he brought to regain his friendship For Antony said that it was not good to re quire an account of a king as to the affairs of his jg Â Â TmiTeÂ t Far at this rate he coiikMSe no king at all but thai ihose wno had given him that authority ought to permit him to make use of it He also told Cleopatra that it would be best for her not to meddle with the acts of the king s govern ment Herod wrote an account of these things and enlarged upon the other honours which he had received from Antony How he sat by him at his hearing causes and took his diet with him every day and that he enjoyed those favours from him notwith standing the reproaches that Cleopatra so severely laid against him who having a great desire of his country and earnestly entreating Antony that the kingdom might be given to her laboured with her utmost diligence to remove him out of the way But that he still found Antony just to him and had no longer any apprehensions of hard treatment from him And that he was soon to set out upon his return with a firmer addi tional assurance of his favour to him in his reigning and managing public affairs and that there was no longer any hope for Cleo patra s covetous temper since Antony had On the War Book I chap 28  AN 34 543 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS given her Coelesyria instead of what she de sired by which means he had at once pa cified her and got clear of the entreaties which she had made him to have Judea bestowed upon her When these letters were brought the wo men laid aside their intention of fleeing to the Romans which they had thought of while Herod was supposed to be dead Yet was not that purpose of theirs a secret But when the king had conducted Antony on his way against the Parthians and returning to Judea both his sister Salome and his mother informed him of Alexandra s inten tions Salome also added somewhat farther against Joseph though it were no more than a calumny that he had often had a criminal conversation with Mariamne The reason of her saying so was that she had for a long time borne her ill will for when they had differences with one another Mariamne took great freedoms and reproached the rest with the meanness of their birth Herod whose affection to Mariamne was always very warm was presently disturbed at this and could not bear the torments of jealousy but was still restrained from doing any rash thing by the love he had for her Yet did his vehement affection and jealousy together make him ask Mariamne by herself about this matter of Joseph But she denied it upon her oath and said all that an innocent woman could possibly say in her own de fence so that by little and little the king was prevailed upon to drop the suspicion and left off his anger at her and being over come with his passion for his wife he made an apology to her for having seemed to be lieve what he had heard about her and re turned her a great many acknowledgments of her modest behaviour and professed the extraordinary affection and kindness he had for her Till at last as is usual between lovers they both burst into tears and em braced each other with a most tender affec tion But as the king gave more and more assurances of his belief of her fidelity and endeavoured to draw her to a like confi dence in him Mariamne said Yet was not that command thou gavest that if any harm  This slaughter of Arsinoe by Mark Antony when she had fled for refuge to this asylum the temple of Diana is confirmed by Appian V page 676 Only he says that came to thee from Antony I who had been no occasion of it should perish with thee a sign of thy love to me When these words were fallen from her the king was shocked at them and presently let her go out of his arms and cried out and tore his hair with his own hands and said that he had now an evident demonstration that Joseph had had criminal conversation with his wife for that he would never have uttered what he had told him by himself unless there had been a great familiarity and such firm confidence between them And while he was in this passion he had like to have killed his wife but being still overcome by his love to her he restrained his passion though not without a lasting grief and disquietness of mind However he gave order to slay Joseph without per mitting him to come into his sight And as for Alexandra he bound her and kept her in custody as the cause of all this mischief CHAP IV of cleopatra s avarice and cruelties her arrival in judea and the attentions she received from HEROD AT this time the affairs of Syria were in confusion by Cleopatra s constant per suasions to Antony to make an attempt on every body s dominions For she persuaded him to take those dominions from their se veral princes and bestow them upon her And she had a great influence upon him by reason of his being enslaved to her by his affections She was also by nature very covetous and hesitated not to commit any wickedness She had already poisoned her brother because she knew that he was to be king of Egypt and this when he was but fifteen years old And she caused her sister Arsinoe to be slain by the means of An tony when she was a supplicant at Diana s temple at Ephesus For if there were but any hopes of getting money she would vio late both temples and sepulchres Nor was there any holy place that was esteemed the most inviolable from which she would not fetch the ornaments it had in it nor any it was at her temple at Miletus and Josephus here at her temple at Ephesus Which was the truth cannot I sup pose be now determined 5U book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS place so profane but was to suffer the most flagitious treatment possible from her covetous humour Yet did not all this suffice so ex travagant a woman who was a slave to her lusts But she still imagined that she wanted every thing she could think of and did her utmost to gain it For this reason she hurried Antony on perpetually to deprive others of their dominions and give them to her And as she went over Syria with him she contrived to get it into her possession So he slew Ly sanias the son of Ptolemy accusing him of his bringing the Parthians upon those countries She also petitioned Antony to give her Judea and Arabia and in order thereto desired him to take these countries away from their pre sent governors As for Antony he was so entirely overcome by this woman that one would not think her conversation only could do it but that he was some way bewitched to do whatsoever she would have him Yet did the grossest parts of her injustice make him so ashamed that he would not always hearken to her to do those flagrant enormities she would have persuaded him to That there fore he might not totally deny her nor by doing every thing that she enjoined him ap pear openly to be an ill man he took some parts of each of those countries away from their former governors and gave them to her Thus he gave her the cities that were within the river Eleutherus as far as Egypt ex cepting Tyre and Sidon which he knew to have been free cities from their ancestors although she pressed him very often to bestow these on her also When Cleopatra had obtained thus much and had accompanied Antony in his expedi tion into Armenia as far as Euphrates she returned back and came to Apamia and Da mascus and passed on to Judea There Herod met her and farmed of her some parts of Arabia and those revenues that came to her from the region about Jericho This country bears that balsam which is the most precious drug that is there and grows there alone The place also produces many and excellent palm trees When she was there and was very often with Herod she endea voured to have criminal conversation with the king Nor did she affect secrecy in the in dulgence of such sort of pleasures And per haps she had in some measure a passion of love for him or rather what is most proba ble she laid a treacherous snare for him by aiming to obtain such an adulterous conver sation from him However upon the whole she seemed overcome with love to him Now Herod had a great while borne no good will to Cleopatra as knowing that she was a woman irksome to all and at that time he thought her particularly worthy of his hatred if this attempt proceeded out of lust he had also thought of preventing her intrigues by putting her to death if such were her endea vours However he refused to comply with her proposals and called a council of his friends to consult with them whether he should not kill her now he had her in his power For that he should thereby deliver all those from a multitude of evils to whom she was already become irksome and was expected to be still so for the time to come and that this very thing would be much for the advantage of Antony himself since she would certainly not be faithful to him in case any such necessity should come upon him as that he should stand in need of her fidelity But when he thought to follow this advice his friends told him that it was not right to attempt so great a thing and run himself thereby into the utmost danger And they begged of him to undertake nothing rashly for that Antony would never bear it though any one should evidently lay before his eyes that it was for his own advantage And that the appearance of depriving him of her conversation by this violent and treacherous method would pro bably set his affections more on a flame than before Nor did it appear that he could offer any thing of tolerable weight in his defence this attempt being against such a woman as was of the highest dignity of any of her sex at that time in the world And as to any ad  This Lysanias was the son of Ptolemy Menneus and was king of Chalcis and Iturea and probably the same person that is mentioned by Strabo XVI page 756 That he was slain is confirmed by Dio XLIX page 411 as Dean Aldrich observes Who also adds that the slaughter of Malichus about the same time which Josephus joins with this of Lysanias in his history Of the War I 22 is not mentioned either by Dio or in the Antiquities of Josephus himself or any other author So that it is highly probable Josephus missed it here voluntarily as having discovered his former mistake about it AN 31 545 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS vantage to be expected from such an under taking if any such could be supposed in this case it would appear to deserve condemna tion on account of the insolence he must take upon him in doing it These considerations made it very plain that in so doing he would find his government filled with mischiefs both great and lasting both to himself and his pos terity whereas it was still in his power to re ject that wickedness she would persuade him to and to come off honourably at the same time So by thus representing to Herod the hazard he must in all probability run by this undertaking they restrained him from it He therefore treated Cleopatra kindly and made her presents and conducted her on her way to Egypt But Antony subdued Armenia and sent Artabazes the son of Tigranes in bonds with his children and procurators to Egypt and made a present of them and of all the royal ornaments which he had taken out of that kingdom to Cleopatra And Artaxias the eldest of his sons who had escaped at that time took the kingdom of Armenia He was indeed ejected by Archelaus and Nero Caesar when they restored Tigranes his younger brother to that kingdom but this happened a considerable time afterward But as to the tributes which Herod was to ay Cleopatra for that country which Antony ad given her he acted fairly with her as deeming it not safe for him to afford any cause for Cleopatra to hate him As for the king of Arabia whose tribute Herod had un dertaken to pay her for some time indeed he paid him as much as came to two hundred talents But he afterward became very slow in his payments and could hardly be brought to pay some parts of it and was not willing to pay even them without some deductions CHAP V HEROD MAKES WAR WITH THE KING OF ARABIA AND AFTER SEVERAL ENGAGEMENTS SUBDUES HIM AND IS CHOSEN BY THE ARABS TO BE GOVERNOR OF THAT NATION ALSO CONCERNING A GREAT EARTHQUAKE HEREUPON Herod held himself ready to go against the king of Arabia be cause of his ingratitude and because after all he would do nothing that was just to him Although Herod made the Roman war an oc E casion of delaying his own For the battle at Actium was now expected which hap pened in the second year of the hundred and eighty and seventh Olympiad where Caesar and Antony were to fight for the supreme power of the world But Herod having en joyed a country that was very fruitful and that now for a long time and having received great taxes and raised great armies there with got together a body of men and care fully furnished them with all necessaries and designed them as auxiliaries for Antony But Antony said he had no want of his assistance But he commanded him to punish the king of Arabia for he had heard both from him and from Cleopatra how perfidious he was for Cleopatra thought it for her own advan tage that these two kings should do one another as great mischief as possible Upon this message from Antony Herod returned back but kept his army with him in order to invade Arabia So when his army of horse men and footmen was ready he marched to Diospolis Thither the Arabians came also to meet them for they were not unapprised of this war that was coming upon them And after a great battle had been fought the Jews had the victory But afterward there were gotten together another numerous army of the Arabians at Cana a place of Coelesyria Herod was informed of this beforehand so he came against them with the greatest part of his forces And when he was come near to Cana he resolved to encamp himself and he cast up a bulwark that he might take a proper season for attacking the enemy But as he was giving those orders the multitude of the Jews cried out that he should make no delay but lead them against the Arabians On this occasion they were in high spirits as believing they were in very good order and those especially were so that had been in the former battle and had been conquerors and had not permitted their enemies so much as to come to a close fight with them And when they were so tumultuous and shewed such great alacrity the king resolved to make use of that zeal the multitude then exhibited And when he had assured them he would not i be behindhand with them in courage he led them on and stood before them in his ar mour all the regiments following him in their several ranks Hereupon a consterna 516 book xy ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tion fell upon the Arabians for when they perceived that the Jews were not to be con quered and were full of spirit the greater part of them ran away and avoided fighting And they had been quite destroyed had not Athenio fallen upon the Jews and distressed them This man was Cleopatra s general over the soldiers she had there and was at enmity with Herod and very wistfully looked on to see what the event of the battle would be He had also resolved that in case the Arabians did any thing that was brave and successful he would lie still but in case they were beaten as it really happened he would attack the Jews with those forces he had of his own and with those that the country had fotten together for him So he fell upon the ews unexpectedly when they were fatigued and thought they had already vanquished the enemy and made a great slaughter of them For as the Jews had spent their courage upon their known enemies and were about to enjoy themselves in quietness after their victory they were easily beaten by these that at tacked them afresh and in particular re ceived a great loss in places where the horses could not be of service and which were very stony and where those that attacked them were better acquainted with the places than themselves And when the Jews had suffered this loss the Arabians resumed their courage after their defeat and returning back again slew those that were already put to flight And indeed all sorts of slaughter were now frequent and of those that escaped a few only returned into the camp So king Herod when he despaired of the battle rode up to them to bring them assistance Yet he did not come time enough to render them any service though he laboured hard to do it but the Jewish camp was taken So that the Arabians had unexpectedly a most glorious success having gained that victory which of themselves they were no way likely to have gained and slaying a great part of the enemy s army Whence afterward Herod could only act like a private robber and make excursions upon many parts of Arabia and distress them by sudden incursions while he encamped among the mountains and avoided by any means to come to a pitched battle Yet did he greatly harass the enemy by his assiduity and the hard labour he took in this matter He also took great care of his own forces and used all the means he could to restore his affairs to their former state At this time the fight happened at Actium between Octavius Caesar and Antony in the seventh year of the reign of Herod And then it was also that there was an earthquake in Judea such a one as had not happened at any other time and which earthquake brought a great destruction upon the cattle in that country About ften thousand men also perished by the fall of houses But the army which lodged in the field received no damage from this sad accident When the Arabians were informed of this and when those that hated the Jews and pleased them selves with aggravating the reports told them of it they raised their spirits as if their ene my s country were quite overthrown and the men were utterly destroyed and thought there now remained nothing that could op pose them Accordingly they took the Jewish ambassadors who came to them after all this had happened to make peace with them and slew them and came with great alacrity against their army But the Jews durst not withstand them and were so cast down by the calamities they were under that they took no care of their affairs but gave themselves up to despair For they had no hope that they should be upon a level with them again in battle nor obtain any assistance elsewhere while their affairs at home were in such great distress When matters were in this condi tion the king persuaded the commanders by his words and tried to raise their spirits which were quite sunk And first he endea voured to encourage and embolden some of the better sort beforehand and then ventured to make a speech to the multitude which he had before avoided to do lest he should find them uneasy because of the misfortunes which  The reader is here to take notice that this seventh year of the reign of Herod and all the other years of his reign in Josephus are dated from the death of Antigo nus or at the soonest from the conquest of Antigonus and the taking of Jerusalem a few months before and never from his first obtaining the kingdom at Rome above three years before as some have very injudi ciously done See the rest of those dates XV 9 10 and 11 and XVI 5 t Or thirty thousand AW 31 J 547 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS had happened So he made a consolatory speech to the multitude in the following manner You are not ignorant my fellow soldiers that we have recently sustained many acci dents that we have put a stop to what we are about and it is probable that even those that are most distinguished for their courage can hardly keep up their spirits in such cir cumstances But since we cannot avoid fighting and nothing that hath happened is of such a nature but it may by yourselves be recovered into a good state and this by one brave action well performed I have pro posed to myself both to give you some en couragement and at the same time some information Both which parts of my de sign will tend to this point that you may still continue in your own proper fortitude I will then in the first place demonstrate to you that this war is a just one on our side and that on this account it is a war of necessity and occasioned by the injustice of our adver saries For if you be once satisfied of this it will be a real cause of alacrity to you After which I will farther demonstrate that the misfortunes we are under are of no great consequence and that we have the greatest reason to hope for victory I shall begin with the first and appeal to yourselves as witnesses of what I shall say You are not ignorant of the wickedness of the Arabians which is to that degree as to appear incredible to all other men and to include somewhat that shews the grossest barbarity and ignorance of God The chief things wherein they have affronted us have arisen from covetousness and envy and they have attacked us in an insidious manner and on the sudden And what occasion is there for me to mention many instances of such their procedure When they were in danger of losing their own go vernment and of being slaves to Cleopatra what others were they that freed them from that fear For it was the friendship I had with Antony and the kind disposition he was in towards us that hath been the occasion that even these Arabians have not been utterly undone Antony being unwilling to undertake any thing which might be sus peeled by us of unkindness But when he had a mind to bestow some parts of each of our dominions on Cleopatra I also managed that matter so that by giving him presents of my own I might obtain a security to both nations while I undertook myself to answer for the money giving him two hundred talents and becoming surety for those two hundred more which were imposed upon the land that was subject to this tribute And this they have defrauded us of although it was not reasonable that Jews should pay tri bute to any man living or allow part of their land to be taxable But although that was to be yet ought we not to pay tribute for these Arabians whom we have ourselves preserved Nor is it fit that they who have acknowledged with great integrity and sense of our kindness that it is by our means they keep their principality should injure us and deprive us of what is our due and this while we have remained their friends And whereas the observance of covenants takes place among the bitterest enemies but among friends is absolutely necessary this is not observed among these men who think gain to be the best of all things let it be by any means whatsoever and that injustice is no harm if they may but get money by it It is therefore a question with you whether the unjust are to be punished or not when God himself hath declared his mind that so it ought to be and hath commanded that we should abhor injuries and injustice This is not only just but necessary in wars between several nations For these Arabians have done what both the Greeks and Barbarians own to be an instance of the grossest wick edness with regard to our ambassadors whom they have beheaded While the Greeks declare that such ambassadors are sacred and inviolable And for ourselves we have learned from God the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our law by angels or ambassadors For this name brings God to the knowledge of mankind and is sufficient to reconcile ene mies one to another What wickedness then can be greater than the slaughter of ambas sadors who come to treat about doing what  Herod says here that as ambassadors were sacred when they carried messages to others so did the laws of the Jews derive a sacred authority by being delivered voL I â NOS 45  46 from God by angels or divine ambassadors which is St Paul s expression about the same laws Gal iii 19 Heb ii 2 4 Q o48 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS is right And when such have been their actions how is it possible they can either live securely in common life or be successful in war In my opinion this is impossible But perhaps some will say that what is holy and what is righteous is indeed on our side but that the Arabians are either more courageous or more numerous than we are Now as to this in the first place it is not fit for us to say so for with whom is what is righteous with them is God himself Now where God is there are both multitude and courage But to examine our own circumstances a little we were conquerors in the first battle and when we fought again they were not able to oppose us but ran away and could not en dure our attacks or our courage But when we had conquered them then came Athe nion and made war against us without de claring it And pray is this an instance of their manhood or is it not a second instance of their wickedness and treachery Why are we therefore of less courage on account of that which ought to inspire us with stronger hopes And why are we terrified at those who when they fight upon the level are continually beaten and when they seem to be conquerors they gain it by wickedness And if we suppose that any one should deem them to be men of real courage will not he be excited by that very consideration to do his utmost against them For true valour is not shewn by fighting against weak persons but in being able to overcome the most hardy But then if the distress we are our selves under and the miseries that have come by the earthquake have affrighted any one let him consider in the first place that this very thing will deceive the Arabians by their supposal that what hath befallen us is greater than it really is Moreover it is not right that the same thing that emboldens them should discourage us For these men you see do not derive their alacrity from any advantageous virtue of their own but from their hope as to us that we are quite cast down by our misfortunes But when we boldly march against them we shall soon pull down their insolent conceit of themselves and shall gain this by attacking them that they will not be so insolent when we come to the battle For our distresses are not so great nor is what hath happened an indigna tion of the anger of God against us as some imagine For such things are accidental and adversities that come in the usual course of things And if we allow that this was done by the will of God we must allow that it is now over by his will also and that he is satisfied with what hath already happened For had he been willing to afflict us still more thereby he had not changed his mind so soon And as for the war we are engaged in he hath himself demonstrated that he is willing it should go on and that he knows it to be a just war For while some of the people in the country have perished all you who were in arms have suffered nothing but are all preserved alive Hence God makes it plain to us that if you had universally with your wives and children been in the army it had come to pass that you had not undergone any thing that would have much hurt you Consider these things and what is more than all the rest that you have God at all times for your protector and prosecute these men with a just bravery who in point of friendship are unjust in their battles per fidious towards ambassadors impious and always inferior to you in valour i When the Jews heard this speech their minds were animated and more disposed to fight than before So Herod when he had offered the sacrifices appointed by the law made haste and took them and led them against the Arabians and in order to that passed over Jordan and pitched his camp near to that of the enemy He also thought fit to seize upon a certain castle that lay in the midst of them as hoping it would be for his advantage and would the sooner produce a battle and that if there were occasion for  This piece of religion the supplicating God with sa crifices by Herod before he went to this fight with the Arabians taken notice of also in the first book of the war chap 19 is worth remarking because it is the only ex ample of this nature so far as I remember that Josephus ever mentions in all his particular accounts of this Herod And it was when he had been in great distress and dis couraged by a defeat of his former army and by a very great earthquake in Judea Such times of affliction ma king men most religious Nor was he disappointed of his hopes here but immediately gained a most signal victory over the Arabians While they who just before had been so great victors and so much elevated upon the earth quake in Judea as to venture to slay the Jewish ambassa dors were now under a strange consternation and hardly able to fight at all AN 31 549 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS delay he should by it have his camp fortified And as the Arabians had the same intentions upon that place a contest arose about it At first they were but skirmishes but afterwards there came more soldiers and it proved a sort of engagement and some fell on both sides till those of the Arabian side were beaten and retreated This was no small encouragement to the Jews and when Herod observed that the enemy s army were dis posed to any thing rather than to come to an engagement he ventured boldly to attempt the bulwark itself and to pull it to pieces and so to get nearer to their camp in order to fight them For when they were forced out of their trenches they went out in dis order and had not the least alacrity or hope of victory Yet did they fight hand to hand because they were more numerous than the Jews and because they were in such a dis position of war that they were under a ne cessity of coming on boldly So they came to a terrible battle while not a few fell on each side However at length the Arabians fled and so great a slaughter was made upon their being routed that they were not only killed by their enemies but became the au thors of their own deaths also and were trodden down by the multitude and the great current of people in disorder and were destroyed by their own armour So five thousand men lay dead upon the spot while the rest of the multitude soon ran within the bulwark for safety but had no firm hope of safety by reason of their want of necessaries and especially of water The Jews pursued them but could not get in with them but sat round about the bulwark and watched any assistance that would get in to them and prevented any that had a mind to it from running away When the Arabians were in these circum stances they sent ambassadors to Herod in the first place to propose terms of accommo dation and after that to offer him so press ing was their thirst upon them to undergo whatsoever he pleased if he would free them from their present distress But he would admit of no ambassadors of no price of re demption nor of any other moderate terms whatever being very desirous to revenge those unjust actions which they had been guilty of towards his nation So they were necessitated by other motives and particu larly by their thirst to come out and deliver themselves up to him to be carried away captives And in five days time the number of four thousand were taken prisoners while all the rest resolved to make a sally upon their enemies and to fight it out with them choosing rather if so it must be to die therein than to perish gradually and inglo riously When they had taken this resolu tion they came out of their trenches but were unable to sustain the fight being too much debilitated both in mind and body and having not room to exert themselves and thought it an advantage to be killed and a misery to survive So at the first onset there fell about seven thousand of them After which stroke they let all the courage they had put on before fall and stood amazed at Herod s warlike spirit under his own cala mities So for the future they yielded and made him ruler of their nation He was greatly elevated at so seasonable a success and returned home taking great authority upon him on account of his bold and glorious expedition CHAP VI HEROD CAUSES HYRCANUS TO BE PUT TO DEATH AND OBTAINS THE CONFIRMATION OF HIS OWN DIGNITY FROM OCTAVIUS CESAR WHOM HE ENTERTAINED IN A SUMP TUOUS MANNER HEROD s other affairs were now very prosperous and he was not to be easily assaulted on any side Yet did there come upon him a danger that would hazard his en tire dominions after Antony had been beaten at the battle of Actium by Octavius Caesar  Antony had provoked Octavinnus against him by the wrong done to Octavia his sister whom Antony had mar ried and yet divorced her for the gratification of his adulterous love to Cleopatra though Octavia was much the handsomer of the two Antony had likewise given out that Cleopatra had been married to Julius Caesar and that Caesanon whom she had by him was his lawful son and consequently had the proper right to the inheritance which Octavianus held only as his adopted son These things were objected against Antony and Antony by his agents and letters was not forgetful to recriminate But these things were no more than pretences the true reason of their disagreement was that both these two great men being not contented with half of the 4 Q2 550 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS For at that time both Herod s enemies and friends despaired of his affairs as it was not probable that he would remain without punishment who had shewed so much friend ship for Antony His friends despaired and had no hopes of his escape but his ene mies though they outwardly appeared to be troubled at his case were privately very glad of it as hoping to obtain a change for the better As for Herod himself he saw that there was no one of royal dignity left but Hyrcanus and therefore he thought it would be for his advantage not to suffer him to be an obstacle in his way any longer For that in case he himself survived and escaped the danger he was in he thought it the safest way to put it out of the power of such a man to make any attempt against him at such junctures of affairs as was more worthy of the kingdom than himself and in case he should be slain by Caesar his envy prompted him to desire to slay him that would otherwise be king after him While Herod had these things in his mind there was a certain occasion afforded him For Hyrcanus was of so mild a temper that he desired not to meddle with public affairs nor to concern himself with innovations but left all to fortune and contented himself with what that afforded him But Alexandra his daughter was a lover of strife and was ex ceeding desirous of a change in the govern ment and spake to her father not to bear Herod s injurious treatment of their family but to anticipate their future hopes as he safely might and desired him to write about those matters to Malchus who was then governor of Arabia to receive them and to secure them from Herod for that if they went away and Herod s affairs proved as it was likely they would by reason of Caesar s enmity to him they should then be the only persons that could take the govern ment and this both on account of the royal family they were of and on account of the good disposition of the multitude toward them While she used these persuasions Hyrcanus put off their suit But as she shewed that she was a woman and a con tentious woman too and would not desist Roman empire were each resolved to have all and accordingly agreed to throw the dice of war for it either night or day but would always be speaking to him about these matters and about Herod s treacherous designs she at last prevailed with him to entrust Dositheus one of his friends with a letter wherein his resolution was declared and he desired the Arabian governor to send to him some horse men who should receive him and conduct him to the lake Asphaltites which is three hundred furlongs distant from the bounds of Jerusalem And he did therefore trust Do sitheus with his letter because he was a careful attendant on him and on Alexandra and had no small occasion to bear ill will to Herod For he was a kinsman of one Jo seph whom he had slain and a brother of those that were formerly slain at Tyre by Antony Yet could not these motives in duce Dositheus to serve Hyrcanus in this affair for preferring the hopes he had from the present king to those he had from him he gave Herod the letter So he took his kindness in good part and bade him go on in serving him by rolling up the epistle and sealing it again and delivering it to Malchus and then to bring back his letter in answer to it for it would be much better if he could know Malchus s intentions also And when Dositheus was very ready to serve him in this point also the Arabian governor returned back for answer that he would receive Hyr canus and all that should come with him and even all the Jews that were of his party that he would also send forces sufficient to secure them in their journey and that he should be in no want of any thing he should desire Now as soon as Herod had received this let ter he immediately sent for Hyrcanus and questioned him about the league he had made with Malchus and when he denied it he shewed his letter to the Sanhedrim and put the man to death immediately This account we give the reader as it is contained in the commentaries of king He rod But other historians do not agree with them for they suppose that Herod did not find but rather make this an occasion for thus putting him to death and that by trea cherously laying a snare for him For they write that Herod and he were once at a Plutarch De Antonio and Prideaux s Connection anno 33 B AN 31 551 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS treat and that Herod had given no occasion to suspect that he was displeased at him but put this question to Hyrcanus Whether he had received any letters from Malchus and when he answered that he had received letters but those of salutation only and when he asked farther whether he had not received any presents from him and when he replied that he had received no more than four horses to ride on which Malchus had sent him Herod charged these upon him as the crimes of bribery and treason and gave order that he should be led away and slain And in order to demonstrate that he had been guilty of no offence when he was thus brought to his end they allege how mild his temper had been and that even in his youth he had never given any demon stration of boldness or rashness and that the case was the same when he came to be king but that he even then committed the manage ment of the greatest part of public affairs to Antipater And that he was now above eighty years old and knew that Herod s government was in a secure state He also came over Euphrates and left those who greatly honoured him beyond that river though he were to be entirely under Herod s government and that it was a most incredi ble thing that he should undertake any thing by way of innovation and not at all agree able to his temper but that this was a plot of Herod s own contrivance And this was the fate of Hyrcanus after he had endured various turns of fortune in his life time For he was made high priest of the Jewish nation in the beginning of his mother Alexandra s reign who held the go vernment nine years And when after his mother s death he took the kingdom him self and held it three months he lost it by the means of his brother Aristobulus He was then restored by Pompey and received all sorts of honour from him and enjoyed them forty years But when he was again deprived by Antigonus and was maimed in his body he was made a captive by the Par thians and thence returned home again after some time on account of the hopes that Herod had given him None of these however came to pass according to his ex pectation but he still conflicted with many misfortunes through the whole course of his life and what was the heaviest calamity of all as we have related already he came to an end which was undeserved by him His character appeared to be that of a man of a mild and moderate disposition and suffered the administration of affairs to be generally done by others under him He was averse to the management of public affairs nor had shrewdness enough to govern a kingdom And both Antipater and Herod came to their greatness by reason of his mildness and at last he met with such an end from them as was not agreeable either to justice or piety Now Herod as soon as he had put Hyr canus out of the way hastened to Caesar and because he could not have any hopes of kindness from him on account of the friend ship he had for Antony he had a suspicion of Alexandra lest she should take this op portunity to bring the multitude to a revolt and introduce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom So he committed the care of every thing to his brother Pheroras and placed his mother Cypros and his sister Sa lome and the whole family at Massada and gave him a charge that if he should hear any sad news about him he should take care of the government But as to Mariamne his wife because of the misunderstanding be tween her and her sister and his sister s mother which made it impossible for them to live together he placed her at Alexan drium with Alexandra her mother and left his treasurer Joseph and Sohemus of Ituria to take care of that fortress These two had been very faithful to him from the be ginning and were now left as a guard to the women They also had it in charge that if they should hear any mischief had befallen him they should kill them both and as far  As Hyrcanus was the only remaining person of the male line of the Asmoneans and had himself reigned in Judea under the protection of the Romans till deposed by the Parthians Herod suspected that if any thing went hard with him it would turn in favour of Hyrcanus for restoring him again to the kingdom and therefore to prevent this contrived a plot against that prince as if he had held a correspondence with Malchus king of Arabia for the accomplishing of treasonable designs against him Under this pretence he caused him to be put to death after he had passed the eightieth year of his age Prideaux s Connection part 2 book 8 B 552 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS as they were able to preserve the kingdom for his sons and for his brother Pheroras When he had given them this charge he went to Rhodes to meet Caesar And when he had sailed to that city he took off his dia dem but remitted nothing else of his usual dignity And when upon his meeting him he desired that he would let him speak to him he therein exhibited a much more no ble specimen of a great soul For he did not betake himself to supplications as men usually do upon such occasions nor offered him any petition as if he were an offender but after an undaunted manner gave an ac count of what he had done For he said that he had the greatest friendship for An tony and did every thing he could that he might attain the government That he was not indeed in the army with him because the Arabians had diverted him but that he had sent him both money and corn which was but too little in comparison of what he ought to have done for him For said he if a man own himself to be another s friend and know him to be a benefactor he is obliged to hazard every thing to use every faculty of his soul every member of his body and all the wealth he hath for him in which I confess 1 have been too de ficient However I am conscious to myself that so far I have done right that I have not deserted him upon his defeat at Actium nor upon the evident change of his fortune have I transferred my hopes from him to another but have preserved myself though not as a valuable fellow soldier yet certainly as a faithful counsellor to Antony when I demonstrated to him that the only way he had to save himself and not to lose all his authority was to slay Cleopatra for when she was once dead there would be room for him to retain his authority and rather to bring thee to make a composition with him than to continue at enmity any longer He however would not attend to my advice but preferred his own rash resolutions which have happened unprofitably for him but profitably for thee Now therefore in case thou determinest about me and my alacrity in serving Antony according to thy anger at him I own there is no room for me to deny what I have done nor will 1 be ashamed to own and that publicly too that I had a great kindness for him But if thou wilt put him out of thy case and only exa mine how I behave myself to my benefactors in general and what a sort of friend I am thou wilt find by experience that I shall do and be the same to thyself For it is but changing the names and the firmness of friendship that I shall bear to thee will not be disapproved by thee By this speech and by his behaviour which shewed Caesar the frankness of his mind he greatly gained upon him who was himself of a generous and magnificent temper insomuch that those very actions which were the foundation of the accusa tions against him procured him Caesar s good will Accordingly he restored him his diadem and encouraged him to exhibit himself as great a friend to himself as he had been to Antony and then had him in great esteem He also added that Quintus Didius had written to him that Herod had very readily assisted him in the affair of the gladiators So when he had obtained such a kind reception and had beyond all his hopes procured his crown to be more entirely and firmly settled upon him than ever by Caesar s donation as well as by that decree of the Romans which was procured for his greater security he conducted Cae sar on his way to Egypt and made presents even beyond his ability to both him and his friends and in general behaved himself with great magnanimity He also desired that Caesar would not put to death one Alexan der who had been a companion of Antony s but Caesar had sworn to put him to death and so he could not obtain that petition And now he returned to Judea again with greater honour and assurance than ever and affrighted those that had expectations to the contrary as still acquiring from his very dangers greater splendour than before by the favour of God to him So he pre pared for the reception of Caesar as he was going out of Syria to invade Egypt and when he came he entertained him at Ptole mais with all royal magnificence He also bestowed presents on the army and brought them provisions in abundance He likewise proved to be one of Caesar s most cordial  See Of the War Book I chap 20 an 29 553 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS friends and put the army in array and rode along with Caesar and had a hundred and fifty men well appointed in all respects after a rich and sumptuous manner for the better reception of him and his friends He also provided them with what they should want as they passed over the arid desert inso much that they lacked neither wine nor water which last the soldiers stood in the greatest need of And besides he pre sented Caesar with eight hundred talents and procured to himself the good will of them all because he was assisting to them in a much greater and more splendid de gree than the kingdom he had obtained could afford By this means he more and more demonstrated to Caesar the firmness of his friendship and his readiness to assist him And what was of the greatest advan tage to him was that his liberality came at a seasonable time also And when they re turned again out of Egypt his assistances were no way inferior to the good offices he had formerly done them CHAP VII OF THE EXECUTION OF SOHEMUS AND MARIAMNE ALEX ANDRA AND COSTOBARUS J HEROD S MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS AND THE SONS OF BABA HOWEVER when Herod came into his kingdom again he found his house all in disorder and his wife Mariamne and her mother Alexandra very uneasy for they naturally supposed that they were not put into that fortress Alexandrium for the se curity of their persons but as into a gar rison for their imprisonment and that they had no power over any thing either of others or of their own affairs And Mari amne supposing that the king s love to her was rather pretended as advantageous to himself than real she looked on it as falla cious She also was grieved that he would not allow her any hopes of surviving him if he should come to any harm himself She also recollected what commands he had for merly given to Joseph insomuch that she endeavoured to please her keepers and es pecially Sohemus as well apprised how all was in his power Sohemus was at first faithful to Herod and neglected none of the things he had given him in charge but when the women by kind words and liberal presents had gained his affections over to them he was by degrees overcome and at length discovered to them all the king s in junctions and this on that account princi pally that he did not so much as hope he would come back with the same authority he had before So that he thought he should escape any danger from him and supposed that he did hereby much gratify the women who were likely not to be overlooked in the settling of the government nay that they would be able to make him ample recom pense since they must either reign them selves or be very near to him that should reign He had a farther ground of hope also that though Herod should have all the success he could wish for and should return again he could not contradict his wife in what she desired for he knew that the king s fondness for her was inexpressible These were the motives that drew Sohemus to discover what injunctions had been given him So Mariamne was greatly displeased to hear that there was no end of the dan gers she was under from Herod and was greatly uneasy at it and wished that he might obtain no favours from Caesar and esteemed it an almost insupportable task to live with him any longer And this she af terwards openly declared without conceal ing her resentments And now Herod sailed home with joy at the unexpected good success he had had and went first of all to his wife and told her the good news as preferring her before the rest on account of his fondness for her and the intimacy there had been between them and saluted her But so it happened that as he told her of the good success he had had she was so far from rejoicing that she rather was sorry for it Nor was she able to conceal her resentments but depending on her dignity and the nobility of her birth in return for his salutations she gave a groan and declared evidently that she ra ther grieved than rejoiced at his success and this till Herod was disturbed at her as affording him not only marks of her suspi cion but evident signs of her dissatisfaction This much troubled him to see that this surprising hatred of his wife to him was not concealed but open And he took this so 554 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS ill and yet was so unable to bear it on ac count of the fondness he had for her that he could not continue long in any one mind but sometimes was angry at her and some times reconciled to ner but by always changing one passion for another he was still in great uncertainty And thus was he entangled between hatred and love and was frequently disposed to inflict punish ment on her for her insolence towards him but being deeply in love with her he was not able to get quit of this woman In short as he would gladly have her punished so was he afraid lest ere he were aware he should by putting her to death bring a heavier punishment upon himself at the same time When Herod s sister and mother per ceived that he was in this temper with re gard to Mariamne they thought they had now an excellent opportunity of exercising their hatred against her and provoked Herod by telling him such long stories and calumnies about her as might at once excite his hatred and his jealousy Now though he willingly listened to their words yet had not he courage enough to do any thing to her as if he believed them But still he became worse disposed to her and these ill passions were more and more inflamed on both sides while she did not hide her disposition towards him and he turned his love to her into wrath against her But when he was just going to put this matter past all remedy he heard the news that Caesar was the victor in the war and that Antony and Cleopatra were both dead and that he had conquered Egypt Hereupon he made haste to go to meet Caesar and left the affairs of his family in their present state However Mariamne recommended Sohemus to him as he was setting out on his journey and professed that she owed him thanks for the care he had taken of her and asked of the king for him a place in the government upon which an honour able employment was bestowed upon him accordingly Now when Herod was come into Egypt he was introduced to Caesar with great free dom as already a friend of his and re ceived very great favours from him For he made him a present of those four hun dred Galatians who had been Cleopatra s guards and restored that country to him again which by her means had been taken away from him He also added to his king dom Gadara and Hippos and Samaria and besides those the maritime cities Gaza and Athedon and Joppa and Strato s tower Upon these new acquisitions he grew more magnificent and conducted Caesar as far as Antioch But upon his return as much as his prosperity was augmented by the foreign additions that had been made him so much the greater were the distresses that came upon him in his own family and chiefly in the affair of his wife wherein he formerly appeared to have been most of all fortunate For the affection he had for Mariamne was no way inferior to the affections of such as are on that account celebrated in history and this very justly As for her she was in other respects a chaste woman and faithful to him yet was she somewhat rough by na ture and treated her husband imperiously because she saw he was so fond of her as to be enslaved by her She did not also consider seasonably with herself that she lived under a monarchy and that she was at another s disposal and accordingly would often behave herself after a saucy manner to him Which yet he usually put off in a jesting way and bore with moderation and good temper She would also expose his mother and sister openly on account of the meanness of their birth and would speak unkindly of them Insomuch that there was before this a disagreement and unpardonable hatred among the women and it was now come to greater reproaches of one another than formerly Which suspicions increased and lasted a whole year after Herod returned from Caesar However these misfortunes which had been kept under some decency for a great while burst out at once upon such an occasion as was now offered For as the king was one day about noon Jain down on his bed to rest him he called for Mariamne out of the great affection he had always for her She came in accordingly but would not lie down by him And when he was very desirous of her company she shewed her contempt of him and added  Gauls An 29 555 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS by way of reproach that he had caused her father and her brother to be slain And when he took this injury very unkindly and was ready to use violence to her in a pre cipitate manner the king s sister Salome observing that he was more than ordinarily disturbed sent in to the king his cup bearer who had been prepared long beforehand for such a design and bade him tell the king how Mariamne had persuaded him to give his assistance in preparing a love potion for him and if he appeared to be greatly concerned and should ask what that love potion was to tell him that she had the potion and that he was desired only to give it him But that in case he did not appear to be much concerned at this potion to let the thing drop and that if he did so no harm should thereby come to him When she had given him these instructions she sent him in at this time to make such a speech So he went in after a composed manner to gain credit to what he should say and yet somewhat hastily and said that Mariamne had given him presents and persuaded him to give him a love potion And when this moved the king he said that this love potion was a composition that she had given him whose effects he did not know which was the reason of his resolving to give him this information as the safest course he could take both for himself and for the king When Herod heard what he said and was in an ill disposition before his indignation grew more violent and he ordered that eunuch of Mariamne s who was most faithful to her to be brought to the torture about this potion as well knowing it was not possible that any thing could be done without him And when the man was under the utmost agonies he could say no thing concerning the thing he was tortured about but so far he knew that Mariamne s hatred against him was occasioned by some what that Sohemus had said to her Now as he was saying this Herod cried out aloud and said that Sohemus who had been at all other times most faithful to him and to his government would not have betrayed what injunctions he had given him unless he had had a nearer conversation than ordi nary with Mariamne So he gave order that Sohemus should be seized on and slain im mediately But he allowed his wife to take her trial and he assembled those that were most faithful to him and laid an elaborate accusation against her for this love potion and composition which had been charged upon her by way of calumny However he kept no temper in what he said and was in too great a passion for judging well about this matter Accordingly when the court was at length satisfied that he was so resolved they passed the sentence of death upon her But when the sentence was passed this temper was suggested by himself and by some others of the court that she should not be thus hastily put to death but be laid in prison in one of the fortresses belonging to the kingdom Salome and her party how ever laboured hard to have the woman put to death and they prevailed with the king to do so and advised this out of caution lest the multitude should be tumultuous if she were suffered to live And thus was Mariamne led to execution When Alexandra observed how things went and that there were small hopes that she should escape the like treatment from Herod she changed her behaviour to quite the reverse of what might have been ex pected from her former boldness and this after a very indecent manner For out of her desire to shew how entirely ignorant she was of the crimes laid against Mariamne she leaped out of her place and approached her daughter in the hearing of all the peo ple and cried out that she had been an ill woman and ungrateful to her husband and that her punishment came justly upon her for her insolent behaviour for that she had not made proper returns to him who had been their common benefactor And when she had for some time acted after this hypo critical manner and been so outrageous as to tear her hair this indecent and dissem bling behaviour as was to be expected was greatly condemned by the rest of the spec  Whereas Mariamne is here represented as reproaching Herod with the murder of her father Alexander as well as her brother Aristobulus while it was her grandfather Hyrcanus and not her father Alexander whom he caused voL I â NOS 47  48 to be slain as Josephus himself informs us chap 6 we must either take Zonaras s reading which is here grand father rightly or else we must as before chap 1 allow a slip of Josephus s pen or memory in the place before ub 4R 556 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS tators as it was principally by her the poor woman was to suffer For at the first she gave her not a word nor was discom posed at her peevishness and only looked at her yet did she out of a greatness of soul discover her concern for her mother s offence and especially for her exposing herself in a manner so unbecoming But as for herself she went to her death with an unshaken firm ness of mind and without changing colour and thereby evidently discovered the nobility of her descent to the spectators even in the last moments of her life And thus died Mariamne a woman of an excellent character both for chastity and greatness of soul but she wanted moderation and had too much of contention in her nature yet had she all that can be said in the beauty of her body and her majestic appearance in conversation and thence arose the greatest part of the occasions why she did not prove so agreeable to the king nor live so pleasantly with him as she might otherwise have done For while she was most indulgently used by the king out of his fondness for her and did not expect that he could do any thing hard to her she took too unbounded a liberty Moreover that which most afflicted her was what he had done to her relations and she ventured to speak of all they had suffered by him And at last greatly provoked both the king s mother and sister till they became enemies to her and even he himself also did the same on whom alone she depended for her expectations of escaping the last of punishments But when she was dead the king s affec tions for her were kindled in a more outra geous manner than before for his love to her was not of a calm nature nor such as we usually meet with among other husbands For at its commencement it was of an enthu siastic kind Nor was it by their long co habitation and free conversation together brought under his power to manage But at this time his love to Mariamne seemed to seize him in such a peculiar manner as looked like divine vengeance upon him for the taking away her life For he would fre quently call for her and frequently lament for her in a most violent manner He also bethought him of every thing he could make use of to divert his mind from thinking of her and contrived feasts and assemblies for that purpose But nothing would suffice He therefore laid aside the administration of public affairs and was so far conquered by his passion that he would order his ser vants to call for Mariamne as if she were still alive and could still hear them And when he was in this way there arose a pes tilential disease and carried off the greatest part of the multitude and of his best and most esteemed friends and made all men suspect that this distemper was brought upon them by the anger of God for the in justice that had been done to Mariamne This circumstance affected the king still more till at length he forced himself to go into desert places and there under pre tence of going a hunting bitterly afflicted himself Yet had he not borne his grief there many days before he fell into a most dangerous distemper himself He had an inflammation upon him and a pain in the hinder part of his head joined with madness And the remedies that were used did him no good at all but proved contrary to his case and so at length brought him to des pair All the physicians also that were about him partly because the medicines they brought for his recovery could not at all con quer the disease and partly because his diet could be no other than what his disease in clined him to desired him to eat whatever he had a mind to and so left the small hopes they had of his recovery in the power of that diet and committed him to fortune And thus did his distemper go on while he was at Samaria now called Sebaste Alexandra in the mean time abode at Je rusalem and being informed what condition Herod was in she endeavoured to get pos session of the fortified places that were about the city which were two the one belonging to the city the other belonging to the temple And those that could get them into their hands had the whole nation under their power For without the command of them it was not possible to offer their sacrifices And to think of leaving off those sacrifices is to every Jew plainly impossible who are still more ready to lose their lives than to leave off that divine worship which they have been wont to pay unto God Alexandra there fore discoursed with those that had the keep â AN 29 557 ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS ing of these strong holds that it was proper for them to deliver the same to her and to Herod s sons lest upon his death any other person should seize upon the government And that upon his recovery none could keep them more safely for him than those of his own family These words however were not by them taken in good part for as they had been in former times faithful to Herod they resolved to continue so now more than ever both because they hated Alexandra and be cause they thought it a sort of impiety to despair of Herod s recovery while he was yet alive For they had been his old friends and one of them whose name was Achiabus was his cousin german They sent messen gers therefore to acquaint him with Alexan dra s design So he made no longer delay but gave orders to have her slain Yet was it still with difficulty and after he had en dured great pain that he got clear of his dis temper He was still sorely afflicted both in mind and body and made very uneasy and readier than ever upon all occasions to inflict punishment upon those that fell under his hand He also slew the most intimate of his friends Costobarus and Lysimachus and Gadias who was also called Antipater as also Dositheus and that upon the following occasion â Costobarus was an Idumean by birth and one of principal dignity among them and one whose ancestors had been priests to the Koze whom the Idumeans had formerly es teemed as a god But after Hyrcanus had made a change in their political government and made them receive the Jewish customs and law Herod made Costobarus governor of Idumea and Gaza and gave him his sister Salome to wife And this was upon his slaughter of his uncle Joseph who had that government before as we have related already When Costobarus had gotten to be so highly advanced it pleased him and was more than he hoped for and he was more and more puffed up by his good success and in a little while he exceeded all bounds and did not think fit to obey what Herod as their ruler commanded him or that the Idumeans should make use of the Jewish customs or be subject to them He therefore sent to Cleo patra and informed her that the Idumeans had been always under his progenitors and that for the same reason it was but just she should desire that country for him of Antony for that he was ready to transfer his friend ship to her And this he did not because he was better pleased to be under Cleopatra s government but because he thought that upon the diminution of Herod s power it would not be difficult for him to obtain the entire government over the Idumeans and somewhat more also For he raised his hopes still higher as having no small pretences both by his birth and by these riches which he had gotten by his constant attention to filthy lucre And accordingly it was not a small matter that he aimed at So Cleopa tra desired this country of Antony but failed of her purpose Herod on receiving intelli gence of this was ready to kill Costobarus yet upon the entreaties of his sister and mo ther he forgave him and vouchsafed to par don him entirely though he still had a suspi cion of him afterward for this his attempt But some time afterward when Salome happened to quarrel with Costobarus sheJ sent him a bill of divorce and dissolved her marriage with him Though this was not according to the Jewish laws for with us it is lawful for a husband to do so but a wife if she depart from her husband cannot of herself be married to another unless her former husband put her away However  An 28 t Chap 3 J Here is a plain example of a Jewish lady giving a bill of divorce to her husband though in the days of Josephus it was not by the Jews esteemed lawful for a woman so to do See the like XX 7 and among the Parthians XVIII 9 However the Christian law when it allowed divorce for adultery Matt v 32 allowed the innocent wife to divorce her guilty husband as well as the innocent husband to divorce his guilty wife as we learn from the shepherd of Hennas Mand IV and from the second apology of Justin Martyr where a prosecu tion was brought upon the Christians upon such a di vorce And I think the Roman laws permitted it at that time as well as the laws of Christianity Now this Ba bas who was one of the race of the Asmoneans or Mac cabees is related by the Jews as Dr Hudson here re marks to have been so eminently religious in the Jew ish way that excepting the day following the tenth of Tisri the great day of atonement when he seems to have supposed all his sins entirely forgiven he used every day of the whole year to offer a sacrifice for his sins of ignorance or such as he supposed he had been guilty of but did not distinctly remember See somewhat like it of Agrippa the Great XrX 7 and Job i 4 4R2 558 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Salome chose to follow not the law of her country but the law of her authority and so  renounced her wedlock and told her brother Herod that she left her husband out of her good will to him because she perceived that he with Antipater and Lysimachus and Dositheus were raising a sedition against him As an evidence of which she alleged the case of the sons of Babas that they had been by him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years which proved to be true But when Herod thus unexpectedly heard of it he was greatly surprised at it and the more so because the relation appeared in credible to him As for the fact relating to these sons of Babas Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punish ment as being enemies to his government But they were now forgotten by him on ac count of the length of time since he had or dered them to be slain Now the cause of his ill will and hatred to them arose hence that while Antigonus was king Herod with his army besieged the city of Jerusalem where the distress and miseries which the besieged endured were so pressing that the great number of them invited Herod into the city and already placed their hopes on him Now the sons of Babas were of great dignity and had power among the multitude and were faithful to Antigonus and were always raising calumnies against Herod and encouraged the people to preserve the government to that royal family which held it by inheritance So these men acted thus politically and as they thought for their own advantage But when the city was taken and Herod had gotten the government into his hands and Costobarus was appointed to hinder men from passing out at the gates and to guard the city that those citizens that were of the party opposite to the king might not get out of it Costobarus being sensible that the sons of Babas were had in respect and honour by the whole multitude and supposing that their preservation might be of great advan tage to him in the changes of government afterward set them by themselves and con cealed them in his own farms And when the thing was suspected he assured Herod upon oath that he knew nothing of the matter and so overcame the suspicions that lay upon him Nay after that when the king had publicly proposed a reward for the discovery and had put in practice all sorts of methods for searching out this matter he would not confess it But being persuaded that when he had at first denied it if the men were found he should not escape unpunished he was forced to keep them secret not only out of his good will to them but out of a neces sary regard to his own preservation But when the king knew the thing by his sister s information he sent men to the places where he had the intimation they were concealed and ordered both them and those that were accused as guilty with them to be slain Insomuch that there were now none left of the kindred of Hyrcanus and the kingdom was entirely in Herod s power and there was nobody remaining of such dignity as could put a stop to what he did against the Jewish laws v CHAP VIII OF A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HEROD FOR THE FOREIGN PRACTICES HE HAD INTRODUCED J AND OF THE BUILD ING OF SEBASTE CESAREA AND OTHER EDIFICES ON this account Herod revolted from the laws of his country and corrupted their ancient constitution by the introduction of foreign practices which constitution yet ought to have been preserved inviolable By which means we became guilty of great wickedness afterward while those religious observances which used to lead the multi tude to piety were now neglected For in the first place he appointed solemn games to be celebrated every fifth year in honour of Caesar and built a theatre at Jerusalem as also a very great amphitheatre in the plain Both of them were indeed costly works but opposite to the Jewish customs For we have had no such shews delivered down to us fit to be used or exhibited by us Yet did he celebrate these games every five years in the most solemn and splendid man ner He also made proclamation to the neighbouring countries and called men to gether out of every nation The wrestlers also and the rest of those that strove for the prizes in such games were invited out of every land both by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed and by the glory of victory to be there gained So the principal AN 26 559 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS persons that were the most eminent in these sorts of exercises were gotten together For there were very great rewards for victory proposed not only to those that performed their exercises naked but to those that per formed as musicians also and were called Thymelici And he spared no pains to in duce all persons the most famous for such exercises to come to this contest for victory He also proposed no small rewards to those who ran for the prizes in chariot races when they were drawn by four three or two pair of horses He also imitated every thing though ever so costly or magnificent in other nations out of an ambition that he might give the most public demonstrations of his grandeur Inscriptions also of the great ac tions of Caesar and trophies of those nations which he had conquered in his wars and all made of the purest gold and silver encom passed the theatre Nor was there any thing that could be subservient to his design whe ther it were precious garments or precious stones set in order which was not also ex posed to sight in these games He had also made a preparation of wild beasts in great abundance and of such other animals as were either of uncommon strength or of such a sort as were rarely seen These were prepared either to fight with one another or that men who were condemned to death were to fight with them And truly foreigners were greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses here exhibited and at the great dangers that were here seen But to natural Jews this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for which they had so great a veneration It appeared also no better than an instance of barefaced im piety to throw men to wild beasts for the purpose of affording delight to the spectators And it appeared an instance of no less im piety to change their own laws for such foreign exercises But above all the rest the trophies gave most distaste to the Jews for as they imagined them to be images included within the armour that hung round about  These grand plays and shews and Thymelici or music meetings and chariot races when the chariots were drawn by four three or two pair of horses c instituted by Herod in his theatres were still as we see here considered by the sober Jews as heathenish sports and tending to corrupt the manners of the Jewish nation them they were greatly displeased because it was not the custom of their country to pay honour to such images Herod was perfectly acquainted with the disturbance they were under and as he thought it unseasonable to use violence he spake to some of them by way of consolation and in order to free them from that supersti tious fear they were under Yet could not he satisfy them but they cried out with one accord out of their great uneasiness at the offences they thought he had been guilty of that although they should think of bearing all the rest yet would they never bear images of men in their city meaning the trophies be cause this was disagreeable to the laws of their country Now when Herod saw that they would not easily change their resolution unless they received satisfaction in this point he called to him the most eminent men among them and brought them upon the theatre and shewed them the trophies and asked what sort of things they took these trophies to be And when they cried out that they were the images of men he gave order that they should be stripped of the outward orna ments which were about them and shewed them the naked pieces of wood which pieces of wood now without any ornaments became matter of great sport and laughter to them because they had before always had the ornaments of images themselves in derision When therefore Herod had thus dissipated the vehemency of passion under which the multitude had been the greatest part of the people were disposed to change their con duct and not to be displeased at him any longer But still some 01 them retained their displeasure against him for his introduction of new customs and esteemed the violation of the laws of their country as likely to be the origin of very great mischiefs So that they deemed it an instance of piety rather to hazard themselves to be put to death than to seem as if they took no notice of Herod who upon the change he had made in their and to bring them into love with Paganish idolatry and Paganish conduct of life to the dissolution of the law of Moses and accordingly were severely condemned by them as appears here and every where else in Jo sephus 560 BOOK â ¼ ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS government introduced such customs as they had never been used to before as in deed in pretence a king but in reality one that shewed himself an enemy to their whole nation On this account ten men that were citizens of Jerusalem conspired together against Herod and swore to one another to undergo any dangers in the attempt and took daggers with them under their gar ments for the purpose of killing him Now there was a certain blind man among these conspirators who had thus sworn on ac count of the indignation he had against what he heard to have been done He was not indeed able to afford the rest any great as sistance in this undertaking but was ready to undergo any suffering with them in the event of their sustaining any harm insomuch that he became a very great encourager of the rest of the undertakers When they had taken this resolution they went up into the theatre hoping that He rod himself could not escape them as they should fall upon him so unexpectedly and supposing that if they missed of him they should kill a great many of those that were about him And this resolution they took though they should die for it in order to suggest to the king what injuries he had done to the multitude These conspirators standing thus previously prepared went about their design with great alacrity But there was one of those spies of Herod s that were appointed to inform him of any con spiracies that should be made against him who found out the whole affair and told the king of it as he was about to go into the theatre So when he reflected on the ha tred which he knew the majority of the peo ple bore him and on the disturbances that arose upon every occasion he thought this plot against him not to be improbable Ac cordingly he retired into his palace and called those that were accused of this con spiracy before him by their several names And as upon the guards falling upon them they were caught in the very fact and knew they could not escape they prepared themselves for their ends with all the de cency they could and so as not to recede from their resolute behaviour For they shewed no shame for what they were about nor denied it but when they were seized they shewed their daggers and professed that the conspiracy they had sworn to was a holy and a pious action that what they intended to do was not for gain nor out of any indulgence to their passions but prin cipally for those common customs of their country which all the Jews were obliged to observe or to die for them This was what these men said out of their undaunted cou rage in this conspiracy So they were led away to execution by the king s guards that stood about them and patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they died Nor was it long before that spy who had discovered them was seized on by some of the people out of the hatred they bore him and was not only slain by them but pulled to pieces limb from limb and given to the dogs This action was seen by many of the citizens yet would not one of them discover the perpetrators of it till upon Herod s making a strict scrutiny after them by bitter and severe tortures certain women that were tortured confessed what they had seen done The authors of the fact were then so terribly punished by the king that their entire families were destroyed for this rash attempt Yet did not the obstinacy of the people and that undaunted constancy they shewed in the defence of their laws make Herod any easier to them but he still strengthened himself after a more secure manner and resolved to encompass the multitude every way lest such innovations should terminate in an open rebellion Since therefore he had now the city for tified by the palace in which he lived and by the temple  which had a strong fortress by it called Antonia and rebuilt by himself he contrived to make Samaria a fortress for himself also against the people and called it Sebaste supposing that this place would be a strong hold against the country not inferior to the former So he fortified that f lace which was a day s journey distant rom Jerusalem and which would therefore be useful to him in common to keep both the country and the city in awe He also built another fortress for the whole nation It was anciently called Strato s tower but was by him named Caesarea He chose out some select horsemen and placed them in the great plain and built for them a place AN 20 561 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in Galilee called Gaba with Hesebonitis in Perea And these were the places which he particularly built While he was always inventing somewhat farther for his own se curity and encompassing the whole nation with guards that they might by no means get from under his power nor fall into tu mults which they did continually upon any small commotion and that if they did make any commotions he might know of it while some of his spies might be upon them from the neighbourhood and might both be able to know what they were attempting and to prevent it And when he went about build ing the walls of Samaria he contrived to bring thither many of those that had been assisting to him in his wars and many of the people in that neighbourhood whom he made fellow citizens with the rest This he did out of an ambitious desire of building a temple and out of a desire to make the city more eminent than it had been before but principally because he contrived that it might at once be for his own security and a monument of his magnificence He also changed its name and called it fSebaste and parted the adjoining country which was excellent in its kind among the inhabitants of Samaria that they might be in a happy condition upon their first coming to inhabit Besides this he encompassed the city with a wall of great strength and made use of the acclivity of the place for making his for tifications stronger Nor was the compass of the place made now so small as it had been before but was such as rendered it not inferior to the most famous cities For it was twenty furlongs in circumference Now within and about the middle of it he built a sacred place of a furlong and a half in circuit and adorned it with all sorts of decorations and therein erected a temple which was illustrious on account of both its largeness and beauty And as to the several parts of the city he adorned them with deco rations of all sorts also and made the walls very strong for his own security and made it for the greatest part a citadel and as to the elegance of the buildings it was taken care of also that he might leave monuments of his taste and beneficence to future ages CHAP IX of the famine that happened in judf a and syria herod s marriage with simon s daughter and the rebuilding of cfsarea and other grecian CITIES NOW on this year which was the thir teenth of the reign of Herod very great calamities came upon the country Whether they were derived from the anger of God or Jwhether this misery return again naturally in certain periods of time For in the first place there were perpetual droughts and for that reason the ground was barren and did not bring forth the same quantity of fruits that it used to produce And after this barrenness of the soil that change of food which the want of corn occa sioned produced distempers in the bodies of men and a pestilential disease prevailed one misery following upon the back of ano ther And these circumstances that they were destitute both of methods of cure and of food made the pestilential distemper which began after a violent manner the more lasting The destruction of men also after such a manner deprived those that had survived of all their courage because they had no way to provide remedies sufficient for the distresses they were in When there fore the fruits of that year were spoiled and whatsoever they had previously laid up was spent there was no foundation of hope for relief remaining but the misery contrary to what they expected still increased upon them And this not only on that year while they had nothing for themselves left at the end of it but what seed they had sown perished also by reason of the ground not yielding its fruits on the second year This  Perhaps Gamala t Augusta in honour of Augustus Caesar  Here we have an eminent example of the language of Josephus in his writing to Gentiles different from that when he wrote to the Jews In his writing to whom he still derives all such judgments from the anger of God But because he knew many of the Gentiles thought they might naturally come in certain periods he complies with them in the following sentence See the note On the War I 33 II This famine for two years that affected Judea and Syria the 13th and 14th years of Herod which are the 24th and 23d years before the Christian Era seems to have been more terrible during this time than was that in the days of Jacob Gen xli xlii And what makes the comparison the more remarkable is this that now as 562 book xv ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS distress obliged them also out of necessity to eat many things that did not use to be eaten Nor was the king himself free from any dis tress any more than other men as being de prived of that tribute he used to have from the fruits of the grounds and having already expended what money he had in his liberality to those whose cities he had built Nor had he any people that were worthy of his assist ance since this miserable state of things had procured him the hatred of his subjects for it is a constant rule that misfortunes are still laid to the account of those that govern In these circumstances he considered with himself how to procure some seasonable help But this was a hard thing to be done while their neighbours had no food to sell them and their money also was gone had it been possible to purchase a little food at a great H ice However he resolved not to leave off lis endeavours to assist his people So he cut off the rich furniture that was in his palace both of silver and gold insomuch that he did not spare the finest vessels he had or those that were made with the most elaborate skill of the artificers but sent the money to Petronius who had been made prefect of Egypt by Caesar And as not a few had already fled to him under their ne cessities and as he was particularly a friend to Herod and desirous to have his subjects preserved he gave leave to them in the first place to export corn and assisted them every way both in purchasing and exporting the same so that he was the principal if not the only person who afforded them what help they had And Herod taking care the people should understand that this help came from himself did hereby not only remove the ill opinion of those that formerly hated him but gave them the greatest possible demon stration of his good will For in the first place as for those who were able to provide their own food he distributed to them their portion of corn in the exactest manner but for those that were not able either by reason of their old age or any other infirmity to pro well as then the relief they had was from Egypt also then from Joseph the governor of Egypt under Pharaoh king of Egypt and now from Petronius the prefect of Egypt under Augustus the Roman emperor See almost the like case XX 2 and 5 It also worth our observa tion here that these two years were a sabbatic year and a yeai of Jubilee for which Providence during the vide food for themselves he made this pro vision for them that the bakers should make their bread ready for them He also took care that they might not be hurt by the dan gers of winter since they were in great want of clothing by reason of the utter destruction of their sheep and goats till they had no wool to make use of nor any thing else to cover themselves withal And when he had pro cured these things for his own subjects he went farther in order to provide necessaries for their neighbours and gave seed to the Syrians which thing turned greatly to his own advantage also this charitable assistance being afforded most seasonably to their fruit ful soil so that every one had now a plenti ful provision of food Upon the whole when the harvest of the land was approaching he sent no fewer than fifty thousand men whom he had sustained into the country By which means he both repaired the afflicted condi tion of his own kingdom with great genero sity and diligence and lightened the afflic tions of his neighbours who were under the same calamities For there was nobody who had been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by him Nay farther there were neither any people cities nor private men who were to make provision for multitudes and on that account were in want of support and had recourse to him but re ceived what they stood in need of Inso much that it appeared upon a computation that the number of cori of wheat of ten Attic medimni a piece that were given to foreign ers amounted to ten thousand and the number that were given in his own kingdom was about eighty thousand Now it happened that this care and seasonable benefaction had such influence on the Jews and was so ex tolled among other nations as to wipe off that old hatred which his violation of some of their customs during his reign had pro cured him among all the nation and that this liberality of his assistance in this their great necessity was a full satisfaction for all that he had done of that nature as it also procured theocracy used to provide a triple crop beforehand but became now when the Jews had forfeited that blessing the greatest years of famine to them ever since the days of Ahab 1 Kings xvii xviii  This Petronius the prefect of Egypt under Augustus Caesar is mentioned by Strabo XVII page 778 and by Dio Cassius LIV page 524 as Spanheimhere informs us AN 24 563 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS him great fame among foreigners And it looked as if these calamities that afflicted his land to a degree plainly incredible came in order to raise his glory and to be to his great advantage For the greatness of his liberality in these distresses which he now demonstra ted beyond all expectation did so change the disposition of the multitude towards him that they were ready to suppose he had been from the beginning not such a one as they had found him to be by experience but such a one as the care he had taken of them in sup plying their necessities proved him now to be About this time he sent five hundred chosen men out of his body guards as auxiliaries to Caesar whom Elius Gallus led to the Red Sea and who were of great service to him there When therefore his affairs were thus improved and again were in a flourishing condition he built himself a palace in the upper city raising the rooms to a very great height and adorning them with the most costly furniture of gold and marble seats and beds and these were so large that they could contain many companies of men These apartments were also of different sizes and had particular names given them For one apartment was called Caesar s another Agrip pa s c He also fell in love again and mar ried another wife not suffering his reason to hinder him from living as he pleased The occasion of this marriage was as follows There was one Simon a citizen of Jerusalem the son of Boethus a citizen of Alexandria and a priest of great note there This man had a daughter who was esteemed the most beautiful woman of that time And when the Eeople of Jerusalem began to speak much in er commendation it happened that Herod was much affected with what was said of her and when he saw the damsel he was smitten with her beauty Yet did he entirely reject the thoughts of using his authority to abuse her as believing that by so doing he should be stigmatized for violence and tyranny So he thought it best to take the damsel to wife And while Simon was of a dignity too inferior to be allied to him but still too considerable to be despised he governed his inclinations after the most prudent manner by augmenting  This Elius Gallus seems to be no other than that Elius Largus whom Dio speaks of as conducting an ex pedition that was about this time made into Arabia Felix voL I NOS 47  48 the dignity of the family and making them more honourable Accordingly he deprived Jesus the son of Phabet of the high priest hood and conferred that dignity on Simon and so joined in affinity with him by marrying his daughter When this wedding was over Herod built another citadel in that place where he had conquered the Jews when he was driven out of his government and Antigonus enjoyed it This citadel is distant from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs It was strong by nature and fit for such a building It is a sort of a mo derate hill raised to a farther height by the hand of man till it was of the shape of a wo man s breast It is encompassed with circu lar towers and has a straight ascent to it which is composed of two hundred steps of polished stones Within it are royal and very rich apartments of a structure that provided both for security and for beauty About the bottom there are habitations of such a struc ture as are well worth seeing both on other accounts and also on account of the water which is brought thither from a great way off and at vast expense For the place itself is destitute of water The plain that is about this citadel is full of edifices not inferior to any city in largeness and having the hill above it in the nature of a castle And now when all Herod s designs had succeeded according to his hopes he had not the least suspicion that any troubles could arise in his kingdom because he kept his people obedient as well by the fear they stood in of him for he was implacable in the infliction of his punishments as by the provi dent care he had shewn towards them after the most magnanimous manner when they were under their distresses But still he took care to have external security for his govern ment as a fortress against his subjects For the orations he made to the cities were very fine and full of kindness and he cultivated a good understanding with their governors and bestowed presents on every one of them in ducing them thereby to be more friendly to him and using his magnificent disposition so as his kingdom might be the better secured to him and this till all his affairs were every LIII according to Petavius who is here cited by Span heiro See a full account of this expedition in Prideaux at the years 24 and 23 4S 664 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS way more and more augmented But then this magnificent temper of his and that sub missive behaviour and liberality which he ex ercised towards Caesar and the most power ful men of Rome obliged him to transgress the customs of his nation and to set aside many of their laws and by building cities after an extravagant manner and erecting temples not in Judea indeed for that would not have been permitted it being forbidden us to pay any honour to images or representations of animals after the manner of the Greeks but still he did thus in the country properly out of our bounds and in the cities thereof The apology which he made to the Jews for these things was that all was done not out of his own inclinations but by the commands and injunctions of others in order to please Caesar and the Romans as though he had not the Jewish customs so much in his eye as he had the honour of those Romans while yet he had himself entirely in view all the while and indeed was very ambitious to leave great monuments of his government to posterity Whence it was that he was so zealous in building such fine cities and expended such vast sums of money upon them Now fupon his noticing a place near the sea which was very proper for containing a city and was before called Strato s tower he set about getting a plan for a magnificent city there and erected many edifices of white stone with great diligence all over it He also adorned it with most sumptuous palaces and large edifices for containing the people and what was the greatest and most laborious work of all he adorned it with a haven that was always free from the waves of the sea Its largeness was not less than the Pyraeum at Athens and had towards the city a double station for the ships It was of excellent workmanship and this was the more remarkable for its being built in a place that of itself was not suitable to such noble structures but was to be brought to perfection by materials from other places and at very great expenses  One may here take notice that how tyrannical and extravagant soever Herod were in himself and in his Grecian cities as to those plays shews and temples for idolatry mentioned above chap 8 and here also yet durst even he introduce very few of them into the cities This city is situate in Phoenicia in the pas sage by sea to Egypt between Joppa and Dora which are lesser maritime cities and not fit for havens on account of the impetu ous south winds that beat upon them which rolling the sands that come from the sea against the shores do not admit of ships lying in their station but the merchants are generally there forced to ride at their anchors in the sea itself So Herod endea voured to rectify this inconvenience and laid out such a compass towards the land as might be sufficient for a haven wherein the great ships might lie in safety And this he effected by letting down vast stones of above fifty feet in length not less than eighteen in breadth and nine in depth into twenty fathoms deep and as some were lesser so were others bigger than those dimensions This mole which he built by the seaside was two hundred feet wide the half of which was opposed to the current of the waves so as to keep off those waves which were to break upon them and so was called Procymatia or the first breaker of the waves but the other half had upon it a wall with several towers the largest of which was a work of very great excellence and was called Drusus from the son in law of Caesar who died young There were a great num ber of arches where the mariners dwelt and there was also before them a key or landing place which ran round the entire haven and was a most agreeable walk But the entrance or mouth of the port was made on the north quarter on which side was the stillest of the winds of all in this place And the basis of the whole circuit on the left hand at the entrance of the port sup ported a round turret which was made very strong in order to resist the greatest waves while on the right hand stood two vast stones and those each of them larger than the turret which was over against them These stood upright and were joined to gether Now there were edifices all along the circular haven made of the finest stone with a certain elevation whereon was erected of the Jews who as Josephus here notes would not even then have permitted it so zealous were the still for many of the laws of Moses even under so tyrannical a government as this of Herod the Great t An 22 An 22 565 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS a temple that was seen a great way off by those that were sailing for that haven and had in it two statues the one of Rome the other of Caesar As the city itself was called Caesarea which was also built of fine materials and was of a fine structure Nay the very subterranean vaults and cellars had no less of architecture bestowed on them than had the building above ground Some of these vaults carried things at even dis tances to the haven and to the sea but one of them ran obliquely and bound all the rest together that both the rain and the filth of the streets were together carried off with ease and the sea itself upon the flux of the tide from without came into the city and washed it all clean Herod also built therein a theatre of stone and on the south quarter behind the port he erected an am phitheatre capable of holding a vast num ber of men and conveniently situated for a prospect of the sea So this city was thus finished in twelve years during which time the king did not fail both to go on with the work and to pay the charges that were necessary CHAP X OF ZENODORUS AND THE TRACHONITES AND THE ACCUSA TION BROUGHT AGAINST HEROD BY THE GADARENES ALSO OF THE PHARISEES THE ESSENES AND MANAHEM WHEN Herod had rebuilt Sebaste or Samaria he resolved to send his sons Alexander and Aristobulus to Rome to enjoy the company of Caesar Accordingly when they came thither they were enter tained at the house of tPollio who was very fond of Herod s friendship and they had leave to lodge in Caesar s own palace for he received these sons of Herod with all hu manity and gave Herod permission to give his kingdom to which of his sons he pleased and besides all this he bestowed on him  Caesarea being here said to be rebuilt and adorned in twelve years and soon afterwards in ten years XVI 5 there must be a mistake in one of the places as to the true number but in which of them it is hard positively to determine I prefer the latter reading because in the 13th and 14th years of Herod s reign was the terrible famine in Judea which would prevent any fulness of his treasury for some years because then it will begin in his 18th year when we know he had recovered himself enough to set about rebuilding the temple Trachon and Batanea and Auranitis on the following occasion One JZenodorus had hired what was called the house of Lysanias But he was not satisfied with its revenues he became a partner with the robbers who inhabited the Trachones and so procured himself a larger income For the inhabi tants of those places lived in a mad way and pillaged the country of the Damascenes while Zenodorus did not restrain them but partook of the prey they acquired Now as the neighbouring people were hereby great sufferers they complained to Varro who was then president of Syria and entreated him to write to Caesar about this injustice of Zenodorus When these matters were laid before Caesar he wrote back to Varro to destroy those nests of robbers and to give the land to Herod that by his care the neighbouring countries might be no longer disturbed with these doings of the Tracho nites For it was not an easy thing to re strain them since this way of robbery had been their usual practice and they had no other way to get their living because they had neither any city of their own nor lands in their possession but only some recepta cles and dens in the earth and there they and their cattle lived in common together However they had made contrivances to get pools of water and laid up corn in gra naries for themselves and were able to make great resistance by issuing out sud denly against any that attacked them For the entrances of their caves were narrow in which but one could come at a time and the places within incredibly large and made very wide But the ground over their habi tations was not very high but rather on a plain while the rocks are altogether hard and difficult to be entered upon unless any one gets into the plain road by the guidance of another For these roads are not straight but have several revolutions But when t This Pollio with whom Herod s sons lived at Rome was not Pollio the Pharisee already mentioned by Jose phus chap 1 and again presently after this chap 10 but Asinius Pollio the Roman  The character of this Zenodorus is so like that of a famous robber of the same name in Strabo and that about this very country about this time also that I think Dr Hudson hardly needed to have put a perhaps to his de termination that they were the same See Strabo XVI page 756 if 4S2 506 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS these men are hindered from their depreda tions upon their neighbours their custom is to prey one upon another insomuch that no sort of injustice comes amiss to them But when Herod had received this grant from Caesar and was come into this country he procured skilful guides and put a stop to their wicked robberies and procured peace and quietness to the neighbouring people Hereupon Zenodorus was grieved in the first place because his principality was taken away from him and still more so because he envied Herod who had gotten it So he went up to Rome to accuse him but returned back without success Now Agrippa was about this time sent to succeed Caesar in the government of the countries beyond the Ionian sea and Herod met with him when he was wintering about Mitylene for he had been his particular friend and companion and then returned into Judea again Some of the Gadarenes now came to Agrippa and accused Herod but they were sent back bound to the king without a hearing The Arabians how ever who of old bare ill will to Herod s go vernment were incensed and at that time attempted to raise a sedition in his dominions and as they thought upon a more justifiable occasion For Zenodorus despairing already of success as to his own affairs prevented his enemies by selling to those Arabians a part of his principality called Auranitis for the value of fifty talents But as this was included in the donation of Caesar they contested the point with Herod as unjustly deprived of what they had bought Sometimes they did this by making incursions upon his territories sometimes by attempting force against him and sometimes by going to law with him They also persuaded the poorer soldiers to help them and were troublesome to him out of a constant hope that they should induce the people to raise a sedition In which de signs those that are in the most miserable cir cumstances of life are still the most earnest And although Herod had been a great while apprised of these attempts yet did not he in dulge any severity against them but by ra tional methods aimed to mitigate things as not willing to give any handle for tumults Now4 when Herod had reigned for seven  These cities Mitylene and Gadara have both coins still extant as Spanheim here informs us teen years Caesar came into Syria at which time the greatest part of the inhabitants of Gadara clamoured against Herod as one that was heavy in his injunctions and tyrannical These reproaches they chiefly ventured upon by the encouragement of Zenodorus who took his oath that he would never leave Herod till he had procured that they should be sepa rated from Herod s kingdom and joined to Caesar s province The Gadarenes were in duced hereby and made no small cry against him and that the more boldly because those that had been delivered up by Agrippa were not punished by Herod who let them go and did them no harm For indeed he was the principal man in the world who appeared almost inexorable in punishing crime in his own family but very generous in remitting the offences that were committed elsewhere And while they accused Herod of injuries and plunderings and subversions of temples he stood unconcerned and was ready to make his defence However Caesar gave him his right hand and remitted nothing of his kind ness to him upon this disturbance by the multitude And indeed these things were alleged the first day but the hearing pro ceeded no farther For as the Gadarenes saw the inclination of Caesar and of his asses sors and expected as they had reason to do that they should be delivered up to the king some of them out of a dread of the torments they might undergo cut their own throats in the night and some of them threw themselves down precipices and others cast themselves into the river and destroyed themselves of their own accord Which accidents seemed a sufficient condemnation of the rashness and crimes they had been guilty of Hereupon Caesar made no longer delay but cleared Herod from the crimes he was accused of Another happy accident there was which was a farther great advantage to Herod at this time For Zenodorus s belly burst and a great quantity of blood issued from him in his sickness and he thereby departed this life at Antioch in Syria So Caesar bestowed his country upon Herod It lay between Trachon and Galilee and contained Ulatha and Pa neas and the country round about He also made him one of the procurators of Syria t An 21 AN 21 567 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and commanded that they should do every thing with his approbation And in short he arrived at that pitch of felicity that whereas there were but two men that govern ed the vast Roman empire first Caesar and Agrippa who was his principal favourite Caesar preferred no one to Herod besides Agrippa and Agrippa made no one his greater friend than Herod besides Caesar And when he had acquired such freedom he begged of Caesar a tetrarchy for his brother Pheroras while he did himself bestow upon him a revenue of a hundred talents out of his own kingdom that in case he came to any harm himself his brother might be in safety and that his sons might not have any dominion over him So when he had conducted Caesar to the sea and was re turned home he built a most beautiful temple of the whitest stone in Zenodorus s country near the place called Penium This is a very fine cave in a mountain under which there is a great cavity in the earth and the cavern is abrupt and prodigiously deep and full of still water Over it hangs a vast moun tain and under the caverns arise the springs of the river Jordan Herod adorned this place which was already a very remarkable one still farther by the erection of this tem ple which he dedicated to Caesar At this time Herod released to his subjects the third part of their taxes under pretence indeed of relieving them after the dearth they had had but the main reason was to recover their good will which he now wanted For they were uneasy because of the innovations he had introduced in their practices of the dissolution of their religion and of the disuse of their own customs And the people every where talked against him like those that were still more and more provoked and disturbed at his procedure Against these discontents however he greatly guarded himself and took away the opportunities they might have to disturb him and enjoined them to be always at work Nor did he permit the citizens either to assemble or to walk or eat together but watched every thing they did and when any were caught they were severely punished And many there were who were brought to the citadel Hyrcania both openly and secret ly and were there put to death And there were spies set every where both in the city and in the roads who watched those that met together Nay it is reported that he did not himself neglect this part of caution but that he would oftentimes assume the habit of a private man and mix among the multitude in the night time and make trial what opinion they had of his government And as for those that could no way be reduced to acquiesce under his scheme of government he prose cuted them all manner of way But for the rest of the multitude he required that they should be obliged to take an oath of fidelity to him and at the same time compelled them to swear that they would bear him good will and continue certain so to do in his manage ment of the government And indeed a great part of them either to please him or out of fear of punishments yielded to what he re quired But for such as were of a more open and generous disposition and had indignation at the force he used to them he by one means or other made away with them He endea voured also to persuade Pollio the Pharisee and Sameans and the greatest part of their scholars to take the oath But these would neither submit so to do nor were they pu nished together with the rest out of the rever ence he bore to Pollio The Essenes also as we call a sect of ours were excused from this imposition These men live the same kind of life as do those whom the Greeks call Pythagoreans concerning whom I shall dis course more fully felsewhere However it is proper to set down here the reasons where fore Herod had these Essenes in such honor and thought higher of them than their mortal nature required Nor will this account be un suitable to the nature of this history as it will shew the opinion men had of these Essenes  A tetrarchy properly and originally denoted the fourth part of an entire kingdom or country and a te trarch one that was ruler of such a fourth part which al ways implies somewhat less extent of dominion and power than belong to a kingdom and to a king But this first exactness has not always been adhered to in the use of these words and Pliny reckons no fewer than six about Decapolis as Noldius takes notice De Herod page 368 But that Zenodorus was once tetrarch or go vernor of Trachonitis we learn from Dio as Spanheim observes here This tetrarchy of Pheroras was in Perea beyond Jordan t See Of the Wars Book ii chap 8 568 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Now there was one of these Essenes whose name was Manahem who had this testimony that he not only conducted his life after an excellent manner but had the foreknow ledge of future events given by God This man once saw Herod when he was a child and going to school and saluted him as king of the Jews But he thinking that either he did not know him or that he was in jest re minded him that he was but a private person But Manahem smiled to himself and clapped him on the back with his hand and said However that be thou wilt be king and wilt begin thy reign happily for God finds thee worthy of it and do thou remember the blows that Manahem hath given thee as be ing a signal of the change of thy fortune And truly this will be the best reasoning for thee that thou love justice towards men and piety towards God and clemency to wards thy citizens Yet do 1 know how thy whole conduct will be that thou wilt not be such an one For thou wilt excel all men in happiness and obtain an everlasting reputa tion but wilt forget piety and righteousness And those crimes will not be concealed from God at the conclusion of thy life when thou wilt find that he will be mindful of them and punish thee for them At that time Herod did not attend to what Manahem said as having no hopes of such advancement But a little afterward when he was so fortunate as to be advanced to the dignity of king and was in the height of his dominion he sent for Manahem and asked him how long he should reign  But Manahem did not tell him the full length of his reign Wherefore upon that silence of his he asked him farther whether he should reign ten years or not he replied Yes twenty nay thirty years but did not assign the just limit of his reign Herod was satisfied with these replies and gave Mana hem his hand and dismissed him and from that time he continued to honour all the Es senes We have thought it proper to relate  Of this temple of Herod see my description of the Jewish temples in the scheme relating to this work chap 15 Only we may here farther observe that the fancy of the modern Jews in calling this which was really the third of their temples the second temple fol lowed so long by later Christians seems to be without any solid foundation The reason why the Christians here follow the Jews is because of the prophecy of Haggai ii 6â 9 which they expound of the Messiah s coming to these facts to our readers how strange soever they be and to declare what hath happened among us because many of these Essenes have by their excellent virtue been thought worthy of this knowledge of divine revelation CHAP XI OF THE REBUILDING AND BEAUTIFYING OF THE TEMPLE AND OF THE TOWER OF ANTONIA IN the eighteenth year of his reign and after the acts already mentioned Herod undertook to rebuild of himself the temple of God and make it larger in compass and to raise it to a most magnificent altitude as esteeming it to be the most glorious of all his actions as it really was to bring it to perfec tion and that this would be sufficient for an everlasting memorial of him But as he knew the multitude were not ready nor willing to assist in so vast a design he thought it ad visable to prepare them first by making a speech to them and then to set about the work itself So he called them together and spake thus I think I need not remind you my coun trymen of such other works as I have done since I came to the kingdom although I may say they have been performed in such a man ner as to bring more security to you than glory for myself For I have neither been negligent in the most difficult times about what tended to ease your necessities nor have the buildings I have made been so pro per to preserve me as yourselves from inju ries And I imagine that with God s assist ance I have advanced the nation of the Jews to a degree of happiness which they never had before And for the particular edifices belonging to your own country and your own cities as also to those cities that we have lately acquired which we have erected and greatly adorned and thereby augmented the dignity of your nation it seems to me a needless task to enumerate them since you the second or Zorobabel s temple of which they suppose this of Herod s to be only a continuation which is meant I think of his coming to the fourth and last temple or to that future largest and most glorious one described by Eze kiel Whence I take the former notion how general soever to be a great mistake See the Testament of Benjamin Â in the Authent Rec page 406 and Lit Ac compl of Proph page 24 25 i AN 20 569 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS well know them yourselves But as to that undertaking which I have a mind to set about at present and which will be a work of the greatest piety and excellence that can possi bly be undertaken by us I will now declare to you Our fathers indeed when they re turned from Babylon built this temple to God Almighty Yet does it want sixty cubits of its largeness in altitude for so much did that first temple which Solomon built exceed this temple Nor let any one condemn our fa thers for their negligence or want of piety herein For it was not their fault that the temple was no higher For they were Cyrus and Darius the son of Hystaspes who de termined the measures for its rebuilding And it hath been by reason of the subjection of those fathers of ours to them and to their posterity and after them to the Macedonians that they had not the opportunity to follow the original model of this sacred edifice nor could raise it to its ancient altitude But since I am now by God s will your governor and I have had peace a long time and have gained great riches and large revenues and what is the principal thing of all I am in amity with and well regarded by the Ro mans who if I may so say are the rulers of the whole world I will do my endeavour to correct that imperfection which hath arisen from the necessity of our affairs and the slavery we have been under formerly and to make a thankful return after the most pious manner to God for what blessings I have received from him by giving me this kingdom and that by rendering his temple as complete as 1 am able This speech however affrighted many of the people as being unexpected and be cause it seemed incredible it put a damp upon them for they were afraid that he would pull down the whole edifice and not be able to bring his intentions to perfection for its rebuilding And this danger appeared to them to be very great and the vastness of the undertaking to be such as could hardly be accomplished But while they were in this disposition the king told them he would not pull down their temple till all things were prepared for the building it up again And as he promised them this beforehand so he did not break his word but got ready a thousand wagons that were to bring stones for the building and chose out ten thousand of the most skilful workmen and brought a thousand sacerdotal garments for as many of the priests and had some of them taught the art of stone cutters and others of car penters and then began to build but not till every thing was well prepared for the work So Herod took away the old foundations and laid others and erected the temple upon them being in length a hundred cubits and in height twenty additional cubits which twenty upon the sinking of their founda tions fell down And this part it was that we resolved to raise again in the days of Nero Now the temple was built of stones that were white and strong their length was twenty five cubits their height was eight and their breadth about twelve And the whole structure as was also the structure of the royal cloister was on each side lower but the middle was much higher till they were visible to those that dwell in the coun try for a great many furlongs but chiefly to such as lived over against them and those that approached to them The temple had doors also at the entrance and lintels over them of the same height with the temple itself They were adorned with their em broidered veils with their flowers of purple and pillars interwoven And over these but under the crown work was spread out a golden vine with its branches hanging down from a considerable height the largeness and fine workmanship of which was a sur prising sight to the spectators to see what  Some of our modern students in architecture have made a strange blunder here when they imagine that Josephus affirms the entire foundations of the temple or holy house sunk down into the rocky mountain on which it stood no less than 20 cubits See Lamy de Templo page 1083 Whereas it is clear that they were the foundations of the additional 20 cubits only above the hundred made perhaps weak on purpose and only for shew and grandeur that sunk or fell down as Dr Hudson rightly understands him Nor is the thing itself possible in the other sense Agrippa s preparation for building the inner parts of the temple 20 cubits higher history Of the War V 1 must in all probability refer to this matter since Josephus says here that this which had fallen down was designed to be raised up again under Nero under whom Agrippa made that preparation But what Josephus says presently that Solomon was the first king of the Jews appears by the parallel place XX 9 and other places to be meant only the first of David s posterity and the first builder of the temple T70 book iv ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Hkk it Â BlW j vast materials were there and with what great skill the workmanship was executed He also encompassed the entire temple with very large cloisters contriving them to be in a due proportion thereto and he expended larger sums of money upon them than had been done before him till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned the temple as he had done There was a large wall to both the cloisters which wall was itself the most prodigious work that was ever heard of by man The hill was a rocky ascent that declined by degrees towards the east parts of the city till it came to an elevated level This hill it was which Solomon who was the first of our kings by divine revelation en compassed with a wall it was of excellent workmanship upwards and round the top of it He also built a wall below beginning at the bottom which was encompassed by a deep valley And at the south side he laid rocks together and bound them to each other with lead and included some of the inner parts till it proceeded to a great height and till both the largeness of the square edifice and its altitude were immense and till the vastness of the stones in the front were plainly visible on the outside yet so that the in ward parts were fastened together with iron and preserved the joints immovable for all future times When this work for the foun dation was done in this manner and joined together as part of the hill itself to the very top of it he wrought it all into one outward surface and filled up the hollow places which were about the wall and made it a level on the external surface and a smooth level also This hill was walled all round and in com pass four furlongs the distance of each angle containing in length a furlong But within this wall and on the top of all there ran another wall of stone also having on the east quarter a double cloister of the same length with the wall in the midst of which was the temple itself This cloister looked to the gates of the temple and it had been adorned by many kings in former times And round about the entire temple were fixed the spoils taken from barbarous nations All these had been dedicated to the temple  See Book XVIII chap 4 by Herod with the addition of those he had taken from the Arabians Now on the north side of the temple was built a citadel whose walls were square and strong and of extraordinary firmness This citadel was built by the kings of the Asmo nean race who were also high priests before Herod and they called it the tower in which were deposited the vestments of the high priest which the high priest only put on at the time when he was to offer sacrifice These vestments king Herod kept in that place and after his death they were under the power of the Romans until the time of Tiberius Caesar Under whose reign Vitel lius the president of Syria when he once came to Jerusalem and had been most mag nificently received by the multitude he had a mind to make them some requital for the kindness they had shewn him So upon their petition to have those holy vestments in their own power he wrote about them to Tiberius Caesar who granted his request And this their power over the sacerdotal vestments continued with the Jews until the death of king Agrippa But after that Cassius Lon ginus who was president of Syria and Cus pius Fadus who was procurator of Judea enjoined the Jews to deposit those vestments in the tower of Antonia for that they ought to have them in their power as they formerly had However the Jews sent ambassadors to Claudius Caesar to intercede with him for them Upon whose coming king Agrippa junior being then at Rome asked for and ob tained the power over them from the empe ror who gave the command to Vitellius then commander in Syria to give it them ac cordingly Before that time they were kept under the seal of the high priest and of the treasurers of the temple which treasurers the day before a festival went up to the Ro man captain of the temple guards and viewed their own seal and received the vestments And again when the festival was over they brought it to the same place and shewed the captain of the temple guards their seal which corresponded with his own and deposited them there And that these things were so the afflictions that happened to us afterwards about them are sufficient evidence But for the tower itself when Herod the king of the Jews had fortified it more firmly than before AN 20 571 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS in order to secure and guard the temple he gratified Antonius who was his friend and the Roman ruler and he then gave it the name of the tower of Antonia Now in the western quarters of the inclo sure of the temple there were four gates The first led to the king s palace and went to a passage over the intermediate valley two more led to the suburbs of the city and the last led to the other city where the road descended down into the valley by a great number of steps and thence up again by the ascent For the city lay over against the temple in the manner of a theatre and was encompassed with a deep valley along the entire south quarter But the fourth front of the temple which was southward had indeed itself gates in its middle as also it had the royal cloisters with three walks which reached in length from the east valley unto that on the west for it was impossible it should reach any farther And this cloister deserves to be mentioned better than any other under the sun For while the valley was very deep and its bottom could not be seen if you looked from above into the depth this farther vastly high elevation of the cloister stood upon that height insomuch that if any one looked down from the top of the battlements or down both those altitudes he would be giddy while his sight could not reach to such an immense depth This cloister had pillars that stood in four rows one over against the other all along for the fourth row was interwoven into the wall which also was built of stone And the thickness of each pillar was such that three men might with their arms extended fathom it round and join their hands again while its length was twenty seven feet with a double spiral at its basis And the number of all the pillars in that court was a hundred and sixty two Their chapiters were adorned with sculptures after the Corinthian order and caused an amazement to the spectators by reason of the grandeur of the whole These four rows of pillars included three intervals for walking in the middle of this cloister Two of which walks were made parallel to each other and were contrived after the same manner the breadth of each of them was thirty feet the length was a tfurlong and the height fifty feet  But the breadth of the middle part of the cloister was one and a half of the breadth of the other and the height was double for it was much higher than those on each side But the roofs were adorned with deep sculptures in wood representing many sorts of figures The middle was much higher than the rest and the wall of the front was adorned with beams resting upon pillars that were inter woven into it and that front was all of po lished stone insomuch that its fineness to such as had not seen it was incredible and such as had seen it was greatly amazing Thus was the first inclosure In the midst of which and not far from it was the second to be gone up to by a few steps This was encompassed by a stone wall for a partition with an inscription which forbade any fo reigner to go in under pain of death Now this inner inclosure had on its southern and northern quarters three gates equidistant from each other But on the east quarter towards the sun rising there was one large gate through which such as were pure came in together with their wives But the temple farther inward in that gate was not allowed to the women But still more inward was there a third court of the temple whereinto it was not lawful for any but the priests alone to enter The temple itself was within this and before that temple was the altar upon which we offer our sacrifices and burnt offer ings to God IntoJ none of these three did Herod enter for he was forbidden because he was not a priest However he took care of the cloisters and the outer inclosures and these he built in eight years But the temple itself was built by the priests in a year and six months Upon which all the people were full of joy and presently they returned thanks in the first place to God  The number of these gates is wanting t Four hundred cubits each cubit about twenty one inches  Into none of these three did king Herod enter i e 1 Not into the court of the priests 2 Nor into the holy house itself 3 Nor into the separate place belonging to voL I â NOS 47  48 the altar as the words following imply For none but the priests or their attendants the Levites might come into any of them See XVI 4 Where Herod goes into the temple and makes a speech in it to the people But that could only be into the court of Israel whither the people could come to hear him 4T 572 book XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS and in the next place for the alacrity the king had shewed They feasted and celebrated this rebuilding of the temple And the king sacrificed three hundred oxen to God as did the rest every one according to his ability The number of which sacrifices it is not pos sible to set down for it cannot be that we should truly relate it For at the same time with this celebration for the work about the temple fell also the day of the king s inaugu ration which he kept of an old custom as a festival and it now coincided with the other Which coincidence of them both made the festival most illustrious There was also an occult passage built for  This tradition which Josephus here mentions as de livered down from their fathers to their children of this particular remarkable circumstance relating to the build ing of Herod s temple is a demonstration that such its building was a known thing in Judea in his time He was the king which led from Antonia to the in ner temple at its eastern gate Over this he also erected for himself a tower that he might have an opportunity of a subterraneous ascent to the temple in order to guard ugaintt any sedition which might be made by the people against their kings It is also Re ported that during the time the temple was building it did not rain in the day time but that the showers fell only in the night so that the work was not hindered And this our fathers have delivered to us Nor is it incredi ble if any one have regard to the other mani festations of God And thus was performed the work of the rebuilding of the temple born but 46 years after it is related to have been finished and might himself have seen and spoken with some of the builders themselves and with a great number of those that had seen it building END OF THE FIRST voLUME â V i Date Loaned Ivyoft AiÂ i â Â Iff jyv cr 6fin   pJW JUL 4 1075
