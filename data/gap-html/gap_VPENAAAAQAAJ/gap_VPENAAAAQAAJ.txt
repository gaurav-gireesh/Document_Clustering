design of writing the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire both in the west and the east The whole period ex tends from the age of Trajan and the Antonines to the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II and includes a review of the crusades and the state of Rome during the middle ages Since the publication of the first volume twelve years have elapsed twelve years according to my wish of health of leisure and of perseverance I may now congratulate my deliverance from a long and laborious service and my satis faction will be pure and perfect if the public favour should be extended to the conclusion of my work It was my first intention to have collected under one view the numerous authors of every age and language from whom I have derived the materials of this history and I am still convinced that the apparent ostentation would be more than compensated by real use If I have renounced this idea if I have declined an undertaking which had obtained the ap probation of a master artist f my excuse may be found in the extreme difficulty of assigning a proper measure to such a catalogue A naked list of names and editions would not be satisfactory either to myself or my readers  the characters of the principal authors of the Roman and Byzantine History have been occasionally connected with the events which they describe a more copious and critical inquiry might indeed deserve but it would demand an elaborate volume which might swell by degrees into a general library of historical writers For the present I shall content myself with renew ing my serious protestation that I have always endeavoured to draw from the fountain head that my curiosity as well as a sense of duty has always urged me to study the origi nals and that if they have sometimes eluded my search I  Alluding to the tfaarto edition in which size the work was originally published t See Dr Robertson s Preface to his History of America VOL v b IT PREFACE Â have carefully marked the secondary evidence on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend I shall soon revisit the banks of the lake of Lausanne a country which I have known and loved from my early youth Under a mild government amidst a beauteous landscape in a life of leisure and independence and among a people of easy and elegant manners I have enjoyed and may again hope to enjoy the varied pleasures or retirement and society But I shall ever glory in the name and character of an Eng lishman I am proud of my birth in a free and enlightened country and the approbation of that country is the best and most honourable reward of my labours Were I ambitious of any other patron than the public I would inscribe this work to a Statesman who in a long a stormy and at length an unfortunate administration had many political opponents almost without a personal enemy who has retained in his fall from power many faithful and disinterested friends and who under the pressure of severe infirmity enjoys the lively vigour of his mind and the felicity of his incomparable tem per Lord North will permit me to express the feelings of friendship in the language of truth but even truth and friendship should be silent if he still dispensed the favours of the crown   In a remote solitude vanity may still whisper in my ear that my readers perhaps may inquire whether in the con clusion of the present work I am now taking an everlasting farewell They shall hear all that I know myself all that I could reveal to the most intimate friend The motives of action or silence are now equally balanced nor can 1 pro nounce in my most secret thoughts on which side the scale will preponderate I cannot dissemble that six ample quartos must have tried and may have exhausted the indulgence of the Public that in the repetition of similar attempts a suc cessful author has much more to lose than he cart hope to gain that I am now descending into the vale of years and that the most respectable of my countrymen the men whom I aspire to imitate have resigned the pen of history about the same period of their lives Yet I consider that the an nals of ancient and modern times may afford many rich and interesting subjects that I am still possessed of health and leisure that by the practice of writing some skill and faci lity must be acquired and that in the ardent pursuit of PREFACE V truth and knowledge I am not conscious of decay To an active mind indolence is more painful than labour j and the first months of my liberty will be occupied and amused in the excursions of curiosity and taste By such temptations I have been sometimes seduced from the rigid duty even of a pleasing and voluntary task but my time will now be my own and in the use or abuse of independence I shall no longer fear my own reproaches or those of my friends I am fairly entitled to a year of jubilee next summer and the fol lowing winter will rapidly pass away and experience only can determine whether I shall stiH prefer the freedom and variety of study to the design and composition of a regular work which animates while it confines the daily applica tion of the author Caprice and accident may influence my choice but the dexterity of self love will contrive to applaud either active industry or philosophic repose Downing Sthbit May 1 1788 P S I shall embrace this opportunity of introducing two verbal remarks which have not conveniently offered them selves to my notice 1 As often as I use the definitions of beydnd the Alps the Rhine the Danube 8cc I generally sup pose myself at Rome and afterward at Constantinople without observing whether this relative geography may agree with the local but variable situation of the reader or the historian 2 In proper names of foreign and especially of oriental origin it should be always our aim to express in our English version a faithful copy of the original But this rule which is founded on a just regard to uniformity and truth must often be relaxed and the exceptions will be li y mited or enlarged by the custom of the language and the taste of the interpreter Our alphabets may be often defec tive a harsh sound an uncouth spelling might offend the ear or the eye of our countrymen and some words notori ously corrupt are fixed and as it were naturalized in the vulgar tongue The prophet Mohammed can no longer be stripped of the famous

restored to the throne of Tamerlane our most correct writers have re trenched the Al the superfluous article from the Koran and we escape an ambiguous termination by adopting Mos lem instead of Mussulman in the plural number In these and in a thousand examples the shades of distinction are often minute and I can feel where I cannot explain the motives of my choice â â ž At the end of the

moment that the favourite concubine of Theodemir was delivered of a son and heir In the eighth year of his age Theodoric was reluctantly yielded by his father to the public interest as the pledge of an alliance which Leo emperor of the east had consented to purchase by an annual subsidy of three hundred pounds of gold The royal hostage was educated at Constantinople with care and tenderness His body was formed to all the exer cises of war his mind was expanded by the habits of li beral conversation he frequented the schools of the most skilful masters but he disdained or neglected the arts of Greece and so ignorant did he always remain of the first elements of science that a rude mark was con trived to represent the signature of the illiterate king of Italy 0 As soon as he attained the age of eighteen he was restored to the wishes of the Ostrogoths whom the emperor â aspired to gain by liberality and confidence Walamir had fallen in battle the youngest of the bro thers Widimir had

desert their Pannonian encampments and boldly to advance into the warm and wealthy neighbourhood of the Byzantine court which already maintained in pride and luxury so many bands of confederate Goths

agitated by fe male passions and Verina the widow of Leo claiming his empire as her own pronounced a sentence of deposi tion against the worthless and ungrateful servant on whom she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the east As soon as she sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno he fled with precipitation into the mountains of Isauria and her brother Basiliscus already infamous by his Afri can

recalled from exile the armies the capital the person of Basiliscus were betrayed and his whole family was condemned to the long agony of cold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror who wanted courage to

the most fertile estates became barren in their hands they despised but they envied the la borious provincials and when their subsistence had failed the Ostrogoths embraced the familiar resources of war and rapine It had been the wish of Theodoric such at least was his dejaration to lead a peaceable obscure obedient life on the confines of Scythia till the Byzan tine court by splendid and fallacious promises seduced him to attack a confederate tribe of Goths who had been engaged in the party of Basilisqus He marched from his station in Maesia on the solemn assurance that be fore he reached Adrianople he should meet a plentiful convoy of provisions and a reinforcement of eight thou sand horse and thirty thousand foot while the legions of Asia were encamped at Heraclea to second

alternative of encountering the Goths as the champion or of leading them to the field as the enemy Â f Zeno Embracing an enterprise wor thy of his courage and ambition Theodoric addressed the emperor

of the wealth and beauty of Italy was impatient to seek through the most perilous adventures the possession of such enchant ing objects The march of Theodoric must be consi dered as the emigration of an entire people the wives and children of the Goths their aged parents and most precious effects were carefully transported and some idea may be formed of the heavy baggage that now fol lowed the camp by the loss of two thousand waggons which had been sustained in a single action in the war of Epirus For their subsistence the Goths depended on the magazines of corn which was ground in portable mills by the hands of their women on the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds on the casual produce of the chase and upon the contributions which they might im pose on all who should presume to dispute the passage or to refuse their friendly assistance Notwithstanding these precautions they were exposed to the danger and almost to the distress of famine in a march of seven hundred miles which had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter Since the fall of the Roman power Dacia and Pannonia no longer exhibited the rich pros pect of populous cities well cultivated fields and conve nient highways the reign of barbarism and desolation was restored and the tribes of Bulgarians Gepidas and Sarmatians who had occupied the vacant province were prompted by their native fierceness or the solicitations of Odoacer to resist the progress of his enemy In many obscure though bloody battles Theodoric fought and vanquished till at length surmounting every ob stacle by

Verona In the neighbour hood of that city on the steep banks of the rapid Adige he was opposed by a new army reinforced in its num bers and not impaired in its courage the contest was more obstinate but the event was still more decisive Odoacer fled to Ravenna Theodoric advanced to Milan and the vanquished troops saluted their conqueror with loud acclamations of respect and fidelity But their want either of constancy or of faith soon exposed him to the most imminent danger his vanguard with se veral Gothic counts which had been rashly intrusted to a deserter was betrayed and destroyed near Faenza by his double treachery Odoacer again appeared master of the field and the invader strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia was reduced to solicit the aid of a kindred nation the Visigoths of

more general concern and the cities might justly complain that he usurped the municipal revenues which had been appropriated to these useful institutions Even the soldiers were injured and such was

granted a similar indulgence and many of his subjects have renounced the possession of those lands whose value is insufficient to satisfy the demands of the treasury To the cities which had suffered by hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven years the provinces of Justinian have been ra vaged by the Persians and Arabs the Huns and Sclavo nians but his vain and ridiculous dispensation of a single year has been confined to those places which were actu ally taken by the enemy Such is the language of the secret historian who expressly denies that any indul gence was

desolate province by the intercession of St Sabas q III Pro copius has not condescended to explain the system of taxation which fell like a hail storm upon the land like a devouring pestilence on its

expense and labour of distant carriage In a time of scarcity an extraordinary requisition was made to the ad jacent provinces of Thrace Bithynia and Phrygia but the proprietors after a wearisome journey and a perilous navigation received so inadequate a compensation that they would have chosen the alternative of delivering both the corn and price at the doors of their granaries These precautions might indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the capital yet Constantinople did not escape the rapacious despotism of Justinian Till his reign the straits of the Bosphorus and Hellespont were open to the freedom of trade and nothing was prohibited except the exportation of arms for the service of the barbarians At each of these gates of the city a praetor was stationed the minister of imperial avarice heavy customs were imposed on the vessels and their merchan dise the oppression was retaliated on the helpless con sumer the poor were afflicted by the artificial scarcity and exorbitant price of the market and a people accustomed to depend on the liberality of their prince might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water and bread The aerial tribute without a name a law or a definite object was an annual gift of 120 000 which the emperor accepted from his praetorian pre fect and the means of payment were abandoned to the discretion of that powerful magistrate IV

lives and fortunes of their fellow citizens And a more direct sale of honours and offices was transacted in the palace with the permission or at least with the con nivance of Justiniah and Theodora The claims of merit even those of favour were disregarded and it was almost reasonable to expect that the bold adventurer who had undertaken the trade of a magistrate should find a rich compensation for infamy labour danger the debts which he had contracted and the heavy interest which he paid A sense of the disgrace and mischief of this venal practice at length awakened the slumbering virtue of Justinian and he attempted by the sanction of oaths and penalties to guard the integrity of his go vernment but at the end of a year of perjury his rigo rous edict was suspended and corruption licentiously For an aureus one sixth of an ounce of gold instead of two hundred and ten he gave no more than one hundred and eighty folios or ounces of copper A dispropor tion of the mint below the

Beli sarius unless he had been a hero must have shewn him self a rebel his wife Antonina who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia the daughter of the prefect the credulous virgin imparted to her father the dan gerous project and John who might have known the value of oaths and promises was tempted to accept a nocturnal and almost treasonable interview with the wife of Belisarius An ambuscade of guards and eu nuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora they rushed with drawn swords to seize or punish the guilty minister he was saved by the fidelity of his at tendants but instead of appealing to a gracious sove reign who had privately warned him of his danger he pusillanimously fled to the sanctuary of the church The favourite of Justinian was sacrificed to conjugal tenderness or domestic tranquillity the conversion of a prefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes but the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace and he retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus an ample portion of hi riches Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy the unrelenting hatred of Theodora the murder of his old enemy the bishop of Cyzicus afforded a decent pretence and John of Cappadocia whose 62 DECLINE AND FALL CHAP XL actions had deserved a thousand deaths was at last con demned for a crime of which he was innocent A great minister who had been invested with the honours of consul and patrician was ignominiously scourged like the vilest of malefactors a tattered cloak was the sole remnant of his fortunes he was transported in a bark to the place of his banishment at Antinopolis in Upper Egypt and the prefect of the east begged his bread through the cities which had trembled at his name  During an exile of seven years his life was protracted and threatened by the ingenious cruelty of Theodora and when her death permitted the emperor to recal a servant whom he had abandoned with regret the am bition of John of Cappadocia was reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession His successors con vinced the subjects of Justinian that the arts of op pression might still be improved by experience

reached Tricameron about twenty miles from Carthage CHAP XLI OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE they might boast perhaps with some exaggeration that they surpassed in a tenfold proportion the diminutive powers of

shed the blood of thousands in his private quarrel the successor of Augustus should vindi cate his rights and recover by arms the ancient provinces of his empire This reasoning might not convince but it was sufficient to alarm and subdue the weakness of Theodatus and he soon descended to his last offer that for the poor equivalent of a pension of 48 00O sterling he would resign the kingdom of the Goths and Italians and spend the remainder of his days in the in nocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture Both treaties were intrusted to the hands of the ambassador on the frail security of an

and defenceless than a hostile commission was sent to the east to seize his treasures and criminate his actions the guards and ve terans who followed his private banner were distributed among the

others the most splendid and important After the death of Caesar a long haired star was conspicuous to Rome and to the nations during the games which were exhibited by young Octavian in honour of Venus and his uncle The vul gar opinion that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the dictator was cherished and consecrated by the piety of a statesman while his secret superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own times k Thejifth visit has already been ascribed to the fifth year of Justinian which coincides with the five hundred and thirty first of the Christian era And it may deserve notice that in this as in the preceding instance the comet was followed though at a longer interval by a remarkable paleness of the sun The sixth return in the year 1100 is record ed by the

Procopius that the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or providence He forgot or perhaps he secretly recollected that the plague had touched the person of Justinian

physicians in the care of the sick whom inhuman prudence would have condemned to solitude and despair But the fatal security like the predestination of the Turks must have aided the progress of the contagion and those salutary precautions to which Europe is indebted for her safety were unknown to the government of Justinian No restraints were im posed on the free and frequent intercourse of the

political skill of an elective king a council of nobles and a general assembly of the people War and religion were administered by the supreme magistrate and he alone proposed the laws which were

legislators and each of them claims his peculiar part in the threefold division of Jurispru dence 8 The laws of marriage the education of children and the authority of parents which may seem to draw their origin from nature itself are ascribed to the untu tored wisdom of Romulus The law of nations and of religious worship which Numa introduced was derived from his nocturnal converse with the

 They amuse the mind by the remembrance of old words and the portrait of an cient manners they inculcate the soundest principles of government and morals and I am not afraid to affirm that the brief

been the first who assumed without disguise the plenitude of legisla tive power And this innovation so agreeable to his active mind was countenanced by the patience of the times and his long absence from the seat of government The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs and according to the harsh metaphor of Tertullian the gloomy and intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and consti tutions During four centuries from Hadrian to Jus tinian the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the will of the sovereign and few institutions either human or divine were permitted to stand on their for mer basis The origin of imperial legislation was con cealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armed despotism and a double fiction was propagated by the servility or perhaps the ignorance of the civilians who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and Byzantine courts 1 To the prayer of the ancient Cassars the people or the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the obligation and penalty of particular statutes and each indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic over the first of her citizens

superior to the forms too often disdains the es sential principles of justice the pride of despotism was envenomed by plebeian envy and the heroes of Athens might sometimes applaud the happiness of the Persian whose fate depended on the caprice of a single tyrant Some salutary restraints imposed by the people on their own passions were at once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the Romans The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine but the cogni sance of all natural crimes was reserved by a fundamental law to the assembly of the centuries in which the weight of influence and property was sure to preponderate Re peated proclamations and adjournments were interposed to allow time for prejudice and resentment to subside the whole proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen or the opposition of a tribune and such popular trials were commonly less formidable to innocence than they were favourable to guilt But this union of the judi cial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the ac cused party was pardoned or acquitted and in the defence of an illustrious client the orators of Rome and Athens addressed their arguments to the policy and benevolence as well as to the justice of their sovereign 2 The task of convening the citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult as the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied and the ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the people to the ordinary magistrates or to extraordinary inquisitors In the first ages these questions were rare and occasional In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they were made perpetual for praetors were annually em powered to sit in judgment on the state offences of trea son extortion peculation and bribery  and Sylla added new praetors and new questions for those crimes which more directly injure the safety of individuals By these DECLINE AND FALL CHAP XLIV inquisitors the trial was prepared and directed but they could only pronounce the sentence of the majority of judges who with some truth and more prejudice have been compared to the English juries 5 To discharge this important though burdensome office an annual list of ancient and respectable citizens was formed by the prae tor After many constitutional struggles they were chosen in equal numbers from the senate the equestrian order and the people four hundred and fifty were ap pointed for single questions and the various rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans who represented the judicial autho rity of the state In each particular cause a sufficient number was drawn from the urn their integrity was guarded by an oath the mode of ballot secured their independence the suspicion of partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and defendant and the judges of Milo by the retrenchment of fifteen on each side were reduced to fifty one voices or tablets of acquittal of condemnation or of favourable doubt 3 In his civil jurisdiction the praetor of the city was truly a judge and almost a legislator but as soon as he had prescribed the action of law he often referred to a dele gate the determination of the fact With the increase of legal proceedings the tribunal of the centumvirs in which he precided acquired more weight and reputation But whether he acted alone or with the advice of his council the most absolute powers might be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of the people The rules and precautions of freedom have re quired some explanation the order of despotism is simple and inanimate Before the age of Justinian or perhaps of The office both at Rome and in England must be considered as an occasional duty and not a magistracy or profession But the obligation of a unanimous verdict is peculiar to our laws which condemn the jurymen to undergo the torture from whence they have exempted the criminal We are indebted for this interesting fact to a fragment of Asconins Pedianns who flourished under the reign of Tiberius The loss of his

Stoics the examples of the bravest Romans and the legal encouragements of suicide The bodies of condemned criminals were ex posed to public ignominy and their children a more serious evil were reduced to poverty by the confiscation of their fortunes But if the victims of Tiberius and Nero anticipated the decree of the prince or senate their courage and dispatch were recompensed by the applause of the public the decent honours of burial and the vali dity of their testaments The exquisite avarice and cruelty of Domitian appear to have deprived the unfor tunate of this last consolation and it was

on the banks of the Tiber In a period of thirteen hundred years the laws had reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners and the laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent institutions destroyed the harmony and swelled the magnitude of the obscure and irregular system The laws which excuse on any occa sions the ignorance of their subjects confess their own imperfections the civil jurisprudence as it was abridged by Justinian still continued a mysterious science and a profitable trade and the innate perplexity of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by the private industry of the practitioners The expense of the pursuit some times exceeded the value of the prize and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty or prudence of the claimants Such costly justice might tend to abate the spirit of litigation but the unequal pressure serves only to increase the influence of the rich and to aggravate the misery of the poor By these

in his palace pious in the church impartial on the seat of judgment and victo rious at least by his generals in the Persian war The most glorious trophy of his victory consisted in a multi tude of captives whom Tiberius entertained redeemed and dismissed to their native homes with the charitable spirit of a Christian hero The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a dearer claim to his beneficence and he measured his bounty not so much by their expec tations as by his own dignity This maxim however dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth was balanced by a principle of humanity and justice which taught him to abhor as of the basest alloy the gold that was extract ed from the tears of the people For their relief as often as they had suffered by natural or hostile calami ties he was impatient to remit the arrears of the past or the demands of future taxes he sternly rejected the servile offerings of his ministers which were compensa ted by tenfold oppression and the wise

report of the charms of his spouse Theudelinda was summoned to undergo this important examination and after a pause of silent rapture he hailed her as the queen of Italy and humbly requested that according to the custom of the nation she would present a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects By the command of her father she Obey ed Autharis received the cup in his turn and in restor ing

cross was restored to the importunate demands of the successor of Constantine The victor was not ambitious of enlarging the weakness of the empire the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret the conquests of his father the Persians who eva cuated the cities of Syria and Egypt were honourably con ducted to the frontier and a war which had wounded the Vitals of the two monarchies produced no change in their external and relative situation The return of Heraclius from Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph and after the exploits of six glorious campaigns he peace ably enjoyed the sabbath of his toils After a long im patience the senate the clergy and the people went forth to meet their hero with tears and acclamations with olive branches and innumerable lamps he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by four elephants and as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from the tumult of pub lic joy he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the em braces of his mother and his son 3 The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different kind the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre Heraclius performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem the identity of the relic was ve rified by the discreet patriarch and this august ceremony has been commemorated by the annual festival of the exaltation of the cross Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated ground he was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple the pomp and va nity of the world but in the judgment of his clergy the persecution of the Jews was more easily

Alexander and Hercules was eclipsed in the popular estimation by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius Yet the deliverer of the east was indigent and feeble Of the Persian spoils the most valuable portion had been ex pended in the war distributed to the soldiers or buried by an unlucky tempest in the waves of the Euxine The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the ob ligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy which he had borrowed for their own defence a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable creditors the provinces already wasted by the arms and avarice of the Persians were compelled to a second payment of the same taxes and the arrears of a simple citizen the trea surer of Damascus were commuted to a fine of one hun dred thousand pieces of gold The loss of two hundred thousand soldiers who had fallen by the sword was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts agriculture and population in this long and destructive war and although a victorious army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Je rusalem an obscure town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens and they cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief an ordinary and trifling occurrence had
