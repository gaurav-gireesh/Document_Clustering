was alive in their bosom and they were more solicitous to explore the nature than to practise the laws of their founder I have already observed that the disputes of the TRINITY were succeeded by those of the INCAR NATION alike scandalous to the church alike perni cious to the state still more minute in their origin still more durable in their effects It is my design to com prise in the present chapter a religious war of two hundred and fifty years to represent the ecclesiastical and political schism of the oriental sects and to intro duce their clamorous or sanguinary contests by a modest inquiry into the doctrines of the primitive church â By what means shall I authenticate this previous inquiry which I have studied to circumscribe and compress If I persist in supporting each fact or reflection by its proper and special evidence every line would require a string of testimonies and every note would swell to a critical dissertation But the numberless passages of VOL VI B â 2 ROMAN EMPIRE I A laudable regard for the honour of the first man to the proselytes has countenanced the belief the hope Ebionites renes were distinguished only by their obstinate perse verance in the practice of the Mosaic rites Their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these secta ries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of Christ Educated in the school of Jewish prophecy and prejudice they had never been taught to elevate their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah If they had courage to hail their king when he appeared in a ple antiquil y which I

the person of a saint a sage or a heretic Yet his refinement is sometimes excessive he betrays an amiable partiality in favour of the weaker side and while he guards against calumny he does not allow

had studiously disguised his celestial character under the name and person of a mortal 1 The familiar companions of Jesus of Nazareth conversed with their friend and countryman who in all the actions of rational and animal life appeared of the same species with themselves His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regu lar increase in stature and wisdom and after a pain ful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross He lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of Socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the Stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of Jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people who held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the Mosaic law The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases raised the dead divided the sea stopped the sun and ascended to heaven in a fiery chariot And the metaphorical style of the Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of SON OF GOD Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes His Lirth and eieva and the Ebionites a distinction is faintly noticed between theheretics who confounded thegenera tion of Christ in the common order of nature and the less guilty schismatics who revered the virginity of his mother and excluded the aid of an earthly father The incredulity of the former was countenanced by the visi ble circumstances of his birth the legal marriage of his reputed parents Joseph and Mary and his lineal claim to the kingdom of David and the inheritance of Judah But the secret and authentic history has been recorded in several copies of

conscious of his own chastity were dispelled by the assurance in a dream that his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost and as this distant and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of the historian he must have listened to the same voice which dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin The son of a virgin ge nerated by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit was a creature without example or resemblance supe rior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of Adam Since the introduction of the Greek or Chal dean philosophy the Jews8 were persuaded of the pre existence transmigration and immortality of souls and Providence was justified by a supposition that they were confined in their earthly prisons to expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former state 11 But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost immeasur d The two first chapters of St Matthew did not exist in the Ebionite copies F liiphan Haeres 3O 13 and

faith which had slowly God toUie arisen in the rocky and ungrateful soil of Judea were transplanted in full maturity to the hap pier climes of the Gentiles and the strangers of Rome or Asia who never beheld the manhood were the more readily disposed to embrace the divinity of Christ The Polytheistand the philosopher the Greek and the bar barian were alike accustomed to conceive a long suc cession an infinite chain of angels or demons or deities or aeons or emanations issuing from the throne of light Nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these aeons the Logos or Word of God of the same substance with the Father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality But the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravi ty of matter infected the primitive churches of the east Many among the Gentile proselytes refused to believe â On8 TOU Tttmfff uya n nu Aa ift uvâ was one of ihe

EMPIRE that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of im pure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of Christ While his blood was still recent on mount Calvary 1 the Docetes a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics invent ed thefantastic system which was afterward propagated by the Marcionites the Manichaeans and the various names of the Gnostic heresy 1 They denied the truth and authenticity of the gospels as far as they relate the con ception of Mary the birth of Christ and the thirty years that preceded the exercise of his ministry He first ap peared on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and ene mies Articulate sounds vibrated on the ears of the disciples but the image which was impressed on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch and they enjoyed the spiritual not the corporeal presence of the Son of God The rage of the Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom and the mys tic scenes of the passion and death the resurrection and ascension of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for the benefit of mankind If it were urged that such ideal mimicry such incessant deception was unworthy of the God of truth the Docetes agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of pious falsehood In the system of the Gnostics the Jehovah of Israel the creator of this lower world was k Apostol is adhuc in seculo superstitibus apud Judsam Christi sanguine recente PHANTAsMA

fourscore in the time of Epiphanius Phot Biblioth Cod 120â 122 The five books of Irenieus exist only in barbarous Latin but the original might perhaps be found in some monastery of Greece CHAP XLVII 7 a rebellious or at least an ignorant spirit The Son of God descended upon earth to abolish his temple and his law and for the accomplishment of this salutary end he dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a temporal Messiah His incor ne of tue most subtle disputants of the Ma mptibie nichaean school has pressed the danger and in decency of supposing that the God of the Chris tians in the state of a human foetus emerged at the end of nine months from a female womb The pious hor ror of his antagonists provoked them to disclaim all sen sual circumstances of conception and delivery to main tain that the divinity passed through Mary like a sun beam through a plate of glass and to assert that the seal of her virginity remained unbroken even at the mo ment when she became the mother of Christ But the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the Docetes who taught not that Christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body Such indeed in the more orthodox system he has acquired since his re surrection and such he must have always possessed if it were capable of pervading without resistance orinjury the density of intermediate matter Devoid of its most essential properties it might be exempt from the attri butes and infirmities of the flesh A foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter Jesus might share the repasts of his disciples without being subject to the calls of thirst or hunger and his virgin purity was never sullied by the involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence Of a body thus singularly constituted a question would arise by what means and of what ma terials it was originally framed and our sounder theo logy is started by an answer which was not peculiar to 8 ROMAN EMPIRE the Gnostics that both the form and the substance pro ceeded from the divine essence The idea of pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy the incorporeal essence ascribed by the ancients to human souls celestial beings and even the Deity himself does not exclude the notion of extended space and their imagination was satisfied with a subtle nature of air or fire or ether incomparably more perfect than the gross ness of the material world If we define the place we must describe the figure of the Deity Our experience perhaps our vanity represents the powers of reason and virtue under a human form The Anthropomorphites who swarmed among the monks of Egypt and the Ca tholics of Africa could produce the

was adopted with many fanciful improvements by Carpocrates Basilides and Valentine 1 the heretics of the Egyptian school In their eyes JESUS of Nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity When he was baptized in the Jordan the

was delivered into the hands of the Jews the Christ an immortal and impassible being for sook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits and left the solitary Jesus to suffer to complain and to expire But the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of Cerinthus It was alleged that when Jesus was nailed to the cross he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind and body which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings It was affirmed that these momentary though real pangs would be abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for the Messiah in his kingdom of the New Jerusalem It was insinuated that if he suffered he deserved to suf v The Valentinians embraced a complex and almost incoherent systern â 1 Both Christ and Jesus were aeons though of different degrees the one acting as the rational soul the other as the divine spirit of the Saviour 2 At the time of the passion they both retired and left only a sensitive soul and a human body 3 Even that body was etherial and perhaps apparent â Such are the laborious conclusions of Mosheirn But I much doubt whether the Latin translator under stood Iren us and whether Irenaeus and the Valentinians understood themselves 10 ROMAN EMPIRE fer that human nature is never absolutely

even with the highest degree of mental faculties and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel the most perfect of created spirits does not involve any positive contra diction or absurdity In the age of religious freedom which was determined by the council of Nice the dig nity of Christ was measured by private judgment ac cording to the indefinite rule of Scripture or reason or tradition But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on the ruins of Arianism the faith of the Catholics trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to recede dangerous to stand dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime character of their theology They hesitated to pronounce that God himself the second person of an equal and con substantial trinity was manifested in the flesh r that a being who pervades the universe had been confined in the womb of Mary that his eternal duration had been marked by the days and months and years of human i The heretics abused the passionate exclamation of  My God my God why hast Hum forsaken me Rousseau who has drawn an eloquent but indecent pa rallel between Christ and Socrates forgets that not a word of impatience or de spair escaped from the mouth of the dying philosopher In the Messiah such sentiments could be only apparent and such Ul sounding words are properly ex plained as

God at Constantinople in the beginning of the sixth century the true reading which is visible in the Latin and Syriac versions still exists in the reasoning of the Greek as well as of the Latin

had been scourged and crucified that his impassible essence had felt pain and anguish that his omniscience was not exempt from ignorance and that the source of life and immorality expired on mount Calvary These alarming conse quences were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris bishop of Laodicea and one of the lumi naries of the church The son of a learned gramma rian he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece elo quence erudition and philosophy conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris were humbly devoted to the service of religion The worthy friend of Athanasius the worthy antagonist of Julian he bravely wrestled with the Arians and Polytheists and though he affected the rigour of geometrical demonstration his commen taries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the Scriptures A mystery which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form and he first proclaimed the memorable words â One incarnate nature of Christ which are still re echoed with hostile clamours in the churches of Asia Egypt and Ethiopia He taught that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man and that the Logos the eternal Wisdom supplied in the flesh the place and office of a human soul Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness Apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation He acqui esced in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the Logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life With the moderate Docetes he â For Apollinaris and his sect see Socrates lib 2 c 46 lib 3 c 16 Sozomen lib 5 c 18 lib 6 c

the carnal mother of Christ whose body either came from heaven impassible and incorruptible or was absorbed and as it were transformed into the essence of the Deity The system of Apollinaris was strenuously encountered by the Asiatics and Syrian divines whose schools are honoured by the names of Basil Gregory and Chrysos tom and tainted by those of Diodorus Theodoric and Nestorius But the person of the aged bishop of Lao dicea his character and dignity remained inviolate and his rivals since we may not suspect them of the weakness of toleration were astonished perhaps by the novelty of the argument and diffident of the final sentence of the Catholic church Her judgment at length inclined in their favour the heresy of Apolli naris was condemned and the separate congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the imperial laws But his principles were secretly entertained in the mo nasteries of Egypt and his enemies felt the hatred of Theophilus and Cyril the successive patriarchs of Alexandria v Ortho  e groveNing Ebionite and the fantas doxcou tic Docetes were rejected and forgotten the verbal recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris disputes reduced the Catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus But instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substantial indissoluble and ever lasting union of a perfect God with a perfect man or the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and hu man flesh In the beginning of the fifth century the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine of the church On all sides it was confessed that the mode of their co existence could neither be represented by our ideas nor expressed by our language Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished between those who were most apprehensive of confounding and those who were CHAP XLVII 13 most fearful of separating the divinity and the huma nity of Christ Impelled by religious frenzy they fled with adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation On either hand they were anxious to guard they were jea lous to defend the union and the distinction of the two natures and to invent such forms of speech such symbols of doctrine as were least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity The poverty of ideas and language tempted them to ransack art and jiature for every possi ble comparison and each comparison misled their fancy in the explanation of an incomparable mystery In the polemic microscope an atom is enlarged to a monster and each party was skilful to exaggerate the absurd or impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of their adversaries To escape from each other they wandered through many a dark and devious thicket till they were astonished by the horrid phantoms of Cerinthus and Apollinaris who guarded the opposite issues of the theological labyrinth As soon as they beheld the twilight of sense and he resy they started measured back their steps and were again involved in the gloom of impenetrable ortho doxy To purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error they disavowed their consequences explained their principles excused their indiscretions and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and faith Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the embers of controversy by the breath of prejudice and passion it was quickly kindled to a mighty flame and the verbal disputes of the oriental sects have shaken the pillars of the church and state I

honourable warfare The exile of the popular candi date to Carthage and Sardinia inflamed the ferment of Alexandria and after a schism of one hundred and seventy years the Gaianites still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder The strength of numbers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and bloody conflict the streets were filled with the dead bodies of citizens and soldiers the pious women ascending the roofs of the houses showered down every sharp or pon derous utensil on the heads of the enemy and the final victory of Narses was owing to the flames with which he wasted the

from our view the Roman name the proper subject of our inquiries is reduced to a narrow corner of Europe to the lonely suburbs of Constantinople and the fate of the Greek empire has been compared to that of the Rhine which loses itself in the sands before its waters can mingle with the ocean The scale of dominion is dimi nished to our view by the distance of time and place nor is the loss of external splendour compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius In the last moments of her decay Constantinople was doubtless more opulent and populous than Athens at her most flourishing era when a scanty sum of six thousand talents or twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling was possessed by twenty one thousand male citizens of an adult age But each of these citizens was a freeman who dared to assert the liberty of his thoughts words and actions whose person and pro perty were guarded by equal law and who exercised his independent vote in the government of the republic Their numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various discriminations of character under the shield of freedom on the wings of emulation and vanity each Athenian aspired to the level of the national dignity from this commanding eminence some chosen spirits soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye and the chances of superior merit in a great and populous kingdom as they are proved by experience would ex cuse the computation of imaginary millions The ter ritories of Athens Sparta and their allies do not ex ceed a moderate province of France or England but after the trophies of Salamis and Plataea they expand in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia which had been trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks But the subjects of the Byzantine empire who assume and dishonour the names both of Greeks and Romans present a dead uniformity of abject vices which are CHAP XLVI1I 89 neither softened by the weakness of humanity nor ani mated by the vigour of memorable crimes The free men of antiquity might repeat with generous enthusiasm the sentence of Homer that on the first day of his ser vitude the captive is deprived of one half of his manly virtue But the poet had only seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery nor could he foretel that the second moiety of manhood must be annihilated by the spiritual despotism which shackles not only the actions but even the thoughts of the prostrate votary By this double yoke the Greeks were oppressed under the suc cessors of Heraclius the tyrant a law of eternal justice was degraded by the vices of his subjects and on the throne

the female apartment of the palace The reign of Constantine III lasted only one hundred and three days he expired in the thirtieth year of his age and although his life had been a long malady a belief was entertained that poison had been the means and his cruel step mother the author of his untimely fate Heracie Martina reaped indeed the harvest of his AJD 64i death and assumed the government in the name M3 5 of the surviving emperor but the incestuous widow of Heraclius was universally abhorred the jea lousy of the people was awakened and the two orphans whom Constantine had left became the objects of the public care It was in vain that the son of Martina who was no more than fifteen years of age was taught to declare himself the guardian of his nephews one of whom he had presented at the baptismal font it was in vain that he swore on the wood of the true cross to defend them against all their enemies On his death bed the late emperor dispatched a trusty servant to arm the troops and provinces of the east in the defence of his helpless children the eloquence and liberality of Valentin had been successful and from his camp of Chalcedon he boldly demanded the punishment of the assassins and the restoration of the lawful heir The licence of the soldiers who devoured the grapes and drank the wine of their Asiatic vineyards provoked the citizens of Constantinople against the domestic authors of their calamities and the dome of St Sophia re echo ed not with prayers and hymns but with the clamours and imprecations of an enraged multitude At their imperious command Hejacleonas appeared in the pul pit with the eldest of the royal orphans Constans alone was saluted as emperor of the Romans and A crown of gold which had been taken from the tomb of Hera clius was placed on his head with the solemn benedic tion of the patriarch But in the tumult of joy and in 96 ROMAN EMPIRE dignation the church was pillaged the sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of Jews and barba rians and the Monothelite Pyrrhus a creature of the empress after dropping a protestation on the altar escaped by a prudent flight from the zeal of the Ca tholics A more serious and bloody task was reserved fort he senate who derived a temporary strength from the consent of the soldiers and people The spirit of Roman freedom revived the ancient and awful exam ples of the judgment

power when it was lodged for a moment in the hands of an aristocracy Constans We shall imagine ourselves transported five I A D hunclrecl years backwards to the age of the An SePtember tonines if we listen to the oration which Con stans II pronounced in the twelfth year of his age before the Byzantine senate After returning his thanks for the just punishment of the assassins who had inter cepted the fairest hopes of his father s reign â By the Divine Providence said the young emperor and by your righteous decree Martina and her incestuous pro geny have been cast headlong from the throne Your majesty and wisdom have prevented the Roman state from degenerating into lawless tyranny I therefore exhort and beseech you to stand forth as the counsellors and judges of the common safety The senators were grati fied by the respectful address and liberal donative of CHAP XLVIII 97 their sovereign but these servile Greeks were unworthy and regardless of freedom and in his mind the lesson of an hour was quickly erased by the prejudices of the age and the habits of despotism He retained only a jealous fear lest the senate or people should one day invade thg right of primogeniture and seat his brother Theodosius on an equal throne By the imposition of holy orders the grandson of Heraclius was disqualified for the purple but this ceremony which seemed to profane the sacraments of the church was insufficient to appease the suspicions of the tyrant and the death of the deacon Theodosius could alone expiate the crime of his royal birth His murder was avenged by the imprecations of the people and the assassin in the fulness of power was driven from his capital into volun tary and perpetual exile Constans embarked for Greece and as if he meant to retort the abhorrence which he de served he is said from the imperial galley to have spit against the walls of his native city After passing the winter at Athens he sailed to Tarentum in Italy visited Rome and concluded a long pilgrimage of disgrace and sacrilegious rapine by fixing his residence at Syracuse But if Constans could fly from his people he could not fly from himself The remorse of his conscience created a phantom who pursued him by land and sea by day and by night and the Visionary Theodosius present ing to his lips a cup of blood said or seemed to say Drink brother drink a sure emblem of the aggrava

in the capi tal of Sicily A servant who waited in the bath after pouring warm water on his head struck him violently with the vase He fell stunned by the blow and suffocated by the water and his attendants who won dered at the tedious delay beheld with indifference VOL VI H 98 ROMAN EMPIRE the corpse of their lifeless emperor The troops of Sicily invested with the purple an obscure youth whose inimitable beauty eluded and it might easily elude the declining art of the painters and sculptors of the age Constan Constans had left in the Byzantipe palace tine iv three sons the eldest of whom had been clothed Pogonatus A i 668 in his infancy with the purple When the fa 1 r ther summoned them to attend his person in Sicily these precious hostages were detained by the Greeks and a firm refusal informed him that they were the children of the state The news of his murder was conveyed with almost supernatural speed from Syracuse to Constantinople and Constantine the eldest of his sons inherited his throne without being the heir of the public hatred His subjects contributed with zeal and alacrity to chastise the guilt and presumption of a pro vince which had usurped the rights of the senate and people the young emperor sailed from the Hellespont with a powerful fleet and the legions of Rome and Carthage were assembled under his standard in the har bour of Syracuse The defeat of the Sicilian tyrant was easy his punishment just and his beauteous head was exposed in the hippodrome but I cannot applaud the clemency of a prince who among a crowd of victims condemned the son of a patrician for deploring with some bitterness the execution of a virtuous father The youth was castrated he survived the operation and the memory of this indecent cruelty is preserved by the elevation of Germanus to the rank of a patriarch and saint After pouring this bloody libation on his father s tomb Constantine returned to his capital and the growth of his young beard during the Sicilian voyage was an nounced by the familiar surname of Pogonatus to the Grecian world But his reign like that of his prede cessor was stained with fraternal discord On his two brothers Heraclius and Tiberius he had bestowed the CHAP XLVIII Â y title of Augustus an empty title for they continued to languish without trust or power in the solitude of the palace At their secret instigation the troops of the Anatolian theme or province approached the city on the Asiatic side demanded for the royal brothers the parti tion or exercise of sovereignty and supported their se ditious claim by a theological argument They were Christians they cried and orthodox Catholics the sincere votaries of the holy and undivided Trinity Since there are three equal persons in heaven it is reasonable there should be three equal persons upon earth The emperor invited these learned divines to a friendly con ference in which they might propose their arguments to the senate they obeyed the summons but the pros pect of their bodies hanging on a gibbet in the suburb of Galata reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of Constantine He pardoned his brothers and their names were still pronounced in the public acclama tions but on the repetition or suspicion of a similar offence the obnoxious princes were deprived of their titles and noses in the presence of the Catholic bishops who were assembled at Constantinople in the sixth ge neral synod In the close of his life Pogonatus was anxious only to establish the right of primogeniture  the hair of his two sons Justinian and Heraclius was of fered on the shrine of St Peter as a symbol of their spiritual adoption by the pope but the elder was alone exalted to the rank of Augustus and the assurance of the empire Justinian After the decease of his father the inheritance D of the Roman world devolved to Justinian II September and the name of a triumphant lawgiver was dis honoured by the vices of a boy who imitated his name sake only in the expensive luxury of building His pas sions were strong his understanding was feeble and he was intoxicated with a foolish pride that liis birth had given him the command of millions of whom the H 2 100 ROMAN HISTORY smallest community would not have chosen him for their local magistrate His favourite ministers were two beings the least susceptible of human sympathy a eu nuch and a monk to the one he abandoned the palace to the other the finances the former corrected the em peror s mother with a scourge the latter suspended the insolvent tributaries with their heads downwards over a slow and smoky fire Since the days of Commodus and Caracalla the cruelty of the Roman princes had most commonly been the effect of their fear but Jus tinian who possessed some vigour of character enjoyed the sufferings and braved the revenge of his subjects about ten years till the measure was full of his crimes and of their patience In a dark dungeon Leontius a general of reputation had groaned above three years with some of the noblest and most deserving of the pa tricians fee was suddenly drawn forth to assume the government of Greece and this promotion of an injured man was a mark of the contempt rather than of the con fidence of his prince As he was followed to the port by the kind offices of his friends Leontius observed with a sigh that he was a victim adorned for sacrifice and that inevitable death would pursue his footsteps They ventured to reply that glory and empire might be the recompense of a generous resolution that every order of men abhorred the reign of a monster and that the hands of two hundred thousand patriots expected only the voice of a leader The night was chosen for their deliverance and in the first effort of the conspirators the prefect was slain and the prisons were forced open the emissaries of Leontius proclaimed in every street â Christians to St Sophia and the seasonable text of the patriarch This is the day of the Lord was the prelude of an inflammatory sermon From the church the peo ple adjourned to the hippodrome Justinian in whose cause not a sword had been drawn was dragged before these tumultuary judges and their clamours demanded  CHAP XLVIII 101 the instant death of the tyrant But Leontius who was already clothed with the purple cast an eye of pity on the prostrate son of his own benefactor and of so many em perors The life of Justinian was spared the amputa tion of his nose perhaps of his tongue was imperfectly performed the happy flexibility of the Greek language could impose the name of Rhinotmetus and the muti lated tyrant was banished to Chersonae in Crim Tartary a lonely settlement where corn wine and oil were imported as foreign luxuries On the edge of the Scythian wilderness Jus His exile Â  A D tinian still cherished the pride of his birth and the hope of his restoration After three years exile he received the pleasing intelligence that his in jury was avenged by a second revolution and that Leon tius in his turn had been dethroned and mutilated by the rebel Apsimar who assumed the more respectable name of Tiberius But the claim of lineal succession was still formidable to a plebeian usurper and his jea lousy was stimulated by the complaints and charges of the Chersonites who beheld the vices of the tyrant in the spirit of the exile With a band of followers attach ed to his person by common hope or common despair Justinian fled from the inhospitable shore to the horde of the Chozars who pitched their tents between the Tanais and Borysthenes The khan entertained with pity and respect the royal suppliant Phanagoria once an opulent city on the Asiatic side of the lake Mceotis was assigned for his residence and every Roman pre judice was stifled in his marriage with the sister of the barbarian who seems however from the name of Theo dora to have received the sacrament of baptism But the faithless Chozar was soon tempted by the gold of Constantinople and had not the design been revealed by the conjugal love of Theodora her husband must have been assassinated or betrayed into the power of his enemies After strangling with his own hands the 102 ROMAN HISTORY r  two emissaries of the khan Justjnian sept back bis wife to tier brother and embarked on the Euxine in search of new and more faithful allies His vessel was assault ed by a violent tempest and one of his pious compa nions advised him to deserve the mercy of God by a vow of general forgiveness if he should be restored to the throne Of forgiveness replied the intrepid tyrant may I perish this instantâ may the Almighty whelm me in the wavesâ if I consent to spare a single head of my enemies He survived this impious menace sailed into the mouth of the Danube trusted his person in the royal village of the Bulgarians and purchased the aid of Ter belis a Pagan conqueror by the promise of his daugh ter and a fair partition of the treasures of the empire The Bulgarian kingdom extended to the confines of Thrace and the two prinqes besieged Constantinople at the head of fifteen thousand horse Apsimar was dis mayed by the sudden and hostile apparition of his rival whose head had been promised by the C ozar and of whose evasion he was yet ignorant After an absence of ten years the crimes of Justinian were faintly remem bered and the birth and misfortunes of their hereditary sovereign excited the pity of the multitude ever discon tented with the ruling powers and by the active dili gence of his adherents he was introduced into the city and palace of Constantine His re In rewarding his allies and recalling his wife storation Justinian displayed some sense of honour and A D 705 gratitude and Terbelis retired after sweeping 711 away a heap of gold coin which he measured with his Scythian whip But never was vow more re ligiously performed than the sacred oath of revenge which he had sworn amidst the storms of the Euxine The two usurpers for I must reserve the name of ty rant for the conqueror were dragged into the hippo drome the one from his prison the other from his palace Before their execution Leontius and Apsimar were cast CHAP XLVIII 103 prostrate in chains beneath the throne of the emperor and Justinian planting a foot on each of their necks contemplated above an hour the chariot race while the inconstant people shouted in the words of the psalm ist â Thou shall trample on the asp and basilisk and on the lion and dragon shalt thou set thy foot The uni versal defection which he had once experienced might provoke him to repeat the wish of Caligula that the Ro man people had but one head Yet I shall presume to observe that such a wish is unworthy of an ingenious tyrant since his revenge and cruelty would have been ex tinguished by a single blow instead of the slow variety of tortures which Justinian inflicted on the victims of his anger His pleasures were inexhaustible neither private virtue nor public service could expiate the guilt of active or even passive obedience to an established government and during the six years of his new reign he considered the axe the cord and the rack as the only instruments of royalty But his most implicable hatred was pointed against the Chersonites who had insulted his exile and violated the laws of hospita ty Their remote situation afforded some means of defence or at least of escape and a grievous tax was imposed on Constantinople to supply the preparations of a fleet and army All are guilty and all must perish was the mandate of Justi nian and the bloody execution was intrusted to his favourite Stephen who was recommended by the epithet of the savage Yet even the savage Stephen imper fectly accomplished the intentions of his sovereign The slowness of his attack allowed the greater part of the in habitants to withdraw into the country and the minister 6f vengeance contented himself with reducing the youth of both sexes to a state of servitude with roasting alive seven of the principal citizens with drowning twenty in the sea and with reserving forty two in chains to receive their doom from the mouth of the emperor In their return the fleet was driven on the rocky shores of Ana 104 ROMAN HISTORY iolia and Justinian applauded the obedience of the Euxine which had involved so many of his subjects and enemies in a common shipwreck  but the tyrant was still insatiate of blood and a second expedition was commanded to extirpate the remains of the proscribed colony In the short interval the Chersonites had re turned to their city and were prepared to die in arms the khan of the Chozarshad renounced the cause of his odious brother the exiles of every provence were assem bled in Tauris and Bardanes under the name of Phi lippicus was invested with the purple The imperial troops unwilling and unable to perpetuate the revenge of Justinian escaped his displeasure by abjuring his al legiance the fleet under their new sovereign steered back a more auspicious course to the harbours of Synope and Constantinople and every tongue was prompt to pronounce every hand to execute the death of the ty rant Destitute of friends he was deserted by his bar barian guards and the stroke of the assassin was praised as an act of patriotism and Roman virtue His son Ti berius had taken refuge in a church his aged grand mother guarded the door and the innocent youth sus pending round his neck the most formidable relics embraced with one hand the altar with the other the wood of the true cross But the popular fury that dares to trample on superstition is deaf to the cries of humanity and the race of Heraclius was extinguished after a reign of one hundred years Between the fall of Heraclian and the rise of the Isaurian dynasty a short interval of six December years is divided into three reigns Bardanes or Philippicus was hailed at Constantinople as a hero who had delivered his country from a tyrant and he might taste some moments of happiness in the first transports of sincere and universal joy Justinian had left behind him an ample treasure the fruit of cruelty and rapine but this useful fund was soon and idly dissipated by his CHAP KLVIII 105 successor On the festival of his birth day Philippicus entertained the multitude with the games of the hippo drome from thence he paraded through the streets with a thousand banners and a thousand trumpets re freshed himself in the baths of Zeuxippus and return ing to the palace entertained his nobles with a sump tuous banquet At the meridian hour he withdrew to his chamber intoxicated with flattery and wine and forgetful that his example had made every subject am bitious and that every ambitious subject was his secret enemy Some bold conspirators introduced themselves in the disorder of the feast and the slumbering monarch was surprised bound blinded and deposed before he Anasta was sensible of his danger Yet the traitors i Vm were deprived of their reward and the free June 4 voice of the senate and people promoted Arte mius from the office of secretary to that of emperor he assumed the title of Anastasius II and displayed in a short and troubled reign the virtues both of peace and war But after the extinction of the imperial line the rule of obedience was violated and every change dif fused the seeds of new revolutions In a mutiny of the fleet an obscure and reluctant officer of the revenue â was forcibly invested with the purple after some months of a naval war Anastasius resigned the sceptre and the conqueror Theodosius III submitted  n his turn to the superior ascendant of Leo January fae general and emperor of the oriental troops His two predecessors were permitted to embrace the ecclesiastical profession the restless impatience of Anastasius tempted him to risk and to lose his life in a treasonable enterprise but the last days of Theodosius were honourable and secure The single and sublime word HEALTH which he inscribed on his tomb ex presses the confidence of philosophy or religion and the fame of his miracles was long preserved among the people of Ephesus This convenient shelter of the 106 ROMAN EMPIRE

tyrant I shall The isau briefly represent the founder of a new dynasty A D TIB who is known to posterity by the invectives of  his enemies and whose public and private life is involved in the ecclesiastical story of the Iconoclasts Yet in spite of the clamours of superstition a favourable prejudice for the character of Leo the Isaurian may be reasonably drawn from the obscurity of his birth and the duration of his reign â I In an age of manly spirit the prospect of an imperial reward would have kindled every energy of the mind and produced a crowd of competitors as deserving as they were desirous to reign Even in the corruption and debility of the modern Greeks the elevation of a plebeian from the last to the first rank of society supposes some qualifications above the level of the multitude He would probably be ig norant and disdainful of speculative science and in the pursuit of fortune he might absolve himself from the obligations of benevolence and justice but to his charac ter we may ascribe the useful virtues of prudence and fortitude the knowledge of mankind and the important art of gaining their confidence and directing their pas sions It is agreed that Leo was a native of Isauria and that Conon was his primitive name The writers whose awkward satire is praise describe him as an itine rant pedlar who drove an ass with some paltry mer chandise to the country fairs and foolishly relate that he met on the road some Jewish fortune tellers who promised him the Roman empire on condition that he should abolish the worship of idols A more probable account relates the migration of his father from Asia Minor to Thrace where he exercised the lucrative trade of a grazier and he must have acquired considerable wealth since the first introduction of his son was pro CHAP XLYIII J07 cured by a supply of five hundred sheep to the imperial camp His first service was in the guards of Justinian where he soon attracted the notice and by degrees the jealousy of the tyrant His valour and dexterity were conspicuous in the Colchian war from Anastasius he received the command of the Anatolian legions and by the suffrage of the soldiers he was raised to the empire with the general applause of the Roman world II In this dangerous elevation Leo III supported himself against the envy of his equals the discontent of a power ful faction and the assaults of his foreign and domestic enemies The Catholics who accuse his religious inno vations are obliged toconfess that they were undertaken with temper and conducted with firmness Their silence respects the wisdom of his administration and the purity of his manners After a reign of twenty four year he peaceably expired in the palace of Constantinople and the purple which he had acquired was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the third generation Constan n tne onS reign of thirty four years the son tinev co and successor of Leo Constantine V surnamed pronymus  A D 7 i Copronymus attacked with Jess temperate zeal the images or idols of the church Their vo taries have exhausted the bitterness of religious gall in their portrait of this spotted panther this antichrist this flying dragon of the serpent s seed who surpassed the vices of Elagabalus and Nero His reign was a long butchery of whatever was most noble or holy or inno cent in his empire In person the emperor assist ed at the execution of his victims surveyed their ago nies listened to their groans and indulged without satiating his appetite for blood a plate of noses was accepted as a grateful offering and his domestics were often scourged or mutilated by the royal hand His surname was derived from his pollution of his baptismal font The infant might be excused but the manly pleasures of Copronymus degraded him below the level 108 ROMAN EMPIRE of a brute his lust confounded the eternal distinctions of sex and species and he seemed to extract some un natural delight from the objects most offensive to human sense In his religion the Iconoclast was a heretic a Jew a Mahometan a Pagan and an atheist and his belief of an invisible power could be discovered only in his magic rites human victims and nocturnal sacrifices to Venus and the demons of antiquity His life was stained with the most opposite vices and the ulcers which covered his body anticipated before his death the sentiment of hell tortures Of these accusations which I have so patiently copied a part is refuted by its own absurdity and in the private anecdotes of the life of princes the lie is more easy as the detection is more difficult Without adopting the pernicious maxim that where much is alleged something must be true I can however discern that Constantine V was dissolute and cruel Calumny is more prone to exaggerate than to in vent and her licentious tongue is checked in some measure by the experience of the age and country to which she appeals Of the bishops and monks the ge nerals and magistrates who are said to have suffered under his reign the numbers are recorded the names were conspicuous the execution was public the mutila tion visible and permanent The Catholics hated the person and government of Copronymus but even their hatred is a proof of their oppression They dissemble the provocations which might excuse or justify his ri gour but even these provocations must gradually in flame his resentment and harden his temper in the use or the abuse of despotism Yet the character of the fifth Constantine was not devoid of merit nor did his govern ment always deserve the curses or the contempt of the Greeks From the confession of his enemies I am in formed of the restoration of an ancient aqueduct of the redemption of two thousand five hundred captives of the uncommon plenty of the times and of the new colonies CHAP XLVIII 109 with which he repeopled Constantinople and the Thra cian cities They reluctantly praise his activity and cou rage he was on horseback in the field at the head of his legions and although the fortune of his arms was various he triumphed by sea and land on the Euphrates and the Danube in civil and barbarian war Heretical praise must be cast into the scale to counterbalance the weight of orthodox invective The Iconoclasts revered the virtues of the prince forty years after his death they still prayed before the tomb of the saint A miraculous vision was propagated by fanaticism Or fraud and the Christian hero appeared on a milk white steed brandish ing his lance against the Pagans of Bulgaria an absurd fable says the Catholic historian since Copronymus is chained with the demons in the abyss of hell Leo IV the son of the fifth and the father of A D 775 the sixth Constantine was of a feeble constitu pt   tion both of mind and body and the principal care of his reign was the settlement of the succession The association of the young Constantine was urged by the officious zeal of his subjects and the emperor conscious of his decay complied after a prudent hesi tation with their unanimous wishes The royal infant at the age of five years was crowned with his mother Irene and the national consent was ratified by every circumstance of pomp and solemnity that could dazzle the eyes or bind the conscience of the Greeks An oath of fidelity was administered in the palace the church and the hippodrome to the several orders of the state who abjured the holy names of the son and mother of God Be witness O Christ that we will watch over the safety of Constantine the son of Leo expose our lives m his service and bear true allegiance to his person and posterity They pledged their faith on the wood of the true cross and the act of their engagement was depo sited on the altar of St Sophia The first to swear and the first to violate their oath were the five sons of Co 110 ROMAN EMPIRE pronymus by a second marriage and the story of these princes is singular and tragic The right of primoge niture excluded them from the throne the injustice of their elder brother defrauded them of a legacy of about two millions sterling some vain titles were not deem ed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power and they repeatedly conspired against their nephew before and after the death of his father Their first attempt was pardoned for the second offence they were condemned to the ecclesiastical state and for the third treason Nicephorus the eldest and most guilty was deprived of his eyes and his four brothers Chris topher Nicetas Anthemeus and Eudoxas were punish ed as a milder sentence by the amputation of their tongues After five years confinement they escaped to the church of St Sophia and displayed a pathetic spec tacle to the people Countrymen and Christians cried Nicephorus for himself and his mute brethren behold the sons of your emperor if you can still recognize our features in this miserable state A life an imperfect life is all that the malice of our enemies has spared It is now threatened and we now throw ourselves on your compassion The rising murmur might have produced a revolution had it not been checked by the presence of a minister who soothed the unhappy princes with flat tery and hope and gently drew them from the sanctuary to the palace They were speedily embarked for Greece and Athens was allotted for the place of their exile In this calm retreat and in their helpless condition Nice phorus and his brothers were tormented by the thirst of power and tempted by a Sclavonian chief who offered to break their prison and to lead them in arms and in the purple to the gates of Constantinople But the Athenian people ever zealous in the cause of Irene prevented her justice or cruelty and the five sons of Copronymus were plunged in eternal darkness and oblivion CHAP XLVIH himself that emperor had chosen a bar tine vi barian wife the daughter of the khan of the A D 7so Chozars but in the marriage of his heir Sept 8 he preferred an Athenian virgin an orphan seventeen years old whose sole fortune must have consisted in her personal accomplishments The nup tials of Leo and Irene were celebrated with royal pomp she soon acquired the love and confidence of a feeble husband and in his testament he declared the em press guardian of the Roman world and of their son Constan tine VI who was no more than ten years of age During his childhood Irene most ably and assiduously discharged in her public administration the duties of a faithful mother and her zeal in the restoration of images has deserved the name and honours of a saint which she still occupies in the Greek calendar But the emperor attained the maturity of youth the maternal yoke be came more grievous and he listened to the favourites of his own age who shared his pleasures and were am bitious of sharing his power Their reasons convinced him of his right their praises of his ability to reign and he consented to reward the services of Irene by a perpetual banishment to the isle of Sicily But her vigilance and penetration easily disconcerted their rash projects a similar or more severe punishment was retaliated on themselves and their advisers and Irene inflicted on the ungrateful prince the chastisement of a boy After this contest the mother and the son were at the head of two domestic factions and in stead of mild influence and voluntary obedience she held in chains a captive and an enemy The em press was overthrown by the abuse of victory the oath of fidelity which she exacted to herself alone was pronounced with reluctant murmurs and the bold refusal of the Armenian guards encouraged a free and general declaration that Constantine VI was the lawful emperor of the Romans In this cha 112 ROMAN EMPIRE racter he ascended his hereditary throne and dis missed Irene to a life of solitude and repose But her haughty spirit condescended to the arts of dis simulation she flattered the bishops and eunuchs re vived the filial tenderness of the prince regained his confidence and betrayed his cre dulity The character of Constantine was not destitute of sense or spirit but his education had been studiously neglected and his ambitious mother exposed to the public censure the vices which she had nourished and the actions which she had secretly advised his divorce and second marriage offended the prejudices of the clergy and by his impru dent rigour he forfeited the attachment of the Armenian guards A powerful conspiracy was formed for the restoration of Irene and the secret though widely diffused was faithfully kept above eight months till the emperor suspicious of his danger escaped from Constantinople with the design of appealing to the provinces and armies By this hasty flight the em press was left on the brink of the precipice yet before she implored the mercy of her son Irene addressed a private epistle to the friends whom she had placed about his person with a menace that unless they ac complished she would reveal their treason Their fear rendered them intrepid they seized the emperor on the Asiatic shore and he was transported to the Porphyry apartment of the palace where he had first seen the light In the mind of Irene ambition had stifled every sentiment of humanity and nature and it was decreed in her bloody council that Constantine should be rendered incapable of the throne her emis saries assaulted the sleeping prince and stabbed their daggers with such violence and precipitation into his eyes as if they meant to execute a mortal sentence An ambiguous passage of Theophanes persuaded the an nalist of the church that death was the immediate con sequence of this barbarous execution The Catholics CHAP XLVIII 113 have been deceived or subdued by the authority of Baronius and Protestant zeal has re echoed the words of a cardinal desirous as it should seem to favour the patroness of images Yet the blind son of Irene sur vived many years oppressed by the court and for gotten by the world the Isaurian dynasty was silently extinguished and the memory of Constantine was re called only by the nuptials of his daughter Euphrosyne with the emperor Michael II  The most bigoted orthodoxy has justly exe A D 792 crated the unnatural mother who may not Â 8  easily be paralleled in the history of crimes To her bloody deed superstition has attributed a sub sequent darkness of seventeen days during which many vessels in mid day were driven from their course as if the sun a globe of fire so vast and so remote could sympathize with the atoms of a revolving planet On earth the crime of Irene was left five years unpunish ed her reign was crowned with external splendour and if she could silence the voice of conscience she neither heard or regarded the reproaches of man kind The Roman world bowed to the government of a female and as she moved through the streets of Con stantinople the reins of her four milk white steeds were held by as many patricians who marched on foot before the golden chariot Jf their queen But these patricians were for the most part eunuchs and their black ingra titude justified on this occasion the popular hatred and contempt Raised enriched intrusted with the first dignities of the empire they basely conspired against their benefactress the great treasurer Nicephorus was secretly invested with the purple her successor was in troduced into the palace and crowned at St Sophia by the venal patriarch In their first interview she reca pitulated with dignity the revolutions of her life gently accused the perfidy of Nicephorus insinuated that he owed his life to her unsuspicious clemency and for the VOL vi i 114 ROMAN EMPIRE throne and treasures which she resigned solicited a de cent and honourable retreat His avarice refused this modest compensation and in her exile to the isle of Lesbos the empress earned a scanty subsistence by the labours of her distaff Nicepho Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more AsD 802 criminal than Nicephorus but none perhaps Oct 31 have more deeply incurred the universal abhor rence of their people His character was stained with the three odious vices of hypocrisy ingratitude and avarice his want of virtue was not redeemed by any superior talents nor his want of talents by any pleas ing qualifications Unskilful and unfortunate in war Nicephorus was vanquished by the Saracens and slain by the Bulgarians and the advantage of his death overbalanced in the public opinion the destruction of a Roman army His son and heir Stauracius A D en escaped from the field with a mortal wound 11 7 25 yet six months of an expiring life were suffi cient to refute his indecent though popular declara tion that he would in all things avoid the example of his father On the near prospect of his decease Mi chael the great master of the palace and the husband of his sister Procopia was named by every person of the palace and city except by his envious brother Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his hand he conspired against the life of his successor and che rished the idea of changing to a democracy the Roman empire But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the people and to remove the scruples of the Michaeli candidate Michael I accepted the purple and A IX u before he sunk into the grave the son of Ni October cephorus implored the clemency of his new so vereign Had Michael in an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne he might have reigned and died the father of his people but his mild virtues were adapted to the shade of private life nor was he capable of con CHAP XLVIII 115 trolling the ambition of his equals or of resisting the arms of the victorious Bulgarians While his want of ability and success exposed him to the contempt of the soldiers the masculine spirit of his wife Procopia awakened their indignation Even the Greeks of the ninth century were provoked by the insolence of a fe male who in the front of the standards presumed to direct their discipline and animate their valour and their licentious clamours advised the new Semiramis to reverence the majesty of a Roman camp After an unsuccessful campaign the emperor left in their winter quarters of Thrace a disaffected army under the com mand of his enemies and their artful eloquence per suaded the soldiers to break the dominion of the eu nuchs to degrade the husband of Procopia and to assert the right of a military election They marched towards the capital yet the clergy the senate and the people of Constantinople adhered to the cause of Mi chael and the troops and treasures of Asia might have protracted the mischiefs of civil war But his huma nity by the ambitious it will be termed his weakness protested that not a drop of Christian blood should be shed in his quarrel and his messengers presented the conquerors with the keys of the city and the palace They were disarmed by his innocence and submission his life and his eyes were spared and the imperial monk enjoyed the comforts of solitude and religion above thirty two years after he had been stripped of the purple and separated from his wife Leo v the A rebel in the time of Nicephorus the fa Aâ mous and unfortunate Bardanes had once the Joiyii curiosity to consult an Asiatic prophet who after prognosticating his fall announced the fortunes of his three principal officers Leo the Armenian Mi chael the Phrygian and Thomas the Cappadocian the successive reigns of the two former the fruitless and fatal enterprise of the third This prediction was veri i 2 116 ROMAN EMPIRE fied or rather was produced by the event Ten years afterward when the Thracian camp rejected the hus band of Procopia the crown was presented to the same Leo the first in military rank and the secret author of the mutiny As he affected to hesitate â with this sword said his companion Michael  will open the gates of Constantinople to your imperial sway or in stantly plunge it into your bosom if you obstinately resist the just desires of your fellow soldiers The compliance of the Armenian was rewarded with the empire and he reigned seven years and a half under the name of Leo V Educated in a camp and ignorant both of laws and letters he introduced into his civil government the ri gour and even cruelty of military discipline but if his severity was sometimes dangerous to the innocent it was always formidable to the guilty His religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of chameleon but the Catholics have acknowledged by the voice of a saint and confessors that the life of the Iconoclast was use ful to the republic The zeal of his companion Mi chael was repaid with riches honours and military command and his subordinate talents were beneficially employed in the public service Yet the Phrygian was dissatisfied at receiving as a favour a scanty portion of the imperial prize which he had bestowed on his equal and his discontent which sometimes evaporated in a hasty discourse at length assumed a more threat ening and hostile aspect against a prince whom he represented as a cruel tyrant That tyrant however repeatedly detected warned and dismissed the old companion of his arms till fear and resentment pre vailed over gratitude and Michael after a scrutiny into his actions was convicted of treason and sen tenced to be burnt alive in the furnace of the private baths The devout humanity of the empress Theo phano was fatal to her husband and family A solemn day the twenty fifth of December had been fixed for CHAP XLVIII 117 the execution she urged that the anniversary of the Saviour s birth would be profaned by this inhuman spectacle and Leo consented with reluctance to a de cent respite But on the vigil of the feast his sleep less anxiety prompted him to visit at the dead of night the chamber in which his enemy was confined he be held him released from his chain and stretched on the jailer s bed in a profound slumber Leo was alarmed at these signs of security and intelligence but though he retired with silent steps his entrance and departure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a corner of the prison Under the pretence of requesting the spiritual aid of a confessor Michael informed the con spirators that their lives depended on his discretion and that a few hours were left to assure their own safety by the deliverance of their friend and country On the great festivals a chosen band of priests and chanters was admitted into the palace by a private gate to sing matins in the chapel and Leo who regulated with the same strictness the discipline of the choir and of the camp was seldom absent from those early devo tions In the ecclesiastical habit but with swords un der their robes the conspirators mingled with the pro cession lurked in the angles of the chapel and expected as the signal of murder the intonation of the first psalm by the emperor himself The imperfect light and the uniformity of dress might have favoured his escape while their assault was pointed against a harmless priest but they soon discovered their mistake and en compassed on all sides the royal victim Without a weapon and without a friend he grasped a weighty cross and stood at bay against the hunters of his life but as he asked for mercy â This is the hour not of mercy but of vengeance was the inexorable reply The stroke of a well aimed sword separated from his body the right arm and the cross and Leo the Armenian was slain at the foot of the altar 118 ROMAN EMPIRE t f  A memorable reverse of fortune was displayed in Michael II who from a defect in his speech was surnamed the Stammerer He was snatched     820 Dec from the fiery furnace to the sovereignty of an empire and as in the tumult a smith could not readily be found the fetters remained on his legs several hours after he was seated on the throne of the Ceesars The royal blood which had been the price of his elevation was unprofitably spent in the purple he retained the ignoble vices of his origin and Michael lost his provinces with as supine indifference as if they had been the inheritance of his fathers His title was disputed by Thomas the last of the military trium virate who transported into Europe fourscore thousand barbarians from the banks of the Tigris and the shores of the Caspian He formed the siege of Constantino ple but the capital was defended wlth spiritual and carnal weapons a Bulgarian king assaulted the camp of the orientals and Thomas had the misfortune or the weakness to fall alive into the power of the conqueror The hands and feet of the rebel were amputated he was placed on an ass and amidst the insults of the people was led through the streets which he sprinkled with his blood The depravation of manners as savage as they were corrupt is marked by the presence of the emperor himself Deaf to the lamentations of a fellow soldier he incessantly pressed the discovery of more accomplices till his curiosity was checked by the ques tion of an honest or guilty minister â Would you give credit to an enemy against the most faithful of your friends After the death of his first wife the emperor at the request of the senate drew from her monastery Euphrosyne the daughter of Constantine VI Her august birth might justify a stipulation in the marriage contract that her children should equally share the em pire with their elder brother But the nuptials of Mi chael and Euphrosyne were barren and she was con CHAP XLVIII Jli tent with the title of mother of Theophilus his son and successor The character of Theophilus is a rare exam Di P in which religious zeal has allowed and  â â  â perhaps magnified the virtues of a heretic and a persecutor His valour was often felt by the ene mies and his justice by the Subjects of the monarchy but the valour of Theophilus was rash and fruitless and his justice arbitrary and cruel He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens but his five expeditions were concluded by a signal overthrow Amorium the native city of his ancestors was levelled with the ground and from his military toils he derived only the surname of the Unfortunate The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the institution of laws and the choice of magistrates and while he seems without action his civil government revolves round his centre with the silence and order of the planetary system But the justice of Theophilus was fashioned on the model of the oriental despots who in personal and irregular acts of authority consult the reason or passion of the moment without measuring the sentence by the law or the penalty by the offence A poor woman threw her self at the emperor s feet to complain of a powerful neighbour the brother of the empress who had raised his palace wall to such an inconvenient height that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air On the proof of the fact instead of granting like an ordi nary judge sufficient or ample damages to the plaintiff the sovereign adjudged to her use and benefit the pa lace and the ground Nor was Theophilus content with this extravagant satisfaction his zeal converted a civil trespass into a criminal act and the unfortunate patri cian was stripped and scourged in the public place of Constantinople For some venial offences some defect of equity or vigilance the principal ministers a prefect a quaestor a captain of the guards were banished or mutilated or scalded with boiling pitch or burnt alive 120 ROMAN EMPIRE in the hippodrome and as these dreadful examples might be the effects of error or caprice they must have alienated from his service the best and wisest of the ci tizens But the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of power or as he thought of virtue and the people safe in their obscurity applauded the dan ger and debasement of their superiors This extraordi nary rigour was justified in some measure by its salu tary consequences since after a scrutiny of seventeen days not a complaint or abuse could be found in the court or city and it might be alleged that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of iron and that the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge Yet in the crime or the suspicion of treason that judge is of all others the most credulous and par tial Theophilus might inflict a tardy vengeance on the assassins of Leo and the saviours of his father but he enjoyed the fruits of their crime and his jealous ty ranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his life A Persian of the race of the Sassa nides died in poverty and exile at Constantinople leav ing an only son the issue of a plebeian marriage At the age of twelve years the royal birth of Theophobus was revealed and his merit was not unworthy of his birth He was educated in the Byzantine palace a Christian and a soldier advanced with rapid steps in the career of fortune and glory received the hand of the emperor s sister and was promoted to the command of thirty thousand Perians who like his father had fled from the Mahometan conquerors These troops doubly infected with mercenary and fanatic vices were desirous of revolting against their benefactor and erecting the standard of their native king but the royal Theophobus rejected their offers disconcerted their schemes and es caped from their hands to the camp or palace of his royal brother A generous confidence might have secured a faithful and able guardian for his wife and his infant son to whom Theophilus in the flower of his age was CHAP XLVIII 121 compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire But his jealousy was exasperated by envy and disease he feared the dangerous virtues which might either sup port or oppress their infancy and weakness and the dying emperor demanded the head of the Persian prince With savage delight he recognised the familiar features of his brother Thou art no longer Theophobus he said and sinking on his couch he added with a faultering voice Soon too soon I shall be no more Theophilus The Russians who have borrowed from the Greeks the greatest part of their civil and ecclesiastical policy preserved till the last century a singular institution in the marriage of the czar They collected not the vir gins of every rank and of every province a vain and ro mantic idea but the daughters of the principal nobles who awaited in the palace the choice of their sovereign It is affirmed that a similar method was adopted in the nuptials of Theophilus With a golden apple in his hand he slowly walked between two lines of contending beauties his eye was detained by the charms of Icasia and in the awkwardness of a first declaration the prince could only observe that in this world women had been the cause of much evil And surely sir she pertly re plied they have likewise been the occasion of much good This affectation of unseasonable wit displeased the im perial lover he turned aside in disgust Icasia con cealed her mortification in a convent and the modest silence of Theodora was rewarded with the golden apple She deserved the love but did not escape the severity of her lord From the palace garden he beheld a ves sel deeply laden and steering into the port on the discovery that the precious cargo of Syrian luxury was the property of his wife he condemned the ship to the flames with a sharp reproach that her avarice had de graded the character of an empress into that of a mer Michaei chant Yet his last choice intrusted her with A b 84 the guardianship of the empire and her son Jan 20 Michael who was left an orphan in the fifth 122 ROMAN EMPJRE year of his age The restoration of images and the final extirpation of the Iconoclasts has endeared her name to the devotion of the Greeks but in the fervour of religious zeal Theodora entertained a grateful regard for the memory and salvation of her husband After thirteen years of a prudent and frugal administration she perceived the decline of her influence but the se cond Irene imitated only the virtues of her predecessor Instead of conspiring against the life or government of her son she retired without a struggle though not with out a murmur to the solitude of private life deploring the ingratitude the vices and the inevitable ruin of the worthless youth Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus we have not hitherto found the imitation of their vices the character of a Roman prince who considered pleasure as the object of life and virtue as the enemy of pleasure Whatever might have been the maternal care of Theo dora in the education of Michael III her unfortunate son was a king before he was a man If the ambitious mother laboured to check the progress of reason she could not cool the ebullition of passion and her selfish policy was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong youth At the age of eighteen he rejected her authority without feeling his own incapa city to govern the empire and himself With Theodora all gravity and wisdom retired from the court their place was supplied by the alternate dominion of vice and folly and it was impossible without forfeiting the public esteem to acquire or preserve the favour of the emperor The millions of gold and silver which had been accumulated for the service of the state were la vished on the vilest of men who flattered his passions and shared his pleasures and in a reign of thirteen years the richest of sovereigns was compelled to strip the palace and the churches of their precious furniture Like Nero he delighted in the amusements of the theatre and sighed to be surpassed in the accomplish1 CHAP XLVIII 123 ments in which he should have blushed to excel Yet the studies of Nero in music and poetry betrayed some symptoms of a liberal taste the more ignoble arts of the son of Theophilus were confined to the chariot race of the hippodrome The four factions which had agi tated the peace still amused the idleness of the capi tal for himself the emperor assumed the blue livery the three rival colours were distributed to his favour ites and in the vile though eager contention he forgot the dignity of his person and the safety of his dominions He silenced the messenger of an invasion who presumed to divert his attention in the most critical moment of the race and by his command the importunate beacons were extinguished that too frequently spread the alarm from Tarsus to Constantinople The most skilful cha rioteers obtained the first place in his confidence and esteem their merit was profusely rewarded the em peror feasted in their houses and presented their children at the baptismal font and while he applaud ed his own popularity he affected to blame the cold and stately reserve of his predecessors The unnatural lusts which had degraded even the manhood of Nero were banished from the world yet the strength of Michael was consumed by the indulgence of love and intemper ance In his midnight revels when his passions were inflamed by wine he was provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands and if any feelings of humanity were left he was reduced with the return of sense to approve the salutary disobedience of his servants But the most extraordinary feature in the character of Mi chael is the profane mockery of the religion of his country The superstition of the Greeks might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher but his smile would have been rational and temperate and he must have condemned the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the objects of public veneration A buffoon of the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch the twelve 124 ROMAN EMPIRE metropolitans among whom the emperor was ranked assumed their ecclesiastical garments they used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar and in their bacchanalian feasts the holy communion was adminis tered in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard Nor were these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city On the day of a solemn festival the emperor with his bishops or buffoons rode on asses through the streets encountered the true patriarch at the head of his clergy and by their licentious shouts and obscene gestures disordered the gravity of the Christian procession The devotion of Michael ap peared only in some offence to reason or piety he re ceived his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin and an imperial tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constantine the Iconoclast By this extravagant conduct the son of Theophilus became as contemptible as he was odious every citizen was impatient for the deliverance of his country and even the favourites of the moment were apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had bestowed In the thirtieth year of his age and in the hour of intoxication and sleep Michael III was murdered in his chamber by the founder of a new dynasty whom the emperor had raised to an equality of rank and power Basa i r ne genealogy of Basil the Macedonian if the Mace it be not the spurious offspring of pride and A D 867 flattery exhibits a genuine picture of the re Sept   volution of the most illustrious families The Arsacides the rivals of Rome possessed the sceptre of the east near four hundred years a younger branch of these Parthian kings continued to reign in Armenia and their royal descendants survived the partition and servitude of that ancient monarchy Two of these Artabanus and Chlienes escaped or retired to the court of Leo I his bounty seated them in a safe and hos CHAP XLVIII 125 pitable exile in the province of Macedonia Adrianople was their final settlement During several generations they maintained the dignity of their birth and their Roman patriotism rejected the tempting offers of the Persian and Arabian powers who recalled them to their native country But their splendour was insen sibly clouded by time and poverty and the father of Basil was reduced to a small farm which he cultivated with his own hands yet he scorned to disgrace the blood of the Arsacide by a plebeian allianceâ his wife a widow of Adrianople was pleased to count among her ancestors the great Constantine and their royal infant was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or coun try with the Macedonian Alexander No sooner was he born than the cradle of Basil his family and his city were swept away by an inundation of the Bulga rians he was educated a slave in a foreign land and in this severe discipline he acquired the hardiness of body and flexibility of mind which promoted his future elevation In the age of youth or manhood he shared the deliverance of the Roman captives who generously broke their fetters marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine defeated two armies of the bar barians embarked in the ships which had been stationed for their reception and returned to Constantinople from whence they were distributed to their respective homes But the freedom of Basil was naked and des titute his farm was ruined by the calamities of war after his father s death his manual labour or service could no longer support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more conspicuous theatre in which every virtue and every vice may lead to the paths of greatness The first night of his arrival at Constanti nople without friends or money the weary pilgrim slept on the steps of the church of St Diomede he was fed by the casual hospitality of a monk and was introduced to the service of a cousin and namesake of the emperor 126 ROMAN EMPIRE Theophilus who though himself of a diminutive per son was always followed by a train of tall and handsome domestics Basil attended his patron to the government of Peloponnesus eclipsed by his personal merit the birth and dignity of Theophilus and formed an useful connexion with a wealthy and charitable matron of Pa tras Her spiritual or carnal love embraced the young adventurer whom she adopted as her son Danielis pre sented him with thirty slaves and the produce of her  bounty was expended in the support of his brothers and the purchase of some large estates in Macedonia His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the service of Theophilus and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of the court A famous wrestler in the train of the Bulgarian ambassadors had defied at the royal banquet the boldest and most robust of the Greeks The strength of Basil was praised he accepted the chal lenge and the barbarian champion was overthrown at the first onset A beautiful but vicious horse was con demned to be hamstrung it was subdued by the dexte rity and courage of the servant of Theophilus and his conqueror was promoted to an honourable rank in the imperial stables But it was impossible to obtain the confidence of Michael without complying with his vices and his new favourite the great chamberlain of the pa lace was raised and supported by a disgraceful marriage with a royal concubine and the dishonour of his sister who succeeded to her place The public administration had been abandoned to the Caesar Bardas the brother and enemy of Theodora but the arts of female influ ence persuaded Michael to hate and to fear his uncle he was drawn from Constantinople under the pretext of a Cretan expedition and stabbed in the tent of audience by the sword of the chamberlain and in the presence of the emperor About a month after this execution Basil was invested with the title of Augustus and the govern ment of the empire He supported this unequal assor CHAP XLVIII 127 elation till his influence was fortified by popular esteem His life was endangered by the caprice of the emperor and his dignity was profaned by a second colleague who had rowed in the galleys Yet the murder of his benefac tor must be condemned as an act of ingratitude and trea son and the churches which he dedicated to the name of St Michael were a poor and puerile expiation of his guilt The different ages of Basil I may be compared with those of Augustus The situation of the Greek did not allow him in his earliest youth to lead an army against his country or to proscribe the noblest of her sons but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave he dissembled his ambition and even his virtues and grasped with the bloody hand of an assassin the empire which he ruled with the wisdom and tenderness of a parent A private citizen may feel his interest repugnant to his duty but it must be from a deficiency of sense or cou rage that an absolute monarch can separate his happi ness from his glory or his glory from the public welfare The life or panegyric of Basil has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of his descendants but even their stability on the throne may be justly as cribed to the superior merit of their ancestor In his character his grandson Constantine has attempted to delineate a perfect image of royalty but that feeble prince unless he had copied a real model could not easily have soared so high above the level of his own conduct or conceptions But the most solid praise of Basil is drawn from the comparison of a ruined and a flourishing monarchy that which he wrested from the dissolute Michael and that which he bequeathed to the Macedonian dynasty The evils which had been sanc tified by time and example were corrected by his master hand and he revived if not the national spirit at least the order and majesty of the Roman empire His appli cation was indefatigable his temper cool his understand ing vigorous and decisive and in his practice he ob 128 ROMAN EMPIRE served that rare and salutary moderation which pursues each virtue at an equal distance between the opposite vices His military service had been confined to the palace nor was the emperor endowed with the spirit or the talents of a warrior Yet under his reign the Roman arms were again formidable to the barbarians As soon as he had formed a new army by discipline and exercise he appeared in person on the banks of the Eu phrates curbed the pride of the Saracens and suppressed the dangerous though just revolt of the Manichaeans His indignation against a rebel who had long eluded his pursuit provoked him to wish and to pray that by the grace of God he might drive three arrows into the head of Chrysochir That odious head which had been ob tained by treason rather than by valour was suspended from a tree and thrice exposed to the dexterity of the imperial archer a base revenge against the dead more worthy of the times than of the character of Basil But his principal merit was in the civil administration of the finances and of the laws To replenish an exhausted treasury it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill placed gifts of his predecessor his prudence abated one moiety of the restitution and a sum of 1 200 000 was instantly procured to answer the most pressing de mands and to allow some space for the mature opera tions of economy Among the various schemes for the improvement of the revenue a new mode was suggested of capitation or tribute which would have too much depended on the arbitrary discretion of the assessors A sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly produced by the minister but on the more careful scrutiny of Basil himself only two could be found who might be safely intrusted with such dangerous powers and they justified his esteem by declining his confidence But the serious and successful diligence of the emperor established by degrees an equitable balance of property and payment of receipt and expenditure a peculiar CHAP XLVIII 129 fund was appropriated to each service and a public method secured the interest of the prince and the pro perty of the people After reforming the luxury he as signed two patrimonial estates to supply the decent plenty of the imperial table the contributions of the subject were reserved for his defence and the residue was employed in the embellishment of the capital and provinces A taste for building however costly may deserve some praise and much excuse from thence in dustry is fed art is encouraged and some object is at tained of public emolument or pleasure the use of a road an aqueduct or an hospital is obvious and solid and the hundred churches that arose by the command of Basil were consecrated to the devotion of the age In the character of a judge he was assiduous and impar tial desirous to save but not afraid to strike the op pressors of the people were severely chastised but his personal foes whom it might be unsafe to pardon were condemned after the loss of their eyes to a life of so litude and repentance The change of language and manners demanded a revision of the obsolete jurispru dence of Justinian the voluminous body of his insti tutes pandects code and novels was digested under forty titles in the Greek idiom and the Basilics which were improved and completed by his son and grandson must be referred to the original genius of the founder of their race This glorious reign was terminated by an accident in the chase A furious stag entangled his horns in the belt of Basil and raised him from his horse he was rescued by an attendant who cut the belt and slew the animal but the fall or the fever exhausted the strength of the aged monarch and he expired in the palace amidst the tears of his family and people If he struck off the head of the faithful servant for presuming to draw his sword against his sovereign the pride of despotism which had lain dormant in his life revived in VOL VI K 130 ROMAN EMPIRE the last moments of despair when he no longer wanted or valued the opinion of mankind Of the four sons of the emperor Constantine died before his father whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering impostor and a vain apparition Stephen the youngest was content with the  honours of a patriarch and a saint both Leo March i and Alexander were alike invested with the pur ple but the powers of government were solely exercised by the elder brother The name of Leo VI has been dignified with the title of philosopher and the union of the prince and the sage of the active and speculative virtues would indeed constitute the perfection of human nature But the claims of Leo are far short of this ideal excellence Did he reduce his passions and appetites under the dominion of reason His life was spent in the pomp of the palace in the society of his wives and concubines and even the clemency which he shewed and the peace which he strove to preserve must be im puted to the softness and indolence of his character Did he subdue his prejudices and those of his subjects His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition the influence of the clergy and the errors of the people were consecrated by his laws and the oracles of Leo which reveal in prophetic style the fates of the empire are founded on the arts of astrology and divination If we still inquire the reason of his sage appellation it can only be replied that the son of Basil was less igno rant than the greater part of his contemporaries in church and state that his education had been directed by the learned Photius and that several books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the pen or in the name of the imperial philosopher But the reputa tion of his philosophy and religion was overthrown by a domestic vice the repetition of his nuptials The primitive ideas of the merit and holiness of celibacy CHAP XLVHI 131 were preached by the monks and entertained by the Greeks Marriage was allowed as a necessary means for the propagation of mankind after the death of ei ther party the survivor might satisfy by a second union the weakness or the strength of the flesh but a third marriage was censured as a state of legal fornication and a fourth was a sin or scandal yet unknown to the Christians of the east In the beginning of his reign Leo himself had abolished the state of concubines and condemned without annulling third marriages but his patriotism and love soon compelled him to violate his own laws and to incur the penance which in a similar case he had imposed on his subjects In his three first alliances his nuptial bed was unfruitful the emperor required a female companion and the empire a legiti mate heir The beautiful Zoe was introduced into the palace as a concubine  and after a trial of her fecundity and the birth of Constantine her lover declared his in tention of legitimating the mother and the child by the celebration of his fourth nuptials But the patriarch Nicholas refused his blessing the imperial baptism of the young prince was obtained by a promise of separa tion and the contumacious husband of Zoe was ex cluded from the communion of the faithful Neither the fear of exile or the desertion of his brethren nor the authority of the Latin church nor the danger of failure or doubt in the succession to the empire could bend the spirit of the inflexible monk After the death of Leo he was recalled from exile to the civil and ecclesi astical administration and the edict of union which â was promulgated in the name of Constantine condemn ed the future scandal of fourth marriages and left a tacit imputation on his own birth In the Greek language purple and porphyry H are the same word and as the colours of nature Ftob o are invariable we may learn that a dark deep red was tne Tyrian dye which stained the purple of K 2 132 ROMAN EMPIRE A D 9ii the ancients An apartment of the Byzantine May11 palace was lined with porphyry it was reserved for the use of the pregnant empresses and the royal birth of their children was expressed by the appel lation of porphyrogenite or born in the purple Several of the Roman princes had been blessed with an heir but this peculiar surname was first applied to Constan tine VII His life and titular reign were of equal dura tion but of fifty four years six had elapsed before his father s death and the son of Leo was ever the volun tary or reluctant subject of those who oppressed his weakness or abused his confidence His uncle Alex ander who had long been invested with the title of Augustus was the first colleague and governor of the young prince but in a rapid career of vice and folly the brother of Leo already emulated the reputation of Michael and when he was extinguished by a timely death he entertained a project of castrating his nephew and leaving the empire to a worthless favourite The succeeding years of the minority of Constantine were occupied by his mother Zoe and a succession of coun cil of seven regents who pursued their interest gratified their passions abandoned the republic supplanted each other and finally vanished in the presence of a soldier From an obscure origin Romanus Lecapenus had raised himself to the command of the naval armies and in the anarchy of the times had deserved or at least had ob tained the national esteem With a victorious and af fectionate fleet he sailed from the mouth of the Danube into the harbour of Constantinople and was hailed as the deliverer of the people and the guardian of the prince His supreme office was at first defined by Romanusi the new appellation of father of the emperor A ixlug but Romanus soon disdained the subordinate Dec 24 powers of a minister and assumed with the titles of Caesar and Augustus the full independence of royalty which he held near five and twenty years CHAP XLVIII 133 His three sons Christopher Stephen and Con pher ste stantine were successively adorned with the phen Con  same honours and the lawful emperor was de graded from the first to the fifth rank in this col lege of princes Yet in the preservation of his life and crown he might still applaud his own fortune and the clemency of the usurper The examples of ancient and modern history would have excused the ambition of Romanus the powers and the laws of the empire were in his hand the spurious birth of Constantine would have justified his exclusion and the grave or the monastery was open to receive the son of the con cubine But Lecapenus does not appear to have pos sessed either the virtues or the vices of a tyrant The spirit and activity of his private life dissolved away in the sunshine of the throne and in his licentious plea sures he forgot the safety both of the republic and of his family Of a mild and religious character he re spected the sanctity of oaths the innocence of the youth the memory of his parents and the attachment of the people The studious temper and retirement of Con stantine disarmed the jealousy of power his books and music his pen and his pencil were a constant source of amusement and if he could improve a scanty allow ance by the sale of his pictures if their price was not enhanced by the name of the artist he was endowed with a personal talent which few princes could employ in the hour of adversity Constan The fall of Romanus was occasioned by his A0D 945 own vices and those of his children After the Jan 27 decease of Christopher his eldest son the two surviving brothers quarrelled with each other and con spired against their father At the hour of noon when all strangers were regularly excluded from the palace they entered his apartment with an armed force and conveyed him in the habit of a monk to a small island in the Propontis which was peopled by a religious com 134 ROMAN EMPIRE munity The rumour of this domestic revolution ex cited a tumult in the city but Porphyrogenitus alone the true and lawful emperor was the object of the pub lic care and the sons of Lecapenus were taught by tardy experience that they had achieved a guilty and perilous enterprise for the benefit of their rival Their sister Helena the wife of Constantine revealed or sup posed their treacherous design of assassinating her hus band at the royal banquet His royal adherents were alarmed and the two usurpers were prevented seized degraded from the purple and embarked for the same island and monastery where their father had been so lately confined Old Romanus met them on the beach with a sarcastic smile and after a just reproach of their folly and ingratitude presented his imperial colleagues with an equal share of his water and vegetable diet In the fortieth year of his reign Constantine VII ob tained the possession of the eastern world which he ruled or seemed to rule near fifteen years But he was devoid of that energy of character which could emerge into a life of action and glory and the studies which had amused and dignified his leisure were in compatible with the serious duties of a sovereign The emperor neglected the practice to instruct his son Ro manus in the theory of government while he indulged the habits of intemperance and sloth he dropped the reins of the administration into the hands of Helena his wife and in the shifting scene of her favour and caprice each minister was regretted in the promotion of a more worthless successor Yet the birth and mis fortunes of Constantine had endeared him to the Greeks they excused his failings they respected his learning his innocence and charity his love of justice and the ceremony of his funeral was mourned with the unfeign ed tears of his subjects The body according to an cient custom lay in state in the vestibule of the palace and the civil and military officers the patricians the CHAP XLVIII 135 senate and the clergy approached in due order to adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their sovereign Before the procession moved towards the imperial se pulchre a herald proclaimed this awful admonition â Arise O king of the world and obey the summons of the King of kings Romanâ The death of Constantine was imputed to A 0 959 poison and his son Romanus who derived NoV is that name from his maternal grandfather ascended the throne of Constantinople A prince who at the age of twenty could be suspected of anti cipating his inheritance must have been already lost in the public esteem yet Romanus was rather weak than wicked and the largest share of the guilt was trans ferred to his wife Theophano a woman of base origin masculine spirit and flagitious manners The sense of personal glory and public happiness the true pleasures of royalty were unknown to the son of Constantine and while the two brothers Nicephorus and Leo tri umphed over the Saracens the hours which the empe ror owed to his people were consumed in strenuous idleness In the morning he visited the circus at noon he feasted the senators the greater part of the afternoon he spent in the sphceristerium or tennis court the only theatre of his victories from thence he passed over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus hunted and killed four wild boars of the largest size and returned to the palace proudly content with the labours of the day In strength and beauty he was conspicuous above his equals tall and straight as a young cypress his complexion was fair and florid his eyes sparkling his shoulders broad his nose long and aquiline Yet even these perfections were insufficient to fix the love of Theophano and after a reign of four years she mingled for her husband the same deadly draught which she had composed for his father  136 ROMAN EMPIRE Ni ho By his marriage with this impious woman nÂ it Romanus the younger left two sons Basil II A D 963 and Constantine IX and two daughters Theo ugust o phano anti Anne The eldest sister was given to Otho II emperor of the west the younger became the wife of Wolodomir great duke and apostle of Russia and by the marriage of her grand daughter with Henry I king of France the blood of the Macedonians and perhaps of the Arsacides still flows in the veins of the Bourbon line After the death of her husband the empress aspired to reign in the name of her sons the elder of whom was five and the younger only two years of age but she soon felt the instability of a throne which was supported by a female who could not be esteemed and two infants who could not be feared Theophano looked around for a protector and threw herself into the arms of the bravest soldier her heart was capricious but the deformity of the new fa vourite rendered it more than probable that interest was the motive and excuse of her love Nicephorus Phocas united in the popular opinion the double merit of a hero and a saint In the former character his qualifications were genuine and splendid the de scendant of a race illustrious by their military exploits he had displayed in every station and in every pro vince the courage of a soldier and the conduct of a chief and Nicephorus was crowned with recent lau rels from the important conquest of the isle of Crete His religion was of a more ambiguous cast and his hair cloth his fasts his pious idiom and his wish to retire from the business of the world were a conveni ent mask for his dark and dangerous ambition Yet he imposed on a holy patriarch by whose influence and by a decree of the senate he was intrusted during the minority of the young princes with the absolute and independent command of the oriental armies As soon CHAP XL VIII 137 as he had secured the leaders and the troops he boldly marched to Constantinople trampled on his enemies avowed his correspondence with the empress and without degrading her sons assumed with the title of Augustus the pre eminence of rank and the plenitude of power But his marriage with Theophano was re fused by the same patriarch who had placed the crown on his head by his second nuptials he incurred a year of canonical penance a bar of spiritual affinity was opposed to their celebration and some evasion and perjury were required to silence the scruples of the clergy and people The popularity of the emperor was lost in the purple in a reign of six years he pro voked the hatred of strangers and subjects and the hypocrisy and avarice of the first Nicephorus were re vived in his successor Hypocrisy I shall never justify or palliate but I will dare to observe that the odious vice of avarice is of all others most hastily arraigned and most unmercifully condemned In a private citi zen our judgment seldom expects an accurate scrutiny into his fortune and expense and in a steward of the public treasure frugality is always a virtue and the increase of taxes too often an indispensable duty In the use of his patrimony the generous temper of Ni cephorus had been proved and the revenue was strictly applied to the service of the state each spring the emperor marched in person against the Saracens and every Roman might compute the employment of his taxes in triumphs conquests and the security of the eastern barrier Among the warriors who promoted his ele vat on an l served under his standard a noble Constan and valiant Armenian had deserved and obtained tine IX i_  i rm f A D 969 the most eminent rewards The stature of Dec 20 John Zimisces was below the ordinary standard but this diminutive body was endowed with strength beauty and the soul of a hero By the jealousy of the 138 ROMAN EMPIRE emperor s brother he was degraded from the office of general of the east to that of director of the posts and his murmurs were chastised with disgrace and exile But Zimisces was ranked among the numerous lovers of the empress on her intercession he was permitted to reside at Chalcedon in the neighbourhood of the capi tal her bounty was repaid in his clandestine and amorous visits to the palace and Theophano consented with alacrity to the death of an ugly and penurious husband Some bold and trusty conspirators were concealed in her most private chambers in the dark ness of a winter night Zimisces with his principal companions embarked in a small boat traversed the Bosphorus landed at the palace stairs and silently ascended a ladder of ropes which was cast down by the female attendants Neither his own suspicions nor the warnings of his friends nor the tardy aid of his brother Leo nor the fortress which he had erected in the pa lace could protect Nicephorus from a domestic foe at whose voice every door was opened to the assassins As he slept on a bear skin on the ground he was roused by their noisy intrusion and thirty daggers glittered before his eyes It is doubtful whether Zi misces imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign but he enjoyed the inhuman spectacle of revenge The murder was protracted by insult and cruelty and as soon as the head of Nicephorus was shewn from the window the tumult was hushed and the Armenian was emperor of the east On the day of his coronation he was stopped on the threshold of St Sophia by the intrepid patriarch who charged his conscience with the deed of treason and blood and required as a sign of repentance that he should separate himself from his more criminal associate This sally of apostolic zeal was not offensive to the prince since he could neither love nor trust a woman who had repeatedly violated the most sacred obligations and Theophano instead of CHAP XLVIII 13d sharing his imperial fortune was dismissed with igno miny from his bed and palace In their last interview she displayed a frantic and impotent rage accused the ingratitude of her lover assaulted with words and blows her son Basil as he stood silent and submissive in the presence of a superior colleague and avowed her own prostitution in proclaiming the illegitimacy of his birth The public indignation was appeased by her exile and the punishment of the meaner accom plices the death of an unpopular prince was forgiven and the guilt of Zimisces was forgotten in the splen dour of his virtues Perhaps his profusion was less useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus but his gentle and generous behaviour delighted all who approached his person and it was only in the paths of victory that he trode in the footsteps of his predecessor The greatest part of his reign was employed in the camp and the field his personal valour and activity were signalized on the Danube and the Tigris the an cient boundaries of the Roman world and by his double triumph over the Russians and the Saracens he deserved the titles of saviour of the empire and conqueror of the east In his last return from Syria he observed that the most fruitful lands of his new pro vinces were possessed by the eunuchs And is it for them he exclaimed with honest indignation that we have fought and conquered Is it for them that we shed our blood and exhaust the treasures of our people The complaint was re echoed to the palace and the death of Zimisces is strongly marked with the suspicion of poison Basil ii Under this usurpation or regency of twelve Mantin years the two lawful emperors Basil and Con 976 Aj stantme had silently grown to the age of man 10 hood Their tender years had been incapable of dominion the respectful modesty of their attendance and salutation was due to the age and merit of their 140 ROMAN EMPIRE guardians the childless ambition of those guardians had no temptation to violate their right of succession their patrimony was ably and faithfully administered and the premature death of Zimiscea was a loss rather than a benefit to the sons of Romanus Their want of experience detained them twelve years longer the ob scure and voluntary pupils of a minister who extended his reign by persuading them to indulge the pleasures of youth and to disdain the labours of government In this silken web the weakness of Constantine was for ever entangled but his elder brother felt the im pulse of genius and the desire of action he frowned and the minister was no more Basil was the acknow ledged sovereign of Constantinople and the provinces of Europe but Asia was oppressed by two veteran generals Phocas and Sclerus who alternately friends and enemies subjects and rebels maintained their inde pendence and laboured to emulate the example of suc cessful usurpation Against these domestic enemies the son of Romanus first drew his sword and they trembled in the presence of a lawful and high spirited prince The first in the front of battle was thrown from his horse by the stroke of poison or an arrow the second who had been twice loaded with chains and twice in vested with the purple was desirous of ending in peace the small remainder of his days As the aged sup pliant approached the throne with dim eyes and faulter ing steps leaning on his two attendants the emperor exclaimed in the insolence of youth and power â And is this the man who has so long been the object of our ter ror After he had confirmed his own authority and the peace of the empire the trophies of Nicephorus and Zimisces would not suffer their royal pupil to sleep in the palace His long and frequent expeditions against the Saracens were rather glorious than useful to the empire but the final destruction of the kingdom of Bulgaria appears since the time of Belisarius the CHAP XLVI1I 141 most important triumph of the Roman arms Yet in stead of applauding their victorious prince his subjects detested the rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil and in the imperfect narrative of his exploits we can only discern the courage patience and ferociousness of a soldier A vicious education which could not subdue his spirit had clouded his mind he was ignorant of every science and the remembrance of his learned and feeble grandsire might encourage a real or affected con tempt of laws and lawyers of artists and arts Of such a character in such an age superstition took a firm and lasting possession after the first licence of his youth Basil II devoted his life in the palace and the camp to the penance of a hermit wore the monastic habit under his robes and armour observed a vow of continence and imposed on his appetites a perpetual abstinence from wine and flesh In the sixty eighth year of his age his martial spirit urged him to embark in person for a holy war against the Saracens of Sicily he was prevented by death and Basil surnamed the slayer of the Bulgarians was dismissed from the world with the blessings of the clergy and the curses of the Constan people After his decease his brother Constan jÂ TV AnD 1025 tine enjoyed about three years the power or December rather the pleasures of royalty and his only care was the settlement of his succession He had en joyed sixty six years the title of Augustus and the reign of the two brothers is the longest and most ob scure of the Byzantine history Komanus  lineal succession of five emperors in a pe 1L riod of one hundred and sixty years had attach A D loss ed the loyalty of the Greeks to the Macedonian dynasty which had been thrice respected by the usurpers of their power After the death of Constan tine IX the last male of the royal race a new and broken scene presents itself and the accumulated years of twelve emperors do not equal the space of his single 142 ROMAN EMPIRE reign His elder brother had preferred his private chas tity to the public interest and Constantine himself had only three daughters Eudocia who took the veil and Zoe and Theodora who were preserved till a mature age in a state of ignorance and virginity When their marriage was discussed in the council of their dying father the cold or pious Theodora refused to give a heir to the empire but her sister Zoe presented herself a willing victim at the altar Romanus Argyrus a pa trician of a graceful person and fair reputation was chosen for her husband and on his declining that honour was informed that blindness or death was the second alternative The motive of his reluctance was conjugal affection but his faithful wife sacrificed her own happiness to his safety and greatness and her entrance into a monastery removed the only bar to the imperial nuptials After the decease of Constantine the sceptre devolved to Romanus III but his labours at home and abroad were equally feeble and fruitless and the mature age the forty eight years of Zoe were less favourable to the hopes of pregnancy than to the indulgence of pleasure Her favourite chamberlain was a handsome Paphlagonian of the name of Michael whose first trade had been that of a money changer and Romanus either from gratitude or equity connired at their criminal intercourse or accepted a slight assu rance of their innocence But Zoe soon justified the Roman maxim that every adulteress is capable of poi soning her husband and the death of Romanus was in stantly followed by the scandalous marriage and eleva tion of Michael IV The expectations of Zoe o were however disappointed instead of a vi  A D gOrous and grateful lover she had placed in her ra 11 bed a miserable wretch whose health and rea son were impaired by epileptic fits and whose con science was tormented by despair and remorse The most skilful physicians of the mind and body were CHAP XLV1lI 143 summoned to his aid and his hopes were amused by frequent pilgrimages to the baths and to the tombs of the most popular saints the monks applauded his pe nance and except restitution but to whom should he have restored Michael sought every method of expi ating his guilt While he groaned and prayed in sack cloth and ashes his brother the eunuch John smiled at his remorse and enjoyed the harvest of a crime of which himself was the secret and most guilty author His administration was only the art of satiating his avarice and Zoe became a captive in the palace of her fathers and in the hands of her slaves When he per ceived the irretrievable decline of his brother s health he introduced his nephew another Michael who derived his surname of Calaphates from his father s occupation in the careening of vessels at the command of the eu nuch Zoe adopted for her son the son of a mechanic and this fictitious heir was invested with the title and purple of the Caesars in the presence of the senate and clergy So feeble was the character of Zoe that she was oppressed by the liberty and power which she re covered by the death of the Paphlagonian and at the end of four days she placed the crown on the head of Michael v Michael V who had protested with tears and oiia oaths that he should ever reign the first and A D 1041 most obedient of her subjects The only act of his short reign was his base ingratitude to his benefactors the eunuch and the empress The dis grace of the former was pleasing to the public but the murmurs and at length the clamours of Constantinople deplored the exile of Zoe the daughter of so many em perors her vices were forgotten and Michael was taught that there is a period in which the patience of the tamest slaves rises into fury and revenge The citi zens of every degree assembled in a formidable tumuk which lasted three days they besieged the palace 144 ROMAN EMPIRE Zoe and forced the gates recalled their mothers Zoe from A D 1042 her prison Theodora from her monastery and April 21 condemned the son of Calaphates to the loss of his eyes or of his life For the first time the Greeks beheld with surprise the two royal sisters seated on the same throne presiding in the senate and giving au dience to the ambassadors of the nations But this singular union subsisted no more than two months the two sovereigns their tempers interests and adherents were secretly hostile to each other and as Theodora was still adverse to marriage the indefatigable Zoe at the age of sixty consented for the public good to sus tain the embraces of a third husband and the censures of the Greek church His name and number were Constan Constantine X and the epithet of Monomachus Sonoma the single combatant must have been expressive ch is of his valour and victory in some public or pri A D io4z vate quarrel But his health was broken by the tortures of the gout and his dissolute reign was spent in the alternative of sickness and pleasure A fair and noble widow had accompanied Constantine in his exile to the isle of Lesbos and Sclerena gloried in the appellation of his mistress After his marriage and elevation she was invested with the title and pomp of Augusta and occupied a contiguous apartment in the palace The lawful consort such was the delicacy or corruption of Zoe consented to this strange and scan dalous partition and the emperor appeared in public between his wife and his concubine He survived them both but the last measures of Ccnstantine to change the order of succession were prevented by the more vi Theodoia g lant friends of Theodora and after his de A D 1054 cease she resumed with the general consent the possession of her inheritance In her name and by the influence of four eunuchs the eastern world was peaceably governed about nineteen months and as they CHAP XLVIII 145 wished to prolong their dominion they persuaded the aged princess to nominate for her successor Michael VI Michael vi Tne surname of Stratioticus declares his mili Stratio taiy profession but the crazy and decrepit ve A D io56 teran could only see with the eyes and exe ueust cute with the hands of his ministers Whilst he ascended the throne Theodora sunk into the grave the last of the Macedonian or Basilian dynasty I have hastily reviewed and gladly dismiss this shameful and destructive period of Jwenty eight years in which the Greeks degraded below the common level of servitude were transferred like a herd of cattle by the choice or caprice of two impotent females Isaac i From this night of slavery a ray of freedom A D io57 or at least of spirit begins to emerge the August si Greeks either preserved or revived the use of surnames which perpetuate the fame of hereditary vir tue and we now discern the rise succession and al liance of the last dynasties of Constantinople and Tre bizond The Comneni who upheld for awhile the fate of the sinking empire assumed the honour of a Roman origin but the family had been long since transported from Italy to Asia Their patrimonial estate was situate in the district of Castamona in the neighbourhood of the Euxine and one of their chiefs who had already entered the paths of ambition revisited with affection perhaps with regret the modest though honourable dwelling of his fathers The first of their line was the illustrious Manuel who in the reign of the second Basil contributed by war and treaty to appease the troubles of the east he left in a tender age two sons Isaac and John whom with the consciousness of desert he bequeathed to the gratitude and favour of his so vereign The noble youths were carefully trained in the learning of the monastery the arts of the palace and the exercises of the camp and from the domestic service of the guards they were rapidly promoted to the VOL VI L 146 ROMAN EMPIRE command of provinces and armies Their fraternal union doubled the force and reputation of the Comneni and their ancient nobility was illustrated by the mar riage of the two brothers with a captive princess of Bul garia and the daughter of a patrician wh9 had obtained the name of Charon from the number of enemies whom he had sent to the infernal shades The soldiers had served with reluctant loyalty a series of effeminate mas ters the elevation of Michael VI was a personal insult to the more deserving generals and their discontent was inflamed by the parsimony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs They secretly assembled in the sanctuary of St Sophia and the votes of the military synod would have been unanimous in favour of the old and valiant Catacalon if the patriotism or modesty of the veteran had not suggested the importance of birth as well as merit in the choice of a sovereign Isaac Comnenus was approved by general consent and the associates separated without delay to meet in the plains of Phrygia at the head of their respective squadrons and detachments The cause of Michael was defended in a single battle by the mercenaries of the imperial guard who were aliens to the public interest and animated only by a principle of honour and gratitude After their defeat the fears of the emperor solicited a treaty which was almost accepted by the moderation of the Comne nian But the former was betrayed by his ambassadors and the latter was prevented by his friends The soli tary Michael submitted to the voice of the people the patriarch annulled their oath of allegiance and as he shaved the head of the royal monk congratulated his beneficial exchange of temporal royalty for the kingdom of heaven an exchange however which the priest on his own account would probably have declined By the hands of the same patriarch Isaac Comnenus was solemnly crowned the sword which he inscribed on his corns might be an offensive symbol if it implied his CHAP XLVIII 147 tide by conquest but this sword would have been drawn against the foreign and domestic enemies of the state The decline of his health and vigour suspended the operation of active virtue and the prospect of ap proaching death determined him to interpose some mo ments betweentife and eternity But instead of leaving the empire as the marriage portion of his daughter his reason and inclination concurred in the preference of his brother John a soldier a patriot and the father of five sons the future pillars of an hereditary succession His first modest reluctance might be the natural dictates of discretion and tenderness but his obstinate and success ful perseverance however it may dazzle with the show of virtue must be censured as a criminal desertion of his duty and a rare offence against his family and country The purple which he had refused was accepted by Con stantine Ducas a friend of the Comnenian house and whose noble birth was adorned with the experience and reputation of civil policy In the monastic habit Isaac recovered his health and survived two years his volun tary abdication At the command of his abbot he ob served the rule of St Basil and executed the most ser vile offices of the convent but his latent vanity was gratified by the frequent and respectful visits of the reigning monarch who revered in his person the cha racter of a benefactor and a saint  If Constantino XI were indeed the subject tine XL most worthy of empire we must pity the debase A Djiosg ment of the age and nation in which he was Dec 2 7 chosen In the labour of puerile declamations he sought without obtaining the crown of eloquence more precious in his opinion than that of Rome and in the subordinate functions of a judge he forgot the duties of a sovereign and a warrior Far from imitating the patriotic indifference of the authors of his greatness Ducas was anxious only to secure at the expense of the republic the power and prosperity of his children L2 148 ROMAN EMPIRE His three sons Michael VII Andronicus I and Con stantine XII were invested in a tender age with the equal title of Augustus and the succession was speed ily opened by their father s death His widow A D io67 Eudocia was intrusted with the administration 7 but experience had taught the jealousy of the dying monarch to protect his sons from the danger of her second nuptials and her solemn engagement at tested by the principal senators was deposited in the hands of the patriarch Before the end of seven months the wants of Eudocia or those of the state called aloud for the male virtues of a soldier and her heart had already chosen Romanus Diogenes whom she raised from the scaffold to the throne The dis covery of a treasonable attempt had exposed him to the severity of the laws his beauty and valour absolved him in the eyes of the empress and Romanus from a mild exile was recalled on the second day to the com mand of the oriental armies Her royal choice was yet unknown to the public and the promise which would have betrayed her falsehood and levity was stolen by a dexterous emissary from the ambition of the patriarch Xiphilin at first alleged the sanctity of oaths and the sacred nature of a trust but a whisper that his brother was the future emperor relaxed his scruples and forced him to confess that the public safety was the supreme law He resigned the important paper and when his hopes were confounded by the nomination of Romanus he could no longer regain his security retract his de clarations nor oppose the second nuptials of the em press Yet a murmur was heard in the palace and Roma the barbarian guards had raised their battle nus in axes in the cause Of the house of Ducas till Diogenes A D 1067 the young princes were soothed by the tears of their mother and the solemn assurances of the fidelity of their guardian who filled the imperial sta tion with dignity and honour Hereafter I shall relate CHAP XLVIII 140 his valiant but unsuccessful efforts to resist the progress of the Turks His defeat and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on the Byzantine monarchy of the east and after he was released from the chains of the sultan he vainly sought his wife and his subjects His wife had been thrust into a monastery and the subjects of Roma nus had embraced the rigid maxim of the civil law that a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived as by the stroke of death of all the public and private rights Michael o a citizen In the general consternation the yn Para Csesar John asserted the indefeasible right of pinnces Â Androni his three nephews Constantinople listened to staLtineÂ n his voice and the Turkish captive was pro XIL claimed in the capital and received on the A D ion frontier as an enemy of the republic Romanus August was not more fortunate in domestic than in foreign war the loss of two battles compelled him to yield on the assurance of fair and honorable treatment but his enemies were devoid of faith or humanity and after the cruel extinction of his sight his wounds were left to bleed and corrupt till in a few daysjie was re lieved from a state of misery Under the triple reign of the house of Ducas the two younger brothers were reduced to the vain honours of the purple but the eldest the pusillanimous Michael was incapable of sustaining the Roman sceptre and his surname of Pa rapinaces denotes the reproach which he shared with an avaricious favourite who enhanced the price and di minished the measure of wheat In the school of Psel lus and after the example of his mother the son of Eudocia made some proficiency in philosophy and rhetoric but his character was degraded rather than ennobled by the virtues of a monk and the learning of a sophist Strong in the contempt of their sovereign and their own esteem two generals at the head of the European and Asiatic legions assumed the purple at Adrianople and Nice Their revolt was in the same month they bore the same name of Nicephorus but 150 ROMAN EMPIRE the two candidates were distinguished by the surnames of Bryennius and Botaniates the former in the matu rity of wisdojn and courage the latter conspicuous only by the memory of his past exploits While Botaniates advanced with cautious and dilatory steps his active competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constan tinople The name of Bryennius was illustrious his cause was popular but his licentious troops could not be restrained from burning and pillaging a suburb and the people who would have hailed the rebel rejected and repulsed the incendiary of his country This change of the public opinion was favourable to Botaniates who at length with an army of Turks approached the shores ofChalcedon A formal invitation in the name of the patriarch the synod and the senate was circulated through the streets of Constantinople and the general assembly in the dome of St Sophia debated with order and calmness on the choice of their sovereign The guards of Michael would have dispersed this un armed multitude but the feeble emperor applauding his own moderation and clemency resigned the ensigns of royalty and was rewarded with the monastic habit and the title of archbishop of Ephesus He left a son a Constantine born and educated in the purple and a daughter of the house of Ducas illustrated the blood and confirmed the succession of the Comnenian dy nasty John Comnenus the brother of the emperor Isaac survived in peace and dignity his gene D rous refusal of the sceptre By his wife Anne a woman of masculine spirit and policy he left eight children the three daughters multi plied the Comnenian alliances with the noblest of the Greeks of the five sons Manuel was stopped by a premature death Isaac and Alexius restored the impe rial greatness of their house which was enjoyed without toil or danger by the two younger brethren Adrian and Nicephorus Alexius the third and most illustrious of CHAP XLVIII 151 the brothers was endowed by nature with the choicest gifts both of mind and body they were cultivated by a liberal education and exercised in the school of obedi ence and adversity The youth was dismissed from the perils of the Turkish war by the paternal care of the emperor Romanus but the mother of the Comneni with her aspiring race was accused of treason and ba nished by the sons of Ducas to an island in the Pro pontis The two brothers soon emerged into favour and action fought by each other s side against the rebels and barbarians and adhered to the emperor Michael till he was deserted by the world and by himself In his first interview with Botaniates Prince said Alexius with a noble frankness my duty rendered me your enemy the decrees of God and of the people have made me your subject Judge of my future loyalty by my past opposition The successor of Michael entertained him with esteem and confidence his valour was employed against three rebels who disturbed the peace of the em peror or at least of the emperors Ursel Bryennius and Basilacius were formidable by their numerous forces and military fame they were successively vanquished in the field arid led in chains to the foot of the throne and whatever treatment they might receive from a timid and cruel court they applauded the clemency as well as the courage of their conqueror But the loyalty of the Comneni was soon tainted by fear and suspicion nor is it easy to settle between a subject and a despot the debt of gratitude which the former is tempted to claim by a revolt and the latter to discharge by an executioner The refusal of Alexius to march against a fourth rebel the husband of his sister destroyed the merit or memory of his past services the favourites of Botaniates pro voked the ambition which they apprehended and accused and the retreat of the two brothers might be justified by the defence of their life or liberty The women of the family were deposited in a sanctuary respected by ty J52 ROMAN EMPIRE rants the men mounted on horseback sallied from the city and erected the standard of civil war The soldiers who had been gradually assembled in the ca pital and the neighbourhood were devoted to the cause of a victorious and injured leader the ties of common interest and domestic alliance secured the attachment of the house of Ducas and the generous dispute of the Comneni was terminated by the decisive resolution of Isaac who was the first to invest his younger brother with the name and ensigns of royalty They returned to Constantinople to threaten rather than besiege that impregnable fortress but the fidelity of the guards was corrupted a gate was surprised and the fleet was oc cupied by the active courage of George Palaeologus who fought against his father without foreseeing that he la boured for his posterity Alexius ascended the throne and his aged competitor disappeared in a monastery An army of various nations was gratified with the pillage of the city but the public disorders were expiated by the tears and fasts of the Comneni who submitted to every penance compatible with the possession of the empire The life of the emperor Alexius has been Comoenus delineated by a favourite daughter who was Â 81 inspired by a tender regard for his person and a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues Con scious of the just suspicion of her readers the prin cess Anna Comnena repeatedly protests that besides her personal knowledge she had searched the dis course and writings of the most respectable veterans that after an interval of thirty years forgotten by and forgetful of the world her mournful solitude was inac cessible to hope and fear and that truth the naked per fect truth was more dear and sacred than the memory of her parent Yet instead of the simplicity of style and narrative which wins our belief an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author The genuine character of Alexius CHAP XLVIII 153 is lost in a vague constellation of virtues and the per petual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jea lousy to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero We cannot however refuse her ju dicious and important remark that the disorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius and that every calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his reign by the justice of Heaven and the vices of his predecessors In the east the vic torious Turks had spread from Persia to Hellespont the reign of the Koran and the crescent the west was invaded by the adventurous valour of the Normans and in the moments of peace the Danube poured forth new swarms who had gained in the science of war what they had lost in the ferociousness of manners The sea was not less hostile than the land and while the fron tiers were assaulted by an open enemy the palace was distracted with secret treason and conspiracy On a sudden the banner of the cross was displayed by the Latins Europe was precipitated on Asia and Constan tinople had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge In the tempest Alexis steered the imperial vessel with dexterity and courage At the head of his armies he was bold in action skilful in stratagem pa tient of fatigue ready to improve his advantages and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible vigour The discipline of the camp was revived and a new generation of men and soldiers was created by the example and the precepts of their leader In his intercourse with the Latins Alexius was patient and artful his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an unknown world and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy with which he balanced the interests and passions of the champions of the first crusade In a long reign of thirty seven years he subdued and pardoned the envy of his equals the laws of public and private order were restored the arts of wealth and science were cultivated 154 ROMAN EMPIRE the limits of the empire were enlarged in Europe and Asia and the Comnenian sceptre was transmitted to his children of the third and fourth generation Yet the difficulties of the times betrayed some defects in his character and have exposed his memory to some just or ungenerous reproach The reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which his daughter so often bestows on a flying hero the weakness or prudence of his situa tion might be mistaken for a want of personal courage and his political arts are branded by the Latins with the names of deceit and dissimulation The increase of the male and female branches of his family adorned the throne and secured the succession but their princely luxury and pride offended the patricians exhausted the revenue and insulted the misery of the people Anna is a faithful witness that his happiness was destroyed and his health was broken by the cares of a public life the patience of Constantinople was fatigued by the length and severity of his reign and before Alexius expired he had lost the love and reverence of his subjects The clergy could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defence of the state but they applauded his theological learning and ardent zeal for the orthodox faith which he defended with his tongue his pen and his sword His character was degraded by the supersti tion of the Greeks and the same inconsistent principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to found a hos pital for the poor and infirm and to direct the execu tion of a heretic who was burnt alive in the square of St Sophia Even the sincerity of his moral and reli gious virtues was suspected by the persons who had passed their lives in his familiar confidence In his last hours when he was pressed by his wife Irene to alter the succession he raised his head and breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world The indignant reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb You die as you have livedâ A HYPOCRITE CHAP XLVIII 155 Jdm or I was tne w sn of Irene to supplant the eldest C 10 of her surviving sons in favour of her daugh Johanms  Â Â A D 1118 ter the princess Anna whose philosophy would Angost is not have jefose tne weigQt of a diadem But the order of male succession was asserted by the friends of their country the lawful heir drew the royal signet from the finger of his insensible or conscious father and the empire obeyed the master of the palace Anna Comnena was stimulated by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother and when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes and had endowed Bryennius with the soul of a woman The two sons of Alexius John and Isaac maintained the fraternal concord the hereditary virtue of their race and the younger bro ther was content with the title of Sebastocrator which approached the dignity without sharing the power of the emperor In the same person the claims of primo geniture and merit were fortunately united his swarthy complexion harsh features and diminutive stature had suggested the ironical surname of Calo Johannis or John the Handsome which his grateful subjects more seriously applied to the beauties of his mind After the discovery of her treason the life and fortune of Anna were justly forfeited to the laws Her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor but he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace and bestowed the rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends That respectable friend Axuch a slave of Turkish ex traction presumed to decline the gift and to intercede for the criminal his generous master applauded and imitated the virtue of his favourite and the reproach or complaint of an injured brother was the only chastise ment of the guilty princess After this example of cle mency the remainder of his reign was never disturbed by conspiracy or rebellion feared by his nobles be 156 ROMAN EMPIRE loved by his people John was never reduced to the painful necessity of punishing or even pardoning his personal enemies During his government of twenty five years the penalty of death was abolished in the Roman empire a law of mercy most delightful to the human theorist but of which the practice in a large and vicious community is seldom consistent with the public safety Severe to himself indulgent to others chaste frugal abstemious the philosophic Marcus would not have disdained the artless virtues of his successor derived from his heart and not borrowed from the schools He despised and moderated the stately mag nificence of the Byzantine court so oppressive to the people so contemptible to the eye of reason Under such a prince innocence had nothing to fear and merit had every thing to hope and without assuming the ty rannic office of a censor he introduced a gradual though visible reformation in the public and private manners of Constantinople The only defect of this accomplished character was the frailty of noble mindsâ the love of arms and military glory Yet the frequent expeditions of John the Handsome may be justified at least in their principle by the necessity of repelling the Turks from the Hellespont and the Bosphorus The sultan of Ico nium was confined to his capital the barbarians were driven to the mountains and the maritime provinces of Asia enjoyed the transient blessings of their deliverance From Constantinople to Antioch and Aleppo he repeat edly marched at the head of a victorious army and in the sieges and battles of this holy war his Latin allies were astonished by the superior spirit and prowess of a Greek As he began to indulge the ambitious hope of restoring the ancient limits of the empire as he revolved in his mind the Euphrates and the Tigris the dominion of Syria and the conquest of Jerusalem the thread of his life and of the public felicity was broken by a singular accident He hunted the wild CHAP XLVIII 157 boar in the valley of Anazarbus and had fixed his jave lin in the body of the furious animal but in the strug gle a poisoned arrow dropped from his quiver and a slight wound in his hand which produced a mortifica tion was fatal to the best and greatest of the Comne nian princes A premature death had swept away the two A aD ii43 eldest sons of John the Handsome of the two Aprils survivorS Isaac and Manuel his judgment or affection preferred the younger and the choice of their dying prince was ratified by the soldiers who had ap plauded the valour of his favourite in the Turkish war The faithful Axuch hastened to the capital secured the person of Isaac in honourable confinement and pur chased with a gift of two hundred pounds of silver the leading ecclesiastics of St Sophia who possessed a de cisive voice in the consecration of an emperor With his veteran and affectionate troops Manuel soon visit ed Constantinople his brother acquiesced in the title of Sebastocrator his subjects admired the lofty stature and martial graces of their new sovereign and listened with credulity to the flattering promise that he blended the wisdom of age with the activity and vigour of youth By the experience of his government they were taught that he emulated the spirit and shared the talents of his father whose social virtues were buried in the grave A reign of thirty seven years is filled by a per petual though various warfare against the Turks the Christians and the hordes of the wilderness beyond the Danube The arms of Manuel were exercised on mount Taurus in the plains of Hungary on the coast of Italy and Egypt and on the seas of Sicily and Greece the influence of his negotiations extended from Jerusalem to Rome and Russia and the Byzantine monarchy for awhile became an object of respect or terror to the powers of Asia and Europe Educated in the silk and purple of the east Manuel possessed 158 ROMAN EMPIRE the iron temper of a soldier which cannot easily be paralleled except in the lives of Richard I of England and of Charles XII of Sweden Such was his strength and exercise in arms that Raymond surnamed the Hercules of Antioch was incapable of wielding the lance and buckler of the Greek emperor In a famous tournament he entered the lists on a fiery courser and overturned in his first career two of the stoutest of the Italian knights The first in the charge the last in the retreat his friends and his enemies alike trembled the former for his safety and the latter for their own Af ter posting an ambuscade in a wood he rode forth in quest of some perilous adventure accompanied only by his brother and the faithful Axuch who refused to de sert their sovereign Eighteen horsemen after a short combat fled before them but the numbers of the ene my increased the march of the reinforcement was tardy and fearful and Manuel without receiving a wound cut his way through a squadron of the Turks In a battle against the Hungarians impatient of the slowness of his troops he snatched a standard from the head of the column and was the first almost alone who passed a bridge that separated him from the enemy In the same country after transporting his army beyond the Save he sent back the boats with an order under pain of death to their commander that he should leave him to conquer or die on that hostile land In thesiege of Corfu towing after him a captive galley the emperor stood aloft on the poop opposing against the volley of darts and stones a large buckler and a flowing sail nor could he have escaped inevitable death had not the Si cilian admiral enjoined his archers to respect the person of a hero In one day he is said to have slain above forty of the barbarians with his own hand he returned to the camp dragging along four Turkish prisoners whom he had tied to the rings of his saddle he was ever the foremost to provoke or to accept a single com CHAP XI VTII 159 bat and the gigantic champions who encountered his arm were transpierced by the lance or cut asunder by the sword of the invincible Manuel The story of his exploits which appear as a model or a copy of the ro mances of chivalry may induce a reasonable suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks I will not to vindicate their credit endanger my own yet I may observe that in the long series of their annals Manuel is the only prince who has been the subject of similar exaggeration With the valour of a soldier he did not unite the skill or prudence of a general his victories were not produc tive of any permanent or useful conquest and his Turk ish laurels were blasted in his last unfortunate campaign in which he lost his armies in the mountains of Pisidia and owed his deliverance to the generosity of the sultan But the most singular feature in the character of Manuel is the contrast of labour and sloth of hardiness and effeminacy In war he seemed ignorant of peace in peace he appeared incapable of war In the field he slept in the sun or in the snow tired in the longest marches the strength of his men and horses and shared with a smile the abstinence or diet of the camp No sooner did he return to Constantinople than he resign ed himself to the arts and pleasure of a life of luxury the expense of his dress his table and his palace sur passed the measure of his predecessors and whole sum mer days were idly wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis in the incestuous love of his niece Theodora The double cost of a warlike and dissolute prince ex hausted the revenue and multiplied the taxes and Manuel in the distress of his last Turkish camp endured a bitter reproach from the mouth of a desperate soldier As he quenched his thirst he complained that the water of a fountain was mingled with Christian blood It is not the first time exclaimed a voice from the crowd that you have drank 0 emperor the blood of your Christian subjects Manuel Comnenus was twice mar 160 ROMAN EMPIRE  ried to the virtuous Bertha or Irene of Germany and to the beauteous Maria a French or Latin princess of Antioch The only daughter of his first wife was des tined for Bela a Hungarian prince who was educated at Constantinople under the name of Alexius and the consummation of their nuptials might have transferred the Roman sceptre to a race of free and warlike barba rians But as soon as Maria of Antioch had given a son and heir to the empire the presumptive rights of Bela were abolished and he was deprived of his pro mised bride but the Hungarian prince resumed his name and the kingdom of his fathers and displayed such virtues as might excite the regret and envy of the Greeks The son of Maria was named Alexius and at the age of ten years he ascended the Byzantine throne after his father s decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line The fraternal concord of the two sons of the AlexiusII A i  A D 1180 great Alexius had been sometimes clouded by ter an opposition of interest and passion By am on Isaac the Sebastocrator was excited to of Andro flight and rebellion from whence he was re claimed by the firmness and clemency of John the Handsome The errors of Isaac the father of the emperors of Trebizond were short and venial but John the elder of his sons renounced for ever his religion Provoked by a real or imaginary insult of his uncle he escaped from the Roman to the Turkish camp his apostacy was rewarded with the sultan s daughter the title of Chelebi or noble and the inheritance of a princely estate and in the fifteenth century Mahomet II boasted of his imperial descent from the Comnenian family Andronicus the younger brother of John son of Isaac and grandson of Alexius Comnenus is one of the most conspicuous characters of the age and his genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance To justify the choice of three ladies CHAP XLVIII 161 of royal birth it is incumbent on me to observe that their fortunate lover was cast in the best proportions of strength and beauty and that the want of the softer graces was supplied by a manly countenance a lofty stature athletic muscles and the air and deportment of a soldier The preservation in his old age of health and vigour was the reward of temperance and exercise A piece of bread and a draught of water were often his sole and evening repast and if he tasted of a wild boar or a stag which he had roasted with his own hands it was the well earned fruit of a laborious chase Dexterous in arms he was ignorantof fear his persuasive eloquence could bend to every situation and character of life his style though not his practice was fashioned by the ex ample of St Paul and in every deed of mischief he had a heart to resolve a head to contrive and a hand to execute In his youth after the death of the emperor John he followed the retreat of the Roman army but in the march through Asia Minor design or accident tempted him to wander in the mountains the hunter was encompassed by the Turkish huntsmen and he re mained some time a reluctant or willing captive in the power of the sultan His virtues and vices recommended him to the favour of his cousin he shared the perils and the pleasures of Manuel and while the emperor lived in public incest with his niece Theodora the af fections of her sister Eudocia were seduced and enjoyed by Andronicus Above the decencies of her sex and rank she gloried in the name of his concubine and both the palace and the camp could witness that she slept or watched in the arms of her lover She accom panied him to his military command of Cilicia the first scene of his valour and imprudence He pressed with active ardour the siege of Mopsuestia the day was em ployed in the boldest attacks but the night was wasted in song and dance and a band of Greek comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue Andronicus was VOL VI M 162 ROMAN EMPIRE surprised by the sally of a vigilant foe but while his troops fled in disorder his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of the Armenians On his return to the imperial camp in Macedonia he was received by Manuel with public smiles and a private reproof but the duchies of Naissus Braniseba and Castoria were the reward or consolation of the unsuccessful general Eudocia still attended his motions at midnight their tent was suddenly attacked by her angry brothers im patient to expiate her infamy in his blood his daring spirit refused her advice and the disguise of a female habit and boldly starting from his couch he drew his sword and cut his way through the numerous assassins It was here that he first betrayed his ingratitude and treachery he engaged in a treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary and the German emperor approached the royal tent at a suspicious hour with a drawn sword and under the mask of a Latin soldier avowed an intention of revenge against a mortal foe and imprudently praised the fleetness of his horse as an instrument of flight and safety The monarch dissem bled his suspicions but after the close of the campaign Andronicus was arrested and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constantinople In this prison he was left above twelve years a most painful restraint from which the thirst of action and plea sure perpetually urged him to escape Alone and pen sive he perceived some broken bricks in a corner of the chamber and gradually widened the passage till he had explored a dark and forgotten recess Into this hole he conveyed himself and the remains of his provisions re placing the bricks in their former positions and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat At the hour of the customary visit his guards were amazed with the silence and solitude of the prison and reported with shame and fear his incomprehensible flight The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut the strictest CHAP XLVIII 163 t orders were dispatched into the provinces for the reco very of their fugitive and his wife on the suspicion of a pious act was basely imprisoned in the same tower At the dead of night she beheld a spectre she recognised her husband they shared their provisions and a son was thefruitof these stolen interviews which alleviated the tediousness of their confinement In the custody of a woman the vigilance of the keepers was insensibly re laxed and the captive had accomplished his real escape when he was discovered brought back to Constanti nople and loaded with a double chain At length he found the moment and the means of his deliverance A boy his domestic servant intoxicated the guards and obtained in wax the impression of the keys By the di ligence of his friends a similar key with a bundle of ropes was introduced into the prison in the bottom of a hogshead Andronicus employed with industry and courage the instrument of his safety unlocked the doors descended from the tower concealed himself all day among the bushes and scaled in the night the garden wall of the palace A boat was stationed for his recep tion he visited his own house embraced his children cast away his chain mounted a fleet horse and directed his rapid course towards the banks of the Danube At Anchialus in Thrace an intrepid friend supplied him with horses and money he passed the river traversed with speed the desert of Moldavia and the Carpathian hills and had almost reached the town of Halicz in the Polish Russia when he was intercepted by a party of Wala chians who resolved to convey their important captive to Constantinople His presence of mind again extricated him from this danger Under the pretence of sickness he dismounted in the night and was allowed to step aside from the troop he planted in the ground his long staff clothed it with his cap and upper garment and stealing into the wood left a phantom to amuse for some time the eyes of the Wakchians From Halicz M 2 164 ROMAN EMPIRE he was honourably conducted to Kiow the residence of the great duke the subtle Greek soon obtained the esteem and confidence of leroslaus his character could assume the manners of every climate and the barba rians applauded his strength and courage in the chase of the elks and bears of the forest In this northern region he deserved the forgiveness of Manuel who solicited the Russian prince to join his arms in the invasion of Hun gary The influence of Andronicus achieved this im portant service his private treaty was signed with a pro mise of fidelity on one side and of oblivion on the other and he marched at the head of the Russian cavalry from the Borysthenes to the Danube In his resentment Ma nuel had ever sympathized with the martial and dissolute character of his cousin and his free pardon was sealed in the assault of Zemlin in which he was second and second only to the valour of the emperor No sooner was the exile restored to freedom and his country than his ambition revived at first to his own and at length to the public misfortune A daughter of Manuel was a feeble bar to the succession of the more deserving males of the Comnenian blood her future marriage with the prince of Hungary was re pugnant to the hopes or prejudices of the princes and nobles But when an oath of allegiance was required to the presumptive heir Andronicus alone asserted the honour of the Roman name declined the unlawful en gagement and boldly protested against the adoption of a stranger His patriotism was offensive to the empe ror but he spoke the sentiments of the people and was removed from the royal presence by an honourable banishment a second command of the Cilician frontier with the absolute disposal of the revenues of Cyprus In this station the Armenians again exercised his cou rage and exposed his negligence and the same rebel who baffled all his operations was unhorsed and almost slain by the vigour of his lance But Andronicus soon CHAP XLVIII 165 discovered a more easy and pleasing conqiiest the beautiful Philippa sister of the empress Maria and daughter of Raymond of Poitou the Latin prince of Antioch For her sake he deserted his station and wasted the summer in balls and tournaments to his love she sacrificed her innocence her reputation and the offer of an advantageous marriage But the resent ment of Manuel for this domestic affront interrupted his pleasures Andronicus left the indiscreet princess to weep and to repent and with a band of desperate adventurers undertook the pilgrimage of Jerusalem His birth his martial renown and professions of zeal announced him as the champion of the cross he soon captivated both the clergy and the king and the Greek prince was invested with the lordship of Berytus on the coast of Phoenicia In his neighbourhood resided a young and handsome queen of his own nation and family great grand daughter of the emperor Alexis and widow of Baldwin III king of Jerusalem She visited and loved her kinsman Theodora was the third victim of his amorous seduction and her shame was more public and scandalous than that of her predeces sors The emperor still thirsted for revenge and his subjects and allies of the Syrian frontier were repeat edly pressed to seize the person and put out the eyes of the fugitive In Palestine he was no longer safe but the tender Theodora revealed his danger and ac companied his flight The queen of Jerusalem was exposed to the east his obsequious concubine and two illegitimate children were the living monuments of her weakness Damascus was his first refuge and in the characters of the great Noureddin and his servant Sa ladin the superstitious Greek might learn to revere the virtues of the Mussulmans As the friend of Noured din he visited most probably Bagdad and the courts of Persia and after a long circuit round the Caspian sea and the mountains of Georgia he finally settled 160 ROMAN EMPIRE among the Turks of Asia Minor the hereditary ene mies of his country The sultan of Colonia afforded a hospitable retreat to Andronicus his mistress and his band of outlaws the debt of gratitude was paid by frequent inroads in the Roman province of Trebizond and he seldom returned without an ample harvest of spoil and of Christian captives In the story of his adventures he was fond of comparing himself to Da vid who escaped by a long exile the snares of the wicked But the royal prophet he presumed to add was content to lurk on the borders of Judaea to slay an Amalekite and to threaten in his miserable state the life of the avaricious Nabal The excursions of the Comnenian prince had a wider range and he had spread over the eastern world the glory of his name and religion By a sentence of the Greek church the licentious rover had been separated from the faithful but even this excommunication may prove that he never abjured the profession of Christianity His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open and secret persecution of the emperor but he was at length ensnared by the captivity of his female companion The governor of Trebizond succeeded in his attempt to surprise the person of Theodora the queen of Jerusa lem and her two children were sent to Constantinople and their loss imbittered the tedious solitude of banish ment The fugitive implored and obtained a final par doii with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sove reign who was satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit Prostrate on the ground he deplored With tears and groans the guilt of his past rebellion nor would he presume to arise unless some faithful sub ject would drag him to the foot of the throne by an iron chain with which he had secretly encircled his heck This extraordinary penance excited the wonder and pity of the assembly his sins were forgiven by the church and state but the just suspicion of Manuel CHAP XLYIIJ  167 fixed his residence at a distance from the court at Oenoe a town of Pontus surrounded with rich vine yards and situate on the coast of the Euxine The death of Manuel and the disorders of the minority soon opened the fairest field for his ambition The emperor was a boy of twelve or fourteen years of age without vigour or wisdom or experience his mother the empress Mary abandoned her person and govern ment to a favourite of the Comnenian name and his sister another Mary whose husband an Italian was decorated with the title of Caesar excited a conspiracy and at length an insurrection against her odious step mother The provinces were forgotten the capital was in flames and a century of peace and order was over thrown in the vice and weakness of a few months A civil war was kindled in Constantinople the two fac tions fought a bloody battle in the square of the palace and the rebels sustained a regular siege in the cathe dral of St Sophia The patriarch laboured with honest zeal to heal the wounds of the republic the most re spectable patriots called aloud for a guardian and avenger and every tongue repeated the praise of the talents and even the virtues of Andronicus In his re tirement he affected to revolve the solemn duties of his oath If the safety or honour of the imperial family be threatened I will reveal or oppose the mischief to the ut most in my power His correspondence with the patri arch and patricians was seasoned with apt quotations from the Psalms of David and the epistles of St Paul and he patiently waited till he was called to her deli verance by the voice of his country In his march from Oenoe to Constantinople his slender train insensibly swelled to a crowd and an army his professions of re ligion and loyalty were mistaken for the language of his heart and the simplicity of a foreign dress which shewed to advantage his majestic stature displayed a lively image of his poverty and exHe All opposition 168 ROMAN EMPIRE sunk before him he reached the straits of the Thracian Bosphorus the Byzantine navy sailed from the har bour to receive and transport the saviour of the empire the torrent was loud and irresistible and the insects who had basked in the sunshine of royal favour disap peared at the blast of the storm It was the first care of Andronicus to occupy the palace to salute the em peror to confine his mother to punish her minister and to restore the public order and tranquillity He then visited the sepulchre of Manuel the spectators were ordered to stand aloof but as he bowed in the attitude of prayer they heard or thought they heard a murmur of triumph and revenge I no longer fear thee my old enemy who hast driven me a vagabond to every climate of the earth Thou art safely deposited under a seven fold dome from whence thou canst never arise till the signal of the last trumpet It is now my turn and speed ily will I trample on thy ashes and thy posterity From his subsequent tyranny we may impute such feelings to the man and the moment But it is not extremely probable that he gave an articulate sound to his secret thoughts In the first months of his administration his designs were veiled by a fair semblance of hypo crisy which could delude only the eyes of the multi tude the coronation of Alexius was performed with due solemnity and his perfidious guardian holding in his hands the body and blood of Christ most fervently declared that he lived and was ready to die for the service of his beloved pupil But his numerous adhe rents were instructed to maintain that the sinking empire must perish in the hands of a child that the Romans could only be saved by a veteran prince bold in arms skilful in policy and taught to reign by the long experience of fortune and mankind and that it was the duty of every citizen to force the reluctant modesty of Andronicus to undertake the burden of the public care The young emperor was himself con CHAP XLVIII 160 strained to join his voice to the general acclamation and to solicit the association of a colleague who in stantly degraded him from the supreme rank secluded his person and verified the rash declaration of the pa triarch that Alexius might be considered as dead so soon as he was committed to the custody of his guar dian But his death was preceded by the imprison ment and execution of his mother After blackening her reputation and inflaming against her the passions of the multitude the tyrant accused and tried the em press for a treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary His own son a youth of honour and hu manity avowed his abhorrence of this flagitious act and three of the judges had the merit of preferring their consciences to their safety but the obsequious tri bunal without requiring any proof or hearing any de fence condemned the widow of Manuel and her un fortunate son subscribed the sentence of her death Maria was strangled her corpse was buried in the sea and her memory was wounded by the insult most offen sive to female vanity a false and ugly representation of her beauteous form The fate of her son was not long deferred he was strangled with a bowstring and the tyrant insensible to pity or remorse after surveying the body of the innocent youth struck it rudely with his foot â Thy father he cried was a knave thy mother a whore and thyself a fool Androni The Roman sceptre the reward of his crimes CUs i was held by Andronicus about three years and Comnenus â â iÂ i A D I 183 a half as the guardian or sovereign of the em pire His government exhibited a singularcon trast of vice and virtue When he listened to his pas sions he was the scourge when he consulted his rea son the father of his people In the exercise of private justice he was equitable and rigorous a shameful and pernicious venality was abolished and the offices were filled with the most deserving candidates by a prince 170 ROMAN E MPIRE who had sense to choose and severity to punish He prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and persons of shipwrecked mariners the provinces so long the objects of oppression or neglect revived in prosperity and plenty and millions applauded the distant blessings of his reign while he was cursed by the witnesses of his daily cruelties The ancient pro verb that blood thirsty is the man who returns from banishment to power had been applied with too much truth to Marius and Tiberius and was now verified for the third time in the life of Andronicus His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals who had traduced his merit opposed his greatness or insulted his misfortunes and the only comfort of his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge The necessary extinction of the young emperor and his mo ther imposed the fatal obligation of extirpating the friends who hated and might punish the assassin and the repetition of murder rendered him less willing and less able to forgive A horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or the sword by the sea or the flames would be less expressive of his cruelty than the appellation of the Halcyon days which was applied to a rare and bloodless week of repose the ty rant strove to transfer on the laws and the judges some portion of his guilt but the mask was fallen and his subjects could no longer mistake the true author of their calamities The noblest of the Greeks more especially those who by descent or alliance might dispute the Comnenian inheritance escaped from the monster s den Nice or Prusa Sicily or Cyprus were their places of re fuge and as their flight was already criminal they ag gravated their offence by an open revolt and the impe rial title Yet Andronicus resisted the daggers and swords of his most formidable enemies Nice and Prusa were reduced and chastised the Sicilians were content with the sack of Thessalonica and the distance of Cy CHAP XLVIII 171 prus was not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant His throne was subverted by a rival without merit and a people without arms Isaac Angehis a descendant in the female line from the great Alexius was marked as a victim by the prudence or superstition of the emperor In a moment of despair Angelus de fended his life and liberty slew the executioner and fled to the church of St Sophia The sanctuary was insen sibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd who in his fate prognosticated their own But their lamenta tions were soon turned to curses and their curses to threats they dared to ask Why do we fear why do we obey we are many and he is one our patience is the only bond of our slavery With the dawn of day the city burst into a general sedition the prisons were thrown open the coldest and most servile were roused to the defence of their country and Isaac the second of the name was raised from the sanctuary to the throne Unconscious of his danger the tyrant was ab sent withdrawn from the toils of state in the delicious islands of the Propontis He had contracted an inde cent marriage with Alice or Agnes daughter of Lewis VII of France and relict of the unfortunate Alexius and his society more suitable to his temper than to his age was composed of a young wife and a favourite con cubine On the first alarm he rushed to Constanti nople impatient for the blood of the guilty but he was astonished by the silence of the palace the tumult of the city and the general desertion of mankind Andronicus proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects they neither desired nor would grant forgiveness he offered to re sign his crown to his son Manuel but the virtues of the son could not expiate his father s crimes The sea was still open for his retreat but the news of the revo lution had flown along the coast when fear had ceased obedience was no more the imperial galley was pur sued and taken by an armed brigantine and the tyrant 172 ROMAN EMPIRE was dragged to the presence of Isaac Angelus loaded with fetters and along chain round his neck His elo quence and the tears of his female companions plead ed in vain for his life but instead of the decencies of a legal execution the new monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous sufferers whom he had de prived of a father a husband or a friend His teeth and hair an eye and a hand were torn from him as a poor compensation for their loss and a short respite was allowed that he might feel the bitterness of death Astride on a camel without any danger of rescue he was carried through the city and the basest of the po pulace rejoiced to trample on the fallen majesty of their prince After a thousand blows and outrages Andro nicus was hung by the feet between two pillars that sup ported the statues of a wolf and sow and every hand that could reach the public enemy inflicted on his body some mark of ingenious or brutal cruelty till two friend ly Italians plunging their swords into his body released him from all human punishment In this long and pain ful agonyâ Lord have mercy on me

eastern empire If we compute the number and duration of the reigns it will be found that a period of six hundred years is filled by sixty emperors including in the Augustan list some female sovereigns and deducting some usurpers who were never acknowledged in the capital and some princes who did not live to possess their inheritance The average proportion will allow ten years for each emperor far below the chronological rule of Sir Isaac Newton who from the experience of more recent and regular monarchies has defined about eighteen or twenty years as the term of an ordinary reign The Byzantine empire was most tranquil and prosperous when it could acquiesce in hereditary succession five dynasties the Heraclian Isaurian Amorian Basilian and Comnenian families enjoyed and transmitted the royal

follies of human ambition so eager in a narrow span to grasp at a pre carious and short lived enjoyment It is thus that the experience of history exalts and enlarges the horizon of our intellectual view In a composition of some days in a perusal of some hours six hundred years have rolled away and the duration of a life or reign is contracted to a fleeting moment the grave is ever beside the

disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries since a question of popular supersti tion produced the revolt of Italy the temporal power of the popes and the restoration of the Roman empire in the west The primitive Christians were possessed with an un conquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews and their enmity to the Greeks The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the foolish idolaters who bowed before the workmanship of their own hands the images of brass and marble which had they been endowed with sense and motion should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist b Perhaps some recent and imper fect converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and St Paul with the profane

triumphant church the more prudent bishops conde scended to indulge a visible superstition for the benefit of the multitude and after the ruin of Paganism they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the veneration of the cross and of relics The saints and martyrs whose intercession was implored were seated on the right hand of God but the gracious and often supernatural favours which in the popular belief were showered round their tomb conveyed an un questionable sanction of the devout pilgrims who visited

Gregory in this memorable contest is variously interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies The Byzantine writers unanimously declare that after a fruitless admonition they pronounced the separation of the east and west and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the re venue and sovereignty of Italy Their excommu nication is still more clearly expressed by the Greeks who beheld the accomplishment of the papal triumphs and as they are more strongly attached to their religion than to their country they praise instead of blaming the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men 0 The

midland country as far as the ridges of the Appennine In this transaction the ambition and avarice of the popes had been severely condemned Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom which it was not easy for him to govern with out renouncing the virtues of his profession Perhaps a faithful subject or a generous enemy would have been less impatient to

was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the Save the provinces of Istria Liburnia and Dal matia were an easy though unprofitable accession and it was an effect of his moderation that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks But these distant possessions added more to the reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor nor

Beneventum to the river Eyder the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scot tish origin and after the loss of Spain the Christian and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was con fined to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch implored the honour and support of his alliance and styled him their common

sadors a tent a water clock an elephant and the keys of the holy sepulchre It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab who were strangers to each other s person and language and religion but their public correspondence was founded on vanity and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest Two thirds of the western empire of Rome were subject

emigrations But it has been wisely observed that in a light of precaution all conquest must be in effectual unless it could be universal since the increas ing circle must be involved in a larger

equally addicted to theft and merchandise the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged and their neighbours since the remote times of Job and Sesostris m have been the victims of

the prophet The faith which under the name of Islam he preached to his family and nation is compounded of an eternal truth and a necessary fiction THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD AND THAT MAHOMET IS THE

knowledge and worship of the true God The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue his metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power the unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law and his sanctuary was never de filed by any visible image of the invisible

nations at Astracan at Fez at Delhi are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure the Mahometans in differently pray in their chamber or in the street As a distinction from the Jews and Christians the Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public worship the people are assembled in the mosch and the iman some respectable elder ascends the pulpit to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon But the Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition II The voluntary1 penance of the ascetics the torment and glory of their lives was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a

his senses In the re volution of the lunar year the Ramadan coincides by turns with the winter cold and the summer heat and the patient martyr without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water must

but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts Remittee The two articles of belief and the four prac â tical duties of Islam are guarded by rewards and punishments and the faith of the Mussulman is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful catastrophe though he darkly announces the

mildest of the seven hells The term of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years but the prophet has judiciously pro mised that all his disciples whatever may be their sins shall be saved by their own faith and his intercession from eternal damnation It is not surprising that super stition should act most powerfully on the fears of her votaries since the human fancy can paint with more energy the misery than the bliss of a future life With the two simple elements of darkness and fire we create a sensation of pain which may be aggravated to an in finite degree by the idea of endless duration But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the conti nuity of pleasure and too much of our present enjoy ments is obtained from the relief or the comparison of evil It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves the fountains and the rivers of paradise but instead of inspiring the CHAP L 30 J blessed inhabitants with a liberal

of wine was confirmed by his example his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley bread he delighted in the taste of milk and honey but his ordinary food consisted of dates and water Per fumes and women were the two sensual enjoyments which his nature required and his religion did not forbid and Mahomet affirmed that the fervour of his devotion was increased by these innocent pleasures The heat of the climate inflames the blood of the Arabs and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the writers of antiquity 1 Their incontinence was regulated by the civil and

Mahomet consummated his nuptials such is the premature ripeness of the climate when she was only nine years of age The youth the beauty the spirit of Ayesha gave her a superior as cendant she was beloved and trusted by the prophet and after his death the daughter of Abubeker was long revered as the mother of the faithful Her behaviour had been ambiguous and indiscreet in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a man The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence he chas tised her accusers and published a law of domestic peace that no woman should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery In his adventures with Zeineb the wife of Zeid and with Mary an Egyptian captive the amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation At the house of Zeid his freedman and adopted son he beheld in a loose undress the beauty of Zeineb and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire The servile or grateful freed man understood the hint and yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and scandal the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the deed to annul the adoption and gently to reprove the apostle for distrust ing the indulgence of his God One of his

summoned to his presence his eleven wives reproached their disobedience and indiscretion and threatened them with a sentence of divorce both in this world and the next a dreadful sentence since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were for ever excluded from the hope of a second marriage Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preterna tural

youth with the title or office of secretary of the prophet the judgment of Omar intrusted him with the government of Syria and he administered that important province above forty years either in a subordinate or supreme rank With out renouncing the fame of valour and liberality he af fected the reputation of humanity and moderation a grateful people was attached to their benefactor and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of Cyprus and Rhodes The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition The bloody shirt of the martyr was

Moawiyah eluded the valour of his rival and after the death of Ali he negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan whose mind was either above or below the go vernment of the world and who retired without a sigh from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his grandfather The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary

Constantinople The primogeniture of the line of Hashem and the holy character of grandson of the apostle had centred in his person and he was at liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid the tyrant of Damascus whose vices he despised and whose title he had never deigned to ac knowledge A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa to Medina of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems who professed their attachment to his cause and who were eager to draw their swords as soon as he should appear on the banks of the Euphrates Against the advice of his wisest friends he resolved to trust hi person and family in the hands of a perfidious people He tra versed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue of women and children but as he approached the confines of Irak he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party His fears were just Obeidollah the go vernor of Cufa had extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection and Hosein in the plain of Kerbela was encompassed by a body of five thousand horse who in tercepted his communication with the city and the river 348 ROMAN EMPIRE He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert that had defied the power of Caesar and Chosroes and confided in the fidelity of the tribe of Tai which would have armed ten thousand warriors in his defence In a conference with the chief of the enemy he proposed the option of three honourable conditions that he should be allowed to return to Medina or be stationed in a frontier garrison against the Turks or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid But the commands of the caliph or his lieutenant were stern and absolute and Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful or ex pect the consequences of his rebellion Do you think replied he to terrify me with death And during the short respite of a night he prepared with calm and so lemn resignation to encounter his fate He checked the lamentations of his sister Fatima who deplored the im pending ruin of his house Our trust said Hosein if in God alone All things both in heaven and earth must perish and return to their creator My brother my father my mother were better than me and every Mussulman has an example in the prophet He pressed his friends to consult their safety by a timely flight they unanimously refused to desert or survive their beloved master and their courage was fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise On the morning of the fatal day he mounted on horseback with his sword in one hand and the Koran in the other his ge nerous band of martyrs consisted only of thirty two horse and forty foot but their flanks and rear were secured by the tent ropes and by a deep trench which they had filled with lighted faggots according to the practice of the Arabs The enemy advanced with reluctance and one of their chiefs deserted with thirty followers to claim the partnership of inevitable death In every close onset or single combat the despair of the Fatimites was invincible but the surrounding multitude galled them CHAP L 351 from a

companions of Hosein Alone weary and wounded he seated him self at the door of his tent As he tasted a drop of water he was pierced in the mouth with a dart and his son and nephew two beautiful youths were killed in his arms He lifted his hands to heaven they were full of blood and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and the dead In a transport of despair his sister issued from the tent and adjured the general of the Cufians that he would not suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes a tear trickled down his venerable beard and the bold est of his soldiers fell back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them The remorseless Shamer a name detested by the faithful reproached their cowardice and the grandson of Mahomet was slain with three and thirty strokes of lances

apostle of God is the simple and invariable profession of Islam The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the

a remnant of thirty thousand regular troops was swelled in truth or in opi nion to one hundred and twenty thousand subjects or allies of the great king The Moslems whose numbers were reinforced from twelve to thirty thousand had pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia u and their line though it consisted of fewer men could produce more soldiers than the unwieldy host of the infidels I shall here observe what I must often repeat that the charge of the Arabs was not like that of the Greeks and Romans the effort of a firm and compact infantry their military force was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers and the engagement which was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying skirmishes might be protracted without any decisive event to the continuance of

Constantinople or Antioch he was awakened by the invasion of Syria the loss of Bosra and the dan ger of Damascus An army of seventy thousand vete rans or new levies was assembled at Hems or Emesa under the command of his general Werdan and these troops consisting chiefly of cavalry might be indiffer ently styled either Syrians or Greeks or Romans Syrians from the place of their birth or warfare Greeks from the religion and language of their sovereign and Ro mans from the proud appellation which was still pro faned by the successors of Constantine On the plain of Aiznadin as Werdan rode on a white mule decorated with gold chains and surrounded with ensigns and stan dards he was surprised by the near approach of a fierce and naked warrior who had undertaken to view the state of the enemy The adventurous valour of Derar was in spired and has perhaps been adorned by the enthusiasm of his age and country The hatred of the Christians the love of spoil and the contempt of danger were the ruling passion of the audacious Saracen and the pros pect of instant death could never shake his religious con fidence or ruffle the calmness of his resolution or even suspend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humour In the most hopeless enterprises he was bold and pru dent and fortunate after innumerable hazards after being thrice a prisoner in the hands of the infidels he still survived to relate the achievements and to enjoy the rewards of the Syrian conquest On this occasion The name of Werdan is unknown to Theophanes and though it might belong to an Armenian chief has very little of a Greek aspect or sound If the Byzantine historians have mangled the oriental names the Arabs in this instance likewise have taken ample revenge on their enemies In transposing the Greek character from right to left might they not produce from the familiar appellation of Andrew â omething like the anagram Wtrdan 1 382 ROMAN EMPIRE his single lance maintained a flying fight

fought in good earnest and with out doubt God assisted me against them and had I not been apprehensive of disobeying your orders I should not have Come away as 1 did and Iperceive already that they

Moslems would derive from the punctual perform ance of their word and the obstinate resistance which they must encounter from the distrust and despair of the rest of the Syrian cities It was agreed

The sea was continually open and if Heraclius had been awake to the public distress fresh armies of Romans and barbarians might have been poured into the harbour to save the second capital of the empire A circumference of ten miles would have scattered the forces of the Greeks and favoured the stratagems of an active enemy but the two sides of an oblong square were covered by the sea and the

expected to have claim ed the most precious reward of the victory from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle till the tears and exclamations of the prefect s daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valour and modesty of that gallant soldier The unfortunate virgin was offered and almost rejected as a slave by her fa ther s murderer who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion and that he la boured for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty or the riches of this transitory life A reward congenial to his temper was

thousand dinars of gold which was imposed on the Roman empire The Sara cens had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land their retreat was solicited by the pro mise of faithful guides and plentiful markets and not a Greek had courage to whisper that their weary forces might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a slippery mountain and the river San

Charlemagne and familiar to the most childish readers as the perpetual hero of the Arabian Tales His title to the name of Al Rashid the Just is sullied by the extirpation of the generous perhaps the innocent Barmecides yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops and who dared in a passage of the Koran to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of God and posterity His court was adorned with luxury and science but in a reign of three and twenty years Harun repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt nine times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca eight times he invaded the territories of the Romans and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of submission But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was de posed and banished her successor Nicephorus resolved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace The
