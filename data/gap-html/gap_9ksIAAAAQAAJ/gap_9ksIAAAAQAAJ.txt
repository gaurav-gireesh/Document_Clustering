that work of purgation complete in which as I have already related they thought themselves justi fied in demolishing the sepulchres of the dead The Delians settled again so fart as they could remove

twelve hundred neavy armed Athenians three hundred horsemen and larger numbers of their allied forces His whole armament consisted of thirty sail Touching first at Scione yet blocked up he drew from thence the heavy armed stationed there as guards and standing away entered the haven of the Colophonians lying at no great distance from Torone Being here informed by the deserters that Brasidas was not in Torone nor the inhabitants able to make head against him he marched his forces by land towards that city and sent ten of his ships about to stand into the harbour His first approach was to the new rampart which Bra sidas had thrown up quite round the city in order to inclose the suburbs within its cincture and thus by the demolition of the old wall had rendered it one intire ci ty When the Athenians came to the assault Pasiteli rhe Knights of Aristophanes Arid to set it in the most ludicrous view the poet opens his play with Nieias and Demosthenes whom he paints in a very injurious

and the garrison under his command exerted themselves in its defence But when they could no longer maintain it and at the same time the ships sent round on pur pose had entered the harbour Pasnelidas fearing left the ships might take the town now left defenceless and when the rampart was carried by the enemy he himself might be intercepted abandons it immediately and re tired with all speed into the town But the Athenians were already disembarked and masters of the place The land force also broke in instantly at his heels by rustling along through the aperture in the old wall and some as well Peloponnesians as Toroneans they flew in the moment of irruption Some also they took alive amongst whom was Pasnelidas the commandant Bra sidas was indeed coming up to its relief but receiving intelligence on his march that it was taken he retired since he was forty stadia off too great a distance to prevent the enemy ButCleon and the Athenians now erected two tro phies one upon the harbour the other at the rampart They farther doomed to slavery the wives and children of the Toroneans The male inhabitants together with the Peloponnesians and every Chalcidean that was found amongst them amounting in all to seven hundred they sent away captives to Athens The Peloponnesians in deed Were afterwards released by virtue of the subse quent treaty the rest were fetched away by the Oiyn thians who made exchanges for them body for body About the fame time the B≈ otians by treachery got possession of Panactum a fort upon the frontier belonging to the Athenians As for Cleon having established a garrison at To rone he departed thence and sailed round Athos as bound against Amphipolis But two vessels about this time bound for Italy and Sicily sailed out of the harbour of Athens having on  A bout 4 miles B 2 board 4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V board Ph√ ax the son of Erasistratus with whom two other persons were joined in commission to execute an embassy there For the Leontines after the departure of the Athenians from Sicily in consequence of the joint accommodation had inrolled many strangers as denizens of their city and the populace had a plan in z gitation for a distribution of the lands The noble alarmed at this gain the concurrence of the Syracusans and eject the commons They were dispersed and wan dered up and down as fo many vagabonds whilst the noble striking up an agreement with the Syracusans a bandoned and left in desolation their own city settling at Syracuse as free citizens of that place And yet foon after some of this number dissatisfied even here forsook Syracuse again and seize upon Phoce√ a quar ter of the old city of the Leontines and upon Bricin ni√ which is a fortress in the Leontine Hither the greater part of the ejected commons resorted to them j and adhering firmly together from these strong holds they annoyed the country by their hostilities When the Athenians had intelligence of this they fend out Ph√ ax to persuade by all proper methods their old allies in that country and to gain if possible the concurrence of the other Sicilians to take up arms for the preservation of the people of Leontium against the incroaching power of the Syracufans Ph√ ax up on his arrival recommendeth the scheme successfully to the Camarineans and Agrigentines But his negotiations meeting with fome obstacles at Gela he desisted from addressing himself to the rest since he was assured he could not possibly succeed Retiring therefore through the district of the Siculi to Catane and calling on his road at Bricinni√ and having encouraged the malcon tents there totpersevere he departed Not but that in this Sicilian voyage both passing and repaffing and also upon the coast of Italy he had urged to several ci ties  how expedient for them was the Athenian friendship B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 5 He met also in his course with those Locrians who were going to another settlement after expulsion from Messene They had been driven to this necessity by se ditious factions at Messene one of which had invited them thither since the joint accommodation among the Si cilians and now they were forced to shift again though Messene had for a time been entirely in their power Ph√ ax therefore meeting with these in their removal gave them no annoyance for the Locrians had been at a conference with him to concert the measures of an a greement with the Athenians These however were the only party of all the consederates who when the Sicilians had amicably ended their disputes refused to treat with the Athenians and were brought to such submission since merely by a war in which they were embroiled against the Itonians and Meleans who bor dered upon them and were colonies of their own And some time after this Ph√ ax truly returned to Athens But Cleon who from Torone was gone about by sea against Amphipolis marching away fron Ei on makeih an assault upon Stagirus a colony of Andrians but without success yet Galepfus a colony of the Thasians he taketh by storm He sent farther embassadors to Perdiccas to summon his attendance in the expedition according to the tenor of the new alliance He sent o thers into Thrace to Polles king of the Odomantians that he would hire as large a body of Thracians as could begot and bring them up under his own orders And during this interval he himself lay quiet at Eton But Brasidas informed of these proceedings placed himself in an opposite post at Cerdilium This place be longeth to the Argilians and is seated on an eminence on the other side of the river and at no great distance from Amphipolis From hence he had a perfect view of all Clton s motions so that now it was impossible for the latter to make any approach with his army from thence to Amphipolis without being discovered Bra sidas however suspected that Cleon would approach B 3 and 6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V and from a contempt of his opponents would certainly advance thither without waiting for reinforcements He had at the same time provided himself with fif teen hundred mercenary Thracians and had assembled all the Edonian targeteers and horsemen Of theMyr cinians and Chalcideans he had a thousand targeteers besides those in Amphipolis But his whole force of heavy armed of all forts amounted to about two thou sand and he had three hundred Grecian horsemen With a detachment consisting of fifteen hundred of these Brasidas had posted himself at Cerdylium the rest were left in Amphipolis under the orders of Cle aridas Cleon remained without stirring for the present but was soon forced to such a step as Brasidas expected The soldiers were chagrined at their inactivity and were disparaging his conduct by invidious parallels against how much siVill and courage with how much  unskilfulness and cowardice he was matched and that  with the highest regret they had attended him from Athens on this expedition Sensible of their discontent and unwilling to disgust them more by too long a continuance in the same post he urew them up and led them on He acted now upon the vain conceit with which his success at Pylus had puffed him up as a man of great importance It could not enter his heart that the enemy would presume to march out against and offer him battle He gave out that  he was only advan cing in order to view the place he waited indeed the arrival of additional forces not as if they were need  fill to his security should the enemy attack him but  to enable him completely to invest the city and to take it by storm Being advanced he posted his troops upon a strong eminence before Amphipolis and went in person to view the marshes of the Strymon and the situation of the city on the side of Thrace how it really was He judged he could retreat at pleasure without a battle Not so much as one person appeared vpon B V THE PELOPGNNESIAN WAR 7 upon the works or issued out at the gates for they were all shut fast He now concluded himself guilty of a mistake in coming so near the place without the ma chines  as the town must infallibly have been taken because abandoned Brasidas however had no sooner perceived that the Athenians were in motion than descending from Cer dylium he marcheth into Amphipolis He there wa ved all manner of sally and all stiow of opposition against the Athenians He was afraid of trusting too much t ¬ hh own forces as he judged them inferior to the ene my not truly in numbers for so far they were nearly balanced but in real worth for the Athenian force appointed for this service was composed of the very flower of Athens and the choicest troops of the Lem nians and Imbrians For this reason he prepared to assail them with art because in case he gave the ene my a view of his numbers and of the sorry manner in which they were armed he judged he should be less like ly to gain a victory than by concealing them till the moment of action and avoiding that contempt which their real state would have inspired Picking out therefore a party of one hundred and fifty heavy armed for himself and appointing Clearidas to command the rest he deligned to fall suddenly upon the Athenians in their retreat concluding he should never again find them in this forlorn manner when the reinforcements they expected were come up Calling therefore all his soldiers around him as he was desirous ot animating them and letting them into his scheme he harangued them thus ‚ YE men of Peloponnesos let it suffice that I brief  ly put you in mind that we are natives of that coun try which hath ever by valour preservech klelf free  and that you of the Doric are now going to attack  your opponents of the Ionic descent whom you are inured to defeat My words are chiefly designed to B 4 inform 8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V inform you in what manner I have planned the method of attack lest hazarding the event with so small a par  ty and not with our intire force may seem unequal to the work and may too much dispirit you The  enemy I conjecture from an utter contempt of us  and a strong presumption that we durst not come out into the field against them have shewn themselves before this city and this very moment disorderly scattered as they are to view the situation they hear tily despise us The leader therefore who hath the  most acuteness in detecting such blunders in a foe and then scizeth the proper moment to fall upon them as best enabled by his own strength not so much in the open and regular manner of a methodi cal fight as with a surprise most advantageous in the  present juncture ‚ such a leader may for the most part be assured of success Such stealths as these draw after them the highest glory By these the man who over reacheth his enemy the most per  formeth the most substantial service for his friends Whilst therefore haughtily presuming on their own worth they remain thus disordered and by what appeareth to me are bent more on drawing osf than remaining here ‚ during this their intermission of  purpose and before their resolutions can be regular ly adjusted I myself at the head of my chosen par ty will be amongst them if possible and will rush  with vigour into the center of their army And then  Clearidas when once you perceive that I am engaged and as in probability it must be have thrown them into disorder then at the head of yours accompa r nied by the Amphipolitans and the rest of the conse f derates throw open the gates on a sudden for your  sally and advance with your utmost speed to the charge And thus it may considently be hoped the f enemy must be thrown into the utmost consternation because a second body thus running to the charge w is more terrible to the foes than the present which is already B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR g already engaged ‚ And shew yourself now Cleari das that gallant man which in honour as a Spartan you ought to be You in general ye confederates I exhort to follow with manly resolution and to remember that good soldiers are bound in duty to be full of spirit to be sensible of shame and to obey commanders that  this very day if you behave with valour you are henceforth free and will gain the honourable title of Laced√ monian allies otherwise must continue to be the slaves of the Athenians where the best that can  befal you if neither sold for slaves nor put to death as rebels will be a heavier yoke of tyranny than you ever yet have felt whilst the liberty of the rest of Greece must by you for ever be obstructed But so dastardly behaviour I conjure you to scorn as you know for what valuable prizes you are to enter the lists I myself shall convince you that I am not  more ready to put others in mind of their duty than personally to discharge my own through the whole f scene of action Brasidas having ended his harangue prepared to sally out himself and placed the main body under the orders of Clearidas at the gates which are called the Thracian to be ready to rush out at the appointed time To Cleon now ‚ for Brasidas had been plainly seen  coming down from Cerdylium and as the prospect of the city lay open to those without had been seen also when lacrificing before the temple of Minerva and form ing the proper dispositions ‚ To Cleon I fay who was now in a remote quarter to view the posts advice is brought that the whole force of the enemy was vi sibly drawn up within the city and that under the gates many feet of horses and men might be discern  ed as ready for a sally Upon hearing this he went to the place and was convinced by his own sight He determined however not to hazard a battle before his to THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V his succours were arrived and though he knew his mo tions could not be concealed he went off and ordered the signal to be given fora retreat commanding farther that the lest wing should file off first which indeed was the only method of drawing off securely to E ion But as they seemed to him to be long about it he wheeled off himself at the head of the right  and thus exposing his men to the missive weapons of the enemy was draw ing off his army At this instant Brasidas perceiving it was time to at tack since the army of the Athenians was already in motion says to those about him and to all that were near ‚ These gentlemen wait not for us that plainly appeareth by the shaking of their spears and heads for those who make such motions are not used to stay for the enemy s approach But let somebody throw me open the appointed gates and letus boldly and with all speed sally out against them In effect Brasidas issuing at the gates of the intrenchment and the first of what was then the long wall advanced with all speed di rectly along the road where now standeth the trophy to be seen by those who pass along by the strongest part of the town and falling upon the Athenians dismayed not only at their own irregular situation but also terri fied at his bold attack in the very center of their army he putteth them to the rout And now Clearidas sal lying out according to order at the Thracian gates was advancing to second him The consequence was that by such an unexpected and sudden assault on both sides the Athenians were thrown into the highest confusion Their left wing which inclined the most towards Eton as having filed off first was instantly broken and fled These were no sooner dispersed in flight than Brasidas advancing to the attack of the right is wounded ‚ He dropped ‚ but the Athenians are not sensible of it Thole who were near him took him up and carried him off This accident however enabled the right wing of the Athenians to maintain their ground the longer though B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR n though Cleon who from the sirst had never intended to  stand an engagement flies instantly awayand being intercepted by a Myrcinian targeteer is slain But his heavy armed embodying together and gaining an emi nence repulsed Clearidas who twice or thrice attacked them and maintained their ground till the Myrcinian and Chalcidic cavalry and the targeteers surrounding and pouring in their darts upon them compelled them to fly Thus the whole Athenian army was distressed in a laborious flight They ran different ways amongst the mountains numbers had been destroyed in the charge others by the Chalcidic horse and targeteers but the remainder escaped in safety to Ei on Those who took up Brasidas when he dropped in the action and bore him osf carried him into the city yet alive His senses remained till he heard his party were victorious and soon after that he expired The rest of the army with Clearidas being come back from the pursuit rifled the dead and erected a trophy This done all the confederates assisted under arms at the funeral of Brafidas whom they interred at the pub lic expence within the city near the place where the fo rum now standeth And afterwards the Amphipolitans having inclosed his monument performed sacrisice to him as a hero They also enacted solemn games in his honour and annual sacrifices Nay they ascribed their colony to him as founder after demolishing the edisices of Agnon and defacing every memorial which might continue the memory of his foundation They acted thus partly out of real gratitude to Brafidas whom they regarded as their deliverer and partly at this juncture  The first embassy which came from the Grecians in Thrace to Sparta after the death of Brafidas made a visit to his mother Argileonis The first queston she asked them was Didmy fin die bravely And when the embassadors expatiated largely in his praise and said at last There was not such another Spartan left alive ‚ You mistake gentlemen said the mother my fin was a good man j but there are many teller men than be in Sparta Plutarch s Laconic Apophthegms to 12 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V to shew their high respect fdr the Laced√ monian a li ance as they stood in great dread of the Athenians For considering their hostile embroilments with the Athenians they thought it neither for their interest nor satisfaction to continue the honours of Agnon To the Athenians they also delivered the bodies of their dead The number of them on the Athenian side amounted to six hundred whereas the enemy lost but seven men This was owing to the nature of the fight which had not been carried on in a regularvman ner but was rather a Daughter in consequence of a surprise and sudden consternation After the reception of cheir dead the Athenians sailed away for Athens but those under the orders of Clearidas applied them selves to re settle and secure Amphipolis About the same time in the close of this summer Ramphias and Autocharidas and Epicydidas Lace d√ monians were conducting up for the Thracian ser vice a reinforcement consisting of nine hundred heavy armed Being arrived at Heraclea in Trachis they regulated there such things as seemed to require an a mendment and during the season they halted here the battle of Amphipolis was fought and the summer ended But early as possible in the succeeding winter the reinforcement under Ramphias proceeded on their route as far as Pierium of Thessaly But the Thessalians op posing their farther passage and Brasidas being now dead to whom they were conducting this supply they returned home They imagined that their aid was no longer wanting as the Athenians in consequence of their overthrow had quitted that country and them selves had not sufficient ability to carry the plans into execution which Brasidas had been meditating But the principal motive of their return was their own conscious ness at setting out that the Laced√ monians were more inclined to peace B V THE PELO PONNESIAN WAti tj It so fell out indeed immediately after the battle of Amphipolis and the return of Ramphias from Thessaiy that neither of the parties meddled any longer with thi operations of war but were more inclined to a peace The motives on the Athenian side were these ‚ They had received a terrible blow at Delium and a second lately at Amphipolis Hence they no longer entertain ed that assured considence of their own strength which had formerly occasioned them to reject all accOmmoda 1 tions as they imagined in their then career of success they should soon give law to their enemies Now also they were under apprehensions of their dependents lest buoyed up by the late misfortunes of Athens they might the sooner be induced to revolt And they heartily repented now that they had neglected the fine opportunity which their success at Pylus gave them of bringing the dispute to a happy determination On the other hand the Laced√ monians acted on these motives ‚ They found themselves strangely mis taken in the events of war  At its commencement they imagined that in the space of a few years they should intirely have demolished the power of the Athe nians by laying their territory waste but they had suf fered a terrible calamity in the affair of Sphacteria such as never before had been the lot of Sparta Devasta tions now were extended over all their country from Pylus and Cythera Their Helots had also in numbers deserted to the foe and they lived in constant expec tation that those who yet persevered in their allegiance gained by the solicitations of those who were fled might in the present low ebb of Sparta attempt to subvert their constitution as had formerly been the case It happened farther that the thirty years truce with the Argives was on the point of expiring and the Argiv es were unwilling to renew it unless the Cynuria was previously restored They judged it therefore a plain impossibility to make head at the fame time a gainst both Argives and Athenians They had alia a suspicion 14 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V suspicion that some cities of Peloponnesus would revolt from them to the Argives which proved afterwards true Both parties then being respectively influenced by such considerations an accommodation was judged to be expedient The anxiety of the Laced√ monians about it was not the least as they were eagerly bent on reco vering their prisoners that had been taken at Sphacteria for they were all citizens of Sparta of the first rank and allied to the most honourable families They had begun to solicit their liberty so soon as ever they were taken but the Athenians flushed with conquest at that time disdained to treat Yet after the blow recei ved at Delium the Laced√ monians knowing then they were become more tractable laid hold of the favourable juncture and obtained a cessation of arms for a year in which space they were by article to hold mutual conferences in order to settle an accommodation for a longer time And since the Athenians had now again more lately been totally defeated at Amphipolis and as well Cleon as Brafidas was dead both of whom had most strenuously opposed an accommodation the latter be cause he was successful and reaped glories in war the former because in a season of tranquillity his villa nies must needs be detected and his bold calumniations lose all credit the persons who at present were chief in the management of either state were more strongly dis posed than ever to adjust disputes These were Pleisti onax the son of Pausanias king of the Laced√ monians and Nicias the son of Niceratus by far the most suc cessful general of that age Nicias desired it as hither to he had never been deseated and was bent on securing his own prosperity on a lasting foundation on obtaining a relaxation of toils for himself and of their present bur dens for his fellow citizens and on leaving his name il Justrious to posterity as one who had never involved his country in cala mity These views he judged could only be accomplished by vacuity from danger by exposing fc V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR i  expofing himself as little as possible to the uncertain ties of fortune and vacuity from danger was compatible solely with peace Pleistionax had been calumniated by his enemies on the account of his restoration and they invidiously suggested to his prejudice upon every loss whatever which the Laced√ monians sustained that such was the consequence of transgressing the laws in the repeal of his banishment For they laid to his charge that in concert with his brother Aristocles he had suborned the priestess of Delphi to give one general answer to all the deputations sent by the Laced√ monians to consult the oracle that  they should bring back the seed of  the demi god son of Jove from a foreign land into their own country if not they should plough with a silver plough share and thus at length so seduced the Laced√ monians in the favour of an exile residing at Lyc√ um upon account of his precipitate retreat ouc of Attica as though purchased by bribes from the enemy and from a dread of his countrymen dwelling in a house one half of which was part of the temple of Jupiter that nineteen years after they conducted him home with the same solemn processions and sacrifices as those who were the original founders of Laced√ mon had ap pointed for the inauguration of their kings Repining therefore at these calumniations and judging that as peace giveth no room for miscarriage and that sar ther if the Laced√ monians could recover the prisoners his enemies would be debarred of a handle for detrac tion whereas whilst the chances of war subsist the persons at the helm of government must be liable to re proaches for every disaster he was earnestly desirous to bring about an accommodation This winrer therefore they proceeded to a confe rence and at the approach of spring great prepara tions were openly in hand on the Laced√ monian fide and a scheme for fortifying in Attica was circulated through all the States in order to render the Athenians more compliant Many meetings were held and many demands i6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V demands with large justifications were urged on both sides till at length it was agreed that  a peace should be concluded each party restoring what they  had conquered in the war but Nis√ a to remain in the hands of the Athenians Plat√ a was re demand ed by the latter but the Thebans urged that it had noc fallen into their hands by force or by treachery but they possessed it in pursuance of a free and voluntary surrender And upon the same plea the Athenians kept Nis√ a Things being so far adjusted the Laced√ monians called together their consederates and all their voices excepting those of the B≈ otians and Corinthians and Eleans and Megareans who were not at all satisfied with these proceedings concurring for a peace they ra tify the accommodation and solemnly pledged the ob servance of it to the Athenians who in exchange swore the same to the Laced√ monians in effect as fol loweth THE Athenians and Laced√ monians and their allies have made peace on these terms and every State hath sworn to their observance In regard to the common temples ‚ Permission is granted to all who desire it to sacrifice to visit to consult the oracles to send public deputations in the prescribed forms of every people both by land and sea without any molestation That the sacred soil and the temple of Apollo at Delphi and Delphi itself be ruled after

first part of the war The Laced√ monians for to them it fell by lot to make the first restitutions released immediately what prisoners they had in their hands and having dispatch ed Ischagoras and Menas and Philocharidas in the quality of their embassadors to the cities of Thrace or dered Clearidas to deliver up Amphipolis to the Athe nians and all the consederates there to submit to the terms of the treaty according to the stipulation given for them But this they positively refused as they judged the treaty prejudicial Clearidas also to ingra tiate himself with the Chalcideans would not deliver up Amphipolis alledging that without their concurrence he could not possibly do ir He himself returned in person soon after with the embassadors in order to make his defence at Laced√ mon mould Ischagoras accuse him there of disobeying orders His view was farther to try if the accommodation could by any means be eva ded But when he found it fast confirmed he posted back with all speed to his government having expresi orders from the Laced√ monians to deliver up Amphi polis or if that was beyond his power to cause all the Peloponnesians within that garrison instantly to evacuate the place The confederates happened at this juncture to be at Laced√ mon where such of them as had hitherto refused to accept the treaty were ordered by the Lace d√ monians to accede to it But this they positively re fused alledging the same reason as before and plainly affirming that  they would not come in till better terms than the present were obtained for them Their ¬ V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 21 Their remonstrances had no effect upon the Laced√ mo nians who sent them away without redress and struck up forthwith an alliance offensive and defensive with the Athenians They had reason to conclude that  the Argives would come to no agreement with them fince they had lately declared a negative to their embassadors Ampelidas and Lichas and yet  these Argives theyjudged  could be no dreadful M foe without the Athenians and that the rest of Pelo ponnems would not now presume to interfere who without this method of prevention would certainly  have gone over to the Athenians An Athenian embassy

Demosthenes This alliance was concluded in a very little time after the treaty of peace and the Athenians now released to the Laced√ monians their Spartans who were made pri soners at Sphacteria The summer also of the eleventh year was now begun and so far the transactions of these first ten years of this war closely carried on have been regularly compiled YEAR XI J AFTER the treaty of peace and the alliance of fensive and desensive between the Laced√ monians and Athenians both which were concluded after the ten years war at the time when Pleistolas presided in the college of Ephori at Sparta and Alc√ us was Archon at Athens the peace became in force amongst the acceding parties But the Corinthians and some of the Pelopon nesian States were endeavouring the overthrow of all these proceedings And immediately there arose ano ther great combustion amongst the confederates against Laced√ mon More than this as time advanced the Laced√ monians became suspected by the Athenians as they shewed no great punctuality in executing the con ditions of the peace For the space of six years and ten months they refrained indeed from entering one ano ther s territory in a hostile manner but during such a correspondence which abounded in suspicions they Were in all other respects active in a reciprocal annoy J Before Christ 421 C 4 ance 2 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V ance And at length necessitated to dissolve the treaty concluded at the ten years period they engaged afresh in open war The same Thucydides an Athenian hath also compiled an account of these latter transactions in a re gular series according to the summers and winters down to that period of time when the Laced√ monians and their allies put an end to the empire of Athens and became masters of the Icng walls and the Pir√ us The whole continuance of the war to this period was twenty seven years And if any man be inclined to think that this intervening accommodation mould not be reckoned as war he will find no arguments to support his opini on For let him only survey the transactions as they are distinctly related and he will find it an absurdity to pro nounce that an interval of peace in which neither all the restitutions were made nor the benesits obtained which the mutual stipulations required And setting these considerations aside in the Mantinean and Epidau ric and other wars transgressions were committed on both sides The confederates also of Thrace continued still to be as great enemies as ever And the B≈ otians never agreed to more than a bare cessation of arms re newable every tenth day Including therefore the first war which lasted ten years and that suspicious interval which ensued and ended at last in a second open rupture the whole conti nuance if computed by summers and winters will turn out upon enquiry to have been so many years and some few additional days And such as laid stress up on the predictions of oracles can assent only to this com putation as genuine For my own part I perfectly well remember that not only at the commencement but even during the whole course of the war many such predictions were gi n out that  it must needs continue three times nine years I also lived through  jts whole extent jn the very flower of my understand ing and strength and with a close application of my thoughts B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 25 thoughts to gain an exact insight into all its occurren ces It was farther my lot to susfer a twenty years ex ile from my country after my employment in the bu siness of A mphipolis and to be present at the transac tions of both parties and not the least at those of the Peloponnesians in consequence of my banishment by which means I had leisure to gather more ample infor mations about them I shall relate therefore the quar rel and breach of the treaty subsequent to the first ten years and the incidents of the war which afterwards ensued UPON the conclusion of the treaty of peace for fif ty years and the subsequent alliance the embassies from the different States of Peloponnesus who had been sum moned thither to give their concurrence withdrew from Laced√ mon The rest of them indeed went di rectly home but the Corinthians stopping in their re turn at Argos began first at a conference with some of the magistracy there to insinuate that since the  Laced√ monians not in order to serve but to inslave  Peloponnesus had entered into a treaty and an alii  ance offensive and desensive with their once most  inveterate soes the Athenians it highly behoved the  Argives now to watch over the preservation of Pelo  ponnesus and to form a public resolution ‚ That any Grecian State which is free and uncontrolled  which enjoyeth and supporteth an equal share of rights and privileges might enter into an alliance of  fensive and desensive with the Argives for the guard of their mutual properties against their common foes f t This to be communicated only to the few who were f absolute masters of the decisions of each State and e  very where to shun all conference with the bulk of the people lest the scheme might be detected in case M the multitude should refuse their concurrence They assured them that the majority of the States were so ex asperated against the Laced√ monians that they would infallibly 26 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V I infallibly come in And after suggesting such a course the Corinthians also returned home The persons at Argos who had listened to these insi nuations reported the scheme in the next place to the whole magistracy and people of Argos The Argives resolved accordingly and elected a committee of twelve with whom such Grecians as desired it might agree upon an alliance the Athenians and Laced√ monians excepted Neither of these States were permitted to treat with the Argives without the public consent of the whole peo ple The Argives were the more readily persuaded to such a measure as they plainly saw a war was unavoidable between themselves and the Laced√ monians for the truce between them was on the point of expiring They were also animated by the hope of gaining into their hands the sovereignty of Peloponnesus For at this juncture of time Laced√ mon lay under the great est discredit and was fallen into utter contempt upon ac count of their late disasters whereas the Argives were in the high vigour of their strength in all respects as they had never intersered in the Attic war and having observed an exact neutrality with both had been thri ving in peace and plenty The Argives therefore in this manner invited those Grecians who were willing to enter into their alliance   The Mantineans and allies were the first who out of a dread of the Laced√ monians accepted the proposal For these Mantineans in the heat of the war against the Athenians had seized and appropriated to themselves a certain district of Arcadia subject to Laced√ mon and now concluded that the Laced√ monians would never leave them in the quiet possession of it when they were at liberty to act for its recovery This readily induced them to have recourse to the league of Argos regarded by them as a powerful State which had ever been at va riance with Laced√ mon and like their own was de mocratical   B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 27 No sooner had the M antineans revolted than the rest of Peloponnesus began to mutter that they ought also to take the same step imagining that revolt to have been founded upon some stronger reasons than yet ap peared exasperated also against the Laced√ monians for sundry reasons and above all for this article in the peace with Athens ‚ that in case the two States of Laced√ mon and Athens think proper to make any additions or alterations the same to be lawful For this was the clause which gave the greatest alarm to Pe loponnesus and inspired a jealousy that the Laced√ mo nians might strike up a bargain with the Athenians to inflave the other States since in justice no alteration ought to be made without the concurrence of the whole confederacy Alarmed therefore at these proceedings many of them made instant application to the Argives exerting their several endeavours to obtain their alliance But the Laced√ monians perceiving what a com bustion was arisen in Peloponnesus principally ow ing to the insinuations of the Corinthians who were al so going to enter into this league with Argos they dis patch embassadors to Corinth from a desire to prevent what might ensue Here they represented to them ‚ how criminal their conduct had been in having thus originally fomented the present tumult and that in cafe they abandoned the Laced√ monians and went over to the Argive league they assured them that  by such a step they must break the most sacred oaths injustice they had already committed in refu sing to accede to the Athenian peace since pursuant to old stipulations between them whatever a ma jority of the confederates resolved was to be binding on all unless some god or hero injoined a dissent Buc the Corinthians in the presence of all those of the con federacy who had not accepted the peace and whose at tendance they had previously invited replied to the La ced√ monians without entering into a particular detail of the injuries they had done them in not covenanting i8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V with the Athenians for the restitution of Solium or A nactorium or any other point in which they thought themselves aggrieved but speciously pretending that  they could never abandon their allies in Thrace  whom by solemn oaths they were bound to support  oaths which they had severally sworn when they first  revolted in concert with the Potid√ ans and had on  other occasions since renewed arguing from hence that they could not have violated the common oath of the confederates in refusing their accession to the Athenian peace since as they had sworn upon the  faith of the gods to the former they could not be  tray them without the guilt of perjury The stipu lation indeed ran thus unless some god or hero injoin  ed a dissent ¬ ‚ their present dissent therefore ap  peared to them to be a divine injunction So far they argued from their former oaths and in regard to the alliance offensive and defensive with Argos ‚ ‚  they would hold consultations with their friends and  take such steps as were expedient and just And with this answer the Laced√ monian embassadors depart ed home An Argive embassy happened also at the same time to be at Corinth who pressed the Corinthians to enter into their league without any farther hesitation They desired them to attend at the next public meeting they held for a final answer There arrived soon after an embassy from the Eleans who made in the first place an alliance offensive and defensive with the Corinthians i and then from Corinth repairing to Argos became allies of the Argives ac cording to the icheme pre established for this purpose for a misunderstanding had arisen between them and the Laced√ monians about Lepreum In a former war of the Lepreat√ against a province of Arcadia the Ele ans had been prevailed upon tojoin the Lepreat√ for a moi ety of the land that should be conquered and at the conclusion of the war the Eleans left all the land in the management of the Lepreat√ subject to the annual tri bute B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR ag bute of a talent to Olympian Jove This was regular ly paid till the Athenian war but that war being then made a pretence of its discontinuance the Eleans would have exacted it by force The others had recourse to the Laced√ monians The dispute was referred to the Laced√ monian arbitration i but the Eleans taking up a suspicion that they should not have justice would not abide the reference but began to ravage the territory of the Lapreat√ The Laced√ monians notwithstand ing this proceeded to a sentence ‚ that  theLeprea t√ were masters of their own conduct and that the Eleans were guilty of injustice and as the latter would not abide by their arbitration they threw a gar rison of heavy armed into Lepreum but the Eleans regarding this step as the reception of a city by the La ced√ monians which had revolted from them and alled ging the treaty in which it was stipulated ‚ that of whatever places the parties were possessed upon the  commencement of the Attic war the same they should continue to hold at its expiration as if they had met with injustice they revolt to the Argives and the Eleans entered into that league offensive and defen iive as hath been already related The Corinthians soon followed their example and with the Calcideans also of Thrace became the allies of Argos But the B≈ otians and Megareans though they had threatened the same thing thought proper to drop it They had been ill used by the Laced√ mo nians but judged however that the democracy of the Argives would be less compatible with their interests whose form of government was oligarchical than the polity of the Laced√ monians About the same time of this summer the Athenians becoming masters of the Scioneans after a long block ade put all who were able to bear arms to the sword and made their wives and children staves and gave the land to be cultured by the Plat√ ans  193I 15s sterling They 30 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V They also again brought back the Delians to Delos induced to it by the many defeats they had suffered in battle and the express oracle of the god at Delphi The Phocians also and Locrians began about this time to make war upon one another And now the Corinthians and Argives united ifl league go together to Tegea to persuade its revolt from the Laced√ monians They saw it was a large district and in case they compassed its accession they imagined the whole of Peloponnesus would be ac their beck But when the Tegeat√ declared that  they would in no shape oppoie the Laced√ monians the Corinthians who till now had acted with great alacrity slackened in their zeal for contention and began to fear that no more of the States would come in They pro ceeded however to the B≈ otians and solicited them to accede to the league between themselves and  Argives and to co operate with them for the com mon welfare And as there were truces for ten days between the Athenians and B≈ otians which were1 agreed upon soon after the peace for fifty years was made the Corinthians now pressed the B≈ otians  to accompany them to Athens and solicic for truces of the same nature for them but in cafe the Athe nians refused to grant them to renounce the suspen sion of arms and for the future never to treat With  out their concurrence The B≈ otians thus solici cited by the Corinthians desired a longer time to consi der about their accession to the Argive league To A thens indeed they bore them company but could not obtain the ten days truces For the Athenians answer ed ‚  The Corinthians have a peace already if they are confederates of the Laced√ monians And up on the whole the B≈ otians absolutely refused to re nounce their own truces though the Corinthians insisted upon ir and urged with some warm expostulations that it had been so covenanted between them So there was only a mere cessation of arms between the Co rinthians  B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 3t rinthians and Athenians without any solemn ratifi cation This same summer the Laced√ monians took the field with their whole united force under the command of Pleistionax the son of Pausaoias king of the Lace d√ monians and marched to the Parrhasians of Arcadia These were subject to the Mantineans and in conse quence of a sedition had invited this expedition But it was also designed if possible to demolish the fortress of Cypscla which the Mantineans had erected and as it was situated in Parrhasia towards the Skiritis of La conia had placed a garrison imit The Laced√ mo nians therefore ravaged the terricory of the Parrhasi ans But the Mantineans leaving their own city to the guard of the Argives marched themselves to the sup port of their dependents But finding it impossible to preserve the fortress of Cypscla and the cities of the Par rhasians they retired The Laced√ monians also when they had set the Parrhasians ac liberty and demolished the fortress withdrew their forces   The same summer also upon the return from Thrace of those soldiers who had served under Brasidas and who came home after the peace under the conduct ot Clearidas the Laced√ monians decreed those Helots who had served under Brasidas to be free and to  have permission to reside wherever they pleased And no long time after they placed them together with such persons as were newly enfranchised at Lepre um It is situated between Laconia and Elea and they were now at variance with the Eleans As for thoie Spartans who had been made prisoners in Sphacteria and had delivered up their arms conceiving some fears about them left should they lay their late disgrace too much to heart as they were persons of the greatest rank they might introduce some innovations in the State they de clared them infamous even though some of the number were at this time possessed of posts in the government But this infamy extended no farther than to disqualify them 32 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V them from offices and from buying and selling Yet in a short time ascerwards they were again restored to their full privileges The fame summer also the Dictideans took Thyssus a town seated upon the Athos and consederate with the Athenians Through the whole course of the summer the com munication was open between the Peloponneflans and Athenians Not but that the Athenians and LacedaM monians began to be jealous of one another immediately after the peace as the reciprocal restitution of places was not punctually performed For though it had fallen to the Laced√ monians lot to begin these restitutions yet they had not restored Amphipolis and other cities They had compelled neither their consederates in Thrace nor the B≈ otians nor the Corinthians to accept the peace always pretending that  should they refuse it they  were ready to join with the Athenians in their com pulfionnay they limited to them a time though not by a regular written notice  within which such as  did not accede were declared enemies to both The Athenians therefore seeing none of these points were put in actual execution became jealous of the Laced√ monians as men who acted insincerely in every step in somuch that when Pylus was re demanded they re fused its restitution and heartily repented that they had released the prisoners taken at Sphacteria They also kept possession of other places and intended to do so till the other side had performed their engagements BUt the Laced√ monians alledged  they had done eve  ry thing in their power that for instance they had  released such Athenians as were prisoners amongst  them had recalled their soldiers from Thrace and wherever they were masters of the execution had performed it As to Amphipolis they said  they  were not so far masters of it as to make an actual sur  render They had omitted no endeavours to bring the B≈ otians and Corinthians to a compliance tore cover B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 33  cover the disposal of Panactum and to obtain the dismission of those Athenians who were prisoners of  war in B≈ otia Pylus however they insisted should be immediately restored to them at least that the Messenians and Helots should be withdrawn as ct their people had been from Thrace and then the  Athenians if they pleased might continue to garri  fon that fortress themselves Many meetings were held and much argumentation passed between them this summer and at last they prevailed upon the A thenians to withdraw from Pylus the Messenians and o thers as well Helots as all deserters whatever out of La conia These they transplanted to Crania of Cephalle ne This summer therefore was a seafon of inaction and the intercourse was open between them In the ensuing winter ‚ for other Ephori were in of fice as the authority of those under whom the peace was made was now expired and some who were averse to the peace had succeeded ‚ embassies attending from the whole consederacy the Athenians and B≈ otians and Corinthians also being present and after much reci procal altercation coming to no regular agreement the rest of them separated to their own homes without ef fect But Cleobulus and Xenares those two of the Ephori who were most inclined to dissolve the peace de tained the B≈ otians and Corinthians for a private con ference In this they exhorted them to act unani  mously in promotion of their scheme in pursuance of which the B≈ otians should first make themselves a party in the Argive league and then employ their good offices to form an alliance between the Argives and Laced√ monians For by these methods the B≈ otians could least of all be necessitated to take part in the Attic peace y as the Laced√ monians  would preser the renewal of friendship and alliance  with the Argives to the enmity of the Athenians and  the dissolution of the peace since to their certain knowledge the Laced√ monians had ever been desi Vot II D rous 34 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V rous to have the friendship of Argos consistently with their honour knowing it would facilitate the success of their war without Peloponnesus ‚ They also requested the B≈ otians  to deliver up Panactum to the Laced√ monians that exchanging it if possible lt for Pylus they might get clear of the main obstacle to a fresh rupture with the Athenians The B≈ otians and Corinthians instructed by Xena res and Cleobulus and the party in their interest at La ced√ mon departed botht to report this scheme to their principals But two persons of the greatest authority in the State of Argos were attending upon the road for their return They met and conferred with them about the means of gaining the concurrence of the  B≈ otians in this league upon the same footing with the Corinthians and Eleans and Mantineans For they were confident were this point once completed they might easily become the arbiters of war or peace either in relation to the Laced√ monians if they so  determined and would act together with firm una nimity or to any other State whatever The B≈ otian embassadors were highly delighted with this discourse The solicitations of these Argives hap pened to coincide with the instructions recommended to them by their friends at Laced√ mon And the Argives finding them satisfied with their motion assured them they would send embassadors to the B≈ otians and so they parted But the B≈ otians at their return reported to the Rulers of B≈ otia the proposals from Laced√ mon and those from the Argives upon the road The B≈ otian rulers were delighted and grew now more zealous than ever became on both sides from their Laced√ mo nian friends and also from the Argives the solicitations were concurrenr And very soon after the Argive embassadors arrived to forward the dispatch of the trea ty The B≈ otian rulers however at present gave only a veibal approbation of the scheme and then dif  i i missed B V THE PELdPONNESlAN WAR 35 misled them promising to send an embassy of their own to Argos to perfect the alliance But in the mean time it was judged to be previous ly expedient that the B≈ otian rulers and the Corin thians and the Megareans and the embassadors from the allies of Thrace should mutually interchange their oaths  to act in support of one another if upon an M occasion such support might be requisite and roen ter neither into war nor peace without joint consent and then the B≈ otians and Megareans for these acted in union to form a league with the Argives But be fore such exchange of oaths the B≈ otian rulers com municated the whole of the plan to the four B≈ otian councils in whom the sovereignty is lodged recom mending it as worthy their confirmation that  what ever cities were willing might mutually interchange such oaths for their reciprocal advantage Yet the B≈ otians who composed the councils refused a confir mation apprehensive it might tend to embroil them with the Laced√ monians should they pledge such an oath to the Corinthians who were now abandoning the Laced√ monian interest For the rulers had not made them privy to the scheme from Laced√ mon how Xenares and Cleobulus of the college of Ephori  and their friends advise them to enter first into league with the Argives and Corinthians and then to extend it to the Laced√ monians They had pre sumed that the supreme council though they secreted these lights would not resolve against a plan which themselves had pre digested and recommended to them But now as this affair took so wrong a turn the Corin thians and embassadors from Thrace went home with out effect and the B≈ otian rulers who had all along intended in case their scheme had passed to persect an alliance with the Argives made no farther report to the ‚ councils in relation to the Afgives¬ sent no embassy to Argos in consequence of thejnpromise Jiiu suffered the D 2 _ whole r  r 36 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V whole plan to fink away in careless and dilatory uncon cern In this fame winter the Olynthians after a sudden assault took Mecyberne which was garrisoned by A thenians After the former proceedings ‚ for conferences were still continued between the Athenians and Laced√ mo nians about those places they held from one another ‚ the Laced√ monians conceiving some hope that if the Athenians could recover Panactum from the B≈ otians they also might regain Pyius addressed themselves in solemn embassy to the B≈ otians and importuned them to deliver up Panactum and the Athenian prisoners that they in return might get Pylus from them But the B≈ otians persisted in a resusal unless they would make a separate alliance with them as they had done with the Athenians Upon this the Laced√ monians though convinced that such a step would be injustice to the A thenians ‚ since it had been stipulated that  without joint consent they should neither make peace nor  war ‚ yet bent on the recovery of Panactum that they might exchange it for Pylus the party at the fame time amongst them who were meditating a fresh rupture inclining to the B≈ otian interest made the requisite alli ance in the very close of this winter on the approach of spring The consequence was that Panactum was im mediately levelled with the ground and the eleventh year of the war was brought to a conclusion _  YE AR XII  EARLY in the spring of that summer which was now approaching the Argives ‚ ‚ when the expected embassy frorn Bceotia was not arrived in pursuance bf promise when they found that Panactum was demo lished i afid a separate alliance struck up between the B≈ otians and Laced√ monians began to fear they ‚  Before Christ 420  t lhould B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 37 should be totally abandoned and that their whole con federacy would go over to the Laced√ monians They concluded that through the prevalence of the Laced√ monian arguments the B≈ otians had been persuaded to level Panactum and accede to the treaty made with A thens and that the Athenians were privy to all these steps and so of consequence they themselves were now utterly excluded from an alliance with the Athe nians and their former hopes entirely blasted that in case disputes should arise and their treaty with the La ced√ monians not be renewed they might at worst depend on gaining the Athenian alliance The Ar gives therefore amidst these perplexities and the dread of being attacked at once by the Laced√ monians and Tegeat√ by the B≈ otians and Athenians as they had formerly refused an accommodation with the Lace d√ monians and had grasped in thought at the sove reignty of Peloponnesus ‚ the Argives I say had no longer one moment to lose but dispatched instantly Eustrophus and √ son whom they judged to be per sons most agreeable there in embassy to Laced√ mon They now judged it their interest to procure the best peace which the present posture of affairs would allow from the Laced√ monians and then quietly to attend the event of things In this view the embassadors on their arrival had a conserence with the Laced√ monians about the terms of a peace and at first the Argives in sisted that  to some State or private person should be referred for equitable arbitration the controversy be ¬ tween them about the district of Cynuria  concern ing which as it is frontier to both they are eternally at variance in this district stand the cities of Thyrea and Anthena and the possession of it is in the hands of the Laced√ monians But at length when the Laced√ monians would not suffer any mention to be made of this declaring only that  were they willing to renew the f former truce they should find them complying the Argive embassadors however prevailed upon the D 3 Laced√ monians 38 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V Laced√ monians to agree to these proposals that for the present a peace mould be concluded for the term K of fifty years provided notwithstanding that liber ty remain to either party to send a challenge when neither was embarrassed by plague or war and the  right of this district be then decided by arms between f Laced√ mon and Argos as had formerly been done  when the victory was equally claimed on both sides f and that in this case it be not lawful to carry the f pursuit beyond the boundaries of either Argos or La ced√ mon These proposals it is true appeared at first to the Laced√ monians to be foolish but ac length as their necessary interest made them vastly desi rous of the Argive friendship they complied with the demand and the terms agreed on were digested into writing But the Laced√ monians before they put the last hand to the treaty insisted on their previous return to Argos and reporting it to the people and in cafe the ratification was given to repair again to Laced√ mon at the Hyacinthian festival and swear obser vance And upon this they returned to Argos  Herodotus relates this remarkable piece of history in Clio They had a con f ference fays he and came to an agreement that three hundred men on each fide should decide the point by combat and the land contested should remain the  property of the victors that both armies in the mean time should retire within their respective dominions nor be present at the combat lest by being spectators of it either of them seeing their countrymen defeated might run to their assist  ance When articles were settled both armies drew off those selected on each fide for the combat staid behind aud engaged They fought it out with equal reso U lution and fortune Of fix hundred men only three were left alive two of them  Argives Alcinor and Chromius j and one Laced√ monian Othryadcs These  weie all the survivors when night came on The Argives as victors ran in haste to Argos but Othryades for the Laced√ monians having stripped the dead f bodies of the Argives and carried off their arms lo the place where his own fide had encamped continued upon the field of battle Next morning both parties came to learn the eyent and then truly each party also claimed the victory j one averring that a majority survived on their fide the other maintaining that even those had fled whilst their own combatant had kept his ground and spoiled f the dead In short from wrangling they came again to blows and a general engage ment in which after great slaughter on bojh fides the Laced√ monians obtained f the victory Whilst B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 39 Whilst the Argives were employed in this negotia tion the Laced√ monian embassadors Andromenes and Ph√ dimus and Antimenidas who were commissioned to receive Panactum and the prisoners of war from the B≈ otians and deliver them over into the hands of the Athenians found upon their arrival that Panactum was already demolished by the B≈ otians upon prettxc that  in former times upon occasion of some dispute about it an oath had been taken by the Athenians and B≈ otians that neither should inhabit that place excluding the other but should jointly possess it but what Athenian prisoners of war were in the hands of the B≈ otians were delivered up to Andromenes and his collegues who carried and released them to the A thenians They also reported the demolition of Panac tum declaring this to be equivalent to a restitution as no enemy to Athens could occupy that post for the fu ture These words were no sooner heard than the Athe nians conceived the deepest resentments They thought themselves injured by the Laced√ monians not only in the demolition of Panactum which ought to have been restored standing but also in the separate alliance made lately with the B≈ otians of which they now had no tice in open contradiction to their own declaration  of joining them to compel by force such as would noc accede to the treaty They reflected also upon o ther points in which the engagements of the treaty had been in no wife fulfilled and concluded themselves o verreached For these reasons they gave a rough an swer to the embassadors and an instant dismission Upon so much umbrage taken by the Athenians a gainst the Laced√ monians such persons at Athens as were willing to dissolve the peace set themselves in stantly at work to accomplish their views Others were labouring the fame point but none more than Alcibu D 4 des 40 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  B V des

seemed to him the most expedient step to form a good under standing with the Argives Not but that his opposition to other measures was the result of his ambition and a study of contention because the Laced√ monians had employed their interest in Nicias and Laches to perfect the treaty flighting his assistance upon account of his youth nor paying him the deference he expected from the ancient hospitality between that State and the family from which he was descended This indeed his grands father had renounced but he himself in the view of re newing it had shewn extraordinary civilities to the Spar tans who were made prisoners at Sphacteria Thinking himself therefore in all respects fligtited at this crisis he began openly to oppose them He affirmed that ‚ the Laced√ monians were a

farther upon the first dissa tisfaction between them he secretly dispatchech his e missaries to Argos exhorting them  at his invita tion to come to Athens in company with the Man  tineans and Eleans and solicit an alliance since op portunity favoured and his whole interest should be exerted in their support The Argives having heard these suggestions and being now convinced that the B≈ otian separate alliance had been made without the privity of the Athenians who on the contrary were highly discontented at the Laced√ monian proceedings took no farther notice of their embassy at Laced√ mon though sent expressly there to negotiate an accommodation but recalled alt their attention from thence to the Athenians They re flected that Athens a State which from long antiquity had been their friend which was governed by a demo cracy in the same manner as their own and which was possessed of a great power at sea could most effectually support them in ease a war should break out against them In short they lost no time in dispatching their embassadors to the Athenians to propose an alliance who were accompanied by embassies from the Eleans and Mantineans A Laced√ monian embassy also arrived in great haste composed of Philocharidas and Leon and Endius persons who were judged most acceptable at Athens They were afraid lest the Athenians in the heat of their resentments should clap up an alliance with the Ar gives They sent also by them a demand of the resti tution of Pylus in lieu of Panacturn and excuses fcr the separate alliance they had made with the B≈ otians  which had been concluded without any design of pre judicing the Athenians Upon these points they spoke 42 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V spoke before the senate notifying at the same time that they were come with

monian embassy have on this occasion their first audience from I be serali The business of this history hath been hitherto transacted in the assembly os the people t For as the generals of the State were the chief ministers in time of war and had a power of convening the people at their own discretion all points that re quired a speedy determination were brought before the people in the first instance and the influence of the senate which operated on ordinary occasions was checked and suspended in time of war which starts many extraordinary occasions or left it in the will of the generals of the Stale to call and treat as extraordinary whatever they pleased By these means the people had ingtoffed the power the balance which Solon designed always to preserve was in a great measure loll and the aristocratical influence was quite suspended As therefore the popular assembly had its note at first setting out the form and constitution of the senate now requires an explanation ‚ At this time it consisted of five hundred persons and for that reason is often stiled the council of five hundred and sometimes by Thucycides the council of the bean from the manner of their e lection Every year on an appointed day each tribe returned the names of their members who were qualified and stood candidates for this honour The names were engraved on pieces of brass and cast into a vessel the fame number of beans were cast into another vessel fifty of which were w hite and the rest black They then proceeded to draw out a name and a bean and the persons to whom the white beans were drawn became the senators of the year Each senator had a drachma that is seven pence three farlbings a day for his salary In the next place the names of the tribes were thrown into a vessel and into ano ther nine black beans and one white one  the tribe to whose name the white bean was drawn took the first course of presidency for a tenth part of the year and the or der of the succeeding courses was determined in the fame manner by the bean How the fifty in course were again subdivided into tent and from these tern a chairman cho sen for a day hath been already explained in the note on the popular assembly Book T ThesenateUt every day in the prytaneum ar slate bouse where the prtfidtntl had al so their diet They were the grand council of state took into consideration all the affairs os the commonwealth debated and voted by beans and whatever determina tions werethus made in the senate were afterwards carried down to the assembly os the people to be ratified and passed into laws ‚ By Solon s original constitution nothing was to be proposed to the people before it had been canvassed and approved in the se nate But this seems to have been eluded by the generals of the state who had all the military business in their department and a power to convene the people at their pleasure and lay matters before them in the first instance To restore the aristocrati cal power and reduce that of the people occasioned an usurpation and fad consusion in ithenE as will bescen in the eighth book of this history ence B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 43 ence upon the multitude and an alliance with the Ar gives might prove abortive But Alcibiades now contriveth to baffle them by art He prevaileth upon the Laced√ monians by solemnly pledging his faith to them that  in case they would  disown before the people the full powers with which they were invested he would engage for the restitu tion ofPylus for he himself would then persuade  the Athenians to it with as much zeal as he now dis suaded and would get all other points adjusted to their satisfaction His view in acting thus was to detach them from Nicias and to gain an opportunity of inveighing against them in the assembly of the people as men who had nothing sincere in their intentions and whose prosessions were dissonant with themselves and so to persect an alliance with the Argives and Eleans and Mantineans And this artifice in the sequel took effect For when they were admitted to an audience before the people and replied to the demand when put contrary to what they had said in the senate that they had no such powers the Athenians in an in stant lost all patience And now Alcibiades roaring out aloud against the Laced√ monians with much more Vehemence than he had ever done before they listened greedily to all he said and were ready instantly to call in the Argives and their companions and to make them confederates But the shock of an earthquake being felt before any thing could be formally concluded the assembly was adjourned At the next day s assembly Nicias though the Laced√ monians had been thus overreached and he himself ensared by their public acknowledgement that they had no full powers ‚ spoke however on the Lace d√ monian side insisting  on the necessity os maintain  ing a good correspondence with them and deserring  all agreement with the Argives till they could send  to the Laced√ monians and be distinctly informed f of their final resolutions ‚ It maketh said he lor 44 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V  for your credit but for their disgrace that a war  should be averted For as your affairs are in a hap  py posture it is above all things eligible for you to  preserve your prosperity unimpaired but they in  their present low situation should put all to hazard V in the hopes of redress He carried it in short that embassadors should be dispatched he himself to be one in the commission  earnestly to require of the Laced√ monians that if their intentions were ho  nest they should surrender Panactum standing and  Amphipolis and should farther renounce the at V Hance with the B≈ otians in cafe they still refused to accede to the peace  ‚ this in pursuance of the arti cle that Neither Jhculd make peace without joint con sent They ordered it to be added farther that they themselves could they have deigned to act un justly had concluded before this an alliance with the Argives as they were already attending and soliciting  such a measure And having subjoined their instruc tions in relation to all other pointsin which they thought themselves aggrieved they sent away the embassadors in commission along with Nicias These being arrived and having reported their instructions added in con clusion that  unless they would renounce their al liance with the B≈ otians if still refusing their acces  sion to the peace they would admit the Argives and V their associates into league The Laced√ monians replied  They would never renounce their alliance with the B≈ otians For the party of Xenares the Epborus and all those who acted in the same combina tion had still the majority However at the request of Nicias they renewed the oaths Nicias was afraid of being forced to depart without settling any cne point of his commission and of falling under pub lic censure which really came to pass as undoubted author of the peace with the Laced√ monians And when upon his return the Athenians had heard that no one point was adjusted at Laced√ mon they imme diately B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 45 diately conceived the warmest indignation And look ing upon themselves as highly abused Alcibiades in troducing the Argives and their associates who were still at Athens they entered into treaty and an alliance offensive and defensive with them as followeth  THE Athenians and Argives and

determination of all parties the lame to be valid A peace and alliance offensive and defensive was in this manner concluded And those subsisting between the Laced√ monians and Athenians were not upon this account renounced by either side The Corinthians however who were confederates of the Argives refused to accede but what is more they had never sworn to the alliance made previous to this between the Eleans and Argives and Mantine ans ‚ to have the lame foes and the same friends They pretended that the defensive league already made was quite sufficient ‚ to succour one another but not to concur in an offensive war In this manner the Corinthians were drawing off from the league and again warped in their inclinations towards the Laced√ monians The Olympics were solemnized this summer rn which Androflhenes the Arcadian was for the first time victor in the pancrace and the Laced√ monians were excluded the temple by the Eleans so that they could neither sacrifice nor enter the lists They had not discharged the sine set upon them by the Eleans by virtue of the Olympic laws who had charged them with a conveyance of arms into the fort of Phyrcon and with throwing some of their heavy armed into Lepreum  during the Olympic cessation The fine imposed was two fc V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 49 two thousand min s at the rate of two min≈ for every heavy armed soldier agreeably to the letter of the law The Laced√ monians upon this dispatched an cm bassy to remonstrate against the injustice of the sen tence that  the cessation had not been notified at La  ced√ mon when they threw in their heavy armed The Eleans replied that the cessation was already in force For they proclaim it first amongst them selves i and so whilst they were quiet and expected no such usage they had been wronged by a surprise The Laced√ monians retorted thar  if so it was  needless for them to proceed to a publication of it in Laced√ mon if the Eleans had already judged them selves wronged But the fact was far different in the  light they saw it and trespass had not been commit ted in any stiape whatever But the Eleans adhered to their first charge that they could not be persuaded the Laced√ monans had not wronged them yer in case they were willing to  surrender Lepreum to them they are ready to remit their share of the fine and to pay for them that part of it which was due to the god But when this would not content it was urged again by the Eleans that  if they were unwilling to part with it they should by no means surrender Lepre um but then as they were desirous to have the use  of the temple they must go up to the altar of Olym pian Jupiter and swear in the presence of the Gre cians that they would hereafter pay the fine ‚ But as they also refused to comply with this the Laced√ monians were excluded the temple the sacrifice and the games and performed their own sacrifices at home Yet the rest of the Grecians except the Lepreat√ were admitted to assist at the solemnity The Eleans however apprehensive they would sacri fice by force set a guard of their armed youths around the temple These were reinforced by the Argives and  2000 minse  64581 6 Zi lie ling Vol II  E Mantineans

of united Greece lest the Laced√ monians should return with an armed force more especially when Lichas the son of Archesilaus a Laced√ monian was scourged in the course by the under osficers be cause when his chariot had gained the prize and the chariot of the B≈ otian State was proclaimed victor pursuant to the exclusion of the Laced√ monians srom the race he stepped into the midst of the assembly and crowned the charioteer desirous to make it known that the chariot belonged to him Upon this the whole assembly was more than ever alarmed and it was fully expected that some strange event would follow The Laced√ monians however made no bustle  and the festival passed regularly through its train After the Olympics the Argives and their consede rates repaired to Corinth in order to solicit the concur rence of that State A Laced√ monian embassy hap pened also to be there Many conserences were held and nothing finally determined but upon feeling the shock of an earthquake they parted each to their re spective cities And here the summer ended In the ensuing winter a battle was fought by the Haracleots of Trachis against the √ nianians and Do lopians and Meliensians and some of the Thessalians For the bordering nations were enemies to the city of Heraclea as this latter place had been fortified for their more especial annoyance From its foundation they had ever opposed it preventing its growth to the utmost of their power and at this time they deseated the Heracleots in a battle in which Xenares the son of Cni dis the Laced√ monian commandant was stain a number also of the Heracleots perished And thus the winter ended and the twelfth year of the war came al so to an end YEAR V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR sr YEAR XIII J THE succeeding summer was no sooner begun than the B≈ otians viewing the low estate to which it had been reduced by the late battle took into their own hands the city of Heraclea and discharged Hegesippi das the Laced√ monian commandant as guilty of mal administration They took this city into their own hands from the apprehension that during the em broilments of the Laced√ monians in Peloponnesus the Athenians might seize it The Laced√ monians howe ver were chagrined at this step of the B≈ otians This fame summer also Alcibiades the son of Cli nias being general of the Athenians with the concur rence of the Argives and their allies entered Pelopon nesus with a small party of heavy armed Athenians and archers and enlarged his forces upon his route by the aids of the confederates in those quarters j where he not only made such a disposition of asfairs as might best an swer the views of the alliarrce but also traversing Pe loponnesus with his force he both persuaded the Pa treans to continue their works quite down to the sea and intended also to execute a plan of his own for erec ting a fort upon the Rhium of Achaia f But the Co rinthians and Sicyonians and all such as were alarmed at the annoyance this fort might give them rushed out to prevent him and obliged him to desist The same summer a war broke out between the Epi daurians and the Argives The pretext was grounded on a victim due from the Epidaurians to the Pythian Apollo as an acknowledgement for their pastures for J Before Christ 419 ‚ f This was a graed project indeed It aimed at no less than the total ruin of Co rinth and putting an end to all the navigation of that trading and opulent city through the hay of Crisla The Athenians were already intire masters of the sea on the other side of the isthmus E 2 the 52 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V the Argives were now the chief managers of the tem ple But this pretended grievance let apart it had been judged expedient by Alcibiades and the Argives to get possession if possible of Epidaurus in order to prevent molestation on the side of Corinth and to ren der the passage of Athenian succours more expeditious from √ gina than by setching a compass about Scyll√ um The Argives therefore were intent on their pre parations as resolved to take the field and act against Epidaurus in order to exact the victim by force of arms Bur about the fame time the Laced√ monians also marched out with their whole force as sar as to Leuc tra upon their own frontier towards Lyceum under the command of Agis the son of Archidamus their king Not a man was privy to the design of their thus taking the field not even the States from which the quotas were furnished out But when the victims they sacrificed for a successful campaign proved inauspi cious they again marched home and circulated fresh orders to their consederates to be ready to take the field again after the next month which was the month Car ndus f the grand festival of the Dorians But when they were thus withdrawn the Argives taking the field on the twenty seventh day of the month preceding Carneius and though celebrating their own festival thac very day continued all this intermediate time to make incursions and ravages upon Epidauria The Epidau rians sent about to solicit the succours of their allies j fome of whom excused themselves as bound to observe the approaching sestivals though others advanced as ‚ f This festival was observed by most cities in Greece but with the greatest pomp and solemnity at Sparta where it began the thirteenth of the month Carneius according to the Laced√ monian stile and lasted nine days A camp was formed for its celebration in wlich they continued during the whole solemnity and observed fliict military discipline By these means as we find a little lower the Argives i n this

embassies from the several States held a congress at Mantinea ac the request of the A thenians and proceeding to a conserence Epharru das the Corinthian remonstrated that their words  were by no means consistent with their actions for  whilst they were here sitting together upon the terms of peace the Epidaurians and allies and the Argives  were opposing one another in arms That consc  quently the first thing to be done was to send depu  tations on both sides to disband those armies and then orderly to proceed to treat of peace Yield ing therefore to the justice of such a remonstance they fetched the Argives out of Epidauria and retur ning to the congress they were not able even then ta agree together Upon which the Argives once more en tered Epidauria and resumed the ravage The Laced√ monians now had taken the field and were advanced to Cary√ ‚ but as now again the vic tims sacrificed portended no success to a campaign they once more withdrew The Argives also after ruining about a third of the territory of Epidauria were returned home In this incursion they were assisted by one thousand heavy armed Athenians with Alcibiades at their head who having heard that the Laced√ monians had now left the field as their service was now no longer needful marched a way And in this manner the summer passed In the beginning of the next winter the Laced√ mo nians unknown to the Athenians threw a body of men to the number of three hundred with Agesippidas as commandant into Epidaurus by sea Upon this the Argives repaired instantly to Athens with remonstran ces that  though it was explicitly mentioned in the  treaty that no enemy should be suffered to pass through their respective dominions yet they had  permuted the Laced√ monians to make this passage E 3 by 54 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V  by sea without molestation f Unless therefore   they would replace the Mefienians and Helots in Py  lus to annoy the Laced√ monians they should deem  themselves aggrieved Upon this the Athenians at the instigation of Alcibiades underwrote this charge upon the Laconic column that the Laced√ monians  were guilty of perjury and removed the Helots from Crania into Pylus to resume their depredations but refrained from any other act of hostility In the course of this winter though the Argives and Epidaurians were at war yet no regular battle was fought between them The hostilities consisted of am buscades and skirmishes in which according to the chance of action some persons perished on both sides But in the close of winter when the spring was now approaching the Argives provided with ladders for scale came under Epidaurus hoping to take it by sur prise as insufficiently manned by reason of the war j but failing of success they soon withdrew And then the winter ended and with it ended also the thirteenth year of the war YEAR XIV J ABOUT the middle of the ensuing summer when their consederates the Epidaurians were sadly distres sed when some of the Peloponnesians had already re volted and others shewed plainly a spirit of discontent the Laced√ monians were clearly convinced that unless expeditiousty prevented the mischief would spread a broad Upon this they took the field against Argos with their whole force both themselves and their He lots and Agis the son of Archidamas king of the La ced√ monians commanded in chief They were atten f The Argives in this remonstrance acknowledge the dominion of the sea even on the coast of Peloponnesus to belong to Athens t Before Chijst4i B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 55 ded in the field by the Tegeat√ and all the other Ar cadians whatever confederated with the Laced√ monians But the allies of the other parts of Peloponnesus and those without the isthmus were assembled at Phlius ‚ the B≈ otians consisting of five thousand heavy armed and the same number of light armed  five hundred horsemen each attended by a soldier on foot ‚ the Co rinthians of two thousand heavy armed ‚ the other con federates with their several quotas  ‚ but the Phliasians with the whole of their force because the army was as sembled in their district The Argives who had sometime before intelligence of the Laced√ monian preparations and that since they were filing towards Phlius in order to join the forces as sembled there now took the field themselves They were joined by a succour of the Mantineans strength ened by the addition of their dependents and three thousand heavy armed Eleans Upon their march they fell in with the Laced√ monians at Methydrium of Ar cadia Each party posts itself upon a rising ground The Argives got every thing in readiness to attack the Laced√ monians whilst yet they were alone but Agis dislodging by night and stealing a march completed his junction with the body of confederates at Phlius When this was perceived by the Argives they drew off early the next dawn first cf all to Argos and then to the pass on the route of Nemea by which they ex pected the Laced√ monians with their confederates would faU into their country Yet Agis took not that route which they expected but having communicated his design to the Laced√ monians and Arcadians and Epidaurians be took a different route though much less practicable and descended into the plains of Argos The Corinthians and Pellenians and Phliasians fol lowed by another more direct route and orders had been given to the B≈ otians and Megareans and Sicyo riians to take the route which leadeth to Nemea on which the Argives were posted that in case the Ar E 4 glves 56 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR E V gives should march into the plain to make head against the Laced√ monians the last wuh their cavalry might press upon their rear After these dispositions and such a descent into the plain Agis ravaged Saminthusand other places upon intelligence of which the Argives so soon as it was day dislodged from Nemea to stop the depredations and on their march met with the body of Phiiasians and Corinthians and encountering flew some few of the Phiiasians whilst not a much greater number of their own men were destroyed by the Corinthians The B≈ otians also and Megareans and Sicyonians took the route of Nemea conformably to orders and found the Argives already dislodged but the latter upon enter ing the plain and a view of the ravage made upon their lands drew up in order of battle The Laced√ monians stood regularly drawn up on the other side And now the Argives were shut up in the middle of their enemies For on the side of the plain the Laced√ monians and those in their body intercepted their re turn to the city on the high ground above them were the Corinthians and Phiiasians and Pellenians on the other part towards Nemea were the B≈ otians and Sicyonians and Megareans Cavalry they had none For the Athenians were the only part of their confede racy who were not yet come up ‚ The bulk indeed of the Argives and confederates apprehended not the danger which at present environ ed them to be so great but rather concluded they might engage with advantage and that they had caught the Laced√ monians fast within their territory and near to Argos itself Two Argives however Thrasyl lus one of the five in command and Alciphron the public host of the Laced√ monians the very instant the armies were moving to the charge had addresied themselves to Agis and proposed expedients to pre vent a battle giving their word that the Argives tf were ready to do and tQ submit to justice upon a fair B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 57  fair and equitable arbitration in case the Laced√ mo  nians had any charge against them and for the fu ture would live at peace if a present accommoda tion could be effected In this manner these Argives presumed to talk mere ly of themselves and without the public authority A gis also by his own private determination accepted the proposals and without reporting them to the council of war without canvassing things maturely him self or at least communicating only with one person of the number which had authority in the army grants them a four months truce in which space they were  to make good what engagements they had now made and then instantly drew off the army without impart ing the reasons of his conduct to the other consederates The Laced√ monians indeed and confederates follow ed when he led them off because their laws exacted such obedience yet amongst themselves were lavish of their censure against Agis that when so fine an op portunity of engaging was in their power when their enemies were hemmed in on all sides both by their horse and their foot they were drawn off without per forming any thing worthy of such mighty preparations for to this very day a finer army of Grecians had never appeared in the field A most gallant figure in truth it made whilst they were all together at Nemea The Laced√ monians were there to be seen with the whole collected force of their State accompanied by the Arca dians and B≈ otians and Corinthians and Sicyonians and Pellenians and Phliasians and Megareans The troops which compoled their several quotas were all pick ed men and were judged a match in the field of battle not only for the whole Argive alliance but the addi tion of double strength This great army however laying all the time most heavy imputations on the con duct of Agis drew off and were disbanded to their se veral habitations On 58 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V On the other part also the Argives were still much more exasperated against those who had made this sus pension without public authority They imagined the Laced√ monians had escaped them when they had the finest opportunity of striking a blow inasmuch as the contest must have been decided under the very walls of Argos and in company with a numerous and gallant alliance And hence upon their return at the Chara drum the place where the crimes committed in an ex pedition are adjudged before they enter the city they were beginning to stone Thrasyllus who flying to an altar escapeth with life His effects however thty confiscated to public use But after this came up the Athenian succour con sisting of a thousand heavy armed and three hundred horsemen commanded by Laches and Nicostratus The Argives who after all were afraid to break the agreement with the Laced√ monians ordered them to  be gone forthwith and though they requested a conference refused to introduce them into the assembly of the people till the Mantineans and Eleans who were not yet departed by great importunity obtained a com pliance Here the Athenians in the presence of Al cibiades their embassador assembled with the Argives and their allies averred that  the suspension was not  valid since agreed to without the consent of the bo dy of the confederates now therefore as themselves were come up opportunely to their assistance they were obliged in honour to prosecute the war The confederates allowed the force of this argument and the whole alliance except the Argives marched instant ly away against Orchomenus of Arcadia But even the Argives though they stayed behind at first were persuaded by such reasoning and soon after went also to take part in the expedition Thus united they sat down before and besieged Orchomenus They made several assaults upon it desirous for other reasons to get  Laches and Nicostratus it B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 59 it into their hands but more particularly because the hostages from Arcadia were lodged in that city by the Laced√ monians The Orchomenians terrisied at the weakness of their walls and the multitude of their besiegers and lest as no relief appeared they should soon be exhausted thought proper to capitulate on these conditions ‚ to  be received into the confederacy ‚ to give hostages of their own body ‚ and to deliver up to the Mantine  ans those whom the Laced√ monians had lodged with   them Having thus got possession of Orchomenus the con federates in the next place held a consultation  a t gainst what other city in their plan of conquest M they should next proceed The Eleans exhorted them to march against Lepreum but the Mantineans against Tegea and the Argives and Athenians adhered to the Mantineans The Eleans upon this were of fended that they had not voted for the siege of Lepreum and separated to their own home But the rest of the confederates set about preparations at Mantinea as sul ly bent on the siege of Tegea j and even some of the citizens of Tegea were exerting their efforts within that city to betray it to them But the Laced√ monians after they were withdrawn from Argos in pursuance of the suspension of arms for four months laid heavy charges upon Agis for not conquering Argos at so sair an opportunity fairer than ever they had reason to expect ‚ since so numerous  and so gallant a body of consederates could never a  gain without greater difficulty be assembled toge  ther And when afterwards the news arrived that Orchomenus was taken their indignation became more violent than ever In such a serment they instantly re folved though not consistently with the calm Laced√ monian temper that  his house must needs be demo  lished and a fine of  one hundred thousand drach f 32291 3s 4 i sterling  mas 60 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V  mas be imposed upon Agis He earnestly pleaded against the execution of the sentence that  in another expedition he would purge tne charge by some no table service to the State if not they might then proceed to punish him at pleasure Upon this they suspended the fine and demolition but passed a law upon the present occasion such as never before had been made amongst them for they elected a committee of ten Spartans to attend him as a council Without whose concurrence he was not permitted to lead out their army into the field In the mean time a message is brought them from their friends at Tegea that  unless they come thither with the utmost expedition Tegea will revolt from  them to the Argives and their confederates and is on Jy not revolted already To prevent this the whole Laced√ monian strength both of citizens and Helots is levied with more sharp ness than had ever been known before and taking the field they marched to Oresteum ofMenalia An or der was sent before hand to their Arcadian allies to as semble and follow them directly towards Tegea But when the whole Laced√ monian strength was thus marched to Oresteum the sixth part of the num ber consisting of the more aged and younger classes was from thence again dismissed to Sparta to take up on them the guard of that place whilst the rest of their military force marcheth to Tegea and not long after their Arcadian confederates join them They sent also to Corinth to the B≈ otians Phocians and Locrians a summons of speedy aid into the Manti nean But for some of these the summons was too shorthand for the rest it was by no means an easy task to take the field in separate bodies and waiting tor their mutual junction to force their passage through an enemy s country for such lay between to obstruct their advance However they were earnestly bent to attempt it The Laced√ monians in the mean time inlarged with B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 6 t with such Arcadian parties as were already come up marched on and broke into the Mantinean and having formed their camp near the temple of Hercules they ravaged the country The Argives and their allies when their enemy was thus in sight having posted themselves on a spot of ground by nature strong and difficult of approach drew up in order as ready to engage The Laced√ moni ans also immediately advanced towards them and even approached so near as within the cast of a stone or a dart But qne of the old experienced Spartans perceiving that they were to attack so difficult a post roared out aloud to Agis that  he was going to repair one evil by an  other j as if by his present ill judged eagerness he was bent on making reparation for his censured retreat from Argos Upon this either struck with such an exclamation or whether upon a sudden his own thoughts suggested to him a different conduct he drew off his army again with all possible expedition before the bat tle could be joined And wheeling from thence into the Tegeatis he turned a stream of water into the Man tinean about which as apt to do great damage to the lands on which side foever it flowed the Mantineans and Tegeat√ are eternally at blows It was his scheme to draw down the Argives and their allies from their strong post on the eminence in order to prevent the turning of this stream so soon as they knew it was in agitation and thus to gain an opportunity of fighting in the plain In pursuance of this he halted the whole day upon the stream and accomplished its diversion But the Ar gives and their allies surprised at this sudden and preci pitate retreat had been at first unable to conjecture what it meant At length when the enemy was totally  Plutarch fays it was an apophthegm of this Agis that Laced√ monians never ask concerning their enemies  How many are they but  Where are they And that when he was hindered from righting at Mantinea he said They who would rule over many must fight against many And being asked what was the number of the Laced√ monians he replied  Enow to b at cowards withdrawn 62 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 6 V withdrawn and quite out of their view after lying in actively in their posts and no orders received sor a pursuit they began a second time to lay heavy imputa tions on their own commanders ‚ that on the for mer occasion the Laced√ monians when fairly   caught near Argos had been susfered to escape y  that now again though they were openly flying not a soul must pursue them but through shameful in   dolence their enemies are preserved and themselves  are treacherously betrayed The commanders up on the first noise of these clamours were highly chagri ned but afterwards they marched them down srom the eminence and advancing into the plain encamped them there as determined to fight the enemy The day following the Argives and allies were drawn up to be in readiness for action should the enemy appear And the Laced√ monians marching away from the stream to re occupy their former camp near the tem ple of Hercules on a sudden perceived that the whole body of their foes were ready drawn up in order of bat tle and had quitted their strong post on the eminence At this crisis the Laced√ monians were struck with a grearer astonishment than the memory of man could parallel For now in an interval os time excee ding short they were bound to get every thing in rea diness for fight Yet such was their diligence that in an instant they were formed into a beautiful array A gis their kingjissuing all the necessary orders according to law for when a king leadeth their armies all orders are given by him He himself declareth what he willeth to be done to the  general officers they carry his orders to the f colonels these to the J captains who after wards forward them to the ¬ subalterns by whom they are communicated to all the private men under their re  Poltroarch¬ ‚ Lochages J Pentecontators ¬ Enomatarchj spective B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 63 spective commands The orders when any such are re quisite are in this method dispersed and circulated with the greatest expedition For in the Laced√ monian armies almost the whole soldiery few only excepted have a command assigned in regular subordination and the care of executing orders is incumbent upon numbers In their present array the left wing consisted os the Skirit√ who of all the Laced√ monians ever claim this post as their peculiar right next them were posted the Brasidean soldiers who had served in Thrace accom panied by those who had lately been honoured with the freedom of Sparta then along the line were regularly posted all the troops which were composed of pure La ced√ monians next to them stood the Hereans of Arca dia and beyond them the M√ nalians In the right wing were the Tegeat√ but in the utmost extent of ie some sew Laced√ monians Their cavalry was equally posted on both the wings And in this form was the Laced√ monian disposition made On the side of the enemy the Mantineans had the right wing because the business fell upon their ground next to them were the allies from Arcadia then a pick ed body of Argives to the number of a thousand who long had been exercised in the study of arms at the pub lic school at Argos and next to them stood the rest of the Argive forces These were followed by their own consederates the Cleoneans and Orneat√ The Athe nians were ranged in the outermost body and composed the left wing supported by their own cavalry Such was the order and disposition on both sides The army of the Laced√ monians had the appearance of superior numbers But exactly to write the number either of the several bodies on each side or of their whole force I own myself unable The amount of the Laced√ monians was not known because of the profound secrecy observed in their polity and the amount of their enemies because of the ostentation ordinary to mankind in  THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V in magnifying their own strength hath been still difbe lieved However from the following computation an inquirer may discover the number of the Laced√ moni ans who on this occasion were drawn up in the field Besides the Skirit√ who were in humber six hundred seven battalions were in this engagement Now in eve ry battalion there were four companies and in every company four platoons in the first rank of every platoon were four fighting soldiers In regard to depth they were not equally formed as every colonel determined the depth at his own private discretion but generally they were drawn up eight deep The front line of their whole force excepting the Skirit√ consisted of four hundred and forty eight men f When both sides were ready the small respite before the engagement was employed by the several comman ders in animating the soldiers under their respective or ders To the Mantineans it was urged That  the points for which they were going to fight were their country and their future fate either rule or fla very that of rule whose sweets they had known they might not be divested and that they might ne ver feel again what slavery is To the Argives It was for their ancient so vereignty and the equal fliare of dignity they had  once enjoyed in Peloponnesus now timely to prevent an eternal submission to such losses and earn revenge ‚ f The Laced√ monian mura or brigade consisted of four hch i or battalions  2048 men For a locbos or battalion consisted of four fetiueoKa or companies ac 512 men a fer tecojiy or company of four enamalia or platoons 128 men i and each tnomatia or platoon

by 4  512 the number of a battalion The number of battalions was seven which shews the number of Laced√ monians to have been 3584 and then with the addition of 600 Siirittr who were posted on the left to have amounted in the whore to 4184 men Or again the whole front line  448 X 8 the number in depth is equal to 3584 600 Skirit√  4184 for THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 6s  for the many injuries a neighbouring State unrelent ing in its enmity had done them But to the Athenians That in honour they were obliged to signalize their valour in a conspicu ous manner in the company of numerous and gal lant allies That should they gain a victory over  the Laced√ monians on Peloponnesian ground their  own empire would be established and inlarged and no enemy would ever again presume to invade their territories And in this manner were the Argives and their con federates animated to the fight But the Laced√ monians were encouraging one ano ther and during martial strains injoined by their disci pline like men of bravery as they were each animated his neighbour with the recital of the gallant acts they had performed together They were persons who knew that a long experience in the toils of war condu ceth more to preservation than a short verbal harangue how finely soever delivered And now the armies were mutually approaching The Argives and their allies advanced in a brisk and an gry manner but the Laced√ monians moved slowly for wards to the found of many flutes the music which their laws ordain not from any religious motive but for advancing with equal steps keeping time with the notes to prevent all disorders in the ranks accidents very frequent in large armies whilst drawing to an en counter Vol II F But  Milton hath made use of this Laced√ monian march to adorn and raise his own noble poetry It was full and strong in his imagination when he wrote the following lines Paradise Icjl book J ‚ ‚ Anon they move In prtrfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders such as rais d To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming M THE FELOPONNESIAtf WAR B V But during the approach Agis the king bethought himself of making a new disposition ‚ It is the constant cafe with all armies that upon the right their wings whilst they approach one another extend themselves too far so that constantly on both sides the left wing is overreached and flanked by the enemy s right This proceedeth from the dread every soldier lieth under of being exposed on his unarmed side which maketh him eager to get it covered by the shield of the next person on his right and positive that a firm closing together in this manner will render them impenetrable to the shock of the enemy This turn of the body is first be gun by the right hand man of the whole front and is the result of his constant care to shift his defenceless side from the aim of the foe and the dread of being in the same manner exposed obligeth all the rest to follow his motion And thus in the present approach the Man tineans in their wing had far overreached the Skirit√ but the Laced√ monians and Tegeat√ had done so more in regard to the Athenians in proportion as they exceed ed them in numbers ¬ Agis therefore fearing lest the left wing of the Laced√ monians might be quite sur rounded and judging that the Mantineans quite too Arming to battle and instead of rage Deliberate valour breath d firm and unmov d l With dread of death to flight dr foul retreat Nor wanting pow r to mitigate and swage With solemn touches troubled thoughts and chafe Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow

wheel away from the spot where they were first posted and fill up the extremity of the line so as to render it equal to the Mantineans and to supply the void thus made he ordered from the right wing two battalions commanded by general officers Hippo no idas and Aristocles to repair thither and salling in to close up the ranks judging that their own right would still be more than sufficient to execute their parts and the wing opposed to the Mantineans might by this disposition be properly strengthened But as he issu ed these orders in the very onset and close of battle it happened that Aristocles and Hipponoi das absolutely refused to change their post though for such disobedi ence as apparently the result of cowardice they were afterwards banished from Sparta and before the new disposition could be completed the enemy had begun to charge Upon the refusal of these two battalions to change their post Agis countermanded those marching to strengthen the Skirit√ to their former places who now were unable to fall into the ranks or close together with those whom they had quitted But on this occa sion more remarkably than ever the Laced√ monians though irr all respects outdone in the military art gave signal proofs of their superiority in true manly valour For to come to particulars when once they were at blows with the enemy the right wing of the Mantineans routs their Skirit√ and Brasideans Then the same Mantineans supported by their confederates and the thousand picked Argives falling in at the void in the Laced√ monian line which was not yet filled up did great execution upon them for taking them in flank they intirely broke them drove them for shelter among their carriages and made a slaughter of the old men who were appointed for their guard And in this quar ter the Laced√ monians were clearly vanquished But in the other quarters and especially in the cen ter where Agis the king was posted and round him Fa the 68 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V the horse guards stiled The three hundreds falling upon thoie troops which were composed of the elder Argives and them which are called the Pentelochi and upon the Gleoneans and Orneat√ and those Athenians who ranked along with them they broke them in an instant so that many of them durst not stand to exchange a blow but so soon as they felt the Laced√ monian shock turned about at once and others were trampled under foot in the great hurry they were in to secure their es cape But when the main body of the Argives and their al lies was in this quarter routed their foot on both the flanks were instantly discomfited Now also the right of the Laced√ monians and Tegeat√ by the ad vantage of superior numbers had overreached and in compassed the Athenians These now on all hands were beset with danger in this quarter they were sur rounded by their enemies in another they v ere already vanquished and they must have suffered the most of any part of the army had it not been for the excellent support their own cavalry gave them It happened also that Agis when he perceived that the Mantineans and the thousand Argives had got the better on the lefr commanded the whole army to wheel off to the support of the vanquished And whilst this was executing the Athenians laid hold of the interval which this mo tion of the enemy and their drawing off from around them occasioned to secure their own escape without a ny opposition accompanied by the Argives who were also vanquished with them But the Mantineans and those who fought in com pany with them and the picked band of Argives were now no longer intent on pressing upon their adversaries but perceiving their own side to be completely van quished and the Laced√ monians approaching to their attack they turned about and fled Yet numbers of them perished and those chiefly Mantineans for the greatest A V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 69 greatest part of the picked band of Argives completed their escape The flight however was not precipitate nor the dis tance to a place of safety great For the Laced√ moni ans till the enemy flieth maintain their combats with long and steady toil but after a rout pursue them neither long nor far And thus or very nearly thus was the procedure of the whole battle the greatest that for many ages had been fought amongst Grecians and where the competi tion lay between most renowned and flourishing Stales The Laced√ monians amassing together the arms of their enemies who had been stain immediately erected a trophy and rifled the bodies of the dead They also took up their own dead and carried them to Tegea where they received the rights of sepulture and also de livered upon truce the slain of their enemy There fell of the Argives and Orneat√ and Cleoneans se ven hundred and two hundred of the Mantineans two hundred also of the Athenians including the √ gi net√ and their several commanders On the Laced√  monian fide ‚ as the consederates were never hard pres sed what loss they suffered is scarcely deserving of no tice and the exact number of their own dead it is diffi cult to discover but it was reported to have been about three hundred When a battle was certainly to be fought Pleistio nax the other king marched out to their support with the whole body of citizens both old men and youths But when he was advanced as far as Tegea he recei ved the news of a victory and returned to Sparta The Laced√ monians also sent messengers to countermand their aljies from Corinth and from without the isthmus And being themselves returned to Sparta after giving dismission to their allies as the Carneian solemnities were at hand they celebrate the sestival The imputa tion also of cowardice at that time laid to their charge by the rest of Greece because of their misfortune at F 3 Sphacteria 7o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B W Sphacteria and some other instances of impolitic and di latory conduct by this one action they completely pur ged away Now it was determined that their depression had been merely the result of fortune but that in in ward bravery they were still themselves The day before this battle was fought it happened that the Epidaurians with the whole of their strength had made an incursion into Argia as left defenceless and had done great execution on the guards left behind at the general march of the Argives Three thousand heavy armed Eleans as auxiliaries to the Mantineans came up after the battle as did also a thousand Athenians to join the former body upon which the whole alliance marched immediately against Epidaurus whilst the Laced√ monians were solemnizing the Carneian festival Afcer an equal distribution of the work they began to raise a circumvaliation around that city The rest indeed soon desisted but the A thenians conformably to their orders completed theirs round the eminence on which stood the temple of Juno To guard this work the whole alliance left behind a sufficient number draughted from their several bodies and then departed to their respective homes And the summer was now at an end In the first commencement of the succeeding winter and after the celebration of the Carneian festival the Laced√ monians immediately took the field and advancing as far as Tegea sent from thence to Argos proposals for an accommodation There was already in that city a party in their intelligence who were also bent on overturning the popular government at Argos and since the event of the late fatal battle they were enabled to use more cogent arguments to persuade the many into the accommodation Their scheme was first to enter into truce with the Laced√ monians as prepara tory to an alliance offensive and defensive which was next in agitation and this point carried then imme diately to execute thtir plot against the people Lichas B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 71 Lichas son of Arcesilaus the public host of the Ar gives accordingly arriveth at Argos charged to make two demands in the name of the Laced√

interest prevailed with the Argives to accept their proposals of an accom modation i which were as followeth  THUS resolved by the Laced√ monian council  to compound with the Argives These to restore

proposals by way of preliminary the Argives accepted and the army of the Laced√ monians was drawn off from Tegea to their own home And after wards in the course of mutual negotiation the same party at Argos prevailed upon their countrymen to re nounce their alliance with the Mantineans and Eleans and even with the Athenians and to strike up a peace and an alliance offensive and defensive with the Laced√ monians The tenor of it was this RESOLVED thus by the Laced√ monians and the  Argives on a peace and an alliance offensive and  desensive for the term of fifty years They shall do justice to

the Athenians till they were withdrawn out  of Peloponnesus and had given up their fortifications  at Epidaurus  and farther  for the future to  make neither peace nor war but with joint concurs rence Their attention was also extended to objects more remote and in conjunction they dispatched em bassadors to the cities in Thrace and to Perdiccas and seduced Perdiccas to swear adherence to their league Not that he instantly declared his revolt from the Athe nians but he was bent on accomplishing it ever since he saw the Argives had done it for he was originally de scended from Argos They renewed also their ancient oaths to the Chalcideans and strengthened them by the addition of new The Argives also dispatched an embassy to the Athe nians requiring them to quit the works they had raised at Epidaurus The latter sensible that their soldiers there ‚ were but a handful of men when compared with those who were associated with them in that service sent De mosthenes 74 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V mosthenes to draw them off He upon his arrival pretending to solemnise some martial game without the fortress when the reft of the garrison was gone out to the spectacle barred fast the gates And afterwards the Athenians having renewed the peace with them surrendered the fortifications they had raised into the hands of the Epidaurians When the Argives had in this manner gone off from the alliance the Mantineans also who at first stood out finding at length that without the Argives they could do nothing os themselves thought proper to accommo date their disputes with the Laced√ monians and resign ed their command over the cities of Arcadia The La ced√ monians also and Argives to the number of a thousand each marched in company to Sicyon where principally by the presence of the Laced√ monians the government was shifted into the hands of a smaller num ber And after transacting such points in concert they soon procured the demolition of the popular govern ment at Argos and an oligarchy suited to the Lace d√ monian model was erected in its stead As the winter was now in its close these transactions ran out nearly into the spring j and the fourteenth year of the war expired YEAR XV J I N the following summer the Dictideans of Athos revolted from the Athenians to the Chalcidc ans and the Laced√ monians resettled the state of Achaia which fora time had been under a management not agreeable to them The people of Argos also combining gradually toge ther and resuming their spirits made an assault upon the few They waited for a favourable opportunity till the festival of the naked games was celebrating at La X Before Christ 417 ced√ mon B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 75 cedaemon A battle was fought within the precincts of Argos in which the people was the victor Some of their opponents they flew and others they doomed to perpetual exile The Laced√ monians when their adherents implored their succour were too dilatory in moving but at last they adjourned the games and marched away to their support and hearing when they were come to Tegea that the few were vanquish ed they determined to proceed no farther maugre all the intreaties of the new exiles but retreating forth with toSparta they resumed the celebration of the games Yet being afterwards attended by deputations from those in Argos as well as by such as had been lately banished in the presence of the whole confederacy af ter many arguments had been urged on both sides they came to a resolution that  the Argives in the city  were guilty of injustice and a decree was pasted that they should march against Argos But after all their proceedings were dilatory and remiss In the mean time the people of Argos dreading the Laced√ monian strength and re addresling themselves 3gain to Athens for a renewal of alliance and proceed ing to execute a plan which they thought the strongest expedient of preservation built long walls quite down to the sea that in case they should be blocked up by Jand all proper supplies might be thrown into the city by sea through the good offices of the Athenians To this scheme of new fortifications some cities also of Pe loponnesus were privy underhand The whole body of the Argives without distinction the citizens their wives and their servants forwarded the work and from Athens they were supplied with carpenters and masons And here the summer ended Winter now succeeding the Laced√ monians when advertised of these new fortifications marched their for ces against Argos their own and all those of their al lies excepting the Corinthian Some new projects in fheir favour were now also in agitation within Argos it self 76 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V self The whole army was commanded by Agis the fon of Archidamus king of the Laced√ monians The new turns th¬ y expected for their service took not effect within the city but they made themselves masters of the new erected walls and levelled them with the ground They also took Hysi√ a town in Argia and having put all the freemen found within that place to the sword they drew off and dispersed to their several cities After this the Argives marched their force into Phli asia and after ravaging that district because the ex ilcs from Argos had met with a reception there they again retired For many of those exiles had taken up their residence at Phlius In the fame winter the Athenians exasperated against Perdiccas prevented all manner of importations into Macedonia They charged him  with taking part in the late treaty confirmed by the sanction of oaths between the Argives and Laced√ monians that far ther when they had made great preparations against the Chalcideans of Thrace and Amphipolis and Ni cias the son ofNiceratus was appointed to command in that service he had violated his obligations to act  in concert and that expedition came to nothing pure ly through his secession He was therefore an enemy to Athens  The winter expired in this manner and with it the fifteenth year of the war came also to an end YEAR XVI J WHEN summer came on Alcibiades with twenty fail arrived at Argos where he leized three hundred of the citizens whose fidelity to the Athenians and ad herence to the Laced√ monian interest was still suspect ed and these the Athenians secured in the neighbouring islands which were subject to their dominion I Before Christ 416 The B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 77 The Athenians also undertook the reduction of Me los with a naval force consisting of thirty fail of Athe nians six of Chians and two of Lesbians on board of which were transported twelve hundred heavy armed Athenians three hundred archers and twenty who drew the bow on horseback The number also of their depen dents from the continent and islands which attended was about fifteen hundred heavy armed The Melians are a colony of the Laced√ monians and had therefore refu sed to receive law from the Athenians in the fame manner as the inhabitants of the other islands received it Atfirst however they observed a strict neutrality but in procels of time when the Athenians by ravaging their country would have obliged them to act osfensively they open ly took part in the war against them With a force so strong as hath been described Cleo medes the son of Lycomedes and Tisias the son of Ti  The original of this colony is curious according to the account given of it by Plutarch ‚ When the Tyrrhenes were masters of Lemnos and Imbrus and made ‚ a practice of ravishing the wives of the Athenians at Brauron a mixed breed was the consequence whom as half barbarjan the Athenians drove out of the iflts u Thus exiled they repaired to T√ narus and were useful to the Spartans in their ¬ war against the Heloss They were afterwards rewarded for their good service with the freedom of Sparta and liberty of intermarriage Yet not being al lowed the honour of serving the offices of the state or a scat in the council they became afterwards suspected as caballing together for bad designs and projecting to overthrow the constitution The Laced√ monians therefore apprehended them ¬ all 5 and throwing them into prison kept them confined under a strong guard u till they could find out clear and incontestable evidence against them The wives of the prisoners came in a body to the prison and after much prayer and intreaty  were at length admitted by the guard to the sight and discourse of their husbands When once they had gained access they ordered them immediately to strip and  change clothes with them to leave them their own and dressed in those of their wives to make their escape d rectly in that disguise It was done the women staid behind determined to endure whatever might be the consequence and the guards deceived by appearances let out the hulbands instead of the wives They marched off and seized Taygeta then seduced the Helots to revolt and promised  to support them which struck a great terror amongst the Spartans They sent to treat with them and made up the matter on these conditions That they siiould e have their wives restored safe to them should be furnilhed with money and vessels for removal j and when fettled in another country should be reckoned a colony and kinsmen of the Laced√ monians ‚ A body of them settled some time after in  the ifle of Melos Of tit virtues us ‚ ujimm  ‚  fimachus 8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V before they proceeded to hostilities they sent a deputa tion from the army to demand a conference whom the Melians refused to introduce into the assembly of the people but in the presence only of the magistrates and the few commanded them to deliver their instructions Upon this the Athenian deputation expressed them selves as followeth  SINCE to the people in full assembly we are pre w eluded from speaking lest the many ‚ hearing their true interest declared at once by us in a continued discourse and proved by arguments fitted to per suade and tod strong to be refuted ‚ ‚ might be  wrought into our vie i for such we are sensible is the plain construction of this our guarded audience by the few To you also who now fit here we recom  mend a method of making that point yet more se cure ‚ that to the reasons we offer you reserve not your objections for one formal deliberate reply but in cafe we offer any seeming incongruity you imme  diately interrupt us and discuss the point And tell us first whether or not this proposal be agreeable The Melians who composed the synod answered thus THE candour of such leisurely debate for mutual information is not to be disapproved And yet there seemeth to be great inconsistency between such can dour and those warlike preparations with which you no longer intend hereafter but in present act have al  ready beset us For we perceive that hither you arc  come to be authoritative judges of your own plea and that the decision must needs prove fatal to us  Since if superior in debate we for that reason refuse submission our portion must be war t and if we al  d upon the ifland Yet low B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAI 99 low your plea from that moment we become your slaves Athenian s TO what purpose this If here you are met to  gether to retail your suspicions of future events or to talk of any thing but the proper means of extricating and preserving your State from the present and mani  fest dangers which environ it we had better be si lent But if the latter be your purpose let us come  to the point  Melians T H E R E is reason for it and there ought to be  forgiveness when men so situated as we are are li  able to much distraction both in speech and thought The point for which we are assembled is it is true no less than our future preservation If therefore it must be so let the conference proceed in the me thod you require Athenians  AS therefore it is not our purpose to amuse you with pompous details ‚ how after completely van  quishing the Mede we had a right to assume the so vereignty or how provoked by the wrongs received from you we come hither to earn redress ‚ we shall tc wave all parade of words that have no tendency to  wards conviction And in return insist from you that you reject all hopes of persuading us by frivo  lous remonstrances ‚ that as a colony of the Lace  d√ monians you were incapacitated from accompa nying our arms or that wrongs in any fliape you  have never done us ‚ But these things apart Ictus  lay all stress on such points as may really on both  sides 8o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V sides be judged persuasive Since of this you are as strongly convinced as we ourselves are sensible of it ‚  that in all human competitions equal wants alone pro duce equitable determination and in what terms so ever the powerful injoin obedience to those the weak V are obliged to submit Melians IF this be so we boldly aver ‚ for as you have discarded justice from the question and substi tuted interest in its place we must follow the precedent that you also it concerneth we should not be deprived of the common privilege  of men but that to human creatures ever liable to lt so dangerous a loss the pleas of reason and equity even though urged beyond their exact limitations should be indulged and allowed their weight And more to you than to others is this proper to be fug  gested lest after satiating revenge in all its fury should you ever be overthrown you may teach your enemies how you ought to be treated Athenians THAT afsecteth us not For though to our fliare an overthrow of empire fall the event would  render us neither abject nor desponding because men inured to inlarged command as the Laced√  monians for instance are never terrible to the van quifhed But our contest at present is not against  the Laced√ monians That revenge alone is terrible when subjects tumultuousty rebel and gain the asoen dant over such as were once their masters And truly f to avert iuch dangerous extremities be the care en  trusted to us But on the present occasion that we are here for the inlargement of our own power and that what we have to urge concerneth the preserva tion of the State of Melos these are the points we  are B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 81 are to establish We are desirous to have our power extended over you without obstruction and your preservation to be amply secured for the Common be  nefit of us both Melians  AND how can it turn out as beneficial For us to be come your slaves as it will for you to be our mas  ters 1 Athenians  PLAiNLY thus ‚ Because Instead of suffering the extremities of conquest you may merely become our subjects and we by exempting you from a f total destruction shall gain your service t  Melians BtJT will not these terms content you ‚ That we  be permitted to persevere in quiet to be friends to you instead of enemies but in regard to war to  be strictly neutral  ‚  ‚ i Athenians NO For all your enmity cannot hurt us so much as the acceptance of such friendship from you The  latter to those over whom we rule would suggest in  timations of our weakness Your enmity is a proof  of our power1  Melians   ARE1 your subjects then such sorry judges of e  quity and right as to place upon the same level those Vol II G who 82 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V who are under no manner of tie and who were never  indebted for their settlement to you and those who  revolting from you have been again reduced Athenians WHY should they not They know such a sense of things may be well grounded in regard to both  inasmuch as those who are exempted from our yoke  owe such exemption to their own superior strength  and if we attack them not it is the pure result or fear And hence the reduction of you besides iri larging our empire will invest it with more ample se  curity especially when seated on an island you are  bound to submit to the masters of the sea and to re main henceforth too weak for resistance unless you  are victorious at the present crisis M E L I A N S DO you then conclude that what we have proposed  is incompatible with your own security ‚ For since excluding us from the plea of justice you endeavour merely to persuade us in o subserviency to your inte rest we also are again necessitated to insist once more   on the profitable to ourselves and by shewing that with our welfare your own also coincideth endea  vour to prevail ‚ What think you of all those States  which now stand neutral in your disputes How will  you avoid their implacable hatred when terrified at such your usage of us they mult live in constant expec V tation of your hostilities And whither can such con duct tend but to enlarge the number of your decla _ red enemies and to constrain others who never de signed to be your foes to take up arms against you  though to their own regfet ‚  rod Athenians B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 8j Athenians  THAT never can be Since from States seated on  the continent we have nothing to apprehend they  are under no immediate necessity of guarding their li berty against attacks from us Those alone we dread ‚ who are seated in islands and who like you refuse  our government or who having felt the pains  of subjection are irritated against us Such are most  likely to have recourse to violent measures and to  plunge themselves aqd us into imminent dangers MELI ANS  IF this be so k and if you ye Athenians can rea  dily embark into so many perils to prevent die diffo  lution of your own empire if States by you insla  ved can do as much to throw off your yoke  ‚ f must it not be Wretchedly base and cowardly in us  who yet are free to leave any method even to the  last extremity untried of averting stavtery   Athenians w I F you judge of things as wise men ought we  answer‚ ‚ Not For the point in which you are at  present concerned is not a trial of valour upon equal terms in order to escape the reproach of cowardice but your deliberations proceed at present about the means of self preservation that you may not be obli  ged to encounter those who must by far overpower  you ‚ Mel I ans BUT we on the contrary know that the entef  prizes of war have sometimes very different events G 2 to ¬ ¬ c ¬ 84 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V to those which superiority of numbers gave reason to  expect and in regard to ourselves that if we yield at once eternal despair must be our fate but by acting resolutely in our own desence we may yet en tertain a hope of success Athenians HOPE in this manner is ever applied to be the so lace of danger And truly in situations which can afford to be disappointed though ever prejudicial  it is not always fatal But such as idly lavish their  last resource their very all upon hope for it is prodigal by nature are only by their own ruin con  vinced of its delusion nay when its delusion is thus  by fad experience discovered and men should guard themselves against it it will not yet let go its hold in  the human heart Choose hot therefore so fatal a resource for yourselves in your present destitute situ  tion hanging as you are on the very brink of ruin Let not your conduct resemble the foolish behaviour of the mob of mankind who though by human  means their safety might be earned yet when cala mity hath chased away all visible hopes of redress  betake themselves to others of a darker cast to divi nations and to oracles and all such vain expedients  as hope suggesteth to draw them to their destruc tion    t  Me LI ANS DIFFICULT indeed as we apprehend and yoti well know the contest must prove to us against your strength and fortune matched as we are fo unequally together Yet the confidence still supporteth us that in fortune since of divine disposal we shall not  be inferior as with innocence on our side we stand a  gainst injustice that farther our desiciencies in strength b v the peloponnesian war 85 strength will be amplified by the addition of Lace d√ monian aid since it is incumbent upon them to  support us if from no other motive yet from the ties of blood and a sense of honour And thus it is  not intirely without good grounds that we can form  the resolution to withstand your esforts Athenians  NOR have we any reason to apprehend on our  own account that the divine benevolence will not e qually exert itself for us because neither our opini  ons nor our acts are worse than those of the rest  of mankind either in regard to the worship of the gods or an acknowledgement of their providence  For of the divine nature we think like the rest of the  world and of men that beyond a scruple they are impelled by the necessary bent of their nature to seize dominion wherever they have power As for ourselves we were not the authors of this constitu  tion nor were we the first who digested it into prac  tice We found it already in force we have accor  dingly applied it and shall leave it behind us for the  practice of every future age conscious that you  yourselves and every other State invested with e  qual power would make the fame exertion of it And truly so far as relateth to the gods we have no  more reason to distrust their protection than our neighbours But your sentiments of the Laced√  monians are such that you are confident of support  from them because it will be base in them to refuse  it Here we bless your simplicity but envy not your folly The Laced√ monians we allow amongst  one another and in paying all due regard to the laws  of their country give ample proofs of honour and  virtue But their behaviour towards the rest of mankind though it would open a large field  of censure were it to be minutely examined yet at present shall be shewn by one concise declara G 3  tion 86 THE PELOPONNESIAN WARi B V  tion that according to the best lights we have been able to collect they repute as honourable the things which please them and as just the things which promote their interest Such maxims are noe  in the least conducive to your preservation It is all ¬ chimera Mel i ans ¬ NO We ground our hopes of relief from them  upon their own clear conviction of whit their interest injoineth them This never can suffer them to enter  tain a thought of abandoning the Melians who are ¬ a colony of their own of being faithleis to the States  of Greece who wish them well or of promoting the schemes of the common foe Athenians OF consequence you imagine ¬ ¬ that their interest ¬ is connected with your security that the duties of juf ¬ tice should in honour be observed though attended  with dangers But these are maxims which the La s ced√ monians least of all men have resolution enough V to observe in fact Melians WE have the strongest grounds to imagine that  in our defence they will hazard any dangers from a  sense that their own preservation dependeth more on us than any other people as we are finely situated for  doing them service in Peloponnesus and in affection  are more faithfully attached to them through the ¬ bands of consanguinity THE NIANS B V TFTE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 87 Athenians BUT the certainty of obtaining succour in the in tervals of need seerhcth not to depend so much on the V merit of those who implore it as on the consciousness  of superior strength in those who are implored to give it A maxim this to which no State adheres  so strictly as the Laced√ monian Hence ever  through a diffidence of their own domestic force they  never dare even to invade their neighbours without the concurrence of numerous allies There cannor  therefore be the least room to expect that they  will transport an aid into an island whilst we are mas  ters of the sea Melians NOT perhaps of their own forces but they have  confederates enow to employ in this service The n sea of Crete is wide and spacious a passage through  it even the lords of the sea will find it more difficult  to obstruct than those who are intent on stealing it to  effect with safety Or grant they miscarry in the at  tempt at worst they can make a diversion upon your territory dr against the remainder of your depen dents who escaped the efforts of Brasidas And then  your attention and your arms must be drawn from a quarter where you have no right to six them for the  necessary defence of your own home and your own  appendage Athenians THOUGH such turns may intervene your own ¬ experience should teach you to distrust them For  you are not cannot be ignorant that the Athenians  never yet would condescend to raise a siege through G 4 hostile 88 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V  hostile dread But we cannot avoid observing that  in the whole course of this debate though de  clared by you to be held as the means of your preser vation you have not so much as started one single  point upon which wise men can presume to fisten the least considence of redress Your firmest security is placed in the faint hope of some distant contingen  ciesj but your present strength is merely trifling a  gainst the extensive scope of your anragonists Nay  victimsyou must fall to your own absurd prelumptions  unless when we are once withdrawn to give you time  to consult you determine to try some oth r expe  dient You will then no longer be controuled by that sense of fliame which when dishonour glareth besore and danger prefleth on precipitateth men in  to ruin For though they see with their eyes quite open into what an abyss they are going to plunge 1 yet to avoid the imputation of what the world sti ‚ leth dishonour ‚ so prevalent is the force of one be witching found though vanquished by it they  icorn to yield to reason wilfully embarrafiing then selves with incurable calamities and contracting a more shameful weight of dishonour through their own mad obstinacy than fortune could award them  Such consequences you are now concerned by mature  deliberations to avoid You are next to reflect that no shame can attend your plying under the force of a  most formidable Stale a State which designeth to make the moderate demands alone ‚ that you would accept her alliance and securely enjoy your territory upon the condition only to pay her tribute and  when war or safety are left to your own option that w you wpujd not peevishly prefer the worst For those  are the men to maintain themselves in credit and ft prosperity who never suffer their equals to insult V them who pay proper regard to their superiors and towards their infeiiors behave with moderation m Reflect on these points whilst we withdraw and reT  member B V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 8 member again and again that your country now  calleth for all your prudence since by the single de  liberation of this single day as either it taketh a prof perous or sinister turn her fate will be determi ned Here the Athenians withdrew from the conference and the Melians after being some time alone and re solving finally to reject what they had already refused gave in their answer thus    WE continue Athenians in the very fame senti  ments we have already declared We shall not in  an instant of time abandon that liberty which in the free possession of our own State we have enjoyed for the space of seven hundred years which still we shall  spare no endeavours to preserve intrusting it to that fortune which by divine permission hath hitherto  preserved it and to that redress we expect from hu f man aid and the Laced√ monians But thus much again we offer ‚ To be friends to you enemies to  neither on condition you quit our lands after an  accommodation ratified between us to our reciprocal  satissaction The Melians in this manner delivered their final an swer But the Athenians the very moment they quit ted the place of conference uttered themselves thus ¬ YOU Melians alone of all mankind are the persons so far as we can judge who regard future  contingencies as an over balance for instant dangers f and through mad presumption value things yet in visib e as really actual But the greater your depen  dence the more rash your considence upon Lace f d√ monians upon tortune and upon hope the more l abundantly fatal your delusions will prove And o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V And this said the Athenian deputation returned to their camp ‚  But the Athenian commanders upon this refusal of submission from the Melians applied themselves in stantly to the acts of war and dividing the work nf shares to the several parties in their army completes shut up the Melians in a line of circumvallation And¬ ‚ when this Was perfected and a sufficient number both of the Athenians and their dependents were appointed to flay behind and continue the blockade both by land and sea they departed with the bulk of their forces Those farther who were left for this service staid be hind and continued the blockade About the same time the Argives making an irrup tion into Phliafia and caught in an ambuscade laid for them by the Phliasians and their own exiles were slaughtered to the number of eighty 1 he Athenians by their excursions from Pylusy committed many depredations on the Laced√ monians But these had not influence enough upon the Laced√ monians to cause a renunciation of the peace or a re newal of the war They only proclaimed that  their people had free leave to make reprisals on the Athc ¬ nians The Corinthians also had a war with the Athenians on accourit of some private differences between them  but the rest of Peloponnesus interfered hot in the quar rel The Melians farther assaulting it by nighr carried that part of the Athenian circumvallation which lay close to their market They flew the guards who were posted there and having gained a conveyance into the town for provisions and all necessary stores they could pro cure by money they aftewards withdrew and disconti nued all efforts of resistance But the Athenians took care 3 V THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  9i care for the future to place a stronger guard upon their works And here the summer ended In the winter which followed the Laced√ monians drew out their forces in order to begin an expedition in to Argia j but when the victims offered on the fron tiers boded no success to the expedition they again withdrew Yet the Argives as such an invasion had been intended against them suspected it was owing to the intrigues of a faction within their city some of whom they immediately secured but the rest escaped by flight About the same time also the Melians carried ano ther part of the Athenian circumvallation as the party by which it was guarded was not numerous But up on such disturbances a strong reinforcement was sent from Athens under the command of Philocrates the son of Demeas The Melians were now closely invested on all fides and some schemes to betray the town be ing in agitation amongst them they thought proper to make a voluntary surrender This they did  at the dis  cretion of the Athenians who put to death all they found within the place able to bear arms and made the women and children staves The town they afterwards repeopjed by fending thither a colony of five hundred THE THE PELO P O N N E S I A N WAR BOOK VI In the fame winter the Athenians came to a resolu tion to make a second expedition against Sicily with a larger force than had been sent thither heretofore under Laches and Eurymedon and to attempt its total reduc tion The bulk of the people was in truth ignorant of the largeness of the island and of the multitude of the Grecians and Barbarians by whom it was inhabited ignorant farther that they were going to embark in a war not much less considerable than the Peloponnesian The compass of Sicily is little under eight days sail for a trading vessel and though it be so large it is severed from the main land so as not to be part of the conti nent by a gut in breadth but  twenty stadia The manner in which it was inhabited in the earliest ages was this and the several nations which possessed it these The Cyclops and Lestrigons are said to be the most ancient inhabitants of some part of this country but from what stock they were derived or from whence they came hither or what is become of them since I have nothing to relate Poetical amusements must here  Abcut 2 miles suffice ‚ B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 93 suffice or such information as every man picks up for his own use The Sicanians appear to be the first people who next to those inhabited this country though accord ing to their own accounts they are prior because they claim to themselves the original tenure But according to the truest discoveries they are found to have been I berians who were compelled to remove from the banks of the Sicanus in Iberia by the Libyans And from them at that time this island received the name of Si cania having before been called Trinacria They con tinue to this day to inhabit the western parts of Sicily After the taking of Troy some of the Trojans who had escaped the Ach√ ans arrive in their vessels upon the Sicilian shore and forming a settlement adjacent to the Sicanians they all took jointly the name of Ely mi and their cities were Eryx and Egesta They were also increased by the accession of some Phocians from Troy who having first been driven to Libya by a storm passed over afterwards from thence into Sicily The Siculi passed over first into Sicily from Italy for there they originally dwelled They fled before the O pici and as the story is told not without probability having observed how the current set within the strait and seized a favourable gale they crossed over upon rafts and perhaps by some other methods There are even to this very day a people in Italy called Siculi and that region in a similar manner obtained its name of Italy from a certain Arcadian king who bore the name of Italus These crossing into Sicily with for midable numbers and vanquishing the Sicanians in bat tle drove them into the southern and western parts caused the name of the island to be changed from Sica nia to Sicily settled themselves in and kept possession of the richest tracts in the country since their passage hither was near three hundred years earlier than the landing of any Grecians in Sicily Nay they continue  94 THE PELOPONNESUN WAR 8 to this very day in posieffion of the midland and north erly parts of the island The Ph≈ nicians also had settlements quite round the coast of Sicily They secured the capes on the sea and the small circumjacent isles for the fake of trafficking with the Sicilians But when the Grecians in consi derable numbers began to cross over and six their resi dence here the Ph≈ nicians abandoned their other set tlements and uniting together seated themselves at Motya and Soloeis and iPanormus near to the Ely mi secure of their own continuance in these quarters from their friendship with the Elymi and because from this part of Sicily the passage to Carthage is exceeding short ‚ So many were the barbarians seated in Sicily j and such the order of their setdements The first Grecians who came hither were the Chalci deans of Eub≈ a Thucles led the colony which set tled at Naxus and erected the altar of Apollo the Guide which is still to be seen without the city and on which the Reputations sent from hence to the oracles r offer sacrifice before they begin their voyage In the year following Archias a Corinthian of the race of Hercules founded Syracuse having previously expelled the Sicilians out of that island on which the inner city is seated though now no longer washed round about by the sea And in process of time the upper city also being taken in by a wall became exceeding populous In die fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse Thucles and his Chalcideans sallied forth out of Naxus and having by force of arms drove away the Sicilians they build Leontium and afterwards Catana But the Cataneans themselves declared Evarchus their founder About the same point of time Lamis also leading a colony from Megara arrived in Sicily and planted them on a spot called Trotilus upon the river Pantacias But removing afterwards from thence to 1 eontium he aslo ciated himself a short time with the Cataneans for the protection B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WA 95  protection of his party yet being ejected by them and then having founded Thapsus he dies His fol lowers upon this removed from Thapsus and Hy blon a Sicilian king betraying another pjace into their hands and becoming himself their conductor they fet tled those Megareans who are called Hybl√ an and af ter a continued possession of two hundred forty five years they were expeljed out of their city and territory by Ge¬ Ion tyrant of the Syracusans Yer before this eject ment about a hundred years after thejr settlement there they had sent out Pammilus and built the city pf Selinus Pammilus had come thither more lately from Megara their mother city and assisted them in making this new settlement at Selinus Antiphemus from Rhodes and Entimus from Crete each leading a separate colony founded Gfcla in con junction in the forty fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse The name of this npw city was taken from the river Gela Yet the spot where the city now stands and which was first walled round is called Lindii But their polity was framed upon the Doric model In the hundred and eighth year as near as possible after this last settlement the Geloans built Acragas gi ving the city its name from the river Acragas They declared Aristonous and Pystilus to be its founders and gave it the civil institutions of Gela Zancle was originally founded by a band of pirates who arrived there from Cyme a Chalcidic city in Opi cia though afterwards a numerous reinforcement from Chalcis and the rest of Eubcea joined them and pos sessed that district in community The founders were Perieres and Crat√ meneSi one of them from Cyme the other from Chalcis But the name of Zancle was first of all gi ven it by the Sicilians becauie in shape it bears relemblance to a scythe and the Sicilians call n scythe zamlum But in procels of time these people were driven from thence by the Samians and other Io nians who flying from the Medes had landed in Sici 96 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vf y And after a short interval Anaxilas tyrant of the Rhegians ejected the Samians repeopled the city with a number of mixed inhabitants and changed its name to Meslene in honour of the country from whence he was originally descended Himera also was founded from Zancle by Euclides and Simus and Sacon In to this colony came also a very numerous body of Chal cideans Some exiles farther from Syracuse who had been worsted in a sedition and were distinguished by the title of Miletid√ took up their residence amongst them Hence their dialect became a mixture of the Chalcidic and the Doric but the Chalcidic model obtained ill their civil institutions Acr√ and Casmen√ were founded by the Syracusans Acre seventy years after Syracuse and Casmen√ near twenty after Acr√ Camarina also was first founded by the Syracusans very nearly one hundred thirty five years after the building of Syracuse Its founders were Dascon and Menecolus But the Camarineans being af terwards driven out by the arms of the Syracusans be cause of a revolt in process of time Hippocrates ty rant of Gela received the lands of the Camarineans as a ransom for some Syracusan prisoners of war and ta king upon himself to be their founder replanted Ca marina Yet once more again it was demolished by Gelon and replanted a third time by the same Gelon So many nations of Greeks and Barbarians inhabited Si cily An island so large and so populous the Athenians were passionately bent on invading Their truest and final view was to compass its total reduction but the pretext alledged for a colour was their readiness to succour such as by blood were related or by prior alli ances had been attached to them An Egestean embas sy now residing at Athens laboured the point with all possible industry and with extraordinary earnestness pressed them to engage in ir For the Egesteans who bordered upon the Selinuntians had been embroiled in 4 war B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 97 war with the latter about some connubial points and a certain tract of land to which both laid claim The Selinuntians farther4 assisted by their Syracuf an allies pressed hard upon them both by land and sea And hence the Egesteans were now suggesting at Athens that  they ought not to forget their alliance with the  Leonttnes made by Laches in the former warre questing farther that a naval force might be sent thither for their succour To this purpose many other argu ments were alledged by them but the principal was this If the Syracusans who have overthrown the Leon  tines be left in the unmolested enjoyment of their conquest and proceed still farther to destroy the re maining parties of that alliance they will get into  their hands the whole power of Sicily Such an e vent would be attended with the utmost danger lest  in consequence of it as they were Doric by descent they might think themselves bound by the ties of blood to assist with a powerful armament their kin  dred Dorians and in quality of colonies might suc cour those Peloponnesians by whom they were origi  nally planted and thus form a combination to de molish the Athenian empire In policy therefore the Athenians were obliged to support the allies who yet remained in order to make head against the Sy racusans and this the more readily as they them selves would undertake to furnissi them with sums of money equal to the exigencies of the war With such discourle the Athenians were frequently entertained in their popular assemblies as the Egestean embassa dors still urging their point had gained many advo cates to second their arguments And at length it was decreed that embassadors should be previously dis  patched to Egesta to inspect the state of their wealth whether they had such sums as they talked of in the public treasury and the temples and also to draw  up a report of the present posture of their war against Vol II H the  98 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL the Selinuntians And in pursuance of this the embassadors from the Athenians were sent to Sicily The Laced√ monians in the same winter joined by their allies those of Corinth excepted and marching into Argia ravaged a small part of that territory and carried off the corn having brought carriages for that purpose They also removed the Argive exiles to Or nea and left them a small detachment from their main army for the security of their persons A temporary truce being also made during which the Orneat√ and Argives were to abstain from all hostilities against one another they drew off the army to their respective homes However not long after this the Athenians arrived with thirty sail of ships and six hundred heavy armed The Argives in conjunction with the Athenians took the field with all their strength and besieged those in Grnea for the space of a day But as at night the be siegers removed to a distance in order for repose those of Ornea made their escape On the day following the Argives when sensible of their escape levelled Or nea with the ground and then withdrew And after wards the Athenians re embarked for Athens The Athenians also threw in by sea a party of horse men into Methone a frontier town on Macedonia With these consisting of their own citizens and such Macedonians as had refuged among them they harras sed the country belonging to Perdiccas But the Lace d√ monians sent a summons of aid for Perdiccas to the Chalcideans of Thrace who kept terms with the Athe nians by truces renewed every tenth day These howe ver refused to march Thus ended the winter and with it the sixteenth year of the war of which Thucydides hath compiled the history YEAR JB VIi THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  YEAR XVII J IN the succeeding summer very early in the spring the Athenian embassadors returned from Sicily accompa nied by the Egesteans They brought sixty talents of uncoined silver being a month s pay for sixty fail of ships the equipment of which for succour they were instructed to solicit from the Athenians Upon this an assembly of the people was called and the reports ef the Egistean and their own embassadors were recei ved consisting of many points specious indeed but false in fact and so far as related to their treasure that  sums ample enough are already reposited in their  temples and their public treasury In consequence of this a decree was made that  a fleet of sixty ships should sail for Sicily the commanders Alcibiades the son of Clinias Nicias the son ot Niceratus and i amachus the son of Xenophanes to be invested  with full powers to act at their own discretion The J Before Christ 415  Lamachus the third in this commission seems to have been picked out for the command for the peculiar constitution of his own character which was a proper ifieari bet veen the cautious and phlegmatic disposition of Nicias and the siery impetu ous ardour of Alcibiades He was now according to Plutarch a brave old experien ced officer In his youth he had been rtm rkable for heat and fire a length of ser vice and years had mellowed him into the right temper to deliberate beforehand and then gallantly to carry the point into execution But then he wanted the means of properly supporting the authority and dignity of His post He was now ranked with two of the most wealthy and noble Athenians whereas his own condition was low nay he was according to Plutarch so exceedingly poor that berore he went to any foreign command he was used to petition the Slate for a little money to fur nifli him out and even to buy him some hoes Mr Wofli in his notes on Thucy dides refers in for his character to a comedy of Aristophanes The Acbarniam j that is to enquire after the character of a plain blunt officer from a professed droll or to seek ttuih from him who ridiculed all mankind Aristophanes hath represent ed Lamachus as a vain glorious roaring bully a mere thing of arms a creature of ver bal p mp and parade contrary to all the truth of history Writers who live by turnirtg great ard good men into ridicule should never be reckoned good evidence as to the truth and reality of characters when history dissents H 2 whole ioo THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V1 whole armament to act as an aid to the Egisteans a gainst the Selinuntians to replace also the Leontines in their former habitations if the state of the war gave them leisure to execute that service and to  manage all other points in Sicily as they should judge most beneficial for the Athenian interest But the fifth day after this another assembly of the people was held upon the ways and means to expedite the equipment of the fleet and by proper decrees to supply the commanders with what might be requisite to accelerate their departure Nicias who against his will had been named for a commander was persuaded that the public determinations were rash and premature since on short examination and motives merely spe cious they were bent on the total reduction of Sicily ‚ an arduous undertaking Now theresore he stood up and having a mind to stop proceedings he advised the Athenians as follows I AM aware that the present assembly is held to concert the means of expediting our preparations and to get all in readiness for the expedition to Sicily But in my sentiments we ought once more to re fume the consideration of the previous point Whe ther upon the whole it be adviseable to equip out such a fleetand nor by rash and premature re   solves on points of such vast importance through too easy compliance with foreign solicitations to em broil ourselves in an unnecessary war For my own part truly I am invested with honour by the present  measures and no man upon earth is so little anxious about his own personal safety But at the same time  I pronounce that person to be a valuable member of the public who makes use of all his prudence to preserve his own lise and property For such an one purely for his own private benesit must be desirous that the public welsare flourish and abound Bur  however neither in the preceding assemblies could   the B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 101 the preeminence of honour awarded tome bias me to speak in contradiction to my judgement nor shall it  bias me at present but what I think tends most to the public good that only ball I utter I am also sensible that what I can urge may have  but little influence on Athenian tempers when I at tempt persuading you to secure what you already possess and not to hazard the present for things invi sible and future but that your eagerness is quite un seasonable and that the ends which you too san guinely propose are not easy to be accomplished  ‚ these things I shall clearly demonstrate To this purpose I aver that if the intended expe  dition proceeds you are going to leave many ene  mies behind you here and to take the most certain method of setching hither more numerous opponents You imagine perhaps that the late peace will be  firm yand constantly observed though it is merely a nominal peace and that only so long as you remain  inactive Nay such it hath been made by the con duct of some even of our own community And  Ihould any considerable force of ours have the  unhappiness to sink under hostile efforts our old  enemies will be suddenly upon us j since merely by calamities they were reduced to an accommodation  and in a manner more disgraceful to chemselves than to us were necessitated to treat In the next place  we have found that in the treaty itself many arti  cles are still controverted There are farther di  vers States and those by no means the weakest t who have not accepted the accommodation but on  the contrary are still in arms against us whilst o  thers are inhibited merely by ten day truces and that only because the Laced√ monian measures are hither to pacific But suddenly perhaps when once they  find our strength divided the very measure into  which we are now precipitating ourselves they may  fall upon us in a general combination augmented by H 3 the 102 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI the strength of Sicily whose accession to their for mer confederacy they would have been glad to pur  chase at any price On these possibilities we are bound sedately to reflect that we may not plunge a State so highly exalted into superfluous dangers nor 1 fondly covet to wrest their empire from the hands  of others before we have adequately insured our  own Since the Chalcideans of Thrace though so  many years are now elapsed since they first revolted  are not yet reduced and some other States on the continent render us only a precarious obedience Yet‚ to the Egesteans our old allies who are injuriously oppressed we are bound in honour to send  a most speedy succour And in the mean time  we continue to defer avenging ourselves upon those  whose revolt from us is of long standing now and whose injustice we are still obliged to suffer Though the Utter could we once bring them back to their duty we might easily controul for the suture But the former should we ever become their masters re mote and numerous as they are we should not with out difficulty be able to awe It must be madness therefore to invade that people whom though con quered you can  never retain in their obedience and who in case the attempt against them miscarry will for the future be much more disaffected towards you than they were before that attempt was made But it is farther my real opinion that the Sicilians as their affairs are now circumstantiated would be  come less formidable to us if once reduced to the Syracusan yoke ‚ and yet on this remote contingen cy the Egesteans have chiefly insisted in order to a larm us Perhaps nozv it may come to pass that its single States may combine against us to gratify the  Laced√ monians But in the other case it is quite improbable that an united empire would hazard its own welfare to demolish another For if acting  from a political precaution they may side with the  Peloponnelians B VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 103  Peloponnesians to overturn our empire those very  Peloponnesians may probably from the fame princi pie concur wiih us to demolish the Sicilian As for us the Grecians there may have reason to dread  us most if we go not at all amongst them and  what is next to that if we only give them a sight  of our power for a short time and then withdraw But if acting osfensively we incur miscarriage they  will instantly despise us and join our neighbouring  foes to annoy us here For things that are placed  most remotely from us as likewise those which yield no opportunity of adjusting our opinion of them by  experience such it is universally known are most apt to excite admiration Reflect ye citizens of A thens that your present elevation of spirits is owing to your success against the Laced√ monians and allies  You crouched for fear under their first attacks till having gained the superiority over them to their utter disappointment you instantly despised them And now nothing less than Sicily can content you We by no means ought to be too much buoyed up by the  dilasters os our soes but only to be so far consident as  we are able to awe their intriguing tempers We ought to ascribe no other view to the Laced√ monians than a vigilant care to seize the first opportunity of wiping  off their disgrace by giving us a blow and thus reco vering their former reputation and that they are  most earnest on accomplishing this since from time  immemorial the glory of military valour hath been their warmest most prevailing passion Our welfare theresore is we knew in what our welfare consists by no means summons us to enter the lists in be half of the Egesteans of Sicily who to us are mere  barbarians but to exert our utmost vigilance to guard our own constitution srom oligarchical in croachments My duty obligeth me also to remind you that we have had but a short respite to breathe from the ha ll 4  voc 104 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL s  voc made amongst us by pestilence and war and  to repair the prodigious waste of our fortunes and our lives These according to all the rules of equi ty should be reserved for our own domestic exigen cies and not be lavished away on a set of fugitives who implore our protection and are bound in inte rest to tell specious falsehoods though whilst plun g ng tneir neighbours into hazards they have no thing but words to contribure and hould we re dress them know not how to be grateful but in  cafe we miscarry in the attempt must involve their  friends in their own destruction If there be farther a person who elevated with M his own designation to the command incites you  earnestly to sail heedful of nothing but his own pri vate views nor qualified by his years for so important a trust if his passion be merely to excite admiration for his fine breed of horses or by the gains of his  commission to repair the havoc ot his fortune caused  by prodigality I conjure you to afford no such per son an opportunity to maite a splendid figure at the expence of your country But rest convinced that  men of such a turn will be corrupt in public office as they are bad ceconomists in private life that the enterprize in hand is a very arduous trust far be f yond such measures or luch exploits as a stripling can devise or execute I own myself intimidated by that crowd of youths  who fit by this per on and abet his schemes I am  hence obliged to implore the men of years and expe rience who happen to sit near them by no means to dread that appearance of pusillanimity which in cafe this decree of war be revoked might be objec ted to them by no means to indulge the same raw passions by which boys are actuated so as to dote upon remote contingencies You gentlemen by experience are convinced that success exceedingly seldom Jesuits from hot and sanguine presumption w but B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 105  but most frequently from calm and prudent delibera tion In behalf therefore of your country which is now on the brink of more critical dangers than e ver it was known before hold up your hands in op  position and support what I am going to move namely ‚ That  the Sicilians confining themselves  within their present limits which we do not pretend  to abridge with free navigation along the coast of the Ionian gulf and transacting their own affairs  at large through the whole extent of the Sicilian seas be at liberty to take care of their own concerns with  out any molestation ‚ And in particular to return the Egesteans the following answer Since without the privity of the Athenians they have al  ready involved themselves in a war against the Seli nuntians let them also without the concurrence of the Athenians bring it to a conclusion That  moreover we shall form no alliance for the future  as hath formerly been the case with men whose indi  rest behaviour we must be forced to abet though when we stand in need of reciprocal assistance from  them we shail get none at all And you sir who at present preside in this assem bly if you are conscious that it is your dury to su perintend the public welfare if you are desirous to behave like a worthy patriot put the question and call upon the Athenians once more to give their votes And in cafe you are afraid to act contrary to order in proposing what is counter to a former decree reflect that when so great a crowd of wit nesses are at hand to justify the ltep you only act the  part of a physician to your country which hath fwal  lowed down pernicious counsels and that he best dilchargeth the duty of first magistrate who will render to his country all the service he is able at least with his eyes open will never suffer it to be  hurt In io6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI In this manner Nicias delivered his sentiments But the far greater part of the Athenians who were present declared for the expedition and against the repeal of what had been already decreed Some however there were who made a fruitless opposition The person who shewed molt ardour and pressed them most earnestly to proceed was Alcibiades the son of Clinias partly from a resolution to oppose Nicias with whom in other political points he generally clashed and because he had calumniously glanced at him in his speech but principally because he was ambitious of being at the head of this expedition He presumed that not Sicily only but Carthage also might be re duced by himself and when he should be the author of so great a success that he must needs abound in wealth and glory His credit was great at present a mongst the citizens but the warmth of his passions threw him into larger expences than his fortune could support being sumptuous in every article of life and especially in horses And it was chiefly by him that the final overthrow of Athens was at length occasioned For the bulk of the city alarmed at the great irregular rity of his private life the excessive luxury of his dress and diet as also at that greatness of spirit which he shewed in every single branch of his conduct turned out enemies to him as a man who affected the tyranny And though when in public commands he conducted the war with the utmost bravery yet at home each single citizen was chagrined at his manners and displa ced him to make room for others which soon drew af ter it the subversion of the State Upon this occasion therefore Alcibiades stood up and advised the Athe nians as follows i  YES to me ye citizens of Athens in preserence  toothers this command is due ‚ for with this I  must needs begin since on this point Nicias hath at tacked B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 107 tacked me ‚ and I also judge myself deserving of the  trust In regard to those things which have caused me to be so loudly censured those very things give splendor to my ancestors and to myself and are of public emolument also to my country The great magnisicence I displayed at the Olympic solemnities hath raised in the Grecians an idea of Athens far be  yond its actual strength though previous to this they entertained the hope of being able totally to war her down For I am the man who brought seven  chariots thither more than any private person ever furnished out before who carried off the first and  the second and the fourth prize and in all other respects supported my quality as a victor Such things it must be owned are declared to be honour  by the laws of Greece and whenever atchieved   they leave a high opinion of power behind them  The splendid figure I have made at home whether  in exhibiting entertainments for the public or any o  ther method of munificence may naturally excite the envy of Athenians but are to strangers instances of  our grandeur And that man s extravagant spirit is  not useless to the public who at his own private  expence does service not merely to himself but to  a whole community Nor can it imply injustice for  a person whose sentiments are generous and exalted to soar above the ordinary level since should he af  terwards be reduced to a state of depression no man  is to share in his reverse of fortune As therefore in calamity we are not to expect even civil salutations  let others in the mean time submit as in justice they ought to that assuming behaviour which prosperity  inspireth or at least let equality of demeanor be first shewn by him who demands it as a debt from an other 1 am indeed aware that persons of such un  common elevation and all in general who in some  splendid qualities outshine the crowd must so long  as they live be the objects of spleen chiesly to those who o8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI who claim equality with them and in the next place to those amongst whom they are conversant And yet to succeeding generations they leave an ambition of claiming affinity to them though quite groundless and chimerical and to their country whatever it be the haughty boast that they were  not aliens were not offenders but citizens of its own  growth and patriots of true renown and worth Of  such reversionary honours I own myself ambitious  and in order to succeed in the pursuit have ever rendered my name illustrious in private life and as to my public behaviour reflect Athenians whether I am inferior to any person whatever in performing good services to my country For I am the person  who without throwing you into hazard or expence  have brought the strongest powers of Peloponnesus to act in your concurrence who reduced the Laces d√ monians to stake their ell upon the fortune of one day at Mantinea It is true they came off victori ous from the contest but have not even yet so far resumed their spirits as to dare to act offensively Such are the exploits which my greener years nay  even that unnatural giddiness imputed to me hath at  chieved which by insinuating language hath made the Peloponnesian strength to ply before it and gt  ving energy to my frantic humour hath now persua ded the world that it is no longer to be dreaded Whilst therefore I flourish in this manner whilst  Nicias yet continues to be esteemed jortunatey lay hold of that service we are each of us able to per  form and by no means repeal the decree of our ex pedition to Sicily as if intended against a people we are not able to encounter For in Sicily the cities swarm with crowds of pro miscuous disunited inhabitants inhabitants for ever ¬ used to sudden revolutions and to perpetual fluctua tions And hence not one of thoje crowds is equip ped with such arms as are requisite to defend a native soil B VL THE PELOPONNESTAN WARj 109 soil or to secure even personal safety nor is the re gion supplied with the needful stores of resistance  It is the habit of each either to execute his purpose by artful language or to wrest it from the public by sedition These arc all his resources and if they fail at the worst he barely shifts his habitation 1c is therefore improbable that a rabble so jumbled to gether will ever be unanimousty guided by one con certed plan or combine together for its just execu tion Each moment they will be veering about to such expedients as happen most to soothe their ca price and the more upon account of these seditions in which we are informed they are already em  broiled Their number of heavy armed it must also be ob  served is not so large as the pompous accounts of fame have made it nor does the sum total of the Grecians amongst them turn out so considerable as each  city hath computed for her own But Greece in this manner ever addicted most terribly to belie her  own numbers hath been sound in the present war scarce able to provide hersels with arms  Such according to the best informations I have  been able to collect is the present condition of af fairs in Sicily Nay there are means within our reach still more to facilitate its reduction For we shall obtain the concurrence of many barbarians seat ed there who from inveteracy against the Syracu  sans4 will join us to attack them Neither can any  obstacles accrue from the situation of our affairs near  er home if you only view it in the just and proper   light  The bravery of our fathers though opposed by the very same enemies who at present it is urged  should we fail for Sicily must be left behind us though opposed by all the power of the Mede erected  this our empire by the sol refource of their superi  ority in naval power The Pcloponnesians farther have io THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  have never had less hopes of being a match for us than at this very juncture even though their strength be in all its maturity of vigour It is true they have it ever in their option to make inroads into our domini  ons even though we wave this expedition but at sea they never can be able to hurt us The fleet we shall leave behind will be amply sufficient to make head against them By what plausible arguments therefore can we ex  cuse our behaviour should we now pufillanimoufly desist what evasion can we find to deny our confcde rates the succour they demanded We are bound in  honour by the oaths we have sworn to undertake  their redress Unavailing is the pretext that they have never done such good offices for us Our alii  ance with them was not made on the condition of their sailing hither to bring us succour but of giving such full employ to our enemies there as might effectu ally deter them from coming hither The ready road to empire as not Athenians only but every people who have risen to a summit of power by ex perience know is ever to succour those who implore  our protection whether they be Greeks or barba  rians For had it been the constant method to che rifh indolent inactive measures or minutely to liti gate who in justice ought to be protected the en largement of our empire had been but trifling or ra ther we had been liable to the loss of our original portion For a Stale invested with superior power is not only openly opposed in the field but recourse  is had to every precaution to prevent their appear  ance in it Neither is it in our power to prescribe ex act or arbitrary limitations to our own empire but we are by necessity compelled to cabal against some and with a high hand to keep others in subjection because should we relax our command over others we endanger our own authority and those we will not awe may become our mailers Nor farther ought B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Ml  ought peace to be so much the object of regard to you as it is to other people unless you new model c your government and render it conformable to that  of your neighbours Weigh therefore these arguments and be convin  ced that thus only our interest is capable of any con  siderable advancement ‚ if we proceed against Sicily and execute the expedition in order to deject the  haughty Peloponnesian spirit by so plain art instance how much we despise them how little fond we are at present of this inactive interval and how eager to begin again with a Sicilian voyage And by acting thus there is probability on our side that in cafe we subdue the people there we may gain the sove reignty over all Greece or at worst we shall de press the Syracusan power The latter point alone will be an important service to ourselves and our at lies But in case any measure of success attends us  our ships will enable us to secure our acquisitions or  at worst our departure For though the whole body of the Sicilians combine together against us we shall be absolute masters of our own retreat Let not therefore the words of Nicias calculated ‚ merely for the service of sloth and to raise dissentions  between the young and the old disconcert your plan But let the usual decorum take place observant   of which our forefathers at whose consultations both the seniors and the youths assisted exalted this State  to its present height and do you now adhering to  the established practice endeavour its farther exasta tion Remember also that youth and age ifdebar  red one another s reciprocal assistance lose all their  influence and weight that on the other hand from ct the wildness of youth and the moderation of the middle aged and the consummate prudence of the old when tempered harmoniously together the most  persect strength must infallibly result that a State which supinely gives way to sloth like other things  for U2 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI for want of exercise must infallibly droop and pine away and the whole of her skill grow old and obso lete but when inured to uninterrupted conflict ic is continually improving by practice and will gain a persect habit of surmounting every obstacle j not by a parade of words but by active perseverance Upon the whole 1 am firmly convinced that a State which hath been accustomed to full employ must soon droop into destruction if it resigns itself to stoth v and that such persons take the best method of infallibly securing their welfare who adhere most steadily to their present customs and laws though  possibly better might be substituted in their stead In this manner Alcibiades spoke And the Athe nians moved by his arguments which were also se conded by the intreaties of the Egestean and Leontine exiles who standing forth in the assembly implored their protection and reminding them of their oaths adjured them to redress their wrongs ‚ declared for the expedition with a warmer zeal than at any time before Nicias was convinced by this that whatever dissuasion he could alledge would be quite incapable to change their refolves Yet as possibly by a minute detail of the immense preparations he was going to demand he might caule them at once to change their sentiments he stood up again and re addressed them as follows I PERCEIVE Athenians that your resolutions are fixed on this expedition beyond the power of dis suasion and may its event be such as your wishes portend But I shall once more beg leave to com  municate to you my own sense of the affair According to the best informations I have been a  ble to procure we are now going to invade a num ber of powerful cities cities independent ofonean  other nor standing in need of public revolutions which people who cringe under the yoke of slavery  mighe B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 113  might readily embrace in order to render their con dition more supportable Nor is it farther to be presumed that they will readily exchange their own M liberty for subjection to us as they are numerous ac least for one island and many of them inhabited by Grecians For without reckoning Naxus and Ca M tana which I hope upon account of their affinity to  the Leontines will side with us there are no less than  seven provided in all respects with as good martial ha biliments and stores as our own armies  and more particularly those against which we chiefly bend our course Selinus and Syracuse These cities abound with  soldiers heavy armed with archers and with darters  They have a great number of triremes and plenty of hands toman them They possess a large quanti ty of wealth not only in private purses but in their public treasuries So rich are even the Selinuntians  And to the Syracusans farther a tribute is paid by  several barbarians But the points in which they  most of all excel us are that numerous cavalry of which they are possessed and corn of their own  growth sufficient to answer all demands without fo  reign importations An armament therefore sini ply naval will by no means be sufficient to cope with such a strength A large land force must accompa ny the naval if we are desirous of performing such atchievements as may be worthy the greatnelsof our plan and would not be debarred an opportunity  of landing by their numerous cavalry And this will  be yet more needful should the cities alarmed at  our approach combine together against us and no  other friends but the Egesteans join us or supply us with a body of cavalry sufficient to countenance our landing It would be a terrible disgrace should we be compelled by force to give over our design or to  send for a larger supply as if our councils at first fet ting out were rash and ill concerted We must steer  ar once against them with preparations in all respects Vol II I  well U4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI well proportioned to the design since we know that we are bound to a land far remote from our own and are under many disadvantages to grapple with our foes It will not be now your employment to march  to the relief of your dependents seated near to A thens against a hostile invasion where all the needsul supplies would be brought to your camp out of the  territories of friends but you are to roam to a dif  tant climate where you cannot call one inch of ground  your own and from whence in the four winter months  vou will scarcely be able to send a messenger to A thens In my opinion therefore it is incumbent upon us  to carry thither large parties of heavy armed to be raised out of our own citizens our allies and our dependents and an additional strength of Pelopon  nesians if we are able to procure it by persuasion or  by pay Our archers and stingers must be also nu merous that we may be able to make good our de scent in spite of the Sicilian horse We must alfo be attended by supernumerary vessels that we may be enabled with greater ease to fetch in necessaries for  our army We must also carry with us from A thens in our tenders a great quantity of corn such as wheat and barley parched j with bakers fome  of whom for certain wages must be obliged to grind that if our armament lie any where weather  bound we may not stand in need of the necessaries of life For so numerous as we must be it will not be possible for every city to receive us All other  provisions must be laid in by ourselves to the utmost  of our power and we must trust for nothing to the  care of others But what concerns us most is to carry from hence  a fund of money as ample as we can raise As for that which the Egesteans pretend is already laid up for our use conclude it to be so only so far as words  are current For unless we set out from Athens not fc V i TWE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 115 I riot barely provided as well as those we are to encoun ter but equality in strength for battle alone ex  cepted in all other respects far surpassing them in e  very needful appointment ‚ ‚ we shall hardly be able to reduce who are to be reduced or even to protect  who are to be protected We should regard ourselves in the character of people who are going to seek a new settlement among aliens and enemies andj as such are necessitated to render themselves victors of the spot the very day they land or to   rest assured if they then miscarry that the whole of that region will be in arms against them Of this I own myself afraid against this I am convinced that  by repeated consultations we ought timely to pro  vide and after all must trust still farther to the  goodness of our fortune hazardous as we are but  men Yet hence I should be glad to set out in this  enterprize with as little occasion as possible to rely on uncertain fortune and to be amply provided with e t very expedient for a successful expedition For these to my apprehension are the readiest means to secure  the public welfare and the safety of us who are desti  ned for the voyage But if any man thinks my reasons chimerical I am ready to resign my com  marid to his superior abilities ‚ In this manner Nicias delivered himself with a view if possible to discourage the Athenians from proceeding by so vast a demand of articles requisite to the design or at least that in case he must be obliged to under take the service he might set out with such ample expe dients of security Yet all this bulky and embarrassing demand of ap pointments could not raise in the Athenians the least a version to the expedition but rather fastened their ea gerness upon it more intensely than ever and Nicias prevailed on that side of the question where he hoped to have been deseated It was now universally agreed I  that iib THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL that his advice was just and proper and if obeyed the expedition must be attended with all imaginable securi ty AH ranks of men were now equally seized with a fondness for the voyage For such as were advanced in years were confident that a career of success must attend the enterprise and that so formidable an armament could not possibly miscarry the younger sort were ani mated with the desire of seeing so remote a clime and gratifying at large the curiosity of their tempers assu red that safety would attend their course the bulk of the populace and the soldiery in general were pleased with their present assignment of pay and the hope of en larging dominion which would afford them perpetual employ and subsistence The passions of the generality were for these causes so vehemently elated with the pro ject that such as could by nq means approve were a fraid to oppose it by a vote lest they might be censu red as men who malevolently opposed the public glory And by this all opposition was effectually quashed At length a certain Athenian standing forth from amongst the crowd and calling aloud upon Nicias told him ‚ He must no longer cast about for evasions nor meditate delays but declare expressly now in the presence of them all the particulars of the prepa  rations which the Athenians fliould vote him Nicias though sorry at his heart was obliged to re ply ‚ That  in order to be exact he ought to con  suit more leisurely with his colleagues But so far  as he could judge in this sudden manner they ought to set out with a fleet consisting of at least one hun  dred triremes that the Athenians themselves ought  to furnish as many transports for heavy armed sol diers as was possible and to send for an additional num  ber from their dependents that the number of hea vy armed both of Athenians and dependents should  at least be five thousand and if possible more 5 that to these the rest of their preparations should be proportioned such as archers to be levied at home    and B VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 117  and procured also from Crete not forgetting slingers  and in fine that whatever should be judged in any degree expedient should be provided in good time and carried along with them in the fleet This the Athenians had no sooner heard than they instantly voted ¬ That the generals were invested  with absolute authority to determine the numbers of the expedition and the whole procedure of the voyage at their own discretion as might best pro mote the public welfare In pursuance of this the preparations were immedi ately in hand Summonses for the quotas adjusted were sent to their dependents and the levies at home went briskly forwards Athens was now finely recover ed from the pestilence and a long continued destructive war both in a multitude of young men now arrived at the vigour of their age and an increase of the public revenues by favour of the peace By this means all the needful supplies were more easily provided and thus were the Athenians busied for the present in fitting out their armament But at this very juncture almost all the statues of Mercury wherever found within the precincts of A thens and according to the established custom they were very numerous both in the porches of private houses and the public temples f      had their faces disfigured in the space of one night The authors of this outrage were not known but large rewards were osfered by the State in order to discover them and a decree was also passed that if any person knew of the  I have omitted two words in the original because I cannot

How such a description can be applicable to a statue will be hard to conceive Whether they allude to the inclosure in which the statues were erected or to the form of the pedestals or whether a Mercury was carved on any or all the sides of a souare stone I am not able to decide The Mercuries were very numerous j and many of them it is certain were strange uncouth and very bung ling

stave This accident in truth made a deep impression on their minds For it was construed as a bad omen in regard to the expedition in hand and as an evidence of fome terrible combination to introduce innovations and an overthrow of the democracy An information was at length given in by some fo journers and their footmen relating indeed not at all to the Mercuries but to the defacements of other images committed sormerly by some young men in a frolicsome and drunken mood  and how farther  they had cele braced  the Mysteries in private houses by way of  mockery and amongst others they also accused Alcibiades The party most inveterate against him caught readily at this charge As he was the main ob stacle to the advancement of their own popularity and credit they concluded that in case they could rid them selves of him they might at once become leaders of the State Hence they aggravated the charge and bellowed aloud that those mystic frolics and the defacements of  the Mercuries struck at the very foundations of the  democracy  and that none of these outrageous acts  had been committed without his participation They alledged as a circumstance that corroborated the charge the whole tenor of his behaviour flagrantly licentious and quite inconsistent with a democratical constitution Alcibiades endeavoured forthwith to clear himself the best he could from all appearances of guilt and declared himself ready before he entered upon the voyage to submit to a trial for the armament was now almost com pleted and if proved to be guilty to suffer the pe ‚ The sacred Mysteries celebrated by the Athenians at Eleusis Plutarch relates that the informers were brought in by one Androcles a demagogue a virulent foe of Alcibiadea They deposed that one Theodorus acted the part of

nalties of law and only if acquitted to take upon him the command He conjured them farther  to receive no calumnious accusations against him in his absence but if he was really guilty to put him instantly to  death  ‚ that in common prudence it could not be justified to intrust a person so heavily charged  with the command of so large an armament before his innocence had been regularly explored But his enemies ‚ apprehensive that in case he was brought to an immediate trial he would be supported by all the favour of the soldiery and that the people whose idol he was might possibly relent because in com pliment to him the Argives and some of the Mantineans accompanied the expedition ‚ opposed and put osf the prosecution They put the management of this point i into the hands of a set of orators who urged that  for  the present he might proceed in his voyage that the   expedition ought not to be deferred on his account and upon his return a day mould be assigned for his trial Their design was to gather more heavy mat ter against him which in his absence could be more easily effected and then to recal him and force him to his trial In short it was resolved that Alcibiades  should go the voyage 1 Things being thus determined and the year now advanced to the middle of summer the fleet set sail for Sicily Orders had been iffued before for the bulk of the consederates and victualling ships and small craft and all the tenders in general  to repair to and assemble together at Coreyra that from thence in a body they might cross the Ionian to the cape of Japygia But such as were subjects of Athens and such of the confederates as were then in the city marching down to the Pir√ us on the appointed day by morning s dawn went on board the ships in order to weigh and be gone They were conducted thither by a great crowd it may be laid by the whole crowd of Athens both citizens and strangers The former attended to perform the  I 4 parting no THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL parting decorums where their several attachments claim ed it some to their friends some to their relations some to their own sons The whole company moved along with a medley of hope and lamentation with hope that success would attend their course with lamentation lest they might never meet again The lad recollecti on occurred ‚ to how great a distance from their native soil they were going to be sent And now that the hour of departure was come and when this moment they were going to be dismissed into scenes of danger the impressi ons of terror were felt with much keener fense than when the expedition was only decreed However at the sight of their present strength of the numerous expedients of a prosperous enterprise which their eyes beheld their spirits were again elated   As for the strangers and bulk of the crowd they at tended merely for the pleasure of gazing at the means intended to accomplish a great and stupendous design For never did any one State of Greece before this time equip by its own strength such a powerful armament It was the finest and most glorious fleer that to this day the world had seen It is true in number of ships and heavy armed on board that which sailed against Epi daurus under command of Pericles and that also against Pottd√ a under Agnon where by no means inferior For those carried four thousand heavy armed soldiers all native Athenians with three hundred horsemen The number of their triremes was a hundred fifty more were furnished by the Lesbians and Chians besides a large number of confederates who attended those expeditions But then they were fitted for a voyage in comparison trifling and in a flight and penurious manner On the contrary the present equipment was calcula ted for a length of time and completely fitted out for both services as occasion might demand either of the sea or of the land The shipping at the great expence of the captains of the several triremes and of the State was quite elaborate The pay assigned by the public to every B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR ill  every mariner was a  drachma a day The number of new ships for the battle and chace was sixty that of transports for the heavy armed forty The several captains of the triremes were very choice in making up their crews and gave to such of the mariners as rowed on the uppermost bench and to the sailors a gratuity out of their own pockets over and above the public pay They had farther adorned their vessels with images and all kind of sumptuous decorations It was the high ambition of every single captain to have his own ship excel all the rest of the fleet in splendor and in swiftness The land force was distinguished by the choiceness of their levies and their arms and all the individuals vied with one another in the goodness of their accoutrements and equipage whatsoever It happened also on the same account that a warm contention was kindled amongst them under what officers they should be ranged and opportunity afforded to the rest of Greece to construe the whole into a mere ostentation of their power and opulence rather than an effective equipment against a foe For were a computation to be formed both of the public disbursements of the State on this occasion and the private expences of the whole soldiery  ‚ of the State what prodigious sums they had already advanced and what additional sums the generals were to carry along with them ‚ of the soldiery what each had expen ded on his own equipage every captain on the decora tion of his vessel and to how much greater charges he was still liable ‚ without taking into the account the vast list of necessaries which over and above the public allowance each private person was obliged to lay in for so long a voyage or the goods which a soldier or trader might take with himon board for the sake of traffic ‚ the amount of talents now carried out of Athens would turn out exceeding large Nor was it merely for the strangeness of the enterprize or the splendor of its shew that the armament was noised abroad 122 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR F VI abroad but also for the numerous force with which it was provided to attack the foe for the remoteness of the voyage great as ever they had undertaken from their native clime and that prodigious expectation which was raised of the event in order to which the State had now exerted itself quite beyond its strength When the whole force was got on board the fleet when the stowage of all necessary stores and all baggage whatever was completely adjusted silence then was proclaimed by sound of trumpet But the solemn prayers for a successful expedition were not offered from every vessel apart but in behalf of all united by the voice of a herald The goblets mingled with wine ran the circle of the whole armament and every crew as well as the commanders poured out the libations and drank success and happiness out of gold and silver cups The whole crowd that stood upon the beach both of citizens and such strangers as were there and wished them prosperity joined with them in the public prayer And now the p√ an being sung and the libation finished they put out to sea  After moving off at first in a line ‚ c  a head  Many incidents arc related by Plutarch in the life of Niciai in regard to the de nunciations of the priests against this expedition the coining and wresting of oracles both for and against it and omens which portended nothing but misfortune Mere human foresight and a consciousness that the means were not equal to the end pro posed gave the wisest and steadiest part of the Athenian community a sad apprehen sion of the event Socrates constantly declared against it and assured his friends it would draw after it the destruction of the Start This his pre sentiment soon became the public talk Meton the Astronomer who was named to a post of high rank in the expedition feigned himself mad and set his house on fire Others deny that cir cumstance of his counterfeiting madness j and fay he set his house on fire by night and appeared next morning on the forum in an abject manner and begged of his fel low citizens in order to comfort him under so great a misfortune to excuse hit son who was to have commanded a trireme from going the voyage An incident farther at the very time of the departure of the grand fleet gave many persons vast concern The women were then celebrating the rites of Adonis in which many representations of deaths and funerals were exhibited all over Athens 5 and the wo men qccoi‚ g Wtiistom were making heavy moan and lamentation This struck fad foreboding unpeople Who laid Msj on such incidents that this expensive and mijbty void  B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 123 a head each vessel made afterwards the best of her way to √ gina And this armament made all possible haste to reach Corcyra where the force of their allies by which they were to be joined was already assembled Though the intelligence of such an intended invasion had been brought to Syracuse from several quarters yet for a long course of time they would yield no credit to its truth Nay more when an assembly was convened such speeches as follow were made by different persons some believing the accounts received in relation to this armament of the Athenians others pronouncing them absolutely false On this occasion Hermocrates the son of Hermon standing forth in the assembly and as one convinced in his own mind that all such accounts were true addressed and advised his countrymen thus I T will probably be my own fate as it hath been  the fate of others to be disbelieved when I speak of this intended invasion as a matter of truth and cer  tainty And I also know by experience that both  those who vent and those who retail such accounts of  things as seem incredible are so far from effectually persuading that they generally incur the imputation of madness Yet no such apprehensions shall intimi  date or strike me dumb when such a weight of dan ger hovers over my country when in my own hearc f I am convinced that I am more clearly enlightened ¬ f on the point than any other person whatever  For I assert that to be a master of the highest cer tainty which you hear only with a sit of stupid  surprise that the Athenians have already set sail against us with a numerous farce both for the service of the sea and the land The pretext alledged by them is execution of treaties with the Egesteans and  the restoration of the Leontines but the true motive is their ambition to inslave Sicily and above all this    ‚ V ‚         mighty armament though now so vigorpHl pff4 magnificent would soon moulder 12 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL  our own Syracuse which if once reduced they are well assured that nothing will be able afterwards to  give a check to their arms Taking it therefore for  grarfted that they will be immediately upon us delibe  rate in what manner you may make the most gallant defence in the present posture of your strength care ful that through contempt you be not taken unprovi  ded nor through incredulity abandon the means of  preservation Nor farther let those who are con  vinced of their immediate appearance be terrified at  the boldness or strength of their undertaking For they will not be able to hurt us more than we shaH be enabled to retaliate upon them Nor are they more beyond our reach because they invade us with  so vast an armament since this in regard to the  other Sicilians will plead more abundantly in our  cause for terrified at the foe they will be disposed us And if thus in the train of affairs we are either enabled to defeat their arms or merely to force their  return their schemes unexecuted and their ambition disappointed for I am not in the least afraid that their sanguine expectations can be glutted with suc  cess such events would reflect the highest glory upon you and complete what I firmly hope  It is a truth evinced by facts that few considerable armaments of either Grecians or Barbarians which  have been sent out on remote expeditions have rc turned successful Nor farther are our present in vaders more numerous than the Syracusans them  selves or their friends of theneighbouring States whose strength mere hostile dread will cement and bind fast together If therefore though merely for wantof need ful supplies they incur miscarriages on a foreign shore i  if they prove unsuccessful though chiefly through their own misconduct the whole honour must how   ever rest with us as if we had ruined their projects by art and management Even these very Athenians  with higher warmth of friendihi  with were B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 115  were indebted to a parallel coincidence of events  for the vast enlargement of their strength and empire  when the Mede who gave out that he aimed the blow  at Athens was contrary to all human expectation disconcerted by a series of errors that were purely his own And some such fortunate coincidence in our own behalf we have at present all imaginable rea son to expect Let us therefore with active resolution put our do mestic affairs into a posture of defence and dispatch our embassadors to the SicuJi to keep firm in our  friendship such as are already our friends and to  endeavour to procure the friendship and concurrence  of the rest Nay let our embassies regularly com f plete the whole circuit of Sicily where they may re  present the common danger which equally threatens f them all Let them farther cross over to Italy to procure for us their defensive alliance or at least to  negotiate a denial of reception to the Athenians I also judge it adviseable to fend to Carthage For even  the Carthaginians are not exempted from the present dangers but have been ever under apprehensions of  receiving from them a visit at Carthage It may f perhaps effectually occur to their thoughts that should they now abandon us the storm must soon  extend itself to them by which they may be deter  mined either secretly or openly by some expedient ¬ or other to vindicate our cause And were their  inclination equal to their power no people on the  globe could so easily redress us For they are pof sesied of an immensity of wealth which gives an easy and prompt completion to the schemes of war and to every human enterprize Let us send farther to La  ced√ mon and Corinth requesting the dispatch of  immediate succours hither and the renewal of the war  against the Athenians There is one point more which in my opinion is more critical and important than all the rest and  I which  126 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vf which though perhaps inured as you are to domestic indolence ic may not gain your ready approbation rt I hall however boldly recommend Would all of us in general who are inhabitants of Sicily or at least  would only we Syracusans with what other people we Can get to assist us put out instantly to sea with  all the ships we have in readiness and victualled  but for the space of two months ‚ would we then  giVe these Athenians the meeting either at Tarentum  or cape Japygia and there convince them that be fore they enter the lists of war for the conquest of ¬ Sicily they must fight for their passage across the Ionian  ‚ we should then strike them with the utmost  terror and infinitely perplex them with the thought   that from a friendly port we shall sally forth to guard  our out works for Tarentum will readily receive us  whilst they have a long tract of sea to pass with all  their cumbersome train and must find it hard  the regular order As their course must thus be slow and must advance only in exact conformity to orders we shall have a thousand opportunities to attack them  If again they clear their ships for action and in a body bear down expeditiously upon us they must  ply hard at their oars and when spent with their  toil we can fall upon them Or in case that may  not be judged adviseable we have it always in our power to retire into the harbour of Tarentum And  thus the Athenians if in constant expectation of be ing fought with at sea they must make their passage  with a small portion only of their stores will be re duced to great distress on coasts which will afford  them no supply Should they choose to continue in  their station they must infallibly be blockedupin it Should they venture a passage they must unavoidably  leave their tenders and storeships behind and as  they have no assurance of a hearty reception from the  cities on the coasts must be terribly dismayed  It  B VL THE PELOPONNEStAN WAR 127 It is my firm opinion that amidst that great per  plexity of thought which must result from these ob structions they will never presume to sail from Cor cyra or at least whilst they are agitating the forms of procedure and sending out spy boats to discover  our numbers and position the season of the year must be protracted to winter or utterly dispirited at so unexpected a resistance they will give up the voyage This I more readily expect as I am informed that their most experienced commander hath been forced into office against his inclination and would gladly  lay hold of the pretext to desist if such a show of  resistance could be made by us as would preserve his honour from suspicion And I am perfectly convin ced that rumour will increase and aggravate our strength Now the sentiments of mankind are con stantly adjusted by rumours Parity of danger is supposed when an enemy declares he is ready to be gin the attack and such an enemy is always more  dreaded than he who betrays an intention merely to  defend himself against an enemy s assaults Such ex cess of fear must now fall to the lot of the Athenians They are invading us with the fond presumption that we shall not fight They think they have  grounds for such a presumption because we have not concurred with the Laced√ monians in their demoli tion But when to their bitter disappointment they find we have the courage to act offensively the sud denness of our efforts will terrify them more than all  the reality of our expected strength could have done Determine therefore to execute with bold and rea dy resolution the plan I have proposed or if this  must not prevail with the utmost expedition to gee  all things at home in readiness for war And let  each Syracusan be firmly convinced that contempc ¬ of an enemy ought never to be shewn but in the heat ¬ of action that the conduct of those men must tend  most highly to the public preservation who alarmed T by 128 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  by a decent fear judge it needful to prepare with all caution and alacrity as if the danger was instant at our doors But these our enemies are actually  coming they are already I know it well upon the  voyage they are this moment only not in sight In this manner Hermocrates spoke his sentiments But the popular assembly of the Syracusans was embroil ed with much variance and contention One party cried out that it was all a joke the Athenians durst not  think of invading them Another Hermocrates had truth and reason on his side A third let them come what damage can they do us which we are not able heartily to repay them Others betrayed an open contempt at the whole account and laughed at it as downright ridiculous The party was but small which gave credit to Hermocrates and trembled for the future At length Athenagoras stood up who being the first magistrate of the people and whose cre dit at this time was highest with them delivered himself as followeth THE man who wishes the Athenians may not be so mad as to come hither and run themselves head  long into our subjection is either a coward or a trai  tor to his country But for those who vent such  news and endeavour to frighten you by the terrible recital at their audaciousness truly I am not in the  least surprised but I am greatly so at their folly if they imagine their views can escape detection Poor  abject souls quite dispirited within through their own pusillanimity are glad to spread consternation  throughout a whole community that under the general panic their own may lie veiled and undistin guished And such is the effect which the present informations may be ready to produce not from any grounds of truth and certainty but the fictions and falsehoods of an iniquitous cabal who are ever dab bling in the practices of faction  But B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 129 But you Syracusans I exhort to apply your good sense on this occasion and search after probability not by considering such accounts as these men have pompousiy detailed but such enterprises as a wise and 4t abundantly enlightened people for such I esteem the Athenians are likely to undertake For whatpro babilky is there that leaving the Peloponnesians on  their backs when the war at home is not yet brought  to any settled conclusion they would wilfully embark  into another of no less importance For my part  I am persuaded they rest well contented that so many and so powerful States as we Sicilians are we  have not yet thought proper to invade them  But allowing these informations true and that  they are actually coming ‚ I am firmly persua  ded that Sicily is better able than Poloponnefus to  war them down by how much in all respects it is l better furnished with every resource of war and  that this our Syracuse alone is far superior in strength  to that nay double that armament which by report  now threatens its invasion For I know assuredly  that no horse can follow in their train that farther  none can be procured for them in this country if we abate an inconsiderable party which the Egesteans  may furnish And I know that a body of heavy  armed equal in number to our own can never be  transported by them across such a length of sea  The enterprize is bold indeed to attempt so long a  voyage hither with only light and nimble ships and to bring all those military stores the roll of which mult  be excessively large in order to attack so great a city  Shall I therefore be terrified at vain reports I who am firmly persuaded that if the Athenians were  possessed of a city on our coasts as considerable in all respects as Syracuse itself and should dare to pro  voke us if masters of the neighbouring territory  they should from thence make war upon us ‚ even ‚ f  with such advantages they would with difficulty escape Vol II K a total i3o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  a total destruction And what therefore in all human  probability must be their fate when all Sicily to a  man will be combined to oppose them For now f their war must issue from a camp on the beach of the sea of which their ships must form the ramparts M They will not be able to make long excursions from their tents and magazines of needful stores as our cavalry will bridle and controul them But in short 1 it is my firm opinion that they never will be able to  accomplish a descent so far am I convinced that our  force is in all respects superior I am well persuaded that all those obstacles which I have hitherto recited their own wise reflexions have suggested to the remembrance of the Athenians and deterred them from hazarding their own ruin 5 and that our own malcontents amuse us with ficti  tious accounts of things that neither have nor can have existence This is by no means the first occafi  on oq which I have been able to detect their  schemes I am no stranger to their constant attempts of fomenting faction ever intent as they are by forgeries like these or more malicious than these or even by the open efforts of sedition to strike a panic  amongst the Syracusan people and to seize the helm of your government And I have reason to apprehend that amongst the many projects they attempt some one at length may be fatally successful But this ic must be charged to our own pusillanimity who ex ert no precautions to avert impending miseries nor bravely oppose the storm though we perceive it to be gathering around us And from hence it unavoida  bly results that our Stale is seldom blessed with a  season of tranquillity but feels the bitter lot of scdi  tion on sedition of more numerous strugglesagainstfac  tionswithin than public hostilities without nay some  times tyranny and despotic rulehave been our portion To guard the present times from such disastrous  contingencies shall be my constant endeavour and B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 131   if favoured with your concurrence my care mall be successful To this end I must prevail upon you who are the many to co operate with me whilst I inflict upon these artificers of faction the punishment they deserve not barely for overt commissions fog  in these they are not easily caught but for all the treacherous plots which how desirous soever they  are not able to execute For we ought not only to award our vengeance on the open outrages of an ene  my but to disarm his malice by wife precaution because the man who will not thus in time disarm it will feel its blow before he is aware On the few I have also to bestow partly some re  proofs partly some cautions and partly some in  structions For chiefly by these methods I judge it c feasible to deter them from their factious designs  Let me therefore request from you ye youths of  Syracuse the solution of a point which hath frequent  ly occurred to my own imagination ‚ What is it  you would have ‚ An immediate possession of the government of your country  ‚ Why the very laws of that country declare you incapable of it  And these very laws were intended rather to exclude  you so long as you are unequal than to give you a  disgraceful rejection when you shall be equal to the  trust But farther ‚ Are you not piqued in heart at being placed upon the same rank and level with the bulk of your fellow citizens And where would M be the justice in awarding distinctions of honour and  trust to those who are in no respect differenced from  others It may perhaps be urged that a democracy  is repugnant to the dictates both of wisdom and  justice that the most opulent members of a State M are intitled to its highest honours are best able to  superintend the public welfare But to this I reply  that in the first place by the word people is signified ff a whole community including its every individual  K 2  but 132 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  but an oligarchy means only a party in the next place  that men of opulence are the most suitable guardians  of the public treasure that men of understanding  and experience are best qualified to advise but the  many after hearing are the best judges of measures  And thus by a democracy equality of right and of  privilege is most fairly preserved as well to the  separate members as to the whole community An oligarchy indeed bestows an ample portion of dangers ft on the many but in benesicial points it not only as  fumes the larger ihare to itself but by an unboun ded rapacity monopoliscth the public harvest These  are the ends which the men of power and the raw unexperienced youths amongst you ambitiousty pur sue ends incompatible with the welfare of a great  and flourishing State The accomplishment of these ¬ I say you have this very mordent in agitation though the world cannot furnish such a set of fools if you  perceive not the pernicious tendency of your schemes Nor can any set of Grecians within my knowledge equal either your brutality or your villany if with  open eyes you dare proceed Lay hold then at once  of sound information or repent if already informed ff and unite in the infallible advancement of the general w elfare of the whole community And let the men  of probity amongst you rest perfectly satisfied that thus they shall obtain a proper share nay more than a share in those emoluments which will equally rc  dound to all their country But in cafe you give into different schemes the hazard is great the whole f of your plan will be baffled and confounded Trouble us therefore no farther with your infor f matipns as we are privy to and shall certainly discon cert the views of their authors For the Syracuse  State even though the Athenians actually invade us will repel their efforts with a magnanimity worthy of herself And we have already a set of brave com  manders who will effectually manage the point  But B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 133 v  But if not one tittle of these intended invasions be true which is my firm opinion the State will not be struck  into a panic by your rumours will never place the  command of her forces in your hands so as to rivet a voluntary servitude upon herself She on the con trary will exert her own vigilance and discretion j she will interpret the rumours you have spread as so many S acts against her welfare and will not give up her liberty to accounts expressly forged to terrify the ear j but aware in time by no means to intrust herself into your managements will leave no possible method of 4 defence untried  1  Thus spoke AthenagoraS But here one of the

the assembly and departed K 3 The Ij4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI The Athenians with the reinforcements of their al lies were by this time all arrived at Corcyra And the first thing done by the commanders was to take a re view of the whole equipment and to settle the order in which they were to anchor and form their naval sta tion They also divided it into three squadrons and cast lots for the command of each to the end that in the course of the voyage they might be well supplied with water and harbours and the proper necessaries wherever they might chance to put in that in other respects a better discipline might be kept up and the men be more inured to a ready obedience as being under the inspection of an able commander in each several division These points being settled they dispatched three vessels to Italy and Sicily to pick up informations what cities on those coasts would give them a reception And their orders were to come back in time and meet them upon the voyage that they might be advertised into what ports they might safely enter These previous points being adjusted the Athenians with an equipment already swelled to so great a bulk weighing anchor from Corcyra stood across for Sicily The total of their triremes was a hundred and thirty four to which were added two Rhodian vessels of fifty oars One hundred of these were Athenian and of this number sixty were tight ships fit for service the rest were transports for the soldiery The remainder of the fleet consisted of Chians and the other allies The total of the heavy armed on board was five thousand one hundred men Of these fifteen hundred were citizens of Athens inrolled seven hundred were Athenians of the lowest class called Tbetes who served by way of marines The rest of the force consisted of the quotas of their alliance some of their own dependents five hundred belonged to the Argives the number of Man tineans and mercenaries was two hundred and fifty the archers in the whole amounted to four hundred and eighty IB VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 135  eighty and of these eighty were Cretans There were seven hundred Rhodian flingers and a hundred and twenty light armed Megarean exiles And one horse transport attended which carried thirty horsemen So great an equipment sailed out at first to begin the war And in the train of this equipment went thirty storefhips laden with corn and carrying on board the bakers and masons and carpenters and all things re quisite in the works of fortification and also a hundred sail of small vessels which necessity demanded to attend the hips that carried the stores A large number also of small craft and trading vessels sailed voluntarily in company with the fleet for the sake of traffic All which now in one collected body stood away from Corcyra across the Ionian gulf The whole armament being got over to cape Japygia or to Tarentum as they severally could make the passage sailed along the coast of Italy ‚ where not one city would receive them would grant them a marker or suf fer them to land barely permitting them to anchor and to water ‚ though at Tarentum and Locri even that was denied them ‚ till they arrived at Rhegium a promon tory of Italy At Rhegium the whole fleet was now assembled and without the city for an admission intoic ‚ was refused them they formed an incampment within the verge of Diana s temple where also they were ac commodated by the Rhtgians with a market Here having drawn their vessels on shore they lay some time for refreshment and had a conference with the Rhegians in which they pressed them as they were of Chalcidic descent to succour the Leontines who were also Chakideans Their answer was that  they should  side with neither party but whatever measures were  judged expedient by the other Italians they should conform to those The Athenians counsels were now solely bent on the affairs of Sicily in what manner they might most successfully make their approaches They allo waited for the return of the three vessels from K 4 Hgeita 136 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI Egesta which had previously been dispatched thither longing earnestly for a report about the state of their treasure whether ic was really such as their envoys at Athens had represented To the Syracusans in the mean time undoubted ad vice is brought from several quarters and by their own spies that the fleet of the enemy lies at Rhegium The truth of this being uncontested they prepared for their defence with the utmost attention and were no longer duped by incredulity They also sent about to the Siculi to some places their agents who were to keep a watchful eye upon ther conduct  and to others embassadors And into those towns upon the coast which were exposed to a descent they threw a garrison In Syracuse they examined if the city was provided with the proper means of a defence by a careful inspec tion of the arms and the horses and all other points were properly adjusted as against a war coming swiftly upon them and only not already present The three vessels detached beforehand to Egesta rejoin the Athenians yet lying at Rhegium with a re port that the great sums which had been promised  them were quite annihilated since they saw only   thirty talents in specie Upon this the commanders were instantly seized with a dejection of spirit because their first hope was thus terribly blasted and the Rhe gians had refused to concur with their attempts upon whom they had made their first efiay of persuasion and with whom they had the greatest probability of success as they were by blood allied to the Leontines and had ever fliewn themselves well disposed to the Athenian State The Egestean affair had indeed taken no other turn than what Nicias fully expected but the other two commanders were quite amazed and confounded at it The trick made use of by the Egesteans at the time that the first embassy went thither from Athens to take a survey of their treasures was this ‚ Having conducted  5812 lot Stirling them B VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 13s f  them into the temple of Venus at Eryx they shewed them the offerings repofited there the cups the flagons and the censers and the other furniture of the temple in quantity by no means small These being all of silver presented to the eye a vast show of wealth far beyond their intrinsic value Having also made entertainments in private houses for those who came in the vessels of the embassy they amassed together all the gold and silver cups of Egesta they borrowed others from the ad jacent cities as well Ph≈ nician as Grecian they carri ed their guests about from one house of seasting to ano ther and each exhibited them as his own property Thus all of them displaying generally the same vessels and great abundance appearing at every place the Athenians who made the voyage were prodigiously sur prised at the splendid shows Hence it was that on their return to Athens they inlarged with a kind of emulation which should magnify it most on the immen sity of wealth they had seen at Egesta In this manner being deceived themselves they obtruded the lame fal lacy upon others but now when the true account was spread amongst them that there was no such wealth  at Egesta they were much censured and reproached by the soldiers The generals however held a consultation about the methods of proceeding And here it was the opinion of Nicias  That with their whole armament they should stand immediately against Selinus the reduc tion of which was the principal motive of the expediti  on and in case the Egesteans would furnish the whole armament with the proper supplies of mo  ney their councils then might be regulated accor  dingly But otherwise they should insist on their maintaining the sixty sail of ships which had been c sent expressly at their own request then abiding by  them they should reconcile their differences with the Selinuntians either by force of arms or negotiation  They afterwards might visit other cities and display besore i3 T E PEtOPONNESsAN WAR B VL before them the mighty power of the Athenian State  and having given such conspicuous proofs of their ‚ alacrity to support their friends and afiies might re  turn to Athens provided that iid sodden andunex M pected turn Of affairs might give then¬ opportunity  to do service to the Leontines or bring Over some  other cities to their interest ever intent not to bring  their ovtn State into danger by a needless profusion of tk blood and treasure Altibiades declared That it could never be justi fiedi if after putting to sea with so great an armaments  they should return withr disgrace artid no effectual service done to their country that on the contrary theyought by hera ds dispatched expressly to notify  their arrival in these parts td all ihV cities except Selinus and Syracuse that farther they should try  what could be done with the Steals tirt order to per soade some of them to revolt from the Syracusans and to strike up treaties of alliance and friendship with others that so they might provide a resource  of provisions and reinforcements that the first trial  of hfs kind should be made upon the Messenians  who lay in the finest situation for favouring their passage and descent into Sicily which must open to  them the most convenient harbour asrtd station for their armament Thus gaining the concurrence of the1  cities arid certain from whom they might depend  upon assistance the way would then be open for them to make attempts upon Syracuse and Selinus in cafe the former refused to make up the quarrel with the Egesteans and the latter to suffer the replantation of the Leontines  The opinion of Lamachus was diametrically opposite since he ad vised it to be the most judicious measure to stand at once against Syracuse and to try their fortune before that city with the utmost expedition whilst they were yet not competently provided for resis taoce and their consternation was still in its height  Because B VI THE PELOPOtfNESIAN WAR fft   Because every hostile force is always most terrible on its first approach and in case it protract tlve time of encountering the eyes of its foes they twist recover their courage through familiarity with danger and then the sight of an enemy is more apt to inspire ¬ contempt ‚ But should they assault them on a sud den whilst yet their approach is with terror expected  the victory must insallibly be their own ‚ In this cafe all things would co operate with them to terrify the foe such as the sight of their numbers which now only could appear in their greatest inlargement  the forebodings of their heaits what miseries were like to ensue andj above all the instant necessity they  must lie under of hazarding a battle Thar moreover it was likely that numbers of the enemy might be surprised yet roaming abroad in the adjacent country  as still they were incredulous of the approach of the  Athenians Or even though the Syracusans were safely  retired with all their effects into the city the army  must needs become masters of prodigious wealth if  they should besiege the city and awe all around it  That by taking this step the other Sicilians would be more discouraged from succouring the Syracusans and more easily inclined to concur with the Athenians and all shifts and delays to keep clear of the contest  till one side was manifestly superior would be pre eluded He added farther that they should take care to possess themselves of Megara which was now  deserted and not far from Syracuse either by sea or  land as it would afford a fine station for their ships  to lie in would shelter them upon a retreat and give expedition to their approaches But though Lamachus delivered his sentiments thus he soon gave up his own opinion and went over to that of Alcibiades And in pursuance of this Alcibiades with his own single ship passed over to Mesiene and having gained a conserence with the Mesienians about an alliance offensive and defensive when no arguments he broughe i ould l 140 THE PELOPONNE IAN WAR B VI could persuade when on the contrary they returned this answer that into their city they would not re  ceive them though they were ready to accommodate  them with a market without the walls he repassed to Rhegium And immediately the generals having manned out sixty ships with the choicest hands of the whole fleet and taken in a requisite stock of subsistence steered away for Naxus leaving the rest of the arma ment at Rhegium under the care of one of those in the commission After a reception granted them into their city by the Naxians they stood away from thence to Catana And when the Cataneans refused to receive them for in that city was a party strongly attached to the Syracu fasis they put into the river Terias After a night s continuance there the next day they sailed for Syracusej keeping the rest of the fleet ready ranged in a line of battle a head But they had detached ten beforehand who were ordered to enter the great harbour of Syracuse and to examine what naval force lay there ready launched for service and to proclaim from their decks as they passed along the shore ‚ That  the Athenians are  come into those parts to replace the Leontines in their own territory as they were bound in point both  of alliance and consanguinity that whatever Leon  tines therefore were now residing at Syracuse should  without fear come over to the Athenians as friends U and benefactors When the proclamation had been made and they had taken a view of the city and its harbours and of the adjacent ground what spots were most convenient for a descent and the commencement of the war they soiled back again to Catana A council os war had been held in that city and the Cataneans were come to a resolution not to receive the armament but how ever they granted an audience to the generals Ac which whilst Alcibiades harangued and the inhabitants of Catana were all in the public assembly the Athenian   soldiers B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 141  soldiers without giving any alarm pulled down a little gate of a very sorry structure and then entering the city walked up and down in the market But such of the Cataneans as were of the Syracusan party no sooner found that the army was got in than struck into a sudden consternation they stole presently out of the city The number of these was but trifling The rest of the inhabitants decreed an alliance with the Athenians and encouraged them to fetch over the remainder of their armament from Rhegium This point being carried the Athenians having pas sed to Rhegium were soon with the whole of their fleet under sail for Catana and on their arrival there they formed a proper station for their ships and men But now intelligence was brought them from Cama rina that if they would come to countenance them that city would declare on their sidei and that the Syracusans are busy in manning their fleet With the whole armament therefore they steered along the coast touching first at Syracuse And when they found that no fleet was there in readiness to put to sea they stood off again for Camarina and there approach ing the shore they notified their arrival by the voice of a herald Admittance was however refused them the Camarineans alledging that they were bound by u solemn oaths to receive only one single ship of the Athenians unless of their own accord they should require a larger number Thus disappointed they put out again to sea and having made a descent on some part of the Syracusan territory they picked up a booty till the Syracusan cavalry making head against therfl and cutting off some of their light armed who were strag gled to a distance they re embarked and went again to Catana On their return thither they find the Salaminian ar rived from Athens to fetch back Alcibiades by pub lic order of the State to take his trial for the crimes charged against him by his country and also soms Gihtfs Ui THE PELOFONNESIAN WA B VI others of the soldiery who attended him in the expedi tion against whom informations had been given that they were guilty of impiety in the affair of the Mysteries and against some of them in that of the Mercuries For the Athenians after the departure of the fleet continu ed to make as strict an inquisition as ever into the crimes committed in regard to the Mysteries and also in regard to the Mercuries What fort of persons the informers were was no part of their concern but in the height of jealousy giving credit indiscriminately to all through too great a deference to men of profligate and abandoned lives they apprehended and threw into prison the most worthy citizens of Athens esteeming it more prudent by pains and tortures to detect the fact than that a person of irreproachable character when once accused through the villany of an informer should escape without the question For the people having learned by tradition how grievous the tyranny of Pisi strams and his sons became at last and what is more that it was not overthrown by themselves and Har modius but by the industry of the Laced√ moni ans lived in a constant iread of such another usur pation and beheld all these incidents now with most suspicious eyes But in fact the bold attempt of Har inodius and Aristogiton took its rife merely from a competition in love The particulars of which I shall here unfold more largely to convince the world that no other people no not even the Athenians themselves have any certain account either relating to their own tyrants or the transactions of that period   _ The truth is that Pisistratus dying possessed of the tyranny in a good old age not Hipparchus as is gene rally thought but Hippias the eldest of his sons was his successor in power Harmodius being at this time in the flower of his youth and beauty Aristogiton a citizen of Athens nay a citizen of the middle rank doated upon and had him in his possession But some attempts having been made upon Harmodius by Hip  parchus  B VI THE PEI OPONNESIAN WAR 1 3  parchus the son of Pisistratus he rejected his solicitati ons and discovers the whole affair to Aristogiton The latter received the account with all that anguish which a warm affection fee s and alarmed at the great power of Hipparchus lest by force he might seize the youth he instantly forms a project a project as notable as his rank in life would permit to demolish the tyranny And in the mean time Hipparchus who after making a second attempt upon Harmodius was equally unsuccessful in his suit could not prevail upon himself to make use of force but however determined upon some remote occasion which might cover his real design from detection and was actually studying an opportunity to dishonour the youth ‚ For the power he had was never exerted in such a manner as to draw upon him the popular hatred and his deportment was neither invidious nor distasteful Nay for the most pare this set of tyrants were exact observers of the rules of virtue and discretion They exacted from the Athe nians only a twentieth of their revenue they beautified and adorned the city took upon themselves the whole conduct of the wars and presided over the religious sacrifices In other respects the State was governed by the laws already established except that they always exerted their influence to place their own creatures in the first offices of the government Several of their own family enjoyed the annual office of 4r hon at Athens and amongst others Pisistratus the son of J Iippias the tyrant who bore the same name with his grandfather and in his archon hip dedicated the altar of the twelve Gods in the public forum and that of Apollo in the temple of the Pythian The people of Athens having since made additions to it in order to inlarge the altar in the forum by that means effaced xhe inscription But that in the Pythian is yet legible though the letters are wearing out apace and runs thus r44 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR S VI j i Of Pythian Ph≈ bus radiant God of day Chose thus the temple to adorn And thus record his own superior sway But farther that Hippias succeeded in the govern ment as the eldest son 1 myself can positively aver as I know it to be so and have examined all the accounts of tradition with much greater accuracy than others But any one may be convinced of the fact by what I am going to subjoin ‚ Now we have abundant light to prove that he was the only one of the legitimate bro chcrs who had any sons So much the altar attests and the column erected for a perpetnal brand of the in justice of the tyrants in the citadel of Athens In the latter the inscription makes no mention of any son of either Thessalus or Hipparchus but nameth five sons of Hippias who were brought him by Myrrhine the daughter of Callias the fon of Hyperochidas It is certainly most probable that the eldest son was marri ed first nay he is named the first after his father on the upper part of the column And there were good reasons for this preserence because his seniority gave him this rank and because he succeeded to the tyranny Nor can it in any light seem probable to me that Hip pias on a sudden and with ease could have seized the tyranny had Hipparchus died when invested with ic and he had only one day s time to effect his own esta blishment The reverse is the truth j that having for a length of time been familiarized to the expectation having rendered himself awful to the citizens and being supported by vigilant and trusty guards he received and enjoyed his power with abundant security He never had cause as a younger brother must have had to work his way through perplexities and dangers as in that casehe could not by practice have been made an adept in the affair of government But it was acciden tal and owing intirely to subsequent misfortunes that Hipparchus   B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 145 Hipparchus got the title and passed in the opinion of succeeding ages for one of the tyrants On Harmodius therefore who was deaf to his solicita tions he executed his resentment in the manner pre determined For a summons having been delivered to a sister of his a young virgin to attend and carry the basket in some public procession they afterwards reject ed her alledging she never had nor could have been summoned because flie was unworthy of the honour This affront highly provoked Harmodius but Aristo giton out of zeal for him was far more exasperated at it The points needful to their intended revenge were concerted with the party who concurred in the design But they waited for the great Panathen√ a to strike the blow on which festival alone without incurring suspi cion such of the citizens as assisted in the procession might be armed and gathered together in numbers It was settled that they themselves should begin and then the body of their accomplices were to undertake their protection against the guards of the tyrant s family The persons made privy to this design were but few from a view to a more secure execution of it For they presumed that even such as were not in the secret ‚ when the attempt was once in whatever manner begun finding themselves armed would seize the opportunity and readily concur to assert their own freedom When therefore the festival was come Hippias repairing without the walls to the place called Ceramicus and there attended by his guards was prescribing and ad justing the order of the procession Harmodius and Aristogiton each armed with a dagger advanced to execute their parts But when they saw one of their accomplices in familiar conversation with Hippias for Hippias was affable and courteous to all men they were struck with fear they imagined the whole of their plot had been betrayed and that already they were only nor apprehended Now therefore by a sudden turn of resolution they determined if possible to snatch a Vol II L  timely 1 i46 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vl timely revenge upon him by whom they were aggrieved and on whole account they had en barked into so dan gerous an affair In this hurry of thought they rushed back into the city and met with Hipparchus at the place called Leocorium where without any regard to their own safety they made an instant assault upon him And thus in all the fury of passion one actuated by jealousy and the other by resentment they wounded and they kill him As the people immediately ran to gether Aristogiton by favour of the concourse escapes for the present but being afterwards seized was un mercifully treated But Harmodius is instantly stain on the spot The news of this assassination being carried to Hippi as at the Ceramicus he moved off immediately not to the scene of action but towards the armed accomplices in the procession before they couid be informed of the fact as they were stationed at a distance He artfully suppressed on his countenance all fense of the calamity and pointing to a certain spot commanded them aloud to throw down their arms and file off thither This command they obeyed expecting he had some thing to communicate to them But Hippias ad dressing himself to his guards orders them to take away those arms He then picked out man by man from amongst them such as he designed to put to the question and all upon whom a dagger was found For by ancient custom they were to make the procession with a spear and a shield In this manner truly from the anguish 6f irritated love this conspiracy took its rise and this desperate attempt l ‚  And et so violently were tyrants detested at Athens that the memory of Har modius and Aristogiton was ever after honoured there as martyrs for liberty and first authors of the ruin of tyrants Their praises were publicly fung at the great Panatbcnaa No slave was ever called by their names Praxiteles was employed to cast their statuei which were afterwards set up in the forum Xeries indeed Carried themaway into Persia but Alexander afterwards scot them back to Athens flktmrtt B Vl THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 147 attempt was executed by Harmodius and Aristogiton from the impulse of a sudden consternation But after this the tyranny became more grievous upon the Athe nians Hippias who was now more than ever alarmed put many os the citizens to death and cast his thoughts about towards foreign powers to secure himself an asylum abroad in case of a total reverse at home To √ antidas therefore the son of Hippoclus tyrant of Lampsacus ‚ to a Lampsacene though he himself was an Athenian ‚ he married his daughter Archedice knowing that family to have a powersul interest with king Darius And the monument of that lady is now at Lampsacus and hath this inscription From Hippias sprung with regal pow r array d  Within this earth Archedice is lay d  By father husband brothers sons ally d To haughty thrones yet never stain d with pride For the space of three years after this Hippias con tinued in possession of the tyranny at Athens but being deposed in the fourth by the Laced√ monians and the exiled Aicm√ otnid√ he retired by agreement to Si g√ um from thence to √ antidas at Lampsacus and from thence to king Darius and with a command un der him he marched twenty years aster to Marathon and though much advanced in years ierved in that war with the Medes The People of Athens reflecting on these past trans actions and recollecting all the dilmal narratives about them which tradition had handed down treated with great severity and deep suspicions all such as were in formed against in relation to the mysteries and they con strued the whole procedure as the dawning of a plot to Plutarch hath preserved a smart reply of Antipho the orator who will appear in this history to the elder Dionyfius tyrant of Syracuse The latter had put the ques tion which was the finest kind of brass That replied Antipho of which the  fbtucs of HaraK dms and Arifiofiton were made L 2 erect 14B THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  erect an oligarchical and tyrannic power And as their passions were inflamed by such apprehensions many worthy and valuable citizens were already thrown into prison Nay it seemed as it their inquisi tion was to have no end since from day to day their indignation gave into more increasing severity and numbers were constantly arrested Here one of those  who had been imprisoned on suspicion and a suspi cion too of being most deeply concerned in the crime is persuaded by one of his fellow prisoners to turn an evidence no matter whether of truth or falsehood Many conjectures have passed on both sides but no one neither at that time nor since hath been able to dis cover the men who were really concerned in the affair The argument which prevailed upon this person was  the ne  cessuy for his taking such a step even though he had  no hand in the commission since by this he would in fallibly procure hisown safety and deliver thecityfrom its present confusions For he must be much more  secure of saving his life by such voluntary confession on a promise of indemnity than he could possibly be should he persist in an avowal of his innocence and be brought to a trial In short this man became an evidence both against himself and against others in the affair of the Mercuries Great was the joy of the Athenian people at this as it was thought undoubted discovery And as they had been highly chagrined before at their inability to detect the criminals who had so outrageously insulted the mul titude they immediately discharged this informer and all other prisoners whom he did not name as accom plices Upon such as he expressly named the judicial trials were held Some of them they put to death as many  This person according to Plutarch in Ahihiada was Andocides the orator a man always reckoned of the oligarchical faction And one Tim√ us his intimate friend who was a man of small consideration at Athens but remarkable for a pene tratirjg and enterprising genius was the person who persuaded him to turn informer B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 149 many as were prevented by timely arrests from flying from justice but they pronounced the sentence of death against the fugitives and set a price on their heads Yet all this while it was by no means clear that those who suffered were not unjustly condemned Thus much however is certain that by such proceedings the public tranquillity was restored In regard to Alcibiades the Athenians were highly incensed against him since the party which were hise nemies and had made their attacks upon him before his departure continued still to inflame them And now as they presumed the truth had been detected in relati on to the Mercuries it appeared to them beyond a scruple that he must also have been guilty of the crimes charged against him about the mysteries upon the fame ground of a secret combination against the democracy  At this critical period of time when the public con fusion was in all its height it farther happened that a Laced√ monian army though by no means large ad vanced as far as to the Isthmus to execute some scheme along with the B≈ otians This was interpreted to the prejudice of Alcibiades as if they had now taken the field at his instigation and not on any account of obli ging the B≈ otians and that  had they not happily apprehended in time such as had been informed f against Athens had now been infallibly betrayed Nay for the space of a night they kept guard under arms within the city in the temple of Theseus  About the fame time also the friends of Alcibiades at Argos were suspected of a design to assault the people And those hostages of the Argives who were kept in custody among the iflands the Athenians on this occa sion delivered up to the people of Argos to be put to death on these suspicions   Thus reasons flowed in from every quarter for sus 1 pecting Alcibiades Desirous therefore to bring him to a trial and to execution they accordingly dispatched the L 3 Salaminian i5o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI Salaminian to Sicily to order him and such others as they had informations against to repair to Athens But it had been given them in charge to notify to him that he should follow them home in order to make his de fence and by no means to put him under arrest This management was owing to a desire of preventing all stirs in the army or in the enemy and not least of all to their willingness that the Mantineans and Argives should continue in the service whose attendance in the expedition they wholly ascribed to the interest Alcibiades had with them In pursuance of this Alcibiades on board his own ship and accompanied by all those who were involved in the same accusation sailed away from Sicily with the Salaminian for Athens And when they were got to the height os Thuria they no longer followed but quitting their ship were no longer to be seen Censured as they were they durst not in fact undergo a trial The crew of the Salaminian exerted themselves immediately in the search after Alcibiades and his companions But when they found the search was ineffectual they gave ic up and steered away for Athens And Alcibiades now be come a fugitive passed over in a vessel soon after from Thuria  to Peloponnesus But the Athenians upon his thus abandoning his defence pronounced the sen tence of death against him and his asfociates After these transactions the Athenian generals who remained in Sicily having divided their whole arma ment into two squadrons and taken the command of each by lot set sail with all their united force for Seiinus  and Egesta They were desirous to know whether the Egesteans would pay down the money to discover also the  Somebody at Thuria who knew AIciMades aiked him why he would not stand a trial and trust hit country In other points I would but

the state of their quarrels with the Egesteans In their course keeping on the left that part of Sicily which lies on the Tyrrhene gulf they arrived at Himera which is the only Grecian city in this part of Sicily and when denied reception here they resumed their course Touching afterwards at Hyccara a Sicanian fortress but an annoyance to the Egesteans they surprise it for it was situated close upon the sea and having doomed the inhabitants to be slaves they delivered the place into the hands of the Egesteans whose cavalry was now attending on the Athenian motions The land forces marched away from hence through the territories of the Siculi till they had again reached Catana but the vessels on board of which were the staves came back along the coasts Nicias had proceeded from Hyccara directly to Egesta where after transacting other points and receiving thirty  talents he rejoined the grand armament at Ca bana And here they set up the slaves to sale f and raised by the money paid

thought proper during their first panic and consternation to tall instantly upon them such a protraction re inspired them day after day with new re viving courage Since farther by cruizing on the other fide of Sicily they seemed to affect a remoteness from them and though shewing themselves b fore Hybla and attempting the place they had not been able to carry it the Syracusans began now to treat them with an open contempt They even insisted as might be ex pected from a populace who are high in spirits that  their generals should lead out towards Catana since  the enemy durst not venture to march against them The Syracusan horsemen also sent daily out to observe their motions rode boldly up to the camp of the Athenians insulting them in other respects but especially with this sneering demand  Whether they were not rather come to gain a settlement for them selves on a foreign shore than to replace the Leon  tines in their old possessions The Athenian generals informed of these bravadoes were desirous to seduce the whole strength of Syracuse to as great a distance as possible from that city that they might snatch an opportunity of transporting thither their own forces by favour of the night and seize a proper spot whereon to six their incampment without any obstruction from the enemy They were well con vinced that their point could not be so easily accomplish ed should they endeavour to force a descent in the face of the enemy or by a land march should give them an early notice of their design For in such cases their own light armed and that cumbersome train which must attend as they had no horse to cover their motions must suffer greatly from the numerous cavalry of the Syracusans But by the other scheme they might pre occupy a spot of ground where the cavalry could not give them any considerable annoyance Nay what is more the Syracusan exiles who followed their camp B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 153 camp had informed them of a piece of ground con venient for their purpose near Olympi√ um In order therefore to accomplish the point the gene rals have recourse to the following artifice ‚ They dis patch an emissary of whose sidelity they were well assured and who might also pass with the generals of Syracuse as well affected to their cause The person employed was a Catanean He told them  he was sent by their friends in Catana with whose names they were acquainted and knew well to be of that num ber in Catana which persisted in stedfast attachment to them He said farther that  the Athenians reposed  themselves by night within the city at a distance  from their arms and that in case they the Syra  cusans on a day presixed would with all the forces  of their city appear by early dawn before the Athe  nian camp the Cataneans would shut up those with in the city and set fire to their shipping by which  means they might force the intrenchments and ren  der themselves masters of the camp that farther the  party of Cataneans that would co operate with them  in this scheme was very large and already prepared to execute these points he was now sent to propose The Syracusan generals whose ardour other contin gencies had already inflamed and who had formed a resolution even previous to such encouragement to march their forces towards Catana without the least reserve gave implicit credit to this emissary and having instantly pitched upon a day for execution dis missed him They also for by this time the Selinun tian and some other auxiliaries had joined them issued out their orders for the whole military strength of Syra cuse to march out on the day appointed No sooner therefore were all the needful preparations adjusted and the time at hand at which they were to make their ap pearance than ‚ on the march for Catana they halted one night upon the banks of the Sym√ chus in the Leontine district But the Athenians when assured f54 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI they had thus taken the field decamping instantly with the whole of their force and with ail the Sicilian and other auxiliaries who had joined them and embarking themselves on board their hips and transports steered away by night for Syracuse Aud early the next dawn they landed on the intended spot near Olympi√ um in tent on forming and securing their incampment The cavalry ef the Syracusans in the mean time came up first to Catana and discovering that the whole Athe nian army had put to sea by night they return with this intelligence to their foot Upon this the whole army soon wheeling about returned with all speed to the defence of Syracuse In the mean time the Athenians as the enemy had a long way to march formed an incampment on an advantageous spot without the least obstruction On it they were possessed of the advantage of fighting only at their own discretion and the Syracusan horse could give them the least annoyance either during or before an engagement On one side they were flanked by walls and houses and trees and a marsh and on the other by precipices They also felled some trees that grew sear and carrying them down to the more they piled them into a barricade for the defence of their ships and to cover them on the side of Dalcon They also expeditioufly threw up a rampart on the part which leemed most accessible to the enemy of stones picked out for the purpose and timber and broke down the bridge of the Anapus Thus busied as they were on fortifying their camp not so much as one person ventured out of the city to obstruct their proceedings The first who appeared to make any resistance were the Syracusan cavalry and when once they had shewn themselves the whole body of thtir infantry was soon in sight They advanced first of all quite up to the Athenian works but when they perceived that they would not sally out to fig he    them B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 155  them they again retreated And having crossed the road to Heiorum reposed themselves for the night The succeeding day the Athenians and allies pre pared for engagement and their order of battle was formed as follows ‚ The Argives and Mantineans had the right the Athenians the center and the rest of the line was formed by the other confederates One half of the whole force which was ranged in the first line was drawn up by eight in depth The other half being potted near the tents formed a hallow square in which the men were also drawn up by eight The latter were ordered if any part of the line gave way to keep a good look out and advance to their support And within this hallow square they posted all the train who at tended the service of the army But the Syracusans drew up their heavy armed which body consisted of the whole military strength of Syracuse and all the confederates who had joined them in files consisting of sixteen Those who had joined with auxiliary quotas were chiefly the Selinuntians and next she horse of the Geloans amounting in the whole to about two hundred The horse also of the Camari neans about twenty in number and about fifty archers But their horsemen they posted to the right being not fewer in number than twelve hundred and next to them the darters The Athenians being now intent on advancing to the charge Micias addressing himlelf in regular order to the troops of the several States animated them to the fight by the following harangue repeated in turn to the whole army  WHAT need my fellow soldiers of a long ex hortation since we are here determined and refo  lute for action For this our present arrangement  seems to me a stronger confirmation of your courage  than any words could be how eloquently soever de t livered if we were inferior in strength But when  Argives iS6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  Argives and Mantineans and Athenians and the  flower of the isles we are here assembled together ‚ how is it possible when such brave and numerous  allies are to fight in company that we should not   entertain a stedfast nay the warmest hope that the victory will be our own Nay more as we have to  do with a promiscuous crowd the mob of a city not selected for service as we have had the honour I to be and who it must be added are but Sicilians who though affecting to despise us will never sus tain our charge because their skill is far beneath their courage Let every soldier farther recal to his remembrance that he is now at a vast distance from his native foil  and near no friendly land but what you shall render such by the efforts of your valour Such things I am bound to suggest to your remembrance the re verse I am well convinced of what our enemies utter for their mutual encouragement They undoubtedly are roaring aloud ‚ It is for your country you are now to fight But 1 tell you that from your coun try you are now remote and as such must either conquer or not without disficulty ever see it again since the numerous cavalry of the enemy will press hard upon our retreat Call therefore to mind your own dignity and worth advance with alacrity to assault your foes convinced that your present ne cessities and wants are far more terrible than the enemy you are to engage When Nicias had finished this exhortation he led on his army towards the encounter But the Syracusans were not yet prepared as by no means expecting to be charged lo loon and some of the soldiers as the city lay so near were straggled thither These however came running with all eagerness and speed to gain their posts too late upon the whole but as each of them met with any number intent on action he ranged himself  B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 157  himself in their company The Syracusans to do them justice were not desicient in alacrity or courage neither in the present battle nor any of the following They maintained their ground gallantly so long as  their competence of skill enabled them but when that failed them they were forced though with re luctance to slacken in their ardour However though far from imagining that the Athenians would presume to begin the attack and though obliged in a hurry to stand on their defence they took up their arms and advanced immediately to meet their foe In the first place therefore the stingers of stones with either the hand or the sling and the archers on both sides began the engagement and alternately chased one another as is generally the cafe among the bodies of the light armed In the next place the soothsayers brought forwards and immolated the solemn victims and the trumpets summoned the heavy armed to close firm together and advance t All sides now began to face the Syracusans to fight for their countrv each soldier amongst them for his native foil to earn for the present his preservation and for the future his liberty ‚ On their enemies side the Athenians to gain possession of a foreign country and not to damage their own by a dastardly behaviour The Argives and voluntary part of the confederates to procure for the Athenians a happy accomplishment of their schemes and again to visit their own country to ‚ which they were endeared victorious and triumphant and that part of the confederacy which attended in obedience to the orders of their masters were highly animated by the thought that they must earn their safety now at once or is defeated now must for the fur ture deipair and then secretly actuated perhaps by the distant hope that were others reduced to the Athenian yoke their own bondage might be rendered more light and easy 1 ‚ i The 1SS THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI The business being now come to blows they for a long time maintained the ground on both sides It happened farther that some claps of thunder were heard attended with lightning and a heavy rain This caused a sudden consternation in the Syracusans who now for the first time engaged the Athenians and had gained very little experience in the asfairs of war But by the more experienced enemy these accidents were interpreted as the ordinary effects of the season and their concern was rather employed upon the enemy whom they found no easy conquest But the Argives having first of all defeated the left wing of the Syracu sans and the Athenians being afterwards successful in their quarter of the battle the whole Syracusan army was soon thrown into disorder and began the flight The Athenians however did not continue the pursuit to any great distance for the Syracusan cavalry as they were numerous and unbroken put a stop to the chaca by assaulting those parties of heavy armed whom they saw detached for the pursuit and driving them back into their own line Having pursued only so far as they could in an orderly and secure manner they again retreated and erected a trophy ‚ û But the Syracusans who had rallied again in the road to Helorum and were drawn up as well as the present posture of affairs would permit send a strong detach ment from their body for the guard of Olympi√ um apprehensive that the Athenians might otherwise seize the treasures that were reposiced there And this being done with the remainder of their force they retired within the walls of Syracuse The Athenians in the mean time made no advances against Olympi√ um but after gathering together the bodies of their slain and laying them upon the funeral jjyre they passed the night on the field of battle The next day they delivered up their dead under truce to the Syracusans of whom and their allies there had perished about two hundred and sixty men and then B VI THE PEtOPONNESIAN WAR 159 then gathered up the bones of theif own Of the Athenians and their allies about fifty in all were lain And now with all the pillage they had made of the enemvj they sailed back to Catana This was owing to the season of the year now ad vanced to winter It was no longer judged possible for them to be able to continue the war in their present post before they had procured a supply of horse from Athens and had assembled others from their confede rates in Sicily that they might not be entirely exposed to the horse of the enemy They were also intent on collecting pecuniary aids in those parts and some were expected from Athens ‚ They might also obtain  the Concurrence of some other cities which they hoped would porve more tractable since they had gained a battle They wanted farther to furnish f themselves with provisions and all necessary stores which might enable them early in the spring to make new attempts on Syracuse Determined by these considerations they sailed back to Naxus and Catana in order to winter there The Syracusans after they had performed the obse quies of their slain called a general assembly of the people And on this occasion Hermocrates the son of Hermon a man who was inferior to none in all other branches of human prudence who for military skill was in high reputation and renowned for bravery standing forth among them endeavoured to encourage them and prevent there being too much dispirited b their late defeat He told them  that in courage they had not been worsted but their want of discipline had done them  harm and yet the harm suffered by that was not  near so great as they might justly have expected efpe  cially when no better than a rabble of mechanics  they had been obliged to enter the lifts against the I most experienced soldiery of Greece That what hurt  them most was too large a number of generals and 1   the 160 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vs the multiplicity of commands which was thence occa  fioned tor the number of those who commanded  was fifteen whilst the bulk of their army observed no discipline and obeyed no orders at all But were only a few skilful generals selected for the trust  would they only be intent this winter on training V their bodies of heavy armed and furnish others with arms who had none for themselwes in order to en  large their number as much as possible and inure  them to settled exercise and use ‚ he assured them  thus in all probability they must upon the whole be  too hard for their foes as their natural portion of valour was great and skill would be attained by practice That both of these would progressively be come more perfect  discipline by being exercised  through a scries of danger and inward bravery  would merely of itself increase in gallant considence when assured of the support of skill As to generals  that few only and those invested with absolute power ought to be elected and confirmed by a solemn oath from the people ‚ that they were per  mined to lead the army where and how they judged best for the public service For by this means  what ought to be concealed would be less liable to detection and all the schemes of war might be di  rested with order and a certainty of success The Syracusans who had listened to this discourse decreed whatever he proposed They elected Hermo crates himself to be a general and Heraclides the fon of Lysimachus and Sicanus the son of Hexeccstus these three They also appointed embassadors to go to Corinth and Laced√ mon to procure the alliance of those States and to persuade the Laced√ monians to make hotter war upon the Athenians with an open avowal that they acted in behalf of the Syracusans that by this means they might either be obliged to recal their fleet from Sicily or might be less able to sen4 any reinforcements to the army already there The B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WA i6t The Athenian forces which lay at Catana soon made p excursion from thence to Messene expecting to have it betrayed inro their power But all the steps taken previously for the purpose were totally discon certed For Alcibiades upon his quitting the com mand when recalled to Athens being convinced within himself that exile must be his portion betrayed the whole project as he had been in the secret to such persons at Messene as were attached to the Syracufans The first step this party took was to put to death all the persons against whom he informed And at the time of this attempt being quite in a ferment and under arms they carried their point lo that those who wish ed to give it were obliged to refuse admission to the Athenians The Athenians therefore after thirteert days continuance on that coast when the weather be gan to be tempestuous when their provisions failed and no hope of success appeared returned to Naxus   fwhere having thrown up an intrenchment round their camp they continued the rest of the winter They also dispatched a trireme to Athens to forward a supply of money and horsemen to join them without fail by the beginning of the spring The Syraculans employed themselves this winter in fortifying their city They inclosed Temenites within their new works and carried their wall through all _ that length of ground which faceth Epipol√ that in case they should be unable to keep the field the enemy might have as little room as possible to raise counter works of annoyance They also placed a garrison at Megara and another in Olympi√ um And all along the sea they drove rows of piles wherever the ground was convenient for descents Knowing also that the Athenians wintered at Naxus they marched out with all their force against Catana They ravaged the terri J In the original is added xa Oqaxtcf But all the editor and note writers give it up and opn they can make nothing ot it Vol II M tory 162 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL tory of the Cataneans and after burning the tents and camp of the Athenians they returned home Having also had intelligence that the Athenians had sent an embassy to Camarina under favour of a treaty made formerly with them by Laches to try if it were possible to procure their concurrence they also dis patched an embassy thither to traverse the negotiation For the Camarineans were suspected by them as if they had not cordially sent in their quota of assistance for the first battle and lest for the future they might be totally averse from acting in their support as in that battle they had seen the Athenians victorious and so induced by the former treaty they had made with the latter might now declare openly on their side Whtn therefore Hermocrates and others were arri ved at Camarina from Syracuse and from the Athe nians Euphemus and his colleagues in the embassy an assembly of the Camarineans was held in which Hermocrates desirous to give them a timely distaste against the Athenians harrangued them thus  ‚ OUR embassy hither ye men of Camarina hath  not been occasioned by any fears we were under that you might be too much terrified at the great equip  ment with which the Athenians have invaded us but rather by our knowledge with what kind of  arguments they would impose on your understanding by which before we had an opportunity to remon  strate they might seduce you into a concurrence M Sicily in fact they have invaded upon such pretext as you have heard them give out but with such intentions as we have all abundant reason to suspect And to me it is clear that their schemes  have no tendency to replant the Leontines but ra  ther to supplant us all For how is it reconcileable  with common fense that a people who have ever been employed in the ruin of the States which are  neighbouring to Athens should be sit cere in re  establishing B VI THE PELOPONNESlAN WAR i6  establishing a Sicilian people or by the bonds of consanguinity hold themselves obliged to protect the Leontines who are of Chalcidic descent whilst  on the Chalcideans of Eub≈ a from whom these o   thers are a colony they hold fast rivetted the yoke of flavery No j it is the fame cruel policy that  subjugated the Grecians in that part of the world  which now exerts itself to glut their ambition in this  These are those very Athenians who formerly ha  ving been elected their common leaders by the well  designing Ionians and that confederate body which  derived from them their descent on the glorious pre  tence of avenging themselves on the Persian mo  narch abused their trust by inflaving thole who pla   ced considence in them charging some with deiert  ihg the common cause others with their mutual em  broilments and all at length wich difserent but fpe  cious criminations And on the whole these Athe nians waged war against the Mede not in the cause of Grecian liberty as neither did the other Grecians  in the defence of their own The former fought not  indeed to subject the rest of Greece to the Mede but  to their own selves the latter merely to obtain a change of master j a master not inferior in policy but  far more abundant in malice But though Athens on manifold accounts be ob  noxious to universal censure and reproach yet we are not come hither to prove how justly she deserveth it  since your own conviction precludes the long detail  We are much more conceined at present to censure  and reproach ourselves since with all the example  before our eyes of what the Grecians in those parts  have sufsered who for want of guarding against their  incroachments have fallen victims to their ambition   since with the certain knowledge that they are  now playing the fame sophistries upon us ‚ there plantation of their kindred Leontines ‚ the sup  port of the Egesteans their allies ‚ ‚ we shew Ma no 164 THE PELOPONNESIANWAR B VI no inclination to unite together in our common de  fence in order to give them most signal proofs  thatinSiiily are neither Ionians nor Hellespontins  noriflanders who will be slaves though ever chan g ng their master one while to the Mede and soon after to whoever will please to govern ‚ but on the contrary that we are Dorians who from Pelopon nesus that seat of liberty and independence came to  dwell in Sicily Shall we therefore protract our u nion till city after city we are compelled to a fub  mission we‚ who are convinced that thus only we can be conquered and when we even behold that thus our foes have dressrd up their plan amongst  some of our people scattering dissentions setting o  thers to war down each other for the mighty recom  pence of their alliance cajoling the rest as may best  soothe the pride or caprice of each and avail themselves  of these methods to work our ruin We even in   dulge the wild imagination that though a remote  inhabitant of Sicily be destroyed the danger can ne  ver come home to ourselves and that he who pre  cedes us in ruin is unhappy only in and for himself Is there now a man amongst you who imagines that merely a Syracusan and not himself is the ob  ject of Athenian enmity and pronounceth it hard  that he must be exposed to dangers in which I only  am concerned Let such an one with more solidity reflect that not merely for what is mine but equally  also for what is his own he should associate with me though within my precincts and that this may be  done with greater security now since as yet I am not quite destroyed since in me he is sure of a stedfast  ally and before he is bereaved of all support may  hazard the contention And let him farther rest as  lured that it is not the fole view of the Athenian to  bridle enmity in a Syracusan j but under the colour of that pretext to render himself the more secure by gaining for a time the friendship of another   If B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 165 c  If others again entertain any envy or jealousy of Syracuse for to each of these great States are ge nerally obnoxious and would take delight in seeing  us depressed in order to teach us moderation though  not totally destroyed from a regard to his own pre  scrvation ‚ these are such sanguine wishes as in the  course of human affairs can never be accomplished  Because it is quite impossible that the same person ¬ shall build up airy schemes to soothe his own passions and then insure their success And thus should some sinister event take place quite sunk under the  weight of his own calamity he would perhaps be c soon wishing again that I was so replaced as to ex cite his envy Impossible this for one who aban doned my defence who refused before hand toparti  cipate my dangers ‚ dangers though not in name yet in reality his own For if names alone be re garded he acts in the support of my power but if realities of his own preservation  Long since ye men of Camarina it was incum bent on you who are borderers upon us and must be our seconds in ruin to have foreseen these things and not to have abetted our defence with so much re missness as you have hitherto done it You ought to have repaired to our support with free and voluntary  aid with such as in case the Athenians had begun first with Camarina you would have come with ear nest prayers to implore from us So cordial and so a lert you should have appeared in our behalf to avert ¬ us from too precipitate submissions But these things  never were not even you nor any other people  have shewed such affection or alacrity for us  From timorousnels of heart you will study perhaps  a manage both wirh us and the invaders and alledge that there are treaties subsisting between yourlelves and the Athenians Yet theie treaties you never made to  hurt your friends but to repel the efforts of your f foes should they dare to attack you By them you M 3 V W t j66 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI  are bound to give defensive aid to the Athenians  when attacked by others and not when they as is  the present case injuriously fall upon your neigh  bours Remember that the Rhegians though even  of Chalcidic descent have refused to concur with them in replanting the Leontines who are also Chal  cideans Hard indeed is your fate if they fus  pecting some bad design to lie lurking under a fair  justification have recourse to the wary moderate be  haviour which appearances will not warrant whilst  you on the pretended ground of a rational conduct t are eager to serve a people who are by nature your foes and join with most implacable enemies to de  stroy your own kindred to whom nature hath Ib  closely attached you 1 In such a conduct there is no justice The justice lies in abetting our cause and not dastardly shrinking before the terror of their arms These arms are not terrible would we only all combine in our mutual defencei they are only so if on the contrary we con tinue disunited the point which the Athenians la bour with so much assiduity For even when sin  g y against Us they entered the lists and were victo  rious yet they were not able to effectuate their de  signs but were obliged precipitacely to re embark  If united therefore what farther can we have to  fear What hinders us from associating together  with instant alacrity and zeal especially as we  soon shall receive an aid from Peloponnesus who in  all the business of war are far superior to Athenians  Reject I fay the vain presumption that either it  will be equitable in regard to us or prudential in re  gard to yourselves to take part with neither fide on  pretence that you have treaties subsisting with both  There is a fallacy in it which though veiled under  plausible words the event will soon detect For if through your determination to abandon his support J the party already attacked be vanquished and the  assailant B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAft 167  assailant be invigorated by success what can such ab lt sensing of yourselves avail but to help forwards the ruin of the one and afford free scope to the pernicious schemes of the other And how glorious would the reverse of this conduct be would you exert your ef forts to redress the injured who also by the ties of consanguinity have a right to expect it from you j  to guard the common welfare of Sicily and not suf  fer your friends your good friends the Athenians  to run out into a course of outrage  In a word we Syracusans have now only this to  add That arguments are superfluous either for the instruction of you or of others in points whose ten  dency you know as clearly as ourselves But we ear  nestly conjure you and if prayers will not avail we  boldly protest against you that as the worst designs  are formed against us by our eternal foes the Io nians you would act as you ought ‚ ‚ if not that by  you we are basely betrayed Dorians by Dorians If such must be our fate if by the Athenians we  must be destroyed they will be indebted for their c success to your determinations but the glory of it  will be totally assumed by themselves Nay the u chief reward they will reap from the victory will be  this to inflave the persons who enabled them to gaia  it But then should the victory rest with us you are  the men from whom we shall exact revenge for all the dangers to which we have been exposed Examine  things therefore and declare your resolution either  at once without embarking into dangers to put on ‚ the Athenian chains or with us to face the storm  and earn your preservation not basely bending to the yoke of foreign tyrants and preventing an enmi  ty with us which will not quickly be appeased In these words Hermocrates harangued the Camark peans And when he had ended Euphemqs embas sador of the Athenians replied as follows M 4 OUH 68 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI OUR journey hither was intended for the renewal  of a former alliance but as this Syracusan hath ta ken the liberty to be severe upon us we lie under an obligation to flhew the justice of our title to that share  of dominion which we now possess And the strong tst evidence of this he himself hath been pleased to  give by affirming that lonians have been eternal foes to Dorians The fact is incontestibly true Since we who are lonians have been necessitated to stand ever upon our guard against the incroaching  designs of the Pcloponnesians who are Dorians who  are our superiors in number and are seated upon our  borders When therefore in the close of the Per f sian invasion we saw ourselves masters of a navy we  asserted our own independence from the government f and guidance of the Laced√ monians since no sha  dow of reason could be found why we should be obe  dient to them any more than they to us save only  that in this critical period their strength was greater  We were afterwards appointed by free election the  leaders of those lonians who had sormerly been sub ject to the monarch And the preference awarded to us we continue to support assured that on y thus we f shall escape subjection to the Peloponnesian yoke by  keeping possession of a power which can effectually awe all their incroachments And farther that we may come to particulars it was not with injustice  that we exacted subjection from those lonians and in habitants of the isles whom the Syracusans fay we f thought proper to inflave though connected with us  by the ties ot blood For they marched in company V with the Mcde against their mother country against  us their founders They had not the courage to ex  pose their own homes to ruin and devastation by an y honest revolt though we with magnanimity aban doned even Athens itself They made slavery their K choice and in the same miserable fate would have  been B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 169  been glad to invelope us Thus solid are the  grounds on which we found our title to that extensive  rule we now enjoy We honestly deserve it Since in the cause of Greece we equipped the largest fleet  and exerted the greatest ardour without the least e  quivocation and since those others acting with im  plicit obedience to the Mede did all they could to 4 distress us To which let it be added that we were  at the fame time desirous to obtain a strength suffi  cient to give a check to the ambition of Peloponne  sians Submissive therefore to their dictates we are  not will not be because either in return for the  repulse of the barbarian by our single efforts or in  requital of the dangers we bravely encountered in de  fence of the liberty of those Ionians greater than  all the rest of Greece or even they themselves durst  hazard for their own  we have an undoubted  right to empire  But farther to guard its own liberties and rights  is a privilege which without either murmur or en  vy will be allowed to every State And now for  the security of these important points to ourselves  have we ventured hither to beg your concurrence  conscious at the fame time ye inen of Camarina  that your welfare too coincides with our own This  we can clearly demonstrate even from those crimina  tions which our adversaries here have lavished upon  us and from those so terrible suspicions which you  yourselves are inclined to entertain of our proceed 4 ings We are not now to learn that men who  with some high degrees of horror suspect latent mis  chief may for the present be soothed by an insinua  ting flow of words but when summoned to action  will so exert themselves as is expedient for their wel  fare And consonant to this we have already hint  ed that through fear alone we seized that power  which we now possess in Greece that through the ¬ fame motive we have ventured hither to establish our own i7o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI own security in concert with that of our friends so  far from the view of instaving them to ourselves that  we are solely intent on preserving them from being  inslaved by others   Let no man here retort upon us ‚ that all our so licitude for you is unmerited and superfluous Such an one must know that so long as you are safe so long as you are able to employ the Syracusans the  less liable they will be to send reinforcements from hence to the Peloponnesians for our annoyance  And as this is the real state of things our concern should most largely be bestowed upon you By pari  ty of rtalon it also highly concerns us to replant the  Leontines not in order to render them vassals to  ourselves as their relations of Eub≈ a are but to make them as strong and powerful as we are able  that seated as they then will be on her confines  they may compensate our remote situation in afford  ing a diversion to Syracuse For if the view be car  ricd back to Greece we ourselves are there a match  for our foes The Chacidean there whom after un justly inslaving we are taxed with absurdity for pre tending to vindicate here is highly serviceable to us because he is disarmed and because he furnisheth us  with a tribute But here in Sicily our interest de  mandeth that the Leontines and the whole body of our friends be restored to the fujl enjoyment of all their liberty and strength Now to a potentate invested with superior pow er or to a State possessed of empire nothing that is profitable can be deemed absurd nothing secure that cannot be safely managed Incidents will arise with which we must temporize and determine accor dingly our enmity or our friendship But the latter makes most for our interest here where we ought by  no means to weaken our friends but through the strength of our friends to keep down and disable our  enemies Of this you ou ht not to rest incredulous B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR i7r as you know that over our dependents in Greece we either hold tight or slacken the rein as squares best  with the public service We permit to the Chians  and Methymneans the free use of their liberties and  laws for a quota of shipping we do the same  to many for an annual tribute exacted perhaps  with somewhat of rigour Others amongst them who fight under our orders are absolutely free  though seated upon islands and easy to be totally re  duced because they are commodiously situated to an noy the Peloponnesian coast And hence it may be   depended upon that we shall make such dispositions ‚ allo here as are most expedient for our own interest and may best lessen the dread which as was said be  fore we entertain of the Syracusans The point at which they aim is an extent of their  rule over you and when by alarming your suspicions  of us they have wrought you to their own purpose either by open force or taking advantage of your de  solate condition when we are repulsed and obliged 1 to abandon your desence they intend to subdue all  Sicily to their yoke Such the event will unavoidably  prove if at present you adhere to them For never again will it be easy for us to assemble together so  large an armament to give a check to their ambition j  nor when we are no longer at hand for your support  will their strength against you be insufficient It is ‚ vain in any man to indulge an opinion that this may s not be the cafe since the very train of things evin  ceth its truth For when first you invited us hither  it was not upon the suggestion of any other fear than  this that should we suffer you to be subjected by the f Syracusans the danger then would extend itself to  us And highly unjust it would be now if the argu  ment you luccessfully inforced with us should lose all its  influence upon you or should you ground suspicions on our present appearance against them with a force  superior to theirs when you ought much more to en 2 certain t7a THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V1  tertain an endless distrust of them The truth is this that without your concurrence we are not able tocofl  tinue here And in case with perfidy open and a  vowed we make seizure of your cities yet we are  unable to retain their possession remote as they lie  from Athens as cities fo large we never could gar  rison and as they are farther provided in all respects  as well as any on the continent But on the contra  ry the Syraculans will not rush upon you from a  camp upon the beach but posted in a city more  formidable in strength than the whole of our arma ment they are ever meditating your ruin and when they have seized a proper oppoitunity will strike the  blow They have afforded you instances of this al ready and a flagrant one indeed in the cafe of the Leontines And yet they have the effrontery now by words as if you were so to be deluded to exas perate you against us who have hitherto comrouled their views and deterred them to this moment from  making all Sicily their prey Our arguments have a tendency directly opposite  We have nothing in view but your certain and affu  red prelervation when we earnestly conjure you not wilfully to betray the mean s which at present will rtf  suit from our union which we can mutually exert in  one another s behalf and strongly to represent to  your own reflexions thar even without the concur rence of allies a road to your reduction will at any  time be open to these Syracusans through their own  superior numbers but an opportunity exceedingly  seldom afforded you to make head against thettl  with so large an auxiliary body And if from  groundless suspicions you suffer now fo large a body  to depart either unsuccessful or defeated yet a time will come when you will ardently wish to see them  return though in a much less proportion of strength  and they have it no longer in their power to cross the  lea for your lupport Take care theresore Cama  rjneans B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 173 rineans that neither yourselves nor others be decei  ved by a too credulous belief of the bold calumnia  tions these Syracusans utter We have now laid be fore you the true ground of all those sad suspicions which are fomented against us but shall again recal  them to your remembrance by a short recapitulation that they may have the proper influence upon you We declare therefore that we rule in Greece merely to prevent our being inflaved but are intent on vindicating liberty in Sicily to suppress that an  noyance which might otherwise be given us from hence ‚ that mere necessity obligeth us to embark in t many undertakings because we have many sinister  incidents to guard against ‚ that now and formerly  we came hither to support those Sicilians who have been unjustly oppressed not uninvited but solemnly  conjured to take such steps Attempt not there  fore to divert our pursuits either by erecting your stives into censors of our proceedings or into correc tors of our politics a point too disficult for you to manage But so much of our activity or conduct  as you can mould into a consistency with your own  welsare lay hold of that and employ it to your best  advantage and never imagine that our politics are equally prejudicial to all the world besides but high ly benesicial to the bulk of the Grecians For  through every quarter even those which we cannot  pretend to controul both such as dread impending  mischiefs and such as meditate incroachments ‚ lay ing hold on both sides of the ready expectation the  former that redress may be obtained by our interpo fition the latter that if we think proper to oppose  them their own sasety will be greatly endangered ‚  both sides I fay are hence obliged the latter to  practise moderation though with regret the former  to enjoy tranquillity without previous embroilments of the public peace The security therefore which  now offers itself to your acceptance and is always V ready 174 THE PELOPONNES AN WAR B VI ready for those who want it you are conjured by no  means to reject but relying like other communi  ties on that quantity of support we are able to af ford you put the change for once on the Syracusans  and instead of being ever on the watch against them force them at length to be watchful and alarmed for  themselves Such was the reply of Euphemus In the mean time the real disposition of the Camarineans was this A t bottom they were well affected to the Athenians save only for the ambition they shewed of inflaving Sicily  but had ever been embroiled with the Syracusans through that jealousy ever to be found in a neighbour ing State But as the dread of victory on the fide of the Syracusans who were close upon their borders if earned without their concurrence had influenced their measures they sent a small party of horse to suc cour them on the former occasion and looked upon themselves as obliged in policy to serve them underhand in future exigences but with all possible frugality and reserve and at the present juncture that they might not betray any the least partiality against the Athenians as they were come offvictorious from a battle to return the fame impartial reply to both Determined there fore by these considerations they answered ‚ ‚ that  since a war had broke out between two States each  of which was in alliance with themselves they judged  the only method of acting consistently with their  oaths would be to observe a strict neutrality Upon this the embassadors of both parties took their leaves and departed And the Syracusans within themselves exerted their utmost applications to get all things in readiness for war The Athenians who were now incamped at Naxus opened negotiations with the Siculi to draw over as many of them as was possible into their adherence Many of these who inhabited the plains and were most B VI THE PELOPONNESlAN WAR 175 most awed by the Syracusans stood resolutely out but the generality of those who were seated in the midland parts as they were now and had ever kept themselves uncontrouled sided at once with the Athenians They furnished them with corn for the service of the army and there were some who supplied them with money And then the Athenians taking the field against such as refused to accede forced some to a compliance and prevented others from receiving garrisons and aids from Syracuse During winter also they removed again from Naxus to Catana and having repaired their camp which had been burned by the Syracusans chose to pass the remainder of the winter there They also dispatched a trireme to Carthage to ask their friendship and whatever assistance could possibly be obtained They sent also to Tuscany as some ci ties on that coast had made them voluntary offers of as sistance And farther they circulated their orders a mong the Siculi and dispatched in particular one to the Egesteans  to send them as large a number of horses  as they could possibly procure They busied them selves in collecting materials for circumvallation such as bricks and iron and all other necessary stores being determined to carry on the war with vigour on the first approach of spring The embassadors who from Syracuse were sent to Corinth and Laced√ mon endeavoured in their passage to prevail with the Italians  not to look with uncon  cern on the Athenian proceedings since they also  were equally involved in the danger But when arrived at Corinth they were admitted to an audience in which they insisted on a speedy supply upon the plea of consanguinity and the Corinthians came at once to a resolution by way of precedent to others that  with all possible ardour they would join in their defence They even appointed an embassy of their own to accompany them to Laced√ mon whose instructions were to second them in soliciting the Laced√ monians 176 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI monians  to declare open war at home against the  Athenians and to fit out an aid for the service of   Sicily At the time that these joint embassies arrived at La ced√ mon from Corinth Alcibiades was also there He had no sooner made his escape attended by his companions in exile than in a trading vessel he pasted over from Thuria to Cyllene in Elea and from thence he repaired to Laced√ mon But as the Laced√ mo nians had pressed to see him he went thither under the protection of the public faith for he had with reason dreaded his reception there since he had acted so large a part in the affair of Mantinea It happened farther that when a public assembly was convened at Sparta the Corinthians and the Sy racusans and Alcibiades all urged the fame request and were successful Nay though the College of E phori and those who presided at the helm os theStaie had dressed up a plan in pursuance of which they were on ly to send their embassadors to Syracuse to hinder all accommodations with the Athenians and were quite a verle to the supplying them with real succours ‚ yet Al cibiades standing up inflamed the Laced√ monian fu ry and wrought them to his purpose by the following harangue I LIE under a necessity in the beginning of my discourse to vindicate myself srom the calumny  which hath been charged against me lest a jealousy of me might divert your attention from those points which equally affect the common cause My ances tors therefore having upon some reasonable grounds of complaint renounced the privilege of be  ing the public hosts of your embassies at Athens I 1 am the man who again re established this hospitable intercourse who in many other respects endeavour  ed with great assiduity to oblige you and particular  ly in the calamity which fell to your share at Pylus J I cheer B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 177 I cheerfully persevered in these my favourable incli nations towards you till you yourselves bent on m accommodating your differences with the Athenians employed my adversaries to negotiate your affairs and as thereby you invested them with authority you of course reflected disgrace on me With rea son therefore after such provocations you were af terwards thwarted by me when I supported the in  terest of the Mantineans and the Argives and in troduced new measures into the State in opposition to you Let therefore such of your number as chagrined at what they suffered then continue un  justly their resentments against me weigh now the force of those reasons on which I acted and return  to better temper If again I suffer in the opinion of any man because I have ever manifested an attach  ment to the interest of the people let him also learn  that his enmity to me on that account is not to be defended We have borne from time immemorial a stedfast unrelenting aversion to tyrants now the  whole of opposition to the despotic power of one is  expressed by this word the people and on this prin ciple alone our firm and constant adherence to the multitude hath been hitherto carried on and supported Besides as the State of which I was a member was  purely democratical I lay under a necessity in many respects of conforming my conduct to the established  model and yet I endeavoured to give the public measures a greater share of moderation than the frantic humour of the Athenians was judged capable  of brooking But incendiaries started up such as  not only in earlier times but even in our own have driven the people to more furious measures and have at length effected‚ the exile of Alcibiades But  so long as the State was in my own management I  thought myself justified could I preserve it in that  height of grandeur and freedom and on the lame  model of government in which I found it Not but Vol II N that i78 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI that the judicious part of our community are sensible what fort of a government a democracy is ‚ and I  myself no less than others who have such abundant  occasion to reproach and curse it ‚ but for mad ness open and avowed new terms of abhorrence can  not be invented though totally to subvert it we  could in no wise deem a measure of security whilst  you had declared yourselves our foes and were in the  field against us And all those proceedings of mine which have proved most offensive to you are to be charged entirely to such principles as these  And now in relation to these points on which  you are here assembled to deliberate and I also with you and about which if I am able to give you a greater light I am bound to do it ‚ attend to what  I am going to declare Our principal view in the  expedition to Sicily was if possible to reduce the Sicilians to our yoke After them we intended to do the same by the Italians We should next have attempted the dominions of the Carthaginians nay  Carthage itself Had these our views been succes ful eithes in the whole or the greater part we  should soon have given the attack to Peloponnesus assembling for that purpose the whole Grecian force  which the countries thus subdued must have added to  our own taking also into our pay large bodies of  Barbarians and Iberians and other soldiers of those  nations which by general consent are famed for the most warlike of all Barbarians We should have built also great numbers of triremes for the enlarge ment of our navy as Italy would plentifully have  supplied us with timber with which blocking up  Peloponnesus on all sides and with our land forces  at the same time invading it by land after carrying your cities some by storm and some by the regular  siege we hoped without obstruction to have warred you down and in pursuance of that to have seized  the empire of universal Greece With money and all needful B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 179 needful stores adequate to this extensive plan the  cities to be conquered in those remoter parts would with all proper expedition have supplied us without any demands on our own domestic revenues Such were to be the atchievements of that grand armament  which is now abroad  such you may rest assured upon the evidence of a person who was privy to every step was its original plan and the generals who are  left in the command will yet if they are able carry it into execution And I must farther beg leave to  tell you that if with timely succours you do not  interpose nothing in those parts will be able to stand  before them The Sicilians are a people unexperienced in war and yet would they unite and combine together in their mutual defence they might possibly even now be too hard for the Athenians But then the Syra cusans abandoned as they are by the rest and who  already have leen their whole force defeated in battle  and who are blocked up in their own harbours by the enemy s fleet will be unable long to resist the great  force of the Athenians which is already there If therefore Syracuse be taken all Sicily is vanquished  at a stroke and Italy becometh instantly their prey f and then the storm which as I intimated before  was to be directed against you from that quarter will in a short time gather and come pouring down  upon you Let no one therefore imagine that the end of your  present deliberation is the lasety of Sicily when Pe loponnesus itself will be endangered unless some measures of prevention be execuced with speed  ‚  unless you send out a naval force for the preferva tion of Sicily so dexterously appointed that the hands who man the ships and ply the oar may on the instant of their landing become a body of  heavy armed and what in my judgement is better than an army a citizen of Sparta to take upon him N 2   the 180 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI the command that those who are ready he maydis  cipline to service and force such to join as on choice would refuse their concurrence for by such a step  those who are already your friends will be animated with higher degrees of resolution and those who fluctuate at present will join you with a smaller sense of fear It behoves you also to make war upon the Athe  nians at home in a more declared and explicit man ner that the Syracusans convinced that you have their welfare at heart may make a more obstinate  resistance and the Athenians be rendered less able to fend reinforcements to their troops in Sicily It behoves you farther to raise fortifications at De celea in Attica a step which the Athenians have  ever most terribly apprehended and think that in that point alone you have not put their resolution to its utmost trial in the present war and that assuredly  must be pronounced the most effectual method ofdis tresfing an enemy to discover what he dreads most and then know how to afflict him in his most tender  part For it is a reasonable conclusion that they will tremble most at incidents which should they take  place they are inwardly convinced must most senfi bly affect them As to the benefits which you your selves shall reap by fortifying Decelea and of what  they shall be debarred I shall pass over many and this ail the natural commodities of the country will fall into your hands some by way of booty the rest  by voluntary contributions They will instantly be deprived of the profits cf the silver mines at Laurium  as well as of the rents of their estates and the fees of their courts The tributes from their dependents will allo be paid with less punctuality since the lat ter hall no sooner perceive that you are earnestly bent on war than they will shew an open disregard  for Athens only concisely point out the most i  By That B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR i8x That these or any of these points be executed with dispatch and vigour dependeth ye Laced√ mo nians on yourselves alone I can confidently aver  that all are feasible and I think I shall not prove mis M taken in my sentiments I ought not to suffer in the  opinion of any Laced√ monian though once ac  counted the warmest of her patriots I now strenu  oufly join the most inveterate foes of my cuuntry nor ought my sincerity to be suspected by any as if I  suited my words to the sharp resentments of an exile  I am driven from my country through the malice of men who have prevailed against me but not  from your service if you hearken to my counsels Your enmity is sooner to be forgiven who have hurt  your enemies alone than their s who by cruel treat ment compel friends to be foes My patriotism is  far from thriving under the injustice I have suffered it was merely an effect of gratitude for that protection  I once enjoyed from my country Nor have 1 reason at present to imagine that against my country I am now going to march so much as to recover some  country to myself when at present I have none at all And 1 judge the person to be a true lover of his country not him who exiled from it abandons  himself without a struggle to his own iniquitous fate but who from a fondness for it leaves no pro ject unattempted to recover it again As these are my sentiments I may fairly ye La  ced√ monians insist upon your acceptance of my ser  vice without diffidence or fear whatever dangers or whatever miseries may hereafter result You well  know the maxim which universal consent will evince to be good that if when an enemy I hurt you  much when I am now become your friend I can  help you more Nay for the latter I am better qua lifted on this very account that I am perfectly ac quainted with the state of Athens whereas 1 was on  ly able to conjecture at your s And as you are N 3 now 182 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V1 now met together to form resolutions on points of the highest importance I conjure you without hesitation to carry you arms at once into Sicily and Attica to the end that in the former by the presence of a small part of your forces you may work out signal preservations and at home pull down the present and  even the future growth of the Athenians that for ages to come yourselves may reap security and  peace and preside at the helm of united Greece which will cheerfully acquiesce under your guidance  and pay you a free uncompelled obedience To this purpose Alcibiades spoke And the Lace d√ monians who had before some sort of intention to take the field against Athens though hitherto they pro tracted its execution were now more than ever anima ted lo it when Alcibiades had given them such a detail 6f affairs whom they judged to have the clearest insight in them Thereupon ihcy turned their attention imme diately on fortifying Decelea and sending out a body os succour for the present service of Sicily They also appointed Gylippus the son of Cleandridas to go and take upon him ihe command at Syracuse with orders by concerting measures with the Syracusans and Corin thians to draw up a plan for the most effectual and most ready conveyance of succours thither Gylippus accordingly issued out his orders to the Co rinthians to attend him without loss of time at A sine with two ships and also to expedite the equipment of the fleet which they designed for this service and to keep them in readiness to fail when opportunity should require Having so far concerted measures the embas sadors departed from Laced√ mon The Athenian trireme also dispatched from Sicily by the generals on that post to demand supplies of mo ney and a body of horse was by this time arrived at A thens And the Athenians on hearing their demands drew B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 183 drew up a derree to send away supplies to chat arma ment and a body of horsemen And here the winter ended and the seventeenth year of this war of which Thucydides hath compiled the history came also to an end YEAR XVIII J O N the earliest approach of the spring which led on the following summer the Athenians in Sicily hoist ing from Catana shewed themselves on the coast of Me gara in Sicily of Which the Syracusans having dispos sessed the inhabitants in the time of Gelon the tyrant as I have already related continued mailers of the foil Having landed here they ravaged the country till approaching a fortress belonging to the Syracusans and attempting it without success they retired some by land and the rest on board the fleet into the river Tereas from whence going again on shore they rava ged the plains and set fire to the growing corn Thry also fell in with a small party of Syracusans some of whom they flew and then erecting a trophy went again on board They next returned to Catana and aster victualling there proceeded from thence with their whole force to the attack of Centoripa a strong fort belonging to the Siculj j and having made them selves masters of it by a capitulation they stood away burning down in their passage the corn of the Inesseans and Hybleans Upon returning to Catana they find there two hundred and fifty horiemen arrived from A thens though without horses yet with all the proper furniture as if they could be better supplied with the former in Sicily as also thirty archers mounted and ‚ three hundred talents in silver X Before Christ 414 II 184 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI In the fame spring the Laced√ monians also took the field against Argos and advanced as far as Cleonae but the mock of an earthquake being felt there they again retired And after this the Argives making an irruption into the Thyreatis which borders upon themselves took a vast booty from the Laced√ monians which fold for no less than  twenty five talents And not long after in the fame spring the popular party at Thespi√ assaulted those in power but without success And though the Athenians marched away to their succour some of them were apprehended and o thers were obliged to take refuge at Athens In the fame summer the Syracusans had no sooner re ceived intelligence of the arrival of a body of horsemen amongst the Athenians and the design of advancing immediately to assault them than it occurred to their reflexions that  in case the Athenians could not pos ‚ sess themselves of Epipol√ a spot of ground which  is only one continued crag and lies directly above the city of Syracuse it would be disficult to inclose them completely round wiih works of circumvalla tion even though they should be defeated in open battle They applied themselves therefore to the guard of all the approaches to Epipol√ that the ene my might not on a sudden gain the eminence for by other methods it was impossible for them to carry that post Excepting those approaches the rest of the tract is an impracticable steep inclining gradually quite down to the city and commanding the view of every thing within it Hence therefore because it riseth with a continual ascent it was called by the Syracusans Epipol√ As Hermocrates and his colleagues had now formally taken upon them the command the whole force of Sy racuse marched out by break of day into a meadow on the banks of the Anapus to pass under reviews where the first thing they did was to select seven hun B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 185 dred of the choicest men amongst the heavy armed to be commanded by Diomilus an exile from Andrus These were appointed for the guard of Epipol√ and to be ready for service as they were always to keep in a body on any sudden emergence But the Athenians who had mustered their forces on the preceding day had stood away from Catana and were come in the night undiscovered to the spot called Leon which is distant  six or seven stadia from Epipol√ where they disbarked their land forces and then serit their ships to lie in the station of Thapsus Thapsus is a peninsula joined to the main land by a narrow isthmus and jut ting out into the sea at no great distance from the city of Syracuse either by land or water The naval force of the Athenians having secured their station by a pa lisado across the isthmus Jay quiet in their posts But the land army without loss of time made a running march towards Epipol√ and mounted by the pals of Euryalus before the Syracusans who were yet in the meadow busied in their review discovered or were able to advance to prevent them And now their whole force was in motion to distodge them each man wich all possible alacrity and more particularly the seven hundred commanded by Diomilus But from the mea dow to the nearest spot where they could come up with the enemy was a march of no less than j twenty five stadia To this it was owing that the Syracusans came to the charge in a disorderly manner and being plain ly repulsed in battle at Epipol√ were forced to retire within the city Diomilus also and about three hun dred more lose their lives in this engagement In pursuance of this the Athenians having erected a trophy and given up the bodies of the stain tinder truce to the Syracusans marched down the next day in order of battle to the very gates of the city But as the Sy  Above half a mile j Two miles and a bi s raculans 1 i86 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI racusans refrained from sallying out against them they again drew off and raised a fort at Labdalum on the very steepest edge of Epipol√ looking towards Mega ra which they intended as a repository for their bag gage and money whilst themselves might be called off cither to fight or to carry on the works of a siege Soon after this they were joined by a body of three hundred Egestean horse and one hundred more consist ing of Siculi and Naxians and some others in their al liance The Athenian cavalry was in all two hundred and fifty They had procured some horses from the E gesteans and Cataneans and had purchased the rest so that now they had got together a body of horse amount ing in all to six hundred and fifty A garrison was no sooner settled in the fort of Labda lum than the Athenians approached to Tyche where taking post they built a wall in circle with great expe dition and by the rapidity of their work struck conster nation into the Syracusans Upon this they sallied out with the sixed design of hazarding an engagement as they saw the danger of dallying any longer The ar mies on both sides were now beginning to face each o ther but the Syracusan generals observing that their own army was in disarray and could not easily be for med into proper order made them all wheel off again into the city except a party of their horse These keeping the field prevented the Athenians from carry ing stones and straggling to any distance from their posts But at length one Athenian band of heavy armed supported by the whole body of their cavalry attacked and put to flight these Syracusan horsemen They made some slaughter amongst them and erected a trophy for this piece of success against the enemy s ca valry On the day following some of the Athenians began to raise a wall along the northern side of their drtU whilst others were employed in carrying stones and tim ber which they laid down in heaps all along the place called B VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 187 called Trogilus near to the line marked out for the cir cumvallation which was to reach by the shortest com pass from the great harbour on one side to the sea on the other But the Syracusans who were principally guided by the advice of Hermocrates gave up all thoughts of sallying out for the future with the whole strength of the city to give battle to the Athenians It was judged more adviseable to run along a wall in length which should cut the line in which the Athenian works were designed to pass and which could they ef fect it in time mull entirely exclude the enemy from persecting their circumvallation Nay farther in cafe the enemy should come up in a body to interrupt the work they might give them full employ with one divi sion of their force whilst another party might raise pa lilades to secure the approaches at least as the whole of the Athenian force must be drawn out to oppose them they would be obliged to discontinue their own works To raise therefore the projected work they issued out ot the city and beginning at the foot of the city wall from below the Athenian circle they carried on srom thence a transverse wall cutting down the o live trees in the sacred grove of which they buiit wood en turrets to cover their work The Athenian shipping was not yet come round from Thapsus into the great harbour but the Syracusans continued masters of all the posts upon the sea and consequently the Athenians were obliged to fetch up all necessary stores from Thap sus across the land When it appeared to the Syracusans that all their palisades and the transverse wall were sufficiently com pleted in which the Athenians had given them no manner of interruption as they were under apprehen sions that should they divide their force they might be exposed to a defeat and at the same time were ar dently intent on perfecting their own circumvallation ‚ the Syracusans drew off again into the city leaving only one 188 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI one band of heavy armed for the guard of their counter wall In the next place the Athenians cut off the pipes which by subterraneous ducts conveyed the drinking water into the city and having farther observed that the Syracusans kept within their tents during the heat of the day but that some had straggled into the town whilst those posted at the palisades kept but a negli gent ouard they picked out three hundred of their heavy armed and strengthening them with a choice party os their light armed soldiers ordered them to march with all possible speed and attack the counter work The rest of their force was to march another way since headed by one of the generals it advanced towards the city to employ the Syracusans in case they sallied whilst the other detachment headed by the other general attacked the palisade which covered the sally port Accordingly the three hundred assault and carry the palisade which those who were posted for its guard abandoned and fled sor shelter behind the works which inclosed Temenites The pursuers however entered with them  but were no sooner got in than they were again forcibly driven out by the Syra cusans And here some of the Argives and a small number of Athenians were flain But now the whole army wheeling about demo lished the counter work and pulled up the palisade The piles of which it was composed they carried off in triumph and erected a trophy The next morning the Athenians resumed their work of circumvallation and continued it across the crag which is above the marsh and lies on the quarter os Epipol√ that looks towards the great harbour This was the shortest cut for their circumvallation down wards across the plain and the marsh till it reached the harbour Upon this the Syracusans issuing again raised another palisade beginning from the city and stretching quite across the marsh They also threw up B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 189 an entrenchment along the palisade entirely to pre vent the Athenians from continuing their works quite down to the sea The latter when they h id perfected their work along the crag are bent on demolishing the new palisade and intrenchment of the Syracusans For this purpose they had ordered their shipping to come about from Thapsus into the great harbour or Syracuse They themselves at the morning s dawn marched down from Epipolse into the plain and then crossing the marsh where the mud was hardest and best able to bear by the help of boards and planks which they laid upon the surface they carry almost the whole length of the palisade and intrenchment early in the morning and were soon after masters of the whole This was not effected without a battle in which the Athenians were again victorious The routed Syracusans fled different ways those who had composed their right towards the city and those who had composed their left to wards the river But with a view of intercepting the passage of the latter the three hundred chosen Atheni ans marched wich all speed to seize the bridge The Syracusans alarmed at this step as this body consisted of the bulk of their horse face about on the three hun dred and put them to flight and then break in upon the right wing of the Athenians By so unexpected a shock the first band in thac wing was thrown into dis order Lamachus observing it advanced to their sup port from the left with a small party of archers that happened to be near him and the whole body of the Argrves Having crossed a ditch that lay between se conded only by a few whilst the bulk of his parry made a full stop he is instantly flain j  as were also five  Plutarch in the life of Nicias circumstantiates the manner in which this old general lost his life in character Calibrates a good soldier but of great impe tuosity rode at the head of the Syracusan horse Being challenged out by Calibra tes Lamachus alone engaged personally with him Lamachus received the first wound j he then returned the blow and dropped His antagonist fell at the fame time and they both expired together Or igo THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR B VI or six of thole by whom he was accompanied The Sy racusans caught up their bodies with al possible expe dition and bore them off to a place of security on the other side of the river They were in great measure obliged to make a precipitate retreat since the rest of the Athenian army was now coming up to attack them But now such of the Syracusans as had fled at first towards the city having gained leisure to observe such turns in their favour caught fresh courage from the fight and forming again into order stood their ground against that body of Athenians which faced them They also send a detachment to attempt the circle on Epipol√ concluding it to be unmanned for the present and might at once be taken This detachment in fact made itself master of the out work and demolishad it for about ten pktbres in length but the circle itself was defended by Nicias from all their attempts Ni cias being much out of order had been left to repose himself within the circle He therefore issued orders to bis servants to set fire to all the machines arid the tim ber which were lying before the wall for he was con vinced that thus alone in such a toral wane of hands for their defence any safety could be earned The event answered his expectation for when the flames began to mount the Syracusans durst not any longer come near but thought proper tc desist and march a way For now the Athenians who by this time had chaced the enemy from off the plain were remounting the ascent to defend their circle and at the same instant of time their fleet conformable to the orders they had received was standing into the great harbour The Syraculans upon the high ground beheld the sight which occasioned them and the whole Syracufan army to retire precipitately into the city  concluding them selves no longer able without an augmentation of their present strength to hinder the completion ot the Artie nian works quite down to the sea B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR i9c After this the Athenians erected a trophy and in pursuance of a truce delivered up their flam to the Sy racusans and received in exchange the body of Lama chus and of those who fell with him The junction of their whole armament both of their land and naval force being now completed they be gan again from Epipol√ and the crag to invert the Syracusans with a double wall which they were to continue quite down to the sea The necessary provi sions to supply their army were brought in from all the coasts of Italy Many also of the Siculi who had hi therto stood aloof declared now for the Athenians and came into their alliance who were farther joined by three vessels with fisty oars from Hetruria All other points equally contributed to elevate their hopes For the Syracusans had begun to despair of be ing able to sustain the siege as they had no glimpse of a ny approaching succour from Peloponnesus They were toffing to and fro amongst themselves some propo sals for an accommodation and had even sounded Ni cias upon that head who by the death of Lamachus was left invested with the sole command Nothing de finitive was however concluded though as might rea sonably be expected from men in high perplexity and more straitly besieged than ever many proposals were made to him and many more were agitated within the city The distresses also which environed them ac present struck into them mutual suspicions of one ano ther Nay they even divested of their charge the ge nerals who were in authority when these distresses came upon them as if all was owing to their misconduct or treachery and chose in their stead Heraclides and Eu cles and Tellias In the mean time Gylippus the Laced√ monian and the ships from Corinth were come up to Leucas designing with the utmost expedition to pass over from thence to Sicily But terrible accounts came thick up on them here and all agreed in broaching the fame un truth I ga THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VL truth that  Syracuse was completely invested on all  sides Gylippus upon this gave up all hopes of sa ving Sicily but having the preservation of Italy still at heart he and Pythen the Corinthian with the small squadron at hand consisting only of two Laconic and two Corinthian vessels crossed over the Ionian gulf with all possible dispatch to Tarentum The Corinthians besides their own ten now fitting out were to man two belonging to the Leucadians and three more belong ing to the Ambraciots and follow them as soon as pos sible The first step of Gylippus now arrived at Tarentum was to go in quality of embassador to Thuria claiming privilege for it as his father had been a denison of that State but finding himself unable to gain their concur rence he weighed from thence and stood along the coast of Italy But in the Terinean gulf he met with a hard gale of wind which in this gulf when in a nor therly point blows generally with great and lasting vi olence and now drove him from his course and blew him out into the open sea where he stood again the rebuff of another violent storm but at length reached Tarentum He there laid his vessels on ground which had been damaged in the foul weather and resitted them for service When Nicias found that he was in his passage he be trayed an open contempt of so trifling a squadron as the Thurians had already done before him It appear ed to him that so petty a squadron could only be fitted out for piratical cruizes and therefore he sent out no detachments to hinder his approach About the fame time of this summer the Laced√ mo nians with their own domestic forces augmented by the junction of their allies made an irruption into Argos and ravaged great part of that territory The Athenians put out to lea with thirty fail to succour the Argives which procedure was beyond all denial the clearest Violation of the treaties between them and the Laced√ monians B VI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 193 monians Hitherto they had only exercised robberies upon them from Pylus and making descents rather on any other coast of Peloponnesus than Laconia itself had left it to the Argives and Mantineans to make war against them Nay though the Argives had frequent ly pressed them that with an armed force they would barely land on the Laconic coast afnd after committing never so small ravage in their company immediately to retire they had positively refused But now under the command of Pythodorus and L√ fpodias and De maratus they made a descent at Epidaurus Limera and Prasia committed large devastation on the adjacent country and afforded the Laced√ monians a most spe cious and justisiable pretext to act offensively against A thens When the Athenian fleet was sailed homewards from Argos and the Laced√ monians also were withdrawn the Argives broke into Phliasia where they laid waste part of the Laced√ monian territory and made some slaughter of the people and then returned to Argos Vol II O THE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR BOOK VII JYLIPPUS and Pythen when they had refitted their ships stood along the coast from Tarentum to Locri Epizephyrii Here they received more certain information that Syracuse was not yet completely in vested and that a succour of force might be thrown into the town by the way of Epipol√ They went next to consultation ‚ whether keeping Sicily on the  right they should endeavour at all hazards to enter  Syracuse by sea or with Sicily on their left should  steer first to Himera from whence attended by the forces of that State and whatever additional strength they could persuade to join them they should march thither over land It was determined to go first to Himera especially as the four Athenian vessels were not yet arrived at Rhegium which Nicias at last upon the certain intelligence that they were now at Locri had detached to observe them To be before hand therefore with this detachment they pass through the straits and having touched only at Rhe gium and Messene arrive at Himera whilst in the latter place they prevailed upon the Himereans to con cur with them in the war and not only to entrust their troops under their command but even to supply with arms such of the mariners as had navigated the vessels and were therefore unprovided for their shipping they had drawn ashore and laid up at Himera The Selinuntians ‚ B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 195 Selinuntians also by a messenger dispatched on pur pose they had summoned to meet them with all their united strength at a determined place upon their route The Geloans also and some of the Siculi promised to attend with a party though by no means considerable The latter of these were disposed better than ever to the service since Archonides was lately dead who reign ing over some of the Siculi seated in these parts and  having a great influence over them had declared for the Athenians and since Gylippus appeared to them to be sent from Laced√ mon with a full purpose to do them service And now Gylippus ‚ having assembled an army which consisted ot about seven hundred of those who navigated or came on board his vessels and for whom he had provided arms of heavy armed and light armed Himereans amounting together to a thousand men and one hundred horsemen of some light armed Selinun tians i a small party of Geloan horse and a body of Siculi in all a thousand ‚ began his march for Syra cuse The Corinthians in the mean time were sending out the other ships as fast as they could equip them for the service to follow with all possible expedition from Leu cas and Gongyplus one of the Corinthian command ers who with a single ship set out last from Leucas is the first who arrives at Syracuse and that but a small space of time before the approach of Gylippus Find ing therefore upon his arrival that the Syracusans were going forthwith to hold a public assembly in which the terms of putting an end to the war were de signed to be adjusted he dissuaded them from so pre cipitate a step and animated their drooping resolutions by strong assurances that  other ships would instantly  arrive‚ and that  Gylippus the son of Cleandridas was sent thither by the Laced√ monians to take upon him the command The Syracusans accordingly resumed their lpirits and immediately marched out O 2 of 196 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII of the town with the whole of their strength in order to meet Gylippus for by this time they had received intelligence that he was actually approaching Gylippus upon his route had made himself master of Iegas a fortress belonging to the Siculi and now at the head of his army drawn up in order of battle he comes up to Epipolse Having mounted by the pass of Euryalus as the Athenians had done on their first approach he marched in Conjunction with the Syra cusans toward the Athenian circumvallation He happened to arrive in that critical juncture when the Athenians had completely finished  seven or eight stadia of the double wall extending to the great harbour j when in consequence but a very small part remained incomplete and on which they were labouring with their highest application On the other side of their cir cle towards Trogilus the stones for completing their work had been laid ready in heaps almost down to the beach and some parts of their work on that side stood but half completed though others had received the fi  nishing hand To such extremity of danger were the Syracusans now reduced Gylippus and the Syracusans coming thus suddenly upon them the Athenians at first were struck with con sternation but formed however in order of battle to give them a reception But Gylippus having ordered his forces to halt dispatcheth a herald to the Athe nians proclaiming that  in case they would evacu  ate Sicily within the space of five days with their arms and baggage he would readily grant them a truce Such offers they received in a contemptuous manner jf and disdaining to return an answer4 ordered  About J of a mile Nicias fays Plalareb disdained to return an answer But seme of hit soldiers laughed outright and asked If at the arrival of a mantle and stasf from Sparta the Syracusans were become so full of spirits as to despise the Athenians who ‚ had lately given up to the Laced√ monians three hundred of their countrymen who had been their prisoners all of them better soldiers and who combed their hair too much hetter than Gylippus B VIT THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 197 the herald to move off And now both sides were busy in marshalling and disposing their men for battle But Gylippus who had made an observation that the Syracusans were in great confusion and could not easily be formed into proper order made his army fall back into more open ground Nicias gave them no disturbance whilst they were making this motion but without advancing stood close under his works and when Gylippus found that the enemy would not move forwards to attack him he made his forces wheel off to the high ground called Temenites where they reposed themlelves for the night The next morning he drew up the greatest part of his army before the works of the Athenians to prevent their sending out succours to more distant posts for he had detached a party to attack the fort of Labdalum which he carried by storm and put all the garrison found within it to the sword Labdalum was so situ ated in regard to the Athenian posts that they could have no view of what was transacting there The same day also an Athenian trireme as it was entering the harbour is taken by the Syracusans After so much success the Syracusans and allies set about raising a counterwork along Epipol√ Begin ning at the city they carried it upwards towards the single wall which had an oblique inclination and in tended that in cafe the Athenians could not stop its completion it mould entirely exclude them from per fecting their circumvallation The Athenians having perfected their works to the sea had now remounted the eminence and as some parts of their work were but weak Gylippus drew out his army by night and was marching to demolish those but the Athmians ‚ who passed the night without their worus were no sooner aware of it ihan they also marched away to de fend them Upon which Gylippus finding them a larmtd desisted and made his army retreat to their former posts This however occasioned the Atheni O 3 ans i98 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII ans to raise those pans of their wall to a greater height and to take the guard of it upon themselvts as amongst the body of their confederates they had divided the guard of the rest of their works allotting a proper charge to each Nicias also judged it expedient to fortify the spot cal led Plemmyrium Plemmyrium is a point of land over against Syracuse which jutting out before the great harbour renders the mouth of it very narrow If this were fortified he thought  the importa  tion of necessaries for the army would be better se  cured because then from a smaller distance they  could at any time command the harbour where the Syracusan shipping lay and should it be their ill‚ fortune to be straitened by sea might easier fetch in supplies than in the present station of their fleet at M the bottom of the great harbour Now also he be gan with greater attention than before to study how to distress them by sea convinced since the arrival of Gylippus how little room he had to hope for success by land To this spot therefore he ordered his fleet and drew his land forces down and immediately erected three forts In these the greatest part of the baggage was laid up and the transports and tight ships were immediately stationed there To this project however the havock that afterwards ensued amongst the seamen is principally to be ascribed for as they suffered in this station under scarcity of water and the mariners were frequently obliged to fetch both water and wood from a distance since near at hand they were not to be had the Syraculan horse who were masters of the country slaughtered them in abundance The Syra cusans had posted a third part of their cavalry at their fcrtreis of Olyrrpi√ um to bridle the marauding ex cursions of the enemy at Plemmyrium Now also Nicias received intelligence that the other Corinthian ships were in their passage To watch their approach he therefore detached twenty sail who were appointed B VIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 199 appointed to cruize about Locri and Rhegium and the capes of Sicily in order to intercept them Gylippus in the mean time was employed in building the counter wall along EpipoJ√ making uie of the stones which the Athenians had laid ready in heaps for the continuation of their own work It was also his daily custom to draw up the Syracusans and allies in order of battle and lead them out beyond the point of the counter wall which obliged the Athenians to draw up likewise to observe their motions And when Gylippus judged he could attack them with advantage he instantly advanced and the charge being given and received a battle ensued in the space between their respective works but so narrow that no use could be made of the Syracusan and confederate horse The Sy racusans and allies were accordingly defeated They fetched off their slain by truce i and the Athenians e rected a trophy But Gylippus having assembled ihe army round him thought proper to make this declara tion in the presence of them all ‚ That  the deseat was not to be charged on their want of bravery but  on his own indiscretion he had deprived them of  the service of their own cavalry and darters by ranging his battle in too confined a spot between the  works that he would now again lead them out in a  more judicious manner He exhorted them there fore to imprint it strong on their remembrance  that as in real strength they were not interior it would be intolerably disgraceful if they who to a man were Peloponnesians and Dorians should not manifest themselves so resolutely brave as to con  quer and drive out of their country a parcel of Ioni  ans and islanders and a promiscuous rabble of hun gry adventurers Having addressed them thus he lay on the watch to seize a proper opportunity and as soon as he had gained it led them on again to the charge O 4 It 200 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII It was the opinion of Nicias and in general of all the Athenians that  though it was not their own in  terest to bring on an engagement yet it highly con cerned them to put a stop to the counterwork which the enemy was raising to hinder their progress For by this time the wall of the Syracusans had only not over reached the extreme point to which the Athenians had brought their circumvallation  And should it  be extended farther it would give the enemy this dou  blc advantage ‚ a certainty of conquest whenever they  thought proper to fight and a discretionary power not to fight at all Determined by these considera tions they drew out in order to give the Syracusans battle Gylippus soon began the engagement He had now drawn up his heavy armed without the works and at a greater distance from them than before He had post ed the cavalry and the darters on a wide and open spot yet unoccupied by the works on either side and posted them so that they flanked the Athenians In the ardour of the engagement the cavalry broke in upon the left wing of the Athenians which was ranged against them and intirely routed them In consequence of which the remainder of the army was soon deseated by the Syra cusans and in the greatest disorder retired for shelter behind their works And night no sooner came on than the Syracusans without loss of time began to car ry forwards their cwn works which they soon extended beyond the Athenian circumvallation by which they gained this great point that they could no longer be invested on all sides by the Athenians and the latter though masters in the field were henceforwaids effectu ally stopped srom perfecting their circumvallation After this twelve hips of the Corinthians and Am bracicts and Leucadians the remainder of the squa dron designed for this service having given the Athe nian guaru ships the slip came into the harbour of Sy racuse They were commanded by Herasinides a Co rinthian B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR aor rinthian By these the Syracusans were now assisted in carrying on their work till it was completely joined to the traverse wall Gylippus now made a circuit over Sicily in order to promote the common cause and to procure additional forces tor the services both of land and sea and to soli cit the concurrence ot such States as hitherto had mani fested either no great inclination or an open repug nance to join in the present war Other embassadors also were dispatched by the Syracusans and Corinthians to Laced√ mon and Corinth instructed to solicit a spee dy reinforcement to be transported into Sicily either in trading vessels or in boats or by any other expeditious methods since the Athenians had also sent for reinforce ments from Athens The Syracusans also assigned com plements of men to their shipping and sedulously train ed them to the service of the sea as designing on this e lement also to try their fortune nay they laboured with alacrity and application to increaie their strength in all respects Nicias being sensible of this and conscious that the strength of the enemy and his own inability became daily greater dispatched his messengers also to Athens a custom he had ever observed and upon all occasions to report the particulars of his proceedings But in his present situation it was more requisite than ever since now he was convinced that he was environed with dan gers and unless with the utmost expedition they ei called their troops or sent them another and that a strong reinforcement no hopes of preservation remain ed Apprehensive farther that the persons he should fend either through want of proper address or through defect of courage or a passion to soothe the populace might suppress the truth he sent a true account os things in a letter wrote with his own hand By this method he concluded that his own sentiments of things could not be concealed or invalidated by messengers that the Athenians would be informed of the truth and might accordingly 20a THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VH accordingly adjust their resolutions These messrn ers therefore departed instructed to deliver the letter which he intrusted to their care and what farther they were to add by word of mouth Nicias in the mean time kept within the limits of his camp more anxious to guard his shattered forces from annoyance than to plunge into fresh and spontaneous dangers In the close of this summer Euetion an Athenian general marched in conjunction with Perdiccas and a large body of Thracians against Amphipolis yet could not render himself master of that city But then set ting out from Imereum he brought his triremes about into the Strymon and blocked it up on the side of the river And here this summer ended In the beginning ot winter the messengers fiom Ni cias arrived at Athens where they gave such accounts of things as he had charged them to give and resolved such questions as were asked them They also deli vered his letter which the clerk of the State stood up and read aloud to the Athenians The contents were these r Athenians THE many letters from time to time received from me have given you all proper information so  far as relates to past transactions  and it is now high  time you should be made acquainted with our pre  sent situation that your councils may be adjusted in  a proper manner After therefore we had defeated in several en  gagements the Syracusans against whom you sent us out and when we had thrown up those works be  fore their city within which we are this moment ly  ing Gylippus the Laced√ monian came upon us at t the head ot an army brought from Peloponnesus and augmented by the troops of some Sicilian States In the first battle he is routed by us but in the last pressed hard by their numerous cavalry and l darters B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 203  darters we have been forced to retire wirhin our in  trenchments Being therefore obliged by the su perior numbers of the enemy to discontinue our  circumvallation we are this moment lying upon the defensive Nor indeed are we able to draw out our whole force for action as detachments of our heavy  armed are remotely employed in the guard of our works They have farther run up a single wall to cut our lines so that there remains no longer a pos sibility for us to complete the circumvallation un less reinforced by a numerous body of troops we  are enabled to assault and demolish the counter  work And in consequence of this we who de signed to besiege others may with much more pro  priety be said to suffer a siege ourselves at least by land for we dare not make any distant excursions  into the adjacent country for fear of the horse What is more they have sent embassadors to Pe  loponnesus to solicit reinforcements Gy ippus also is making the tour of the Sicilian States with a view to obtain the concurrence of such as are at present  neutral and to prevail with the rest to intrust their  additional levies for the service both of land and sea under his command and according to my present intelligence they are fully bent to attack at one and  the same time our intrenchments with their land  forces by land and with their ships by sea And  though I say by Sea let not the iound be too ter  rible in your ears for they know very well the pre sent state of our navy which though at first a most complete equipment for the cleanness of the ships and the health and vigour of the seamen yet at pre sent hath scarce a ship which is not leaky  so long  have they been necessitated to keep the sea whilst  their hands have daily been mouldering away for  in fact we have no opportunity to lay them dry and careen them as we are under continual apprehen ¬ sions of being attacked by the ships of the enemy  equal jo4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII equal nay superior in number to our own That they will attempt it we have most certain ground to  believe but the seasons of doing it are intirely in  their own option which also enables them to preserve  their vessels ever fit for service as they are not neces  sitated to be continually in action to strike awe into others Nay we should hardly be able to do the  like though the number of our stripping were much  larger than it is or though we were exempted from  the necessity we now lie under of keeping guard with  them all For in case we make the least abatement  of our vigilance We should be distressed for want of necessaries which even now we setch in with diffi  culty in the very teeth of the enemy To this must   be ascribed the great waste of our seamen which hath already been made and whose number lessens from  day to day since obliged to fetch wood and water  and forage from remote places they are intercepted by the enemy s horse Even our servants who have nothing to dread from our ruinated condition desert  us daily And such foreigners as were forced on board our fleet depait with impunity to their own  cities whilst others who were allured to the service  by the greatntss of our pay and imagined they were  rather come to plunder than to fight when contrary to their hopes they behold the ei emy possessed of a  numerous fleet and making a brave resistance in e  very quarter some catch at the least pretext to goo  ver to the enemy and others make shift to skulk a  way ‚ never again to be retrieved in ib wide a coun  try as Sicily Nay some of those who having at  tended us hither from Athens and since prevailed  with the captains of triremes to accept of the service of Hyccarian slaves in redemption of their own have by this means iubverted our naval discipline  I am writing to men well mlightened in naval as sairs and perfectly convinced trtat the flower of an e  quipment is but of short duration and how few of those on boand B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR aoj  on board arc skilled at steering the vessel or mana ging the oar But what gives me most acute vexa tion is this ‚ ‚ that though commander in chief I am utterly unable to put a stop to these disorders  since your tempers Athenians are hard to be mana  ged and am quite at a loss from whence to repair  the waste that hath been made of our seamen The enemy have abundant resources every where at hand whereas necessity points out only one to us ‚ ‚ ‚ that  place from whence we had who now remain and ‚ who are for ever lost For Naxus and Catana the cities which still persevere in our alliance are unable to recruit us And should the enemy get one cir cumltance more in their favour that the towns of Italy which at present supply us with food de terred by the discovery of our low condition and the non appearance of a reinforcement from Athens go over to the Syracusans the war will be finished  to their hands without costing them a blow and we shall be left to the mercy of the enemy 1 could have sent you much more pleasing accounts  of things but none so proper to give you a clear idea of the posture of your affairs here and such as you ought to have before you proceed to deliberate upon them and at the same time ‚ as I am by no means a  stranger to Athenian tempers since I know you to be fond of hearing what will give you pleasure but  are afterwards inflamed with anger if any article in e  vent drops short of your expectation ‚ I thought it  highly concerned my own safety to tell you nothing  but the truth And let me here conjure you to cn tertain no resentment either against private soldiers or  commanders since in labouring thole points which are the principal ends of the expedition they have fully done their duty  But since all Sicily is in arms against us and since  our enemies expect a reintorcemeut from Peloponne  sus resolve without loss of time that as your forces arc ao6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII  are not sufficient to keep the enemy in play they  must either be recalled or be reinforced with a body not inferior to the first equipment with both a land  and a naval force and a large pecuniary supply For myself I must insist that a successor be sent me since I am quite disabled by a nephritic disorder from continuing in the command And I think I  have just title to expect my dismission from you since in the vigour of my life I have been intrusted by you with several commands in which I did you some signal services Whatever you determine put it in execution on  the first approach of spring and above all things  keep clear of delays for the ready supplies given the enemy in Sicily will soon enable them to act and those expected from Peloponnesus though they must be longer in coming up yet depend upon it  that unless you exert your utmost vigilance some  of them will steal hither as before through all your  guards and some will infallibly be here before you Such were the advices brought them by the letter of Nicias The Athenians however when they had heard it read would not so far comply with the request of Nicias as to give him his dismission but that af flicted as he was in body the whole burden of affairs might not lie too heavily upon him they appointed two persons already in Sicily Menander and Euthyde mus to assist him in the command till those who by the public vote should be joined with him in the com mission can arrive They also decreed him a rein forcement consisting both of a land and naval force to be levied amongst the Athenians upon the roll and their dependents and for colleagues to share in the command Demosthenes the son of Alcistenes and Eu rymedon the son of Thucles Eurymedon by order began his passage for Sicily about the winter solstice at the head of ten fail of ships and with a supply of twenty B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 207 ‚ twenty talents of silver impowered farther to as sure them that a large reinforcement will soon come up as the State had seriously interested itself in their welsare Demosthenes stayed behind to forward the equipment and was intended to set out on the first approach of spring He was busied in assembling to gether their contingents from the dependent States and in levying amongst them both money and shipping and soldiers The Athenians farther send out twenty fail to cruize on the coasts os Peloponnesus and to take care that no one passed over from Corinth and Peloponnesus into Si cily For the Corinthians upon the arrival of the em bassadors and the advice they brought that the face of affairs was much altered for the better priding themselves in the reflexion that their former equipment had arrived in time to contribute to this turn became now more alert than ever and got transports in readi ness to carry over a body of their own heavy armed into Sicily whilst the Laced√ monians were intent on doing the fame from other parts of Peloponnesus The Co rinthians sarther manned out five and twenty fail de signing to hazard an engagement with the guard ships stationed at Naupactus or to disable the Athenians who lay there from giving their transports the least molesta tion by keeping their own triremes ready ranged in or der of battle in the very face of that squadron  The Laced√ monians also were preparing for an inva sion of Attica in pursuance of a former resolution and in compliance farther with the pressing instances of both Syraculans and Corinthians They had no sooner heard ot the reinforcement intended to be sent by the Athe nians to Sicily than by making a diversion they de signed to stop its execution Alcibiades also continued warmly importuning them to execute his plan of forti fying Decelea and to proceed briskly with the war  3875 Stirling But io8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII But the motives which at this present juncture anima ted the Laced√ monians most were that the Atheni ans if engaged in a double war both against themselves and against the Sicilians must become a much more expeditious conquest and farther the Athenians were the first aggressors in violating treaties In the former war they were well convinced the first offence was chargeable on their own heads because the Thebans had surprised Plat√ a whilst treaties were in fact subsist ing Nay contrary to an express stipulation in a pre ceding treaty that  arms should never be taken up  against the party which was willing to abide by a ju  dicial determination they themselves had refused to submit to a trial though claimed by the Athenians To a conduct so ungenerous they concluded that their ill success in the war ought fairly to be imputed and reflected with self accusations not only on the cala mity they had suffered at Pylus but On all their other losses in every quarter of the war But now since the Athenians with an equipment of thirty fail had com mitted devastations at Epidaurus at Prasi√ and at other places and continued to infest their dominions by robberies from Pylus nay as often as disputes had intervened about the intent of articles in the last treaty in which the Laced√ monians appealed to a judicial de termination the others had haughtily refused it j ‚ con cluding hence that the Athenians were become as guilty aggressors now as themselves had been on the former occasion with cheerful presages of success they determined for war In order to it they demanded this winter from their allies their contingents of iron and got all the needful materials in readiness to execute their plan of fortification Resolved at the same time to transport an aid to Sicily in vessels of burden they began to levy it at home and exacted the quotas of augmentation from their consederates And thus the winter ended and the eighteenth year of this war of which B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 209 which Thucydides hath compiled the history came also to an end YEAR XIX J THE following spring no sooner approached than at an earlier date than on any former occasion the La ced√ monians and allies invaded Attica and Agis the son of Archidamus king of the Laced√ monians had the command of the army At first they ravaged the country particularly the plains and this being done having allotted out the work in portions to the several States they set out about fortifying Decelea Now Decelea is distant at most but one hundred and twenty stadia from the city of Athens and lies at the fame dis tance or very little more from B≈ otia but in the plain and on the finest spot of ground from whence effectually to annoy them was their fortress raised and might be seen from the very walls of Athens In this manner the Peloponnesians and allies erected a fortress within Attica itself whilst in the same por tion of time their friends in Peloponnesus embarked a body of heavy armed on board their transports and sent them off for Sicily For this service the Laced√ monians picked out from the very best of the Helots and of those citizens of Sparta who were newly enfran chised from both together six hundred heavy armed and appointed Heccritus a Spartan to command them And the B≈ otians sent three hundred heavy armed commanded by Xeno and Nicon of Thebes and He gesander of Thespi√ These were first embarked at X√ narus in Laconia and thence put out to sea Soon after these the Corinthians sent away five hun dred heavy armed some from Corinth itlelf others hired from the Arcadians and appointed Alexarchus J Before Chiist 413  About twelve milei Vol II P a Corinthian 2io THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII a Corinthian to command them The Sicyonians also sent two hundred heavy armed along with the Corin thians and at their head Sargeus a Sicyonian But the five and twenty sail of Corinthians which launched out to sea in the depth of winter lay ranged in an opposite station to the twenty Attic at Naupactus to give leisure for the embarkation of the heavy armed on board the transports from Peloponnesus On this account principally they were manned and fitted out to lea that they might divert the attention of the A thenians from the transport fleet that was now putting out and fasten it wholly upon the hostile appearance of these triremes In the mean time the Athenians even during th¬ fortifications in hand at Decelea and at the earliest ap proach of spring sent out thirty sail to cruize on the coasts of Peloponnesus under the command of Cha ricles the son of Apollodorus His instructions were farther to touch at Argos and to summon them in conformity to the treaty of alliance to embark a body of heavy armed on board the fleet  Demosthenes also according to promise they sent away for Sicily with a numerous fleet consisting of sixty ships of Athens and five of Chios on board of which were twelve hundred enrolled Athenians and as large a number of islanders as with the utmost industry they had been able to draw together They had also amassed from their other confederates subject to A thens all manner of supplies they were able to furnish for carrying on the war with vigour But Demosthenes was farther instructed to sail at first in company with Charicles and assist him in the cruize on the coasts of Laconia Demosthenes therefore having stood over to √ gina continued there till the remainder of his force which was yet behind had completely joined him and Charicles had taken on board the Argive auxiliaries About the fame time in this spring Gylippus also re turned to Syracuse at the head of as large a force as he 8 VII THE PELGPONNESIAN WAR 211 he had been able to collect from the several States with whom his persuasions had been effectual and ha ving convened the Syracusans he told them that ‚ they ought to man out as large a number of ship ping as they possibly could and try their fortune in  a naval engagement such a step he had reason to  hope might be attended with consequences which would amply compensate the danger and invigorate the war These instances of Gylippus were well seconded by Hermocrates who took uncommon pains to encourage his countrymen to attack the Athenians by sea ‚ ‚  The latter he told them were far from enjoying their naval skill as an hereditary right or a privi lege from time immemorial exclusively their own In fact they were by nature land men much more than the Syracusans and necessity alone in the Me dish invasion had forced them to try their fortune at sea By enterprising men as the Athenians were  such as were most daring in opposing them must ¬ needs be regarded as the most formidable enemies  True ‚ they had been used to intimidate their neigh  bours not by a real superiority of strength but by  their daring enterprising genius and now by the fame methods themselves might become formidable even to Athenians He assured them  for his own parr he was perfectly convinced that the Syra cusans if by an effort of bold resolution they would  on a sudden attack the Athenian fleet might reap ‚ more benesit from the terror which such a step would M strike upon the foe than could accrue to the Athe nians from their superior skill when compared with Syracusan inexperience He pressed them there fore  to try their fortune by sea and to bid adieu to fear Thus animated by Gylippuy and by Hermocrates and by others the Syracusans were eagerly bent on ac tion by ica and manned out their fleet And when P 2 the ai2 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII the whole was ready for service Gylippus by favour of the night at the head of his land army marched down to the forts at Plemmyrium intending to assault them on the land side The triremes of the Syracu sans at the fame instant of time as had been concerted beforehand to the number of thirty five are sailing up out of the great harbour whilst forty five were going about out of the lesser harbour where their dock lay The latter went round designing to complete their junction with the other squadron and then in a body to stand against Plemmyrium that the Athenians on both fides might be thrown into confusion The Athenians lost no time but instantly manned out sixty vessels With twenty five of the number they engaged the thirty five Syracusan in the great harbour with the rest they went to meet the other squadron that was coming a bout from the dock A smart engagement immedi ately ensued in the mouth os the great harbour The dispute was a long time obstinately maintained one side exerting themselves to clear the passage but the other to obstruct it In the the mean time Gylippus ‚ as the Athenians posted at Plemmyrium had flocked down to the sea side and with their utmost attention were looking at the bat tle on the water ‚ Gylippus seizeth the opportunity and no sooner had the morning dawned than to the great surprise of the enemy he attacks the forts He first makes himself master of the largest of the three and afterwards carries the two lesser the desendants of which seeing the largest so easily taken had aban doned their posts Nay on the surprisal of the first those who had manned it throwing themselves on board the boats and a transport that lay at hand found no small disficulty in getting away to the camp for as the Syracusans had now the better of the engagement with their squadron in the great harbour they detached one of their nimblest triremes to pursue the fliers But at the time the other two forts were carried the Syra cusans B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 213 cusans were plainly vanquished which gave them who abandoned the last an opportunity to sail away without obstruction For that Syracusan squadron that was engaged before the harbour s mouth having forced their way through the Athenian fleet by sailing for wards in a disorderly manner and continually running foul one upon another gave the Athenians an opportu nity to regain the day For this squadron they soon routed and afterwards that within the harbour by which they had been vanquished They also sunk ele ven ships of the enemy and made a slaughter of all their crews those of three ships excepted to whom they granted quarter and all this with the lose only of three ships on their own side Having afterwards drawn a shore the shatters of the Syracusan fleet and piled them into a trophy on the little isle before Plemmyrium they retired to their main incampment Thus unsuccessful were the Syracusans in their naval engagement They had carried however the forts at Plemmyrium and to signalize each of their acquisi tions they erected three several trophies One also of the two forts that were taken last they levelled with the ground but the other two they repaired and garri soned In this furprisal of the forts many were slain and ma ny were made prisoners and a great stock of wealth reposited there became the prize of the enemy For as the Athenians had made use of these forts by way of magazine much wealth belonging to merchants and corn in abundance were found within much also of the stores belonging to the captains of the ships of war inasmuch as forty masts for triremes and other materials of resitment had been laid up there and three triremes were hauled ashore to be careened Nay this furprisal of Plemmyrium wasoneof thechief if not the greatest source of all the distress which the Athenian army suffered in the sequel for no longer was the sea open to them for the secure importation of necessary supplies P 3 From THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII From this time the Syracusans rushed upon them from thence and awed all their motions The convoys could no more get in without fighting their way Besides that in all other respects it struck a great consternation and even a dejection of mind amongst the troops The next step taken by the Syracusans was to send out to sea a squadron of twelve ships under the com mand of Agatharcus a Syracusan One of these ships was to proceed to Peloponnesus and land an embassy there which had instructions  to notify a present hopeful posture of affairs and to press the prosecu t M tion of the war in Greece with all possible vigour The other eleven stood over to the Italian coast having received intelligence that a number of small vessels laden with stores for the Athenians were coming up They intercepted and intirely destroyed most of these i and the timber on board them which was ready wrought for the Athenians to frame together into ships they burnt to ashes on the shore of Caulonia This done they stood away for Locri and whilst they lay in that road one of the transports from Peloponnesus having on board the heavy armed from Thespi√ came in The Syracusans removed those heavy armed into their own ships and returned with them to Syracuse  The Athenians with twenty fail were stationed at Megara in order to intercept their return where one ship alone with all the crew fell into their hands They were not able to come up with the rest since e luding all pursuit they recover with security their own harbours There happened also a skirmish in the harbour of Sy racuse about the piles which the Syraculans had drove down in the sea before their old docks that their vessels might ride in sasety behind them the Athenians be un able to stand in amongst them and do any damage to fheir shipping Close up to those piles the Athenians had towed a raft of prodigious size on which turrets and parapets to cover the defendants were erected   whilst B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 215 whilst others in long boats were fastening cables round the piles and by the help of a machine convenient for the purpose craning them up and such as they broke a set of divers sawed off close at the bottom The Sy racusans in the mean time were pouring their missive weapons upon them from the docks which were plenti fully returned by those posted on the raft In short the Athenians plucked up most of the piles but one part of the staccade was exceeding difficult to be demo lished as it lay out of fight for they had driven down some of the piles in such a manner that their heads e merged not above the surface of the water This ren dered all access exceeding dangerous since ignorant where they lay a pilot would be apt to bulge his vessel as it were upon a shelve But even these the divers for a pecuniary reward searched out and sawed away And yet as fast as this was done the Syracusans drove down a fresh set of piles The contrivances both of annoy ance and prevention were strenuously exerted on both fides as might justly be expected from two hostile bo dies posted so near one another the skirmishings were often renewed and every artifice of war was successively practised The Syracusans farther had dispatched embassies composed of Corinthians and Laced√ monians and Ambraciots to the cities of Sicily  to notify the sur  prisal of Plemmyrium and to give a just representa  tion of the naval engagement in which they had been defeated not so much by the strength of the enemy as by their own confusion in other respects to assure  them that their hopes of success were high and that they firmly depended on receiving soon an aid from them composed both of a land and naval force since the Athenians were also in expectation of a reinforce  ment from Athens the approach of which would their  friends anticipate the Athenians at present there must  be totally destroyed and the war brought at once to P 4 af¬ 416 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII  an end Such schemes were now in agitation in Si cily But Demosthenes when he had assembled the whole of the armament with which he was to pass over to the relief of those in Sicily weighing from √ gina and standing over to Peloponnesus he completes his junction with Charicles and the squadron of thirty sail of Athe nians under his command and as a body of heavy armed had been taken on board the latter from Argos they steered together for the coast of Laconia And here first they ravaged in part Epidaurus Limera and proceeding from thence to that part of Laconia which lies over against Cythera and where stands the temple of Apollo having ravaged part of the adjacent country they inclosed and fortified a neck of land which might serve as a receptacle to such of the Helots as deserted the Laced√ monians from thence banditti like as was done from Pylus to infest the country This convenient spot was no sooner taken in than Demosthenes stood a way for Corcyra that he might take on board the auxi liaries there and make the best of his way to Sicily But Charicles stayed till he had put the place into a state of secure defence and sixed a garrison in it This being done he carried back his squadron of thirty sail to Athens and the Argives at the same time received their dismifiion ‚ This summer there arrived at Athens thirteen hundred Thracian targeteers of those called Mach√ ropbori and who are originally Dians This body was intended to have been sent wit h Demosthenes into Sicily but as they arrived not till after his departure the Athenians had resolved to send them back again to their own homes in Thrace To retain them merely for the sake of the war waged against them from Decelea they thought would plunge them in too large an expence since the pay of every soldier was  a drachma a day For now since Decelea which had been B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 217 been fortified this spring by thejoint labours of the whole united army continued to be garrisoned by detachments from the several States which at certain intervals of time relieved one another in a regular succession it gave ter rible annoyance to the Athenians and caused amongst them such havoc of their effects and such a destruction of their men as threw them into great distress All preceding incursions of the enemy having been only transient had left them in the peaceable enjoyment of their lands for the rest of the year but now as they awed the country by one continued blockade and as by intervals they received considerable augmentations to e nable them to give greater annoyance as even the regu lar garrison was periodically obliged to scour the country and plunder for their own subsistence and as Agis king of the Laced√ monians who with the utmost diligence prosecuted the war in person directed all the operations ‚ the Athenians were sorely pressed For they were de barred the whole produce of their own lands more than twenty thousand of their slaves had deserted to the ene my and a large part of these were mechanics of the city their whole stock of ssieep and labouring cattle was lost beyond retrieve their horses ‚ as the horsemen were obliged every day to mount either to ride towards De celea to awe the excursions of that garrison or to guard some important posts in the country ‚ their horses were either lamed by running incessantly over hard or rugged ground or by wounds were disabled for service the constant supplies of provisions for the city which used to be fetched from Eub≈ a to Oropus and to be brought in from thence through Decelea as the shortest passage were now forced to go round the cape of Sunium by lea which considerably enchanced their price For want also of all foreign commodities the city was equal ly distressed and Athens was now reduced to be merely a place ofarms To keep guard on the battlements by day the citizens were obliged successively to relieve one another but the whole body of the city except ¬ i8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIL the horsemen mounted guard by night The latter e ver under arms without the rest on the constant guard of the city walls and this for a summer and winter without any intermission were reduced to a very low condition But the point which pressed hardest upon them was having two wars at once upon their hands and yet their obstinacy had rose to so high a pitch as had it not been visible to all the world the bare men tion of its possibility would hare been quite incredible For who would have believed that this people fo closely blocked up at home by the Peloponnesians should scorn to give up Sicily nay should persevere with unabating zeal to carry on the siege of Syracuse a city in no respect inserior even to Athens itself that they should exhibit such an astonishing proof of their strength and their courage to the eyes of Greece where upon the first breaking out of the war some people had imagined that in case the Peloponnefians invaded Atti ca they could not hold out above one year intire though others had allowed them two and others three but nobody a longer space and that in the seventeenth year after the first invasion of this kind they should at tempt the conquest of Sicily and when deeply gashed in every parr by one war already upon their hands should wilfully plunge into another as formidable in all respects as that waged against them from Peloponne sus But now when besides what they had suffered already they were terribly annoyed from Decelea and other incidents had exacted from them very large dis bursements their finances were reduced to a very low ebb At this period therefore instead of the tribute paid them by their dependents they exacted a twentieth of the value of all commodities imported and exported which they thought would replenish their cofsers faster than the former method For their disbursements were not as they had been in preceding times but had been inflamed in the fame proportion as the scenes of war had been B V1I THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR tlf been inlarged whilst their annual revenue was constant ly decreasing Unwilling therefore in the present ebb of their trea sures to defray the charge of this body of Thracians who came too late for Demosthenes they sent them back to their own country with all possible haste Dii trephes was the person pitched upon to conduct them home and was instructed that  in the passage for  they were to go through theEuripus he should em ploy them if opportunity offered against the ene  my He landed therefore near Tanagra and in a hurrying manner carried off a booty from thence A bout the shut of evening he also crossed the Euripus from Chalcis of Eub≈ a and having landed his Thra cians in B≈ otia led them against Mycalessus His de sign was not discovered that night though he halted at the temple of Mercury which is distant from Mycales sus but  sixteen stadia at most But early the next morning he assaulted this city which is of large extent He carries it on the first attack as there was no guard to resist him and the inhabitants could never have ima gined that a maritime body would have marched so far into the country to make attempts upon them The wall besides was weak in some places it was fallen and the remaining part of it was low and the gates from too great a considence of security had been left o pen No sooner were the Thracians broke into Myca lessus than they gutted both houses and temples they massacred the inhabitants shewing no regard to either old age or youth but venting their fury on all that came in their way they butchered even the women and the children nay all the labouring cattle and every creature that had life which came before their eyes For the Thracians when once their fury is inflamed are as insatiable of blood as any other the greatest savages in the barbarian world On this occasion the confusion was terrible and every ghastly method of destruction ‚ More thin a mile and a halt 20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII was exemplified in act They even sell upon the public school which was a very large one when the youth of the town were but just got in and hacked all the children to pieces And thus this whole city was invol ved in a calamity a greater than which no city had ever felt nay a calamity unexpected and dreadful indeed The Thebans had no fooner intelligence of it than they marched to their assistance but came not up with the Thracians till they were retired to some distance from the town where they recovered from them their booty and having put them to flight continue the chace down to the Euripus and the sea where the vessels which had brought them lay at anchor Here they make a staughter of most of those who endeavoured to get on board but could not swim since the persons left in the vessels when they law what passed on the shore put them off beyond their reach But in the otherparts of the retreat the Thracians behaved with some gal lantry against the Theban horse which attacked them first since sallying frequently out on the pursuers and rallying again after the discipline of their country they made good their retreat and thus few of this body were destroyed A number farther who staid behind in the city to plunder were found there and put to the sword The whole number of the slain amongst this body of thirteen hundred Thracians amounted to two hundred and fifty men though in return they killed of Thebans and others who accompanied by way of aid of horse and heavy armed together about twenty and Skirphondas of Thebes one of the rulers of B≈ otia the lives of some more Mycalessians were also lost in their company Such was the calamity which fell to the unhappy lot of Mycalesius and which for excess of horror is more to be deplored than any other of the tragical events of this war Demosthenes who after marking out the fortifica tion had stood away from Laconia to Corcyra sur prising a transport vessel which rode at anchor in the   road B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 221 road of Phia of the Eleans on board of whicsra num ber of heavy armed Corinthians were to pass over into Sicily finks that vessel But the mariners having saved themselves by flight found afterwards another vessel and proceeded in the voyage From hence Demosthenes came up to Zacynthus and Cephallene where he took their heavy armed on board and sent for those of the Messenians from Nau pactus He also crossed over to the opposite continent of Acarnania to Alyzia and Anactorium both be longing to the Athenians Thus employed as he was in augmenting his force Eurymedon returning from Sicily whither he had been sent in the winter to carry a supply of money for the army meets him and a mongst other intelligence relates that  he had heard  since he was upon his return that Plemmyrium had  been taken by the Syracusans Conon also who commanded at Naupactus came to them with advice that  the five and twenty fail of Corinthians which lay over against their squadron had not quitted that station and even threatened them with an engage ment He exhorted therefore these commanders to detach some vessels thither since their squadron at Naupactus consisting only of eighteen ships was not a match for the enemy whose squadron amounted to twenty five Upon this Demosthenes and Euryme don detach ten of the prime sailors amongst those un der their own command to follow Conon for the re inforcement of the squadron at Naupactus The two former continued to assemble forces for the grand expedition Eurymedon for this purpose sailed to Corcyra commanded them to man out fifteen ships and selected himself the heavy armed for the ser vice for as he was returned from carrying the stores he joined himself with Demosthenes in the command in pursuance of the prior nomination Demosthenes was collecting a body of slingers and darters from the towns of Acarnania The 82t THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vfl The embassadors from Syracuse who were sent round to the Sicilian cities after the surprisal of Plemmyrium had succeeded in their negotiations and having as sembled a large body of succours were intent on bring ing them up Nicias who had gained an early intel ligence of their motion sends to such of the Siculi as lay upon their route and were in his alliance namely the Centoripes and Halycy√ ans and others  by no  means to yield a free passage to the enemy but to  assemble in a body and obstruct their march It was impossible for them to reach Syracuse by any other route for the Agrigentines had refused them a passage through their territories Now therefore the Sicili ans being on their march the Siculi in compliance with the request of the Athenians had placed three different ambuscades in their way From these rustl ing suddenly upon them as they were advancing in a careless manner they destroyed about eight hundred men and all the embassadors excepting one Corin thian And this Corinthian brought up afterwards to Syracuse all those who escaped by flight the number of whom amounted to fifteen hundred About the same time the Camarineans also send up a body of succours consisting of five hundred heavy armed three hundred darters and three hundred ar chers The Geloans also sent them a squadron of about five sail beside four hundred darters and two hundred horsemen Now almost all Sicily except the Agrigentines for these still adhered to their neutrality all the rest of the island I say who hitherto had stood aloof to observe events united themselves against the Athenians in be half of Syracuse though the Syracusans after the blow they had just received from the Siculi thought it not proper to attack the Athenians again upon a sud den But Demosthenes and Eurymedon having now com pleted their embarkations at Corey ra and on the conti nent B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR aa3 nent at the head of this united and powerful arma ment crossed over the Ionian to cape Iapygia and standing away from thence reach the Ch√ rades islands of Iapygia Here they take on board their fleet a party of Iapygian darters to the number of fifty and one hundred more of the Messapian nation and after they had renewed a friendship of ancient date with Ar tas who being lord of these islands supplied them with the darters they proceed to Metapontium in Italy Upon the plea of an alliance subsisting between them they prevail upon the Metapontians to furnish them out three hundred more and two triremes with which augmentation they stood along the coast to Thuria where on their arrival they find that the party who had acted against the Athenian interest had in a late sedition been driven out of the city Desirous here to take a view of the whole armament and to know whe ther any part had straggled and was left behind ho ping farther to prevail upon the Thurians to join them with their forces in the most cordial manner and since their welfare was connected with that of Athens to declare the friends and foes of the Athenians to be equally their own they staid some time at Thuria and completed their designs To return to the Peloponnesians About the fame portion of time their squadron of five and twenty sail ‚ which to favour the passage of the transports to Sicily Jay ranged in opposition to the fleet at Naupactus ha ving now made all things ready for an engagement and equipped out some additional vessels which had almost equalized their number to that of the Athenian ships take their station in Rhypica near Erineus of Achaia As the place in which they rode was bent in the form of a crescent the land force of the Corinthians and ad jacent confederates who marched to their assistance was posted upon each wing of the squadron on the jutting necks of land whilst the ships drawn up close J together 224 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII together composed the center of their arrangement and Polyanthes the Corinthian commanded the fleet The Athenians with three and thirty sail under the command of Diphilus weighed from Naupactus and stood in against them At first the Corinthians lay still without motion but so soon as it was judged ne cessary for them to act and the signal flag was accord ingly hoisted they advanced to charge the Athenians and an engagement ensued The contention was main tained a long time on both fides Three of the Co rinthian vessels are destroyed whilst not a single ship on the Athenian side was funk though seven were disabled for service by blows they had received from the ene mies beaks by which their forecastles had been shat tered by the Corinthian ships made firm and compact for this very purpose by stays on each side of the beak The event of the engagement remaining doubtful from whence both sides took occasion to claim the vic tory the Athenians however being masters of all the shatters of the enemy s fleet which the wind drove right into the sea and which the Corinthians made no efforts to recover they dropped away from each other Yet no kind of pursuit was attempted and no prisoners were taken by either for the Corinthians and Pelo ponnesians who fought close under the shore were by that enabled to make an easy escape but on the Athe nian side not even a single ship was funk And yet when the Athenians were sailed back to Naupactus the Corinthians immediately set up a trophy as if the vic tory was their own because they had disabled a larger number of the enemy They farther looked upon themselves as not defeated because their enemies were not clearly victorious for it is the way with the Corin thians to pronounce themselves victors if they are not ladly beaten whereas the Athenians esteem themselves defeated if they have not made a signal conquest But farther when the Peloponnesians were retired from their station and the land army was dismissed the A thenians B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 325 thenians erected a trophy The spot they chose whereon to place this token of their victory was distant about ‚ twenty stadia from Erineus the station in which the Corinthians rode Such was the event of this naval en gagement ‚ Demosthenes and Eurymedon so soon as the Thu rians had got in readiness seven hundred heavy armed with three hundred darters to attend them in the expe dition ordered the fleet to coast along the shore to wards the Crotoniatis whilst themselves after having taken a review of all their land army upon the banks ot the Sybaris marched them over land through the Thuriatis But when they were advanced to the river Hylias they were met by a message from the Crotonia t√ intimating to them that their consent should ne  ver be given for the passage of this army through  their dominionsupon which they wheeled off down wards towards the sea and the mouth of the Hylias where they halted a night and were joined by the whole body of the fleet The next morning they re embarked and proceeded along the coast touching at every city except Locri till they arrived at Petra in the district of Rhegium But during this interval the Syracusans who had received advice of the approach of the reinforcement determined to make another attempt with their fleet and the whole augmented body of their land army which they had assembled together for this very design of at tacking the Athenians again before the reinsorcement arrived But like men who in the former action had clearly perceived what would give them advantages over the enemy they had made some alteration in the struc ture of their vessels Having shortened the heads of their ships they made them more firm and compact and fastened very substantial stays to each fide of the beak they strengthened these again by rafters of six cubits in length which were laid along the ribs both  About two miles Vol II Q within 226 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII within and without in the softie manner as the Corinthi ans had strengthened the wholeprow of their ships for the last naval engagement against the squadron atNaupactus By thele means the Syracusans coricluded they should gain an advantage over the ships of the Athenians which were of a different structure as in the prow they were but weak because of their usual practice in an engagement not to charge a head biit by tacking a bout o strike upon the sides  ‚ that sarther should the battle be fought in the great harbour where sea room would be small and the ships be crouded this must be also an advantage in their favour since dariing themselves a head they must needs shatter the prows of the enemy when with compact and solid beaks rJhey struck against such as were hollow and weak  ‚ that again for want of sea room the Athenians would be too ftiuch straitened to make their tacks or to run through their lines which were points of art on which they chiefly relied j they were determined to the utmost of their power to check all attempts of the latter sort and the narrow space in which they must engage would of itself prevent the former and now they intended with dexterity to tufn to their own advantage the me thod of striking a head which on the former occasion appeared to be an error in the masters that hence in fallibly the day must be their own j for the Athenians if once repulsed would not have room to go round and return to the charge since thus they must directly be forced on the shore which lay but a small distance from their camp and would sadly cramp them up that they themielves must be masters of the rest of the harbour whilst the enemy crouded together in case they should be forced to give way must be driven into narrow compass and even falling soul on one another a total cons usion and disorder must certainly follow for what hurt the Athenians most in all their naval engagements was their inability to make use of the whole harbour for tacking about or returning to the charge in the same   manner B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 227 manner as the Syracusans ‚ that finally the Athe nians could not possibly get out into wider sea as the entrance of the harbour and the space behind the lines of battle were in their own command nay other ob stacles would co operate such as Plemmyrium which would now oppose any attempt of this kind and the very nature of the harbour s mouth which was exceed ing narrow By such a project the Syracusans had given an increase to their former skill and strength and animated more than ever by the thought of having improved from their errors in the former engagement they sallied out to encounter the enemy both with their land and naval force Gylippus hewed himself a small portion of time before the rest at the head of the infantry whom Jallying out of the city he drew up near the Athenian Entrenchment in that quarter where it faced the city Then the garrison of Olympi√ um to a man as well heavy armed as horsemen with all the light armed parties of the Syracusans came and drew up on the other quarters and immediately after the ships of rthe Syracusans and their allies came sailing forwards The Athenians at first imagined that at present they were threatened only with an assault by land but when on a sudden they saw the fleet bearing down a gainst them they were struck with confusion Some t f them were taking post upon and without the intrench ments to make head against the assailants others were sallied forth to encounter the troops srom Olym pi√ um and those from remoter parts coming on with full speed  numerous body of horsemen and darters The rest were hurrying on board to man the ships or to give what assistance they could upon the beach and no sooner were the proper complements on board than ieventy five ships stood out to meet the enemy but then the number of the enemy s vessels was abouc eighty Q 2 Great 228 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII Great parr of this day was spent in advancing to wards and retiring from one another and in recipro cal endeavours to seize advantages but neither side was able to execute any remarkable piece of service excepting that the Syracusans lunk one or two of the Athenian ships upon which they parted and at the fame time the land army drew off from the intrench ments The day following the Syracusans lay quiet asford ing the entmy no room to guess at their future designs But Nicias conscious to himself that hitherto no ad vantages had been gained by sea and fully expecting that the enemy would repeat their attempt obliged the captains of the triremes to repair their ships if any wife damaged and stationed ihe transports before the piles which they had driven down in the sea to secure the ships and lock up as it were that space in which they lay The transports he ranged in a line at the distance of the breadth of two  plethra from one another that in case a ship was repulsed it might run in hither as a place of scqurity and might again stand out without any molestation In persecting these dispositions the Athenians were all this day employed from morning to nighf The next day the Syracusans earlier in the morn ing than before and with the fame parade of their land and naval force came out to attack the Athenians Now again facing each other in the lines of engage ment they spent great part of the day in the same en  deavours as before to over reach and surprise one ano ther till at length Aristo the son of Pyrricus a Corinthian and the most expert seaman in the fleet of Syracuse persuades the commanders of that fleet to dispatch their orders to the magistrates within the city ‚ with all expedition to bring the provisions which were for sale down to the beach of the sea and hold the market there nay farther to compel all those  A plttbnti is said by seme to contain 1444 by others 1000 square feet  who B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 229 who had any meat to sell to offer it instantly on the beach that the mariners might come ashore and dine under the sides of their vest Is so that after a short  repast they might this same day unexpectedly fall upon the Athenians This counsel being approved the necessary orders were dispatched away and the market was furnished out Then suddenly the Syracu san fleet fell back and stood away towards the city where disembarking with all possible haste they took their repast But the Athenians who ascribed this dropping off of the enemy to a consciousness of their own inferiority quitting their own ships as if there was nothing farther to be done diverted their attention to their own affairs and especially to prepare a refreshing meal for them selves consident there would be no engagement on this day But on a sudden the Syracusans repairing on board stood out a second time to give them battle Then the Athenians in much hurry and confusion and most of them still fasting re embarking without any regularity or order with great difficulty after a considerable interval stood out to receive them For a certain space each side stood upon their guard and declined the charge At length it occurred to the Athe nians that it was imprudent to dally so long and ex haust their spirits by the mere labour of the oar which ought rather to be exerted on an expeditious attack Upon which animating one another with a shout they darted upon the enemy and the engagement began The Syraculans received the shock without giving way and keeping the heads of ti eir vessels right a gainst the enemy executed their project and with their strengthened beaks shattered the forecastles of the Athe nian Ihips whilst their darters who were ranged along the dei ks galled the Athenians sorely with their mis sive weapons though not near so much as did the crews of some light Syratusan boats which scoured a bout the enemy s fleet sometimes getting under their   Q 3 wards 23o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIL wards and gliding along the sides of their veflels and from these close positions aiming their darts at the ma riners In fine the Syraeusans persevering in this manner to gall their foes were masters of the day whilst the Athenians being put to flight were obliged to retire through the intervals of the line of transports into their own station The Syracusan ships pursued as far as to this line of transports but were obliged to stop there for fear of the  machines which hung upon the yards of the transports to bar all approach Two ships indeed of the Syraeusans elevated with success approached too near and were funk j and another with all her crew was taken by the enemy And now the Syraeusans who in the action had funk seven ships of the enemy had damaged many had taken many prisoners and made great slaughter judged it proper to retire They then erected trophies as victorious in two engagements and plumed themselves in the assu rance that by sea they had the superiority over the enemy  presuming at the same time that they must soon be victorious also by land upon which they got every thing in readiness to attack them once more oa both elements But at this crisis Demosthenes and Eurymedort ar rive at the head of the reinforcement from Athens which consisted of seventy three sail of ships inclu ding foreigners of about five thousand heavy armed of their own and their confederate troops beside a considerable number of darters as well Barbarian m precian and stingers and archers and a Complete supply of all military stores The first appearance of this grand reinforcement struck the Syraeusans arid their allies with no small consternation It looked as if the war must be endless and themselves exposed to dan gers that knew no bounds They saw that in spite of W Called dolphins from their form They were massy made of lead and bong upon the sail yards by cords and pulleys and when thrown into the entity s IhipSi either burst or funk them the B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 231 the annoyance which Decelea now fortified gave them the Athenians were arrived before Syracuse with ano ther armament as great and as formidable as the for mer  and that in every view the strength of Athens must be quite unsurmountable And now also the A thenians who remained of the former armament re spired from that dejection of spirit into which a series of misfortunes had plunged them Demosthenes after taking a view of the present pos ture of affairs thought it absolutely necessary to avoid delays and keep clear of those errors which had done so much prejudice to Nicias for Nicias at his first ap pearance struck an universal consternation  and yet by declining the immediate attack of Syracuse and loi tering a whole winter away at Catana he became an ob ject of contempt and Gylippus had time to land a suc cour from Peloponnesus which disconcerted all his measures That succour however the Syracusans could never have lent for had Nicias assaulted them on his first approach for deluding themselves with the thought that they were a match for their foes they would have found by sad experience that they had indulged a cruel mistake and must the same moment have been invested on all sides and in such a state though they had invited those succours yet no effectual relief could have been obtained from them Demosthenes therefore reflecting on these past mis takes and sensible that he himself this very moment on the first day of his arrival appeared most terrible in the eyes of the enemy resolved without loss of time to improve the present consternation which his reinforce ment had struck amongst them He farther took no tice that the counterwork of the Syracusans by which the Athenians had been excluded from perfecting their cireumvallation consisted only of a single wall  and in case the heights of Epipol√ could again be regained with the camp which at first had been occupied there that work might easily be carried since the defendants Q 4 could 232 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII could not now be able to withstand the Athenian strength j ‚ he determined therefore to put this project in execution judging that in case it succeeded it would be a means of bringing the war to a speedy con clusion for if the scheme took place the surrender of Syracuse must loon sollow at worst he would draw osf the army and not waste the lives of those Athenians who were employed in this service and the strength of the whole State to no manner of purpose Now therefore the Athenians began to act offen sively and in the first place sallying out from their camp they ravaged the country along the banks of the Anapus and were now again as on the first approach masters without controul both by land and sea for in neither element durst the Syracusans any longer come out to check their motions abating what small resist ance was made by the cavalry and darters from Oh m pi√ um In the next place Demosthenes thought proper to try what could be done against the works of the enemy by the help of machines But when upon applying them those machines were fired by the Syracusans who from the top of their works made a gallant de sence and though the army attacked in several quar ters at once they were every where repulsed he de termined to waste no longer time upon the trial but having prevailed with Nicias and his other coljegues in command to assent to the scheme he had formed to re cover Epipol√ he proceeded to put it in execution Yet by day light it was judged impossible sor them either to march or to mount the aicent without being discovered Upon this having issued out his orders that every man should take with him subsistence for five days and that all the masons and carpenters should attend the march with proper store of missive weapons and all needsul materials for raising new works in case the attempt was successful he put himself about the first sleep a the head of the whole army and assisted by B VIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 233 by Eurymedon and Menander marched towards Epi pola But Nicias was left behind in the intrench ments   When now they were advanced to the pass of Eury alus by which the first army gained formerly the as cent they are yet undiscovered by the Syracusan guards and mounting the heights surprise the fort which was there manned by the Syracusans and slaughter some of the desendants But the majority flying amain to wards the camps of whicli there were three among the advanced intrenchments of Epipol√ one of Syracu sans a second of other Sicilians and a third of the con federates they spread the alarm and also notified the enemy s approach to the six hundred Syracusans who at first were selected for the guard of this quarter of E pipol√ These sallied out instantly to stop their pro gress and Demosthenes with his Athenians falling in with them put them to flight after they had made a gallant stand Upon this success they immediately pushed forwards that they might improve the present ardour of the soldiers to the immediate completion of those points for which they had made this bold attempt Another party which had been advancing all along without a check surprised the counterwork of the Sy racusans of which since abandoned by its desendants they were throwing down the battlements But now the Syracusans and their consederates and Gylippus with the body under his command marched out of their intrenchments yet having been attacked in so daring a manner amidst the darkness of the night they had not recovered their surprise when they sell in with the Athenians j and thus not able to stand the first shock they were obliged to give way for a time But as the Athenians pushed forwards with great irre gularity as if the victory was quite their own eager farther to make themselves masters of all the tract not yet cleared of the enemy for sear lest should they slacken in their ardour the enemy might have time to 34 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII rally into a body ‚ the B≈ otians first put a flop to their career and rustling boldly upon them routed and put them to flight By this turn the Athenians were thrown into so much disorder and confusion that the particulars which followed cannot easily be gathered neither from themselves nor their antagonists for even in day light when objects are clearest to the sight men present in a battle are not able to fee all that paffeth each single combatant can barely relate what happened about his own person When therefore armies en gage amidst the darkness of the night though this is the only instance of it between powerful armies in the present war how is it possible to come at the know ledge of the several incidents The moon indeed hone at this time  but then they only saw one another as objects appear by moon light so as to discern the appearance of human bodies but not to distinguish be tween friends and enemies The heavy armed far ther numerous on both sides were too much crouded for want of room One party of the Athenians was al ready clearly defeated another unbroken by the first attack upon them was pushing forwards Of the re mainder of their army a great part had already mounted the ascent yet some were still busied in mounting up but none of these when they were got upon the emi nence knew which way to advance for before them as the rout was begun there was one grand medley of confusion and the tumult was so loud that no sounds could be distinctly heard The Syraculans and their confederates were animating one another with loud ex ultations for the season of the night made all signals useless to complete the blow and were clearing before them all that came in their way but the Athenians were prying about for one another and regarded every thing they met even though they fell in with their own friends as the flight was now begun for an assured enemy Obliged farther by frequent iterations to de mand the word as the only method to distinguish one another B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR n another all calling out aloud for it ac the fame instant of time they heightened the general distraction and clearly discovered their own word to the enemy But then they had not equal opportunities to discover that of the enemy because as the latter were now the vic tors and kept more in bodies it was less liable to de tection Hence it came to pals that though a stronger party of the Athenians fell in with a weaker party of their foes yet they judged it best to fly because they were sensible that their own word was divulged  and as they could not return the word of the Syracusans they must unavoidably be cut to pieces But what had the greatest effect and did most hurt to the Athe nians was the singing the faan since that used on both sides being nearly the same raised the utmost confusion And when the Argives and Corcyreans and all others of Doric descent who were with the A thenians began from time to time their p√ an it struck the fame alarm into the Athenians as when the enemy themselves sang it so that in short falling in amongst one another in different quarters of the army when once the confusion was rose to a height friends against friends and citizens against fellow citizens they not only impress a reciprocal terror but proceed to blows with so much fury that they could not easily be parted The pursuit was briskly followed in which many of them plunging headlong down the precipices were dashed in pieces because the pals downwards from E pipol√ was too narrow for their numbers But of those who from the heights got down into the plain many and all in general who came in the first arma ment since better experienced in the country escaped in safety to the camp whereas of the last comers some straggling into by ways were bewildered in a country to which they were utter strangers and at break of day were cut to pieces by the Syractnan horse who   236 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII On the day following the Syracusans erected two trophies on Epipol√ one on the summit of the pass and the other where the B≈ otians first stopped the ene my s progress The Athenians also obtained a truce to setch osf their dead the number or which was large both in their own troops and thole of their aHies and yet more arms were taken by the enemy than bore pro portion to the slain for of the number of light armed who were pushed to the brink of the precipices and throwing away their shields were obliged to leap down though some perished by the fall yet others escaped with life But after this the Syracusans highly animated a gain with this fresh unexpected turn in their favour sent out Sicanus at the head os fifteen fail to Agri gentum now embroiled in a sedition with orders to exert the utmost of his power to reduce it to their obe dience Gylippus also made once more the tour of Si cily to levy another army consident that with such a reinforcement he could carry the very intrenchments of the enemy by storm since affairs had taken such a favourable turn on Epipol√ In the mean time the Athenian generals were em ployed in the needful consultations since the last misfor tune and the present universal dejection of their troops They law that all their attempts were blasted by ill suc cess and that the soldiers were chagrined at the con tinuance of so fruitless a service tor a sickness spread amongst their people from a double cause  from the prelent season of the year in which the human body is most subject to disorders and the marshy unwholesome ground on which they were encamped besides that in every respect their situation appeared desperate and quite beyond the power of redress The opinion of Demosthenes was therefore totally re pugnant to a longer continuance before Syracule He  Plutarch puts it at two thousand j but Diodwus Siculm says it was two thousand five hundred urged B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 237 urged  the immediate execution of the scheme he had  formed before he made the late dangerous attempt upon Epipolse which since it had miscarried they should no longer protract their departure whilst yet  the season of the year was proper for their voyage  homewards and they had strength enough in the  last reinforcement to force their pafskge in spite of  the enemy He affirmed  it would be more con  ducive to the public welsare to turn their arms against  those who were erecting fortifications within Attica  itself than against the Syracusans whose reduction  now was almost impracticable and that it was mad  ness to persist any longer in a siege which dissipated the wealth of the State in fruitless vain expences In this manner Demosthenes declared his sentiments As for Nicias though convinced within himself that their affairs were in a bad situation yet he was unwil ling with his own mouth to confess their low condition or that a departure should be sixed by the general votes of a public council where all that passed must be re ported to the enemy because should the determina tion be formed in this manner the execution could not go forwards without the enemy s privity Besides as he knew the state of the enemy somewhat more per fectly than others he imagined there were grounds to hope that the state of the latter would soon become worse than their own would they only continue to press the siege A want of supplies must soon reduce them to great straits  and this the sooner as by the acces sion of the last squadron themselves were now again masters of the sea And what is more in Syracuse itself there was a party which wished to see the city fall into their hands These had dispatched their agents to Nicias and insisted he should not quit the siege Yet thus enlightened as he was in reality he knew not how to act as his mind was balanced between two mea sures which equally required mature deliberation But for the present he openly declared himself in council against a38 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII against drawing off the army He told them  he  was perfectly well affined that the Athenians would never forgive him should he carry their troops from Sicily without peremptory orders That the affair  would not then lie under the cognizance of such as  here advised it and with their own eyes were con  vineed of Che necessity of such a step but of men   who would form their judgements upon the spiteful  calumniations of others and the influence some ma Hcious demagogues would have over their under standings by which their fate would be determined He farther represented that  many nay the greater  part of the soldiers who now farmed the troops and make such tragical outcries about ahe perils that en  viron them at present would change their notes so  foon as they were landed again at Athens and as  cribe their return to the treachery and corruption of  their commanders For such reafons he declared as he was well acquainted with Athenian tempers  he would choose rather than be undone at Athens  by base criminations and an unjust sentence to ha  zard the last extremity and perish if so it must be  under the violence of the enemy He maintained however that  the state of the Synacu sans was worse  than their own The demand upon them ffor the  pay of foreigners was large their expences in secu ring the outworks of Syracuse were nigh they had  now supported a large navy for thespace of an en   tire year want theresore must soon come upon them and they must shortly be tocally distressed because  the sum of  two thousand talents they had already  expended of their own stook and had even con tracted a large debt beside And in case they a  bate of their present punctuality or making good the  appointments of the forces they have on foot their  strength must moulder away since it consisted not  like the Athenians of troops which must serve but  337500 Stirling of B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 439  of such as were only discretionary aids He con cluded with  the necessity they lay under from the ‚ ties of duty to continue the siege with vigour and  by no means expose a superior strength to ruin through a false presumption that they were inferior in point of supplies Nicias expressed himself on this occasion with an air of neat confidence as a person perfectly weli acquaint ed with the stare of Syracuse and the failure of money there and because there was a party within the city which acted in favour of the Athenians and had advi sed him iby their agents  by no means to raise the siege And what is more he placed a stronger dependence now upon the fleet than ever he had done before the late unsuccessful engagement As to the proposal of continuing the siege Demos thenes would not yield the least degree of attention to it  if ithe army must not evacuate Sicily without a  peremptory order from Athens but must persist in this destructive service he judged it would be better to draw them off to Thapsus or to Catana where M they might find opportunity enough to make incur  sions with the land army upon the territories of the enemy and by committing devastations migbc highly distress them Their fleet might then en  gage n tne open sea not in a space confined and straitened which was the greatest advantage to the enemy but in sufficient sea room where all their su 1 perior skill might fairly be exerted where they would be able to make their tacks and bear down a  gain upon the foe with greater agility and more vio lent hocks than could be done in the limitary space  of a close pent up harbour Upon the whole he af  firmed that his consent should never be given to a longer continuance in their present posts but he was for moving off with all possible expedition and they  had not a moment to lavish upon delay  Eurymedon 240 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII  Eurymedon then declared that his sense of things co incided with that of Demosthenes and Nicias persist ing in the contrary opinion a sit of languor and sus pence ensued attended with the secret imagination that the pofitiveness of Nicias resulted from some stronger hopes of success he had conceived above his colleagues And in this manner the Athenians fell into dilatory mea sures and continued in their camp before Syracuse But in this interval Gylippus and Sicanos returned to Syracuse Sicanus truly disappointed of Agrigen tum for he was advanced no farther than Gela when the sedition in favour of the Syracusans was brought to an amicable period but then Gylippus was returned at the head of a numerous body consisting of levies made in Sicily and the heavy armed troops from Peloponne sus who in the spring had put to sea on board the transport but came over last from Africa to Selinus for into Africa they had been driven by contrary winds j and having there been furnished by the Cyreneans with two triremes and a set of pilots as they coasted along the African shore they relieved the Evesperit√ then blocked up by the Libyans The latter they deseated in a set battle and proceeding from thence along the shore they reached Neapolis a Carthaginian mart from whence lies the shortest cut to Sicily being only a passage of two days and a night Hence therefore they stood across and landed at Selinus    With this accession of strength the Syracusans instant ly prepared to attack the Athenians again both by land and sea But the Athenian generals ‚ finding they had received so large an augmentation and that the posture of their own affairs was so far from being changed for the better that day after day it grew worse in every re spect and what was worst of all that their troops were quite exhausted with fatigue and sickness ‚ they repent ed now in earnest that they had not drawn off in time and as Nicias now no longer opposed that step with the same vehemence as he had done before but merely en deavoured B V1T THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 241 deavoured that it should not be determined in public council they issued out orders with the utmost secrecy that the whole armament should hold themselves in rea diness to put to sea upon a signal given But all things now ready the very moment they are going to embark the moon is eclipsed for it was now the time of the full The bulk of the army struck with the awful appear ance called out upon the generals to halt and Nicias always addicted too much to superstition and such vul gar scruples positively declared that  it should no more be debated whether they should remove or not till the three times nine days were past which the  soothsayers prescribe on such occasions So for this reason a longer stay was forced upon the Athe nians who had been too dilatory already Vol II R The  That the bulk of an army or a fleet should be frightened at such appearances is no wonder at all They are ever ignoiant and the most daring of them in other respects have been much addicted to superstition But one cannot help being surpri sed at the ignorance and superstition of Nicias j one cannot help pitying and deplo ring the foible of a man who had so good a heart Plutarch expatiates hugely on this occasion Even the vulgar fays he at this time were well apprised that an ec lipse of the sun was often occasioned about the time of the change by an inter position of the moon but as to the moon by the interposition of what body and  bow on a sudden at the full its light fades away or emits variety of colour waa not easy for them to conceive They thought it a strange occurrence and sent from God as a prognostic of great calamities The first person who wrote a clear and bold solution of the enlightening and obscuration of the moon was Anaxa f goras who now bad not been long dead nor was his account in every body hands but concealed imparted only to a few and that with caution and aiTu ranees of secrecy The world could not bear that Naturalists and Meteor mnn gers as they were then stiled should seem to restrain the divine power by quaint  argumentations invisible operations and necessary consequences For such at tempts Protagoras was banished and Pericles with much ado procured the re  lease of Anaxagoras when thrown into prison Nay Socrates who never med died with any of these points was however put to death upon the charge of pbi  hsopbix mg It was not till late that the glory of Plato shone abroad j who by his irreproachable life and subjecting natural necessities to a divine and sovereign  power cleared away all bad imputations from studies of this kind and by a ma  thematical beginning opened a field to other sciences And thus his friend D on  at what time he was setting fall from Zacynthus against Dionyfius was not at all  disheartened by an eclipse of the moon but landed safe at Syracuse and ejrcted the tyrant It was the misfortune of Nicias at this juncture not to have even a4i THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII The Syracusans who had soon an intelligence of their designs were now more animated than ever to press briskly on the Athenians as on men who had given prools of their own inward conviction that they were no longer a match for their foes cither by sea or on land fincei with other thoughts they never could have projected a re embarkation Apprehensive at the lame time that mould they remove to any other quarter of Sicily they would become more disficult of reduction they saw the necessity of engaging them by sea without a moment s loss whilst yet they had an advantage in compelling them to sight Upon this they ordered the complements of men on board their ships and exercised their crews as many days as Was judged susficient But when opportunity offered of acting with advantage on the first day they assaulted the Athenian intrenchments and a party of heavy armed and horsemen though not numerous sallying out at some of the ports to beat them off they cut off some of the heavy armed from the rest of that party As the spot farther on which the assault is made was narrow the Athenians lose seventy horses and a small number of their heavy armed Nothing more hap pened on this day as the army of the Syracusans now made their retreat a sleilfu soothsayer with him for his intimate Stilbidet who had cured much of his superstition had died a little before j since this portent as Philochoru fays was not a bad one but an excellent good one for a flying army since act which are accompanied with fear stand in need of concealment and light it ever an adversary to them Besides after eclipses of the son or moon it was the u ¬ soat custom as Autoclidrs hath informed us to hold only a three days cessation from business But Nicias persuaded himself that a complete revolution of the moon ought to be waited for as if with his own eyes he had not seen her shine bright again when the had passed the sliadow and the earth s interposition Yet throwing up all attention to other points he minded nothing hot sacrificing till and having  them to flight follow the pursuit his enemies attacked him Life of Nie uu But B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 243 But on the day following they stand out with their  fleet to the number of seventy six ships and at the fame time the land army marched up to the intrench ments The Athenians launched out with fourscore and six to give them a reception and thus charging one another an engagement ensued Eurymedon commanded the right wing of the Athenian fleet and endeavoured to over reach and surround the ships of the enemy For this purpose he opened his line and stood along too close to the land which gave the Sy racusans and their allies who had now defeated the center of the Athenians an opportunity to intercept him in the bottom and recess of the harbour where they slay Eurymedon himself and destroy the ships which had separated in his company and this done they gave chace to the whole Athenian fleet and drove them ashore Gylippus now perceiving that the ships of the ene my were defeated and drove aground quite wide of the piles and their camp formed instantly a design to make slaughter of the men as they were leaping on shore and of giving the Syracusans an opportunity easily to draw off all the ships from land of which they were entire masters At the head therefore of one division of the land force he marched down to the pier to second the fleet The Tyrrhenes happened to have been posted nearest by the Athenians who seeing a body of the enemy running down thither in a dilbrderly manner advanced eagerly to meet them and charging briskly on the van put them to flight and drive them into the lake of Lysimclia But soon after a reinforcement of Syracusans and their allies coming up the Athenians  Plutarch adds that  on this occasion the very lads came out in fishing  boats and fleiffs taunting and insulting the Athenians One of these lads Hera elides of a noble family who had advanced too near was in great danger of be  ing intercepted by an Athenian vessel But Pollichus the uncle of the hi a ¬ Jarmed for his safety charged instantly with the ten triremes he had under his ¬ command The rest of the Syracusan fleet now alarmed for Pollichus ran in  mi once and brought on a general engagement Life of Nitiet R 2 also a4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII also advanced with speed to succour their friends and trembling for their ships soon came to an engagement with them and after routing pursued them amain They slaughtered now a great number of the heavy armed and what was more preserved the far greater part of their fleet and towed again to their former moorings all their ships except eighteen which the Syracusans and their allies made prizes and put all the men on board them to the sword With a view far ther to destroy the rest by setting them on fire they filled an old transport ship with fascines and combusti ble matter and as the wind blew right upon the Athe nians set her on sire and let her drive in amongst them The Athenians trembling for the ships put all their engines instantly at worK to extinguish the flames which having at length effectuated and kept this fire ship clear of their own vessels they were delivered from this irrmir ent danger After this the Syracusans erected a trophy for their victorious engagement on the water and for the inter ception of the party of the heavy armed before the in trenchments where they had taken so many horses The Athenians also did the same for the repulse given by the Tyrrhenes to the land forces of the enemy and their being chated into the lake and the larger success they afterwards obtained with the rest of their army But now when beyond the reach of doubt the Sy racusans though at first aiaimed at the large reinforce ment of Hupping brought against them by Demosthenes had gained a signal victory by sea the Athenians were plunged into a total dejection of spirit they were thun derstruck by the reverie of misfortunes so little expect ed and began to repent with much more bitterness of thought that they had ever engaged in so fatal an expedition They had invaded States whose polity was already of a piece with their own whose form of government was popular like that of Athens and which flourished in shipping in horses and each arti B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 245 cle of power And yet finding themselves unable to give any measure of luccess to their projects by intro during dissentions amongst them through political em broilments nor even by a powerful force superior to that of their foes able to ward off the many blows they had received they had fallen beforehand into great anxi eties and now sadly beaten as they were at sea one thought of which they never could hitherto have con ceived their despondency became more violent than e ver From this time the Syracusans scoured the whole harbour without having any thing to fear They had also formed a scheme of barring up its mouth that the Athenians though never so intent upon it might for the future not have it in their power to steal away Their care and diligence were no longer employed on the view alone of their own preservation but on the larger view of ruining the Athenians They conclu ded and justly too that the latter turns in their favour had given them the ascendant over these invaders and could they but compass the total overthrow of this body of Athenians and their allies the grand atchievement would strike all Greece with admiration Nay more all other Grecians must reap the fruits of such success of whom some would in an instant recover freedom and others be delivered from the fear of losing it For the remaining strength of Athens would never be able to stand against that weight of war with which she must be soon incompassed about And thus could they Syra cusans be the glorious authors of luch desirable events they must infallibly become objects of wonder not only to all the present age but to latest posterity And of a truth considered in such a light it was great and glo rious ambition to aim at the conquest not only of the Athenians but also of their whole extensive and combi ned alliance and this not merely to earn laurels for themselves but for the auxiliaries also who had engaged in their cause since exposed in the front of the war R 3 with  246 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B V1I with the Laced√ monians and Corinthians they had ob jected their own State to the fury of a storm which threatened them all and by their own personal valour in naval engagements had contributed most to such a height of success The various people now got together at this one city of Syracuse were so very numerous as to be exceeded only by the comprehensive roll of those who in the se ries of the present war sided either with the States of A thens or Sparta The catalogue is subjoined of those who mustered in the offensive and defensive armies at Syracuse who fought against or in behalf of Sicily who joined for the reduction or preservation of this ifland not so much from just and lawful motives ora concurrence resulting from the ties of blood as from policy or interest or direct compulsion The Athenians truly in quality of Ionians had vo luntarily come hither against the Syracusans who were Dorians attended by those who spoke the same dialect and used the same institutions with themselves the Lem mans and Imbrians and those √ ginerse who were the present possessors of √ gina The Hesti√ ans farther now inhabiting Hesti√ a in Eub≈ a as an Athenian co lony had joined in the expedition Ot the remaining pumbers some came along with them because they were dependents some though independent because they were confederates and some there were who at tended merely for their pay The dependents And tri butaries were the Eretrians and Chalcideans and Sty rensians and Carystians from Eub≈ a from the islands the Ceans and Andrians and Tei ans from Ionia the Milesians and Samians and Chians of these the Chians being not subjected to a tribute but only to furnish a quota of shipping though independent at home yet followed their arms And all these hitherto recited were Ioi ians and Athenian colonies excepting the Carystians for these last areDryopes but as sub jected to Athens not so much from choice as Ionians as B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 247 as by mere compulsion hey now followed their mas ters against Dorians To these were added √ olians the Methymneans for instance who were to furnish shipping but were exempted from tribute the Tene dians farther and √ nians who were tributaries But these being √ olians were now compelled to fight a gainst other √ olians namely their own founders the B≈ otians who adhered to the Syracusans The Pla t√ ans did the same and were the only B≈ otians that acted against B≈ otians upon the justisiable pretext of las ting enmity The Rhodians farther and Cytherians attended though both of Doric descent The Cythe rians truly who are a Laced√ monian colony bore arms at this juncture on the Athenian side against the Laced√ monians under the command of Gylippus and the Rhodians Argives by descent were obliged to turn their arms against the Doric Syracusans nay a gainst the Geloans a colony of their own now acting in concert with the Syracusans Of the people of the lfles on the coast of Peloponnesus came the Cephallenians and Zacynthians independent in fact but through their situation controuled in some measure by the Athe nians who are masters of the sea The Corcyreans farther who were not only of Doric bur what is more were even of Corinthian original as being a colony of the latter and by blood allied to the former from compul sion as they gave out for a colour though in truth from deliberate malice since opposing the Corinthians whom they hated followed the Athenians with an ar dour inferior to none The Messenians also now stiled Meflenians of Naupactus and those from Pylus which was still held by the Athenians were brought along to the war to whom must be added a small party of Me garean exiles who by a sad reverse of fortune now took part against the Selinuntians who were also Megarean The residue of the confederates were engaged rather up on free and spontaneous choice The Argives for in stance not more from obligations of lubsilting treaties R 4 than 248 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII than the rancour they bore the Laced√ monians and the gratification of private spleen though Doric yet followed the Ionic Athenians against their Doric kin dred But the Mantineans and the reft of the Arca dians who are mercenaries and eternally habituated to act against any foe pointed out to them were now so far influenced by gain as to regard those Arcadians as their enemies who came over on this occasion in company with the Corinthians The Cretans also and √ tolians were there allured by an advantageous pay and thus it happened that the Cretans who in concert with the Rhodians had founded Gela readily took part for the fake of gain not with but against a colony which themselves had planted There was also a body of A carnanian auxiliaries partly induced to join by the pay they received but principally by their personal regard for Demosthenes and their attachment to the Athenians And thus have we run them over to the utmost bounda ry of the Ionian gulf Of the Italic nations the Thu rians and those Metapontians whom intestine feuds had reduced to the necessity of fighting for subsist ence joined their arms and of the Sicilian the Nax 1 ians and Cataneans of barbarian the Egesteans who were the first movers of this grand contention and the major part of the Siculi and out of Sicily some of the Tyrrhenes from enmity to the Syracusans and the mercenary Iapygians So many nations were assembled together at present under command of the Athenians The auxiliaries on the side of the Syracusans were the Camarineans who border close upon them and the Geloans who are situated next the Camarineans To proceed regularly As the Agrigentines were neutral the Selinuntians next occur who are seated beyond the Agrigentines since they inhabit that tract of the island which faceth Afric Then the Himereans the only Grecian people who inhabit that part of the ifland which lies off the Tyrrhene sea and were the only body which came from thence to the aid of Syracuse The several B VII THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR 249 several nations of Greek descent settled in Sicily being all Doric and independent acted together in concert Of the barbarous people they had those Siculi alone who did not openly revolt to the Athenians but out of Sicily the Laced√ monians sent them a citizen of Spar ta to command and a body of Neodamodes and Helots By a Neodamas is meant a citizen newly enfranchised The Corinthians alone aided them both with shipping and a land force in conjunction with the Leucadians and Ambiaciots by blood allied to Syracuse From Arcadia also came a body of mercenaries sent by the Corinthians and the Sicyonians who acted on com pulsion and of those who dwell without the Pelopon nesus were the B≈ otians But beside these foreign aids the Sicilians as possessed of great and powerful cities furnished out in all respects a much greater and well appointed force For by them a numerous body of heavy armed of ships and horses and other kinds of military force in an amazing abundance were rai sed and brought to Syracuse And yet it must be said that the domestic force of the Syracusans was more to be considered than all the rest from the greatness of their State and the immediate urgency of those perils with which they were environed These were the aids the numerous aids assembled together by the contending parties and at this juncture all these were present on each side of the contest and from this crisis neither party received any accession The Syracusans therefore and their consederates thought since the signal victory they had gained upon the water it would be a brave exploit and highly for their glory to make the whole extensive camp of the Athenians their prize and cut off their retreat on both elements both by land and lea With this pro ject they immediately barred up the great harbour the mouth of which is about  eight stadia over with a P Near a mile line ¬ 50 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII line of triremes placed fide by side and other vessels and boats moored fast together by anchors and got e very thing besides in readiness in cafe the Athenians should venture on another engagement Their every view was now become large and aspiring When the Athenians saw the harbour thus barred up and perceived farther the whole of the enemy s de signs it was judged high time to go to consultation The commanders of the different bodies were called to council with the generalsin which ‚ upon represen tations made  of the great distress to which they were reduced and that they had not a stock of provisions ample enough for their immediate subsistence for bent on sailing away they had sent already to Catana to countermand any fresh convoys and unless they 4 could recover their mastery at sea it would be im practicable for the future to obtain a supply ‚ they came to a final resolution  To quit their intrench  ments on the higher ground and before the station of their shipping to raise a circular work of as little  compass as possible but sufficient to serve for a ma M gazine and hospital and to this only to assign a guard as for the rest of the land army they were to oblige every soldier to goon board that all the ships  which yet were undamaged or had been aid up for  want of hands might be completely manned and  thus they must fight their passage out of the har 4 bour and if it succeeded make directly for Cata na but if repulsed they would burn their hip  ping and moving off in one body by land would endeavour by the most expeditious marches to reach the ntrarest place that would receive them whe ther barbarian or Grecian Such was the plan resolved on and which they began immediately to execute for now abandoning their upper intrenchments they drew down to the beach and manned the whole of their shipping on board of which they forced without exception all such as B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 251 had youth and vigour enough to be of service there The whole number of ships they were by this means e nabled to man amounted to a hundred and ten They also placed on board the fleet a large number of archers the darters of the Acarnanians and other foreign auxi liaries and provided in all other respects for action as well as their condition would permit or the nature of the project required When things were thus in great forwardness Nicias taking notice that the soldiery was much dejected by the great defeats which contrary to their wonted custom they had received by sea and yet desirous to hazard an other engagement as soon as possible because pinched for want os necessary subsistence he gathered them all round about himself and endeavoured to raise their drooping spirits by the following exhortation the first of the kind he had ever made MY sellow foldiers whether of the Athenian or  the consederate troops the bold attempt we are now going to make is of equal concern to each individual amongst us since not more for victory over our  foes than for the preservation of ourselves and our  country we are now to fight and if our naval ef forts be crowned with victory each of us may again  be blessed with the fight of his own native city A  way therefore with these faces of despair this pain  ful dejection fit only for a raw unexperienced multi  tude who unsuccessful in their first attempts for ever after bid adieu to hope and by unmanly sears  anticipate misfortunes As for you Athenians who form so considerable  a part ot this assembly experienced as you are in  such variety of warfare  ‚ and you also our allies  who have ever fought under our banners ‚ recal  to your reflexion the unexpected turns of war  en w courage the hope that fortune may at length declare f for us and determine once more to engage the foe with s5 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII with a spirit worthy of that numerous strength of which by ocular demonstration you see yourselves this moment possssed Those points of which we perceive we may avail ourselves against the narrow ness of the harbour s mouth against such a multi tude of vessels as will be crouded together and against that particular disposition of soldiers on their decks from which on the former occasion we suf fered so much ‚ all these I must tell you are as well adjusted as our present condition will permit by the united care of us your generals and your own masters for many archers and darters shall now line your decks and that croud of soldiers which when we engage in the open sea we never can use be cause the vessels would be too heavily laden to allow the proper exertion of our skill that croud I say in this pent up contracted space shall give to our naval battle the strength and stability of a land engagement We have also devised the proper means to compensate the inferior structure of our ships and in return for the consolidated beaks of our enemy have provided the ships with grappling irons which will hold fast a vessel that hath run a gainst you from getting clear provided those on board will perform their duty because as necessity inforceth us now to fight a mere land battle from our decks it highly concerns us neither to be beat off ourselves nor to suffer them to get clear from our grapple especially when all the ambient shore excepting the small tract now occupied by our own army is hostile in regard to us Mindful of these things it behoves you to fight it out so long as strength and vigour shall enable you and never suf fer yourselves to be driven on such a shore but when once your ship hath grappled with a foe never once to think of losing your hold till you have cleared the enemy s decks of all the defendants But these points I give in charge to the heavy armed  not B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 253 not less than to the seamen fince this method of engagement is more particularly your province and since it still remains within your power to earn a glorio us victory by putting your land method into practice But the seamen I exhort and with my exhortations mingk my intreaties not to shrink too much under the sensibility of pall defeats as your decks are now better armed in all respects than they were before and as the number of the shipping is enlarged Recal the idea of that heart delighting privilege of which you are now to secure the con v  tinuance ‚ To you I speak who though not of  Athenian extraction have hitherto been regarded and honoured as Athenians and for speaking well our language and appropriating our manners have been admired through the whole extent of Greece have participated the benefits of our large extended empire not less than ourselves in point of profit and much more than ourselves in striking awe into your vassals and being exempted from the attacks of injustice Since therefore you alone have freely shared our empire with us you are bound by all the ties of honour by no means to desert its present vin dication Then in open despight of those Corin thians whom you have so often conquered and of those Sicilians not one of whom durst look us in the  face so long as the vigou of our fleet was unim  paired drive your foes before you and strike into  them the plain conviction ‚ that your military skill  though struggling with weakness and misfortunes is yet far superior to all their strength and luck united But to the native citizens of Athens amongst you  1 must once more suggest that you have now no longer in your docks such another fleet as this nor  have left behind you such another body of heavy armed If therefore your immediate fate be any  thing less than victory your enemies will fail and be  directly at Athens and the remainder os our forces there 254 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII  there will no longer be able to repulse the united as faults of their domestic foes and such foreign inva ders Nay the infallible result must be that you at  once put on the chains of Syracusans against whom  you are conscious with what intentions you at first  came here whilst your country must be forced ro submit to a Laced√ monian bondage Now there  fore summon all your courage to earn the day in  which your own liberty and that of Athens is to be the victor s prize and let each individual amongst  you invigorate himself with the thought nay let it  throw spirit and life into the whole army ‚ that  these who are now to engage on board this present fleet are the whole of the land and naval force of  your country arc the surviving supports of the  State and the great Name of Athens In so mo  mentous a conflict whoever amongst you excels in  military skill or inward bravery that person had ne ver so fine an opportunity to give demonstration of  his superior worth or to perform a great service for  himself or for the welfare of his country Nicias after he had finished this earnest exhortation ordered them to repair directly to their posts on board the fleet As all this hurry of preparation lay within their view Gylippus and the Syracusans could not escape the con victon that the Athenians were bent on another engage ment They had moreover received intelligence of the new project of the grappling irons As therefore they had provided against every thing besides they also made provision to counterwork that project For this purpose they had covered the prows and almost the whole gunnel of their ships with hides that when the grappling iron was thrown it might slip off and catch no hold And no fooner were all their preparations completed than the Syracusan generals in concert with Gylippus i B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 255 Gylippus animated their men to engage with resolu tion by the following harangue THAT your past achievements have been glorious indeed and for the acquisition of greater honour and glory that you are now on the brink of engaging the generality of you ye Syracusans and confede rates are well convinced and need not at present to be informed for otherwise you could never have persisted so far in this warm career of bravery and fuc  cess But if there be a man amongst you whose sense  of things drops short of their real position we shall  now throw upon it the needful illustration This land our property the Athenians have inva  ded aiming in the first place at insiaving Sicily  and had this design succeeded at inflicting an equal  fate on Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece And  yet these very Athenians who enjoy already the lar gest tract of empire that any ancient or modern State of Greece hath at any time enjoyed you are the first  who have bravely resisted and of that navy on  which they erected their incroaching pile of power are  plainly the victors in several engagements as again hi  that which now approacheth you will assuredly beat  them For men who have received such severe  checks in a point for which they so highly plumed  themselves wiH for the future have a much worse o  pinion of their own merit than if they had never con  ceived so high a value of it and when all their tow  ering pretensions are so unexpectedly blasted their subsequent efforts must of course drop short of their  real strength And this you may rest assured is the  present state of yonder Athenians And by parity in  regard to ourselves that proportion of strength we  enjoyed at first with which though far inserior in  skill we boldly and successfully presumed to with  stand them must now be suitably enlarged and f with the farther accession of this inward assurance thai 25 6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VlL that we are really the best since we have beat the best seamen in the world our hopes of success are in every light redoubled and then human experience  teacheth us that in every competition the warmest hope is ever accompanied with the greatest resolu tion But farther those late alterations which they have introduced among their shipping in order to equalise  and balance ours have been a long time familiar to our own practice and each of their new preparations we shall dexterously improve to our own advantage For when contrary to the long and inveterate disci  pline of their fleet there are crouded together upon their decks a numerous body of heavy armed as well  as another numerous body of mere terra firma dart ers as they may properly bestiled ‚ when thus A carnanians and other landmen are forced on board  who even sitting would be unable to poise and direct  their weapons ‚ how can they avoid indangering their  vessels or jumbled confusedly together and tot tering under motions to which they are not inured how can they escape a total disorder What still makes more against them the multi  tude of their shipping will only serve the more to embarrass them and let this dispel the fears of those who may be afraid of engaging against their superior  numbers for a multitude ot ships in a contracted space will be more stow in executing orders and are  at the fame time most easily exposed to the annoy  ance which our preparations are contrived to give them And now attend to the true and real situation  of the foe as from good intelligence we are enabled clearly to declare it to you Environed on all sides with misfortunes and dif tressed in a present want of the necessaries of life they are become quite desperate And hence though they have resigned all considence in their real strength yet in the fury of despair they are throwing themselves B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 357 themselves upon the decision of fortune that either  if the passage can be forced they may launch out to  sea or that project sailing may attempt a retreat by land ‚ as if to a worse condition than their present  it were not in the power of fortune to reduce them  Warmed therefore with brave resentment let us  also try the encounter against such wild confusion  and against the fortune of our inveterate foes now  treacherously bent to finish their destruction Let us  charge with the full conviction that on an enemy  who would justify their invasion on the principle of redressing wrongs it is most fair and equitable to  satiate all the fury of revenge nay more that ven  geance on a foe is an appetite of our nature and  commonly said to be the sweetest of all human enjoy  ments But that those men yonder are our foes our  most bitter unrelenting foes you need no farther  proofs since bent on inslaving this our country  they first made the voyage and had this their o  dious project been fuccelsful on our citizens they ¬ had inflicted the most cruel torments on our wives and children the most indecent enormities and on Syracuse the most ignominious appellation In a work of so just retaliationj to indulge a tenderness of mindj or to think it gain to let them depart with out additional revenge will be a matter of just re proach for the latter is all they will be able to ef  sect even though at length they maybe victors  But 10 us could we execute the fair and equitable wishes of our hearts by inflicting upon them the pu f nishment they well deserve and in setcing the liberty  yond the reach of any future insults how glorious  must such achievements be For such critical mo merits of adventure are most rarely to be met with which if unsuccessful can do the least disservices  but if successful draw after them the most valuable  acquisitions  of all Sicily as it hath been  Vol II s When 2S8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vlh When the Syracusan generals seconded by Gylippus had finished this their exhortation to their own soldiers they also in their turn repaired immediately on board their fleet as they found was already done by the Athe nians ‚ ‚ t But Nicjas whose mind was surcharged with present cares sensible how extreme the danger and how nearly approaching since this very moment they were only not in motion and once more reflecting that as ge nerally happens in affairs of such prodigious moment some points might yet be left imperfect something of energy and weight and influence be yet left unlaid j he called out again upon every single captain in the fleet addressing himself separately to them with the honour able mention of their fathers themselves and their tribe and conjuring each by his own distinguishing splendor whatever it was not now to betray it nor tarnish  those hereditary virtues on which their ancestors had sounded their gloryreminding them earnestly of the uninterrupted freedom of their country and the privilege they had ever enjoyed of living in it quite free and uncontrouled ‚ asserting other argu ments soch as with men who had their all so much at stake might have influence and weight no matter now how trite or hackneyed by frequent repetitions pr how equally applicable to every case as fetched from the endearments of their wives and their offspring and their paternal gods such as from every topic in a plunge of horror and distress are rung in the ears of men as likely to animate and persuade And thus at last though fearful that not even yet he had said c nough but all that the time would permit he parted from them and placing himself at the head of the land army marched down to the beach where he drew them up in as large a line as they could possibly form that their appearance might have the greater ef fect in emboldening those on board the fleet B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 259 And now Demosthenes and Menander and Euthy demus for these went on board to command the fleet getting clear from their moorings stood away directly towards the barricade of the harbour and that interval of its mouth not yet completely barred in order to clear the passage The Syracusans also and their allies had now launched forth against them with their usual number of ships A detachment of these were so sta tioned as to guard the passage the rest were spread cir cularly quite round the harbour that on all sides at once they might attack the Athenians and their land army on the beach might second them on approaches to the shore The Syraculan fleet was commanded by Sicanus and A gatharcus who were respectively stationed in each of the wings whilst Py then and the Corinthians composed the center When the Athenians were come up to the barricade they run boldly at it and by the violence of the first shock they beat off the vessels ranged about it and were intent on clearing away the whole barricade But here the Syracusans and allies falling in amongst them from every quarter a general engagement ensued not only at the barricade but in every part of the harbour Obstinate it really proved and such a battle as they had never fought before Great in truth was the ar dour of the seamen on both sides in running upon the enemy whenever the word was given and great was the art exerted by the officers in attack and defence and reciprocal contention The soldiers on board ex erted all their efforts that when ship came to close with ship no stretch of military skill mould be omitted on the hatches Every individual abiding firmly in hrs post strained all his diligence to signalize his own behaviour But as numerous ships were falling in to gether amongst one another in little sea room and so large a number never fought before in so small a space since she amount of both fleets fell little short of two hundred the direct incursions with the beak were few S 2 because  26p THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII because room was wanting for tacks and passages but boardings were frequent as the vessels were continu ally running Foul on one another or in sheering off met with others which were coming on And so long as a vessel was in her approach thole on the hatches poured plentifully against her whole showers of javelins and arrows and stones but when they were once come to grappling the soldiers closing in firm battalion en deavoured by force to board one another Nay it most frequently happened through the straitness of sea room that the very moment one party boarded the enemy the very same moment they were also boarded themselves as two vessels lay often along side of an enemy nay sometimes more by necessity mingled and squeezed sast together In the mean time the care of the officers was not confined to one single point but distracted  n all sides by a whole round of perils they were here intent on their own defence and there on the annoyance of the enemy And farther the prodi gious crash that was made by such a number of strips running at the same instant upon one another struck such dismay and loss of hearing that the voices of those who issued out orders could no longer be distinguished Loud besides were the exhortations and shouts of the officers on both sides partly in conformity to rule though swelled at present by the ardour of contention Amongst the Athenians it was shouted amain ‚  To ‚ force the passage and now or never to exert their utmost stretch of bravery to earn a safe return to their native country  ‚ Amongst the Syracusans and their allies ‚  How glorious it would be to hin der their escape and by present victory for every one amongst them to increase the growing honours of his country The commanders also on both sides if they saw a vessel dropping off before it was overpow ered by the enemy called out aloud by name on the captain demanding on the Athenian side  Did they  retire on the wild presumption that yonder most hostile shore B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 261 shore would prove more friendly to them than the open sea which by long prescription they had claimed as their own province ‚ But on the Syrac usan ‚ Would they who were perfectly assured that the  Athenians wanted nothing so much as to escape ‚ would they fly fit ft from those who were flying The land army farther of each party upon the beach whilst yet the battle was alternately fluctuating on the water felt the utmost anxiety and the most painful Con flict of mind earnestly bent as the one domestic party was  on gaining accumulated honours but fearful as the other invading party was become that  their condition might loon become worse than it was al ready For the whole hope of the Athenians cen tering at present in that fleet their anguish for the e vent was more acute than ever they had felt and was aggravated by their own position on the beach which gave them a clear uninterrupted prospect of all that passed in the battle upon the water The scene was but at a trifling distance from their eyes and as the looks of all of them were not at the fame instant fastened upon the same spectacle if any saw their own party prevailing they grew at once exalted and immedi ately began an invocation to the gods that the efforts of their friends might be crowned wich success whilst another party beholding those who were vanquished uttered a loud shriek which ended in a groan  and by the sight of such affecting turns were more subdued in spirit than those who were actually engaged in this medley of horror Others farther who were intent upon a quarter of the engagement where the event was yet in suspense and no judgement amidst such confu sion could be formed adjusted the contortions of their bodies to their own inward fears and passed that inter val in extremity of anguilh  for each single moment they were within a little ot escaping or being sunk And thus in one and the same army of Athenians so long as the event was under decision a whole medley of l  S 3 noises 262 THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR B VII noises was heard together ‚ Jkrieking‚ shouting‚ victory ‚ undone I ‚ undone ‚ and all other sounds of various import which in such extremity of danger a nume rous body of men may be forced to utter Those farther on board were equally sensible of all the quick alternatives of passion till at last after the battle had for a long time been obstinately maintained the Syracusans and allies put the Athenians to open flight and plying briskly in the chace with obstrepe rous clamour and loud exultations drove them upon the beach And here the land soldiers which had served on board excepting such as had been taken in the deep er water leaping in all parts as they severally could on the shore run in great confusion for shelter to the diversified but with one and the same uniform vehe mence having expressed their resentment of the horrible conclusion by a loud skriek and a hearty groan some hurried along the beach to succour the shipping others todesend what yet remained of their intrenchments whilst a third party and the bulk of the army confined their whole care to themselves and were solely intent on their own personal preservation The horrid consterna tion in which this moment they were universally plun ged was greater than Athenians had ever felt before They suffered now what on a former occasion they had made others sufser at Pylus There the Laced√ monians having first lost their fleet had the farther mortification to see all their gallant Spartans in the island undone And now the desperate condition of the Athenians offered no glimmering of sasety on the land unless some miracu lous contingency should take place in their favour After an engagement so hardy and well disputed as ter the sinking of a large number of ships and the death of numbers on both sides the Syracusans and their al lies who were masters of the day took up the shatters and the dead This being done they sailed in triumph to the city and erected a trophy  But B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 263 But the Athenians quite funk with the weight of their present misfortunes never so much as once en tertained the thought of recovering their mattered ves sels Or their dead but were contriving how to decamp by favour of the approaching night Demosthenes upon this repairing to Nicias declared it as his own Opinion that  manning at once the whole number  of their vessels they mould exert their utmost efforts M to force their passage out of the harbour early the next dawn affirming that they had still a larger number of shipping fit for service than the enemy For the Athenians had yet about sixty left whereas those of the enemy were under fifty Nicias came into the proposal but when both joined in issuing pro per orders for the execution the seamen flatly resused to go on board Dispirited as they were by the last great blow they had resigned all hope of ever beating these enemies again No measure now remained but a retreat by land on which the universal attention was hence forth employed Hermocrates the Syracusan had conceived a suspi cion that such a step would be taken by them and foreseeing what difficulties might arise if so large an ar my should march across the country and posting themselves afresh onSicilian ground should again resume their spirits and renew the war against Syracuse he wai ted upon those in authority and suggested to them that they odght not by any rales of policy to let the e nemy steal off by night inserting here his own senri  ments of the affair but that all the Syraeusans and  their allies sallying out in a body should pre occupy  and secure the roads and in good time beset and put  strong guards in all the passes The magistrates were sensible as much as he who gave this advice how reasonable it was and declared themselves forks execu tion But then  the men who now indulging their joy for the late victory were intent on recreations and as besides it was a festival time for this very S 4   day 264 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII day they were performing the anniversary sacrifice to  Hercules in all probability would refuse to march  because transported as they were with success the generality no doubt were celebrating the sestival with good cheer and wine and any thing might sooner be  hoped from them than obedience to an order for ta king up their arms and sallying forth at a minute s notice As the magistrates were convinced that things would so turn out the scheme was judged im practicable and Hermocrates could in no wife prevail But he thought of an artifice to play off against the foe Afraid lest the Athenians dislodging quietly by night might possess themselves of the most difficult passes be fore any opposition could reach them he dispatcheth some of his most trusty friends under an efcorte of horse to the Athenian camp so soon as it was dark who ri ding up so near to the intrenchments that their words might be distinctly heard and calling out aloud on some persons to come forth since they were a party sent from his friends in Syracuse to bring Nicias some intelli gence charged them to carry word immediately to Ni cias u by no means to draw off the army by night because the Syracusans had beset the roads but to  defer his march till day light when he had leisure to  make the proper dispositions And after delivering this message they rode off whilst those who received it went and reported it faithfully to the Athenian generals Wrought upon by this piece of intelligence in which they were far from suspecting any fraud they continued all night in their posts and then as they had not dis lodged at once in a hurry they thought it adviseable to stay there but one day longer that the soldiers might pack up and carry away with them as large a part as was possible of their necessary stores The rest of the baggage it was agreed should be abandoned to the enemy they were only to carry off each person for himself what was absolutely necessary for food and raiment ‚ But B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 265 Bur in this interval the Syracusans and Gyljppus by sallying out with the land forces had gained a march before them had blocked up the roads along the coun try by which it was judged the Athenians would march and had posted strong guards upon all the fords of brooks and rivers nay their detachments stood ready drawn up in battalia to beat off the enemy from the most con venient passes Standing out farther into the harbour with their fleet they dragged from the shore the Athe nian shipping Some few of these they burnt as the Athenians themselves had designed to do but the resi due at their leisure from the pot where each lay stran ded they took in tow and carried away to the city And this being done when Nicias and Demosthenes judged that they had completed such preparations for their march as were absolutely needful the dislodge nient of the whole army was put in execution on the third day from the naval engagement Terrible indeed it was not only when viewed in one particular light as that they retreated because they had lost the whoie of their fleer and all their mighty hopes had terminated in such personal dangers to themselves and such as even boded the ruin of Athens but the ve ry abandoning of the camp presented to their fight the most cutting spectacles and struck each foul amongst them with heart piercing anguish For as the dead lay uninterred upon the surface of the earth when the re mains of m old acquaintance thus miserably laid out arrested the eyes of a soldier he was instantly seized with regret and horror But the living who on account of wounds and sickness were left behind were causes of much greater affliction to the found than were even the dead and in truth were much more to be deplored than those who had no longer a being For bursting out into prayers and lamentations they occasioned a wild irresolution of thought earnestly intreating that they might not be left behind and screaming out aloud on each by name as they saw a friend or an acquaintance 266 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII or an old comrade moving off throwing their arms about their necks and fo dragged along whilst they could keep their hold but when strength and bodily vigour tailed and left them destitute or resource they gave them the last adieu not without a shower of cur ses and a hideous howl By such cutting incidents the whole army was silled with tears and a wild irresolution fo that they could not depart without the highest regret though from a spot so hostile where they had suffered more than tears could alleviate and the dread of more which yet might be impending was inexpressible De jection of the head and self accusation were general through all the troops and they resembled nothing less than a large subjugated city whose numerous inhabi tants were escaping from the fury of a sack for the a mountof those who were now marching off together was not less than forty thousand men Of these the generality carried off merely what ne cessary subsistence they had scraped together but the heavy armed and horsemen contrary to custom were now obliged to carry their own sustenance themselves beneath their armour some because they had none others because they durst not trust their servants The desertions had for a long time been large but of late in greater numbers than ever Neither were they thus provided with susficient stores for there was no longer any corn to be found in the camp Nay truly the general calamity and equability of misfortunes which in many cafes alleviate the pain as numbers are in volved were unable to render the present evils in any degree supportable especially when the thought oc curred srom what a height of splendor and preceding glory to what a plunge and miserable state they were now reduced For a most cruel turn of fortune this really proved to a Grecian army who coming hither to inflave others were departing now with the fad al ternative of fearing to be made slaves themselves and instead of the prayers and p√ ans with which they first began B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 267 began the voyage were now dislodging with omens that portended nothing but misery Those farther who came hither as lords of the ocean were now stealing away by land from henceforth to be saved not by naval skill but the perseverance of a land army How ever ail these reflexions put their patience nothing on the stretch in comparison of that weight of misery which this very instant was hovering over their heads Nicias perceiving the whole army to be overwhelmed in despair and sunk in this plunge of distress addressed himself severally to the troops exhorted and com forted by every topic which occurred each single party whom he visited by turns elevating his voice far beyond the ordinary pitch to suit the earnestness of his heart in hope that the louder he spoke the more extensive effect it might have upon the hearers EVEN yet and in the present low ebb of our  fortune my dear countrymen and consederates we  ought to encourage hope Instances may be given of armies who have been rescued from a deeper  plunge of dangers than that which is now our por  tion Nor ought you to torture yourselves with too  painful regret at what you suffer or at the unme  rited miseries which this moment environ you abour Even I myself who have much less room to boast of a constitution superior to hardships than the meanest soldier in your ranks for your own eyes can witness  to how low a state my bodily infirmities have redu ced me who however in the continued happi  ness of my former course of lise or in any other re  gard am inserior to none amongst you ‚ yet am  bufseted now by the storms and outrages of fortune  as cruelly as ever were the vilest and most abject of  my sellow creatures It is true I have ever habitu ally worshipped the gods with a conscientious de ference to established laws and have made justice  and beneficence to man the constant practice of my V   life 268 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII life Upon the strength of this when I look for  wards to the future my mind is enlivened with invi gorating hope though I own these misfortunes so  far undeserved strike no little terror on my thoughts But better times perhaps may be ap  proaching for sure our enemies have been blessed i with an ample measure of success and though some  deity may have frowned at first on this our expedi  tion yet by this time his wrath must be fully wreaked upon us We are not the first instance of a people  who have wantonly invaded the possessions of ano ther many such offences have taken their rife from the impulse of human passions and have been pu  nished with such a measure of vengeance as human nature was able to endure Good reason therefore  have we now to hope for a milder fate from the of fended deity who depressed as we are seem objects of compassion more than of resentment Cast there  fore your eyes on the fine bodies of heavy armed and the goodly numbers which even now compose  your retreat and let the sight revive and cheer your drooping spirits Conclude that wherever you choose to halt you areof yourselves that instant a mighty com  munity

individual amongst your ranks made warm and ear  nest by the thought ‚ that on whatever spot you may be compelled to fight on that if crowned with victory you regain a country and a bulwark of your own But then our march must be continued both day  and night with unabating speed because our stock of provision is but scanty and can we but reach some friendly territory belonging to the Siculi who from their excessive diead of the Syracusans will ever preserve their attachment to us conclude yourselves that moment to be beyond the reach of danger   Send B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 269 Send therefore your messengers beforehand to them with orders to meet us on our route and bring us the needful supplies of food On the whole myfellow soldiers rest assured that the last necessity injoins you to be resolutely brave since to cowardice now no place of shelter is any longer open and only if you stem the efforts of your foes‚ can you again be happy in the enjoyment of those scenes your eyes so fondly regret arid can Athenians re erect the extensive pow er of the Athenian State how low soever it may be fallen at present For they are men who make a State not wails nor hips by men abandoned  With these words of encouragement Nicias ran regu larly through all the ranks of the whole army careful at the same time if he saw any parties strangling from the main body and quitting the order of the march to fetch them up and replace them Demostnenes exerted himself as diligently in his own department encoura ging his troops with the same energy and ardour of ad dress The body under Nicias drawn up in a square led the van of the march that under Demosthenes brought up the rear whilst the baggage men and the numerous crowd that attended the camp marched with in the center of the heavy armed When they were advanced to the place of fording the Anapus they find a body of Syracusans and allies drawn up in battalia there to oppose the passage But putting these to flight they gained the passage of that river and advanced into the country beyond though their march was terribly harrassed by the incursions of the Syracusan horse and by the missive weapons which the light armed of the enemy poured in from time to time amongst them And yet in this day s march the A ihenians wrought about  forty stadia and halted for the night upon an eminence    About sour miles On 27o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI On the ensuing day by early dawn they were again in motion and advanced about f twenty stadia when descending into a certain plain they halted and formed an incampment Thrir design in this was to fetch in some provisions for the adjacent country was inhabited and to get a proper supply of water to carry along with them far in the country beyond through which their route was fixed no springs were to be met with for the Jength of several stadia But during this halt the Sy racuiansv advancing beyond them throw up a work a cross their route to stop their fartheir progress The spot chosen for this was a strong eminence Banked on both sides by an inaccessible crag and known by the name of Acr√ um Lepas On the day following the Athenians resumed their march but the horse and numerous darters of the Sy raculans and allies stopped their advance the latter pouring in their weapons upon and the former riding up and disordering their ranks For a long time it is true the Athenians maintained the skirmishes against them i but at length they retreated again to their last in campment And now all farther supplies of provisions were totally cut off it being no longer possible to fetch i¬ a ny for fear of the horle But decamping early in the morning they continued their march and forced their progress to the eminence which was fortified by the new work Here they found the Syracusan infantry drawn up before them in firm and deep battalia posted also on the strong eminence they had occupied on purpose for the pals was very narrow The Athenians marched up and assaulted the work but being pelted by showers of darts from the emi nence which was very steep and so gave those upon k a great advantage in throwing their weapons home and finding themselves unable to force it they again drew off and attempted it no farther It happened at the f Two miles fame B V1I THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 271 fame time that some claps of thunder were heard ac companied with rain esfects not unusual in this season as the year was now in autumn and yet these accidents contributed still more to dispirit the Athenians who con cluded that every thing now acted in combination for their destruction During this interval of inaction Gvt lippus and the Syracusans send off a detachment of their forces to throw up a work in their rear where the enemy had already pasted But the Athenians sent also a detachment of their own body which prevented its execution and after this wheeling off with their whole body more into the plains they halted there for the night The next morning they began to move forwards a gain And now the Syracusans besetting them quite round in a circle poured vollies os darts and arrows amongst them and wounded numbers If indeed the Athenians sallied out against them they retreated but when the Athenians drew back they then pressed upon their retreat i and falling in chiefly amongst their rear if at any time they put small parties to flight they struck a consternation into the whole army But for a long time in such a train of skirmishings the Athe nians made good their ground and advancing after wards the kogth of five or six stadia they halted in a plain Here also the Syracusans no longer molested them but withdrew to their own camp This night it was determined by Nicias and Demos thenes that ‚ since the army was reduced to so low a condition and began already to be pressed with a total failure of provisions since farther large numbers had been wounded in the many incidental assaults of the enemy  ‚ they stiould first kindle a great number of fires and then march the whole army off no longer by the route which they had first projected but by another towards the sea quite contrary to that which the Syra cusans had already preoccupied and guarded The re  About I a milt  sidue 37 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VltJ sidue of the march was no longer pointed towards Ca tana but to the other coast of Sicily towards Cama rina and Gela and the cities in that quarter both Gre cian and Barbarian In pursuance of this a large num ber of fires being kindled they dislodged in the dead of night This part of their retreat as is the general fate of ar mies but especially of the greatest ever subject to fears and panics particularly when moving in the night and on hostile ground and conscious farther that the enemy is close at their heels was made in a fad and disorderly manner The column indeed under Ni cias which composed the van kept firm together in a body and quite out matched the rest of the army but that under Demosthenes being one half at least if not the major part of the whole force was separated from the van and came on in great confusion and disorder However by the dawn of day they reach the coast and gaining the great road which is called the Helorine took their route along it that after they had reached the river Cacyparis they might pierce upwards along the course of that river into the heart of the country for thus they hoped to meet with the Siculi whom they had summoned to be ready on their route But when they had gained the fight of that river they found its banks already occupied by a Syracusan guard busy in throwing up a rampart and palisado to defend its pas sage This party they soon dispersed and passed the river and from thence advanced towards another river the Erineus for thus their guides had planned their route In the mean time the Syracusans and allies when the day was clearly broke and they knew the Athenians were stole off began in general to throw heavy impu tations on Gylippus as if the Athenians had made their escape through his connivance Yet beginning the pursuit with all possible expedition and it was easily discoverable what route they had taken they come up with B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 273 with them about the hour of repast And as they sett in first with the column under the orders of Demosthe nes which composed the rear and had moved in a more flow and disorderly manner than the van because the darkness of the night had so highly incommoded and confounded their march they immediately charged them and fought The Syracusan cavalry beset them quite round the more easily indeed as they were se parated from the van and drove them into one crouded heap But the column under Nicias was now  fifty stadia before them for Nicias led them forwards with great celerity concluding that their sasety consisted not in lingering voluntarily at so critical a period or expo sing themselves to an engagement but in pushing for wards with their utmost speed and fightingonly when by absolute necessity they were compelled to fight But then Demosthenes was involved in a much more labo rious and continued toil because as he filed off last the enemies were left upon his rear and soon con vinced that they had begun the pursuit he was obli ged not so much to move forward as to draw up his troops in the order of battle till by such necessitated lingering he is environed by them and himself and the body of Athenians under him are thrown into high tu mult and confusion For now hemmed in as they were on a certain spot surrounded quite round by walls and whence the issues both on one side and the other were full of olive trees they were terribly galled on their flanks by the darts of the enemy This kind of annoyance the Syracuians wisely chose to give them and to decline all close engagement because to hazard the latter against enemies now become quite desperate they judged would make more for the advantage of the A thenians than of themselves Though at the same time a kind of frugality inspired by the great career of suc cess they had already obtained taught them not to ex haust their strength on superfluous encounters and per  Above five miles Vol IL T fuaded 2 4 THE FE LOPONNESIAN WAlt B VII suaded them that thus they might effectually subdtte and ftfre for the whole remainder of the day they had galled them on all fides with missive weapons and now perceived that the Athenians and their allies were re duced to a miserable plight by the wounds which they had received and the other calamities which lay hard vp6n them Gylippus in concert With the Syracusatfs arid allies causeth a herald to proclaim ‚ First that  such inhabitants of the isles as would come over to  them should rest in the secure enjoyment of their h  berty   upon which some cities though not many went over to them  ‚ And in the next place after ibme time a surrender is agreed on of the whole body of troops commanded by Demosthenes on the rerms that  they mould deliver up their arms and  no one should suffer death either by public execu  tion or the miseries of a prison or the want of ste  cessary subsistence Thus this whole body to thb number of six thousand men surrendered themselves prisoners and produced all the silver they ha d about them which they were commanded to throw into the hollows of shields four of which in this manner were filled full with spoil and these prisoners the victors immediately led away to Syracuse But Nicias and the column under his cdWimand ar rived the same day on the banks of the Erineus and having passed that river halted on an eminence The day following the Syracusans coming up to his post notified to Nicias that  those under Demosthenes had surrendered and summoned him to follow their example Incredulous of the fact he begs leave to Tend out a horseman to discover the truth who upon his return affirming that  they had actually soften  dered Nicias fends an intimation to Gylippus and the Syracusans that he was ready to stipulate in the name of the Athenians that  whatever sums she Sy ¬ racusans had expended in t h s war should be fairly  reimburfedj  B VII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 275  reimbursed on condition the forces under his com mand might have free departure bur till the mo ney could be paid he would leave with them a num  ber of Athenians as hostages for performance a maa  for a talent Gylippus and the Syracusans refused the offer and resuming offensive measures ranged their parties quite round the eminence and poured in their missive wea pons upon them till the evening This body of troops was also sadly distressed for wane of bread and necessary subsistence Watching however for the dead and si lent hours of the night they were then determined to continue their march They accordingly take up their arms the Syracusans perceive it and sing the p√ an of alarm The Athenians were thus convinced that they could not dislodge without being discovered and so grounded their arms again all but one party of three hundred men for these having forced themselves a passage through the guards made off in the night as fast as it was possible So soon as the day appeared Nicias at the head of his troops led them forwards But the Syracusans and allies pressed upon him on all sides in the usual manner pouring in vollies of darts and javelins The Atheni ans made the best of their way to reach the river Assina rus not only because annoyed on all sides by the ir ruption of the numerous cavalry and skirmishing par ties they concluded they should be eated of these could they once pass that river but also through bodily fa tigue and a vehement desire to extinguish their thirst When therefore they are upon the bank they rush into the river no longer observant of order but each single soldier intent on passing the first of the army And the enemy who now prefled hard upon them had rendered the passage already a business of toil For obli ged as they were to go down in confused heaps they fell and trampled upon one another some embarrassed by their spears and luggage met with instant destruction T 2 others 76 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII others entangled in the croud were carried away by the current The hither bank of the river was now rilled with Syracusans and it being naturally steep they poured down their darts upon the Athenians numbers of whom were drinking greedily of the stream confu sedly hampered together in the hollow of the channel The Peloponnesians plunging in after them made a great slaughter of those who were in the river The water was immediately discoloured with blood But the stream polluted with mud and gore deterred them not from drinking it greedily nor many of them from fight ing desperately for a draught of it But in short when the carcases of the dead began to lie heaped one upon another in the river and the whole army was become a continued carnage of some in the river of those who were making off from the banks by the horsemen of the foe Nicias surrenders himself prisoner to Gylip pus into whose power he chose to fall sooner than into that of the Syracusans He told him that  he him  self and the Laced√ monians might decide his fate as  best pleased themselves but intreated that a stop  might be put to the slaughter of his soldiers Upon this Gylippus issued out orders to give quarter and thus they carried off the remnants of this body as pri soners of war such excepted as were secreted by their captors the number of which was large Having far ther detached a party in pursuit of the three hundred who in the night had broke through the guard they also made them prisoners The whole number now collected together as the public prize was not large but very numerous were they who were clandestinely secreted Not a town in Sicily but was crouded with them fince these had not surrendered upon terms like thole under Demosthenes A considerable number had also perished For this was a terrible slaughter nay there was no one greater in the course of the Sicilian  According to DUderut Siculus the number of the slain amounted to eightttn thousand men war B VlI THE PELOPONNESlAN WAR 277 War And in the preceding skirmishes which had hap pened very frequently during the march not a few had been slain Yet notwithstanding all this many made their escape some from the scenes of action and others from their prisons from whence they afterwards gained an opportunity to run away These repaired to Catana as a safe resort And now the Syracusans and allies in one grand col lective body having amassed together as large a num ber of prisoners as they possibly could and all the spoils returned in triumph to Syracuse The bulk of pri soners whether of the Athenians or their confederates whom they had taken they thrust down into the quar ries concluding that from such a confinement they could not possibly make escapes but Nicias and De mosthenes in spite of all the remonstrances of Gylip pus they butchered For Gylippus imagined that the finishing of this war would invest himself with pre eminent degrees of glory if besides the rest of his at chievements he could carry home to the Laced√ mo nians the generals of the enemy It had farther la happened that one of these that is Demosthenes was regarded as their most inveterate enemy because of his exploits against them in the island Sphacteria and Pylus and the other Nicias as their most sincere well wisher from his behaviour on those very inci dents For Nicias had strenuously exerted himself in behalf of those Laced√ monians who were made pri soners in the island It was he who prevailed with the Athenians to sign the treaty in pursuance of which they were released For such services done them the Lace d√ monians had a kindness for him and it had been chiefly owing to his assurance of this that he surren dered himself prisoner to Gylippus But a party of the Syracusans as was generally reported fearful because they had kept up a correspondence with him lest if put to the torture he might now amidst the general prosperity involve them in trouble j others also and T 3 hot 78 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VII not least of all the Corinthians lest as he was rich he might purchase the connivance of his keepers to get his liberty and then again might have influence enough to foment fresh stirs to their prejudice obtained the con currence of their allies and put him to death For these or reasons most nearly neighbouring to these was Nicias doomed to destruction ‚ though the man of all the Grecians in the present age who least deserved so wretched a catastrophe since his whole life was one uniform series of piety towards the Deity As for those who were doomed to the quarries the Syracusans treated them at first with outrageous seve rity As great numbers were crouded together in this hollow dungeon the beams of the fun in the first place and then the suffocating air annoyed them in a more terrible manner because the aperture was left unco vered and each succeeding night the reverse of the preceding day autumnal and nipping through such vicissitudes threw them into strange disorders Thus straitened as they were for room they did whatever they had to do on one and the same spot and the car cases of those who died lay heaped up promiscuously to gether as some expired of their wounds and others perished through the viciflitudes of air they suffered or some other such deadly cause At length the stench be came intolerably noisome and they were farther op pressed with hunger and thirst i For during the space of eight months the allowance to each was only a  co tyl of water and two J cotyls of bread a day Nay whatever species of misery numbers cooped up in ib close a confinement might be liable to suffer not one of these but pressed cruelly upon them They were all thus thronged and dieted together for seventy days But after this term all but the

proved to be the greatest Grecian exploit of all that happened in the course of this war and in my opinion of all that oc cur in the whole history of Greece since the event to the victors was most glorious and to the vanquished most calamitous For in every respect they were totally overpowered and their miseries in no respect had any mitigation i In short root and branch as is commonly said their land armies and their shipping Were now ru ined 5 nay nothing belonging to them was exempted from destruction and few out of all their numbers had the good fortune to revisit their native country Such were the transactions in Sicily  ¬  The decent and engaging behaviour of the Athenians was of great service to them  for by it they either soon obtained their liberty or were highly esteemed and caressed by their masters Some of them were indebted for their freedom to Euripides The Sicilians it seems were fonder of the muse of Euripides tharf were even the people who lived in Greece itself If the strangers who were often resorting to Sicily brought them any specimens or morsels of his poetry they ‚ learned them by heart and with high delight communicated them to their friends It is said that several who by this means earned their liberty went afterwards to wait upon Euripides in token of their gratitude assuring him some of ihtm that they had been released from slavery for teaching their masters what pieces of his writing they were able to repeat j and others that when vagabonds after the ¬ defeat they had been supplied with meat and drink sot singing some of his lines This is not to be wondeted at since even a Caunian vessel which brihg hard chased by pirates and endeavouring to get for refuge into a Sicilian harbour was however kept off by force till at length being asked whether they could repeat ‚ any of Euripides s Verses they answered in the affirmative upon which they obJ tained immediate reception and refuge Plutarch in the Life of Nicias

news was reported at Athens no be lief tor a long time was given ‚ even though the most creditable part of the soldiery who had made their es cape from this disastrous business proved it by a cir cumstantial relation ‚ that so total a destruction was become their lot But no sooner were they convinced of its reality than their resentments burst forth against those of the orators who had advised and recommended the expedition as if their own suffrages had never con curred to its execution They farther vented their gall against those retailers of oracles and foretellers of future events against all in general who pretending privity  P utarcb from report tells an odd story on this occasion ‚ A stranger wh it seems had come ashore at the Pir√ us and had set him down in a bar ber s hop began to talk about the overthrow in Sicily as of a point well known at Athens The barber hearing it before any other person had the  news ran with all speed up into the city and having first informed the magistrates of it spread the report in an instant all over the forum Consterna tion and tumult at once ensued The magistrates convened an assembly of the  people and produced the barber before them He was called upon to tell from whom he had the news and when he could not name the person being looked ‚ upon as an idle fellow and a disturber of the public peace he was immediately  tied upon the wheel and a long time whirled round upon it till several per  sons arrived who gave a minute and circumstantial account of the whole Life of Niciat  to 282 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII to the will of heaven had elevated their hopes with the certain conquest of Sicily On all sides now all manner of disasters environed them about and never had A thens been thrown into so great a consternation and de jection as at the present juncture For now beside what each private family suffered as the public at the fame time had lost the bulk of its heavy armed and horsemen and that flower of its youth which they saw it impossible to replace they were sorely dejected Con scious farther that they had not shipping sufficient in their docks for a fresti equipment nor money in the public treasury nor even hands to man what vessels they had left they gave up all hope of deliverance in the present plunge Their enemies from Sicily they i magined would soon enter the Pir√ us with a powerful navy especially as they were flushed with such a career of success and their enemies nearer home would now for a certainty redouble their preparations and with the utmost resolution fall upon them at once both by sea and land and be farther strengthened by the re volt of their own temporising confederates At last however they agreed it was their duty to do what might yet be done not basely to abandon their own preier vation but to fit out a navy by collecting from all possible resources both timber and money ‚ and timely to secure their own dependent States above all Eub≈ a ‚ and to reduce the expences of the civil administration with all possible ceconomy ‚ and to lodge the sove reignty in the hands of a select body of old experienced statesmen whose maturer counsels might if possible yet extricate the State from its present misfortunes Such an effect had the general consternation now upon them an effect not unusual with a peepk that they became heartily disposed to order their government aright And as to such resolutions they came they proceeded farther to put them in execution And the summer ended In B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 283 In the beginning of the ensuing winter animated by the terrible blow the Athenians had received in Sicily the whole body of Greece was alert against them li ven such as had hitherto observed a strict neutrality without so much as waiting for a formal invitation to accede thought it incumbent upon themselves no longer to be absent from the war but voluntarily to enter the lists against the Athenians Not a State but reasoned thus ‚ that  themselves also these Athenians had they succeeded in Sicily would undoubtedly have attack ed and then concluded ‚ that  as the war for  certainty was very nearly finished it would be glo  rious for them to have a hand in its completion But the old confederates of the Laced√ monians as their desires were greater so they exerted themselves now with higher alacrity than ever to procure a speedy relax ation of their heavy burdens Yet in a most remarka ble manner such States as were dependent upon Athens manifested their readiness to revolt even beyond the bounds of caution since now they formed their judge ments in all the warmth of indignation and could dis cern no probable method by which the Athenians could retard their ruin for another summer All these circumstances coinciding the Laced√ mo7 nian state became prodigiously alert and above all with the expectation that their confederates of Sicily with a powerful reinforcement as their navies must now of necessity act in concert would be with them in all probability very early in the spring In every view their hopes were gallant and elate They determined to go on with the war without any delay concluding that if once brought well to a conclusion they should ever for the future be released from such dangers as had lately threatened from Athens in case Sicily had been reduced and should they now demolish their competi tors must remain for the future supreme leaders of Greece without fear of a reverse Instantly 284 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VHL Instantly therefore Agis their king though in the depth of winter sallying forth with a body of troops from Decelea marched round the confederacy levying sums of money for the service of the marine Turning his route to the Melian gulf he took a large booty from the CE t√ ans against whom their enmity had been of long dura tion which he converted into money He also compel led those Ach√ answho were seated in the Pthiotis and other States in this quarter dependent on Theslaly spite of all the complaints and murmurs of the Thessalians to give him some hostages for their good behaviour and to furnish him with money He disposed of these hostages into safe custody at Corinth and spared no pains to get them over into the alliance The Laced√ monians farther circulated an order among the States for the building of one hundred fail of ships They taxed themselves and the B≈ otians to furnish respectively twenty five ‚ the Phocians and Locrians fifteen the Corinthians fifteen the Arca dians and Pellenians and Sicyonians ten the Me gareans and Trcezenians and Epidaurians and Her mionians ten They went to work with all other needful preparations that they might prosecute the war briskly upon the first approach of spring The Athenians on the other hand were not remiss in preparing for their own defence since in pursuance of the plan they had formed they were busy during all the winter in building of ships having collected proper quantities of timber and in fortifying Sunium that the navigation of their victuallers round that cape might be preserved from molestation They also evacuated the fortress in Laconia which they had raised in the voyage to Sicily and in all respects where they jud ged themselves involved in any less needful expence they contracted their disbursements with the utmost fru gality But their principal care was keeping a close eye upon their dependents that they might not revolt Amidst B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 285 Amidst these employments of both parties which were nothing less than most earnest preparations on all sides as if war was just in its commencement the Eu b≈ ans took the lead and sent embassadors this winter to treat with Agis about a revolt from the Athenians Agis accepted what terms they proposed and sends for Alcamenes the son of Sthenelai das and Melanthus frorrr Laced√ mon to pass over as commanders into Eubcea Accordingly they arrived with a body of ci tizens newly infranchised to the number of about three hundred and Agis was preparing for their transporta tion But in this interval the Lesbians arrived with declarations of their readiness to revolt and as they were seconded by the recommendations of the B≈ otians Agis is persuaded to put off for a time the affair of Eu bcea and began to expedite the revolt of the Lesbians having assigned them Alcamenes for their governor who was to have passed over to Eub≈ a The B≈ otians promised to send them ten ships and Agis ten These points were transacted without the privity of the Lace d√ monian State For Agis so long as he continued at Decelea having under his command the army of the State was invested with a power of sending detachments whithersoever he thought proper and to levy men and money at his own discretion and it may with truth be affirmed that the confederates during this period paid a much greater deference to him than to the State of Laced√ mon for having a power ful force under his own orders he was formidable in his every motion And thus he arbitrarily settled the ne gotiation of the Lesbians But then the Chians and the Erythr√ ans who were also desirous to revolt addressed themselves not to A gis but at Laced√ mon In their company also went thither an embassador from Tissaphernes who was lieu tenant for Darius the son of Anaxerxes in the mari  Neodamodes time 286 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII time provinces of Asia Even Tissaphernes concerned himself now to inflame the Peloponnesian ardour and promised them larpe supplies For lately he had been summoned by the king to make returns of the revenue of his government which not being able to exact from the Grecian cities because of the Athenians he was run into a large arrear He concluded therefore that could he demolish the Athenians he then with great ease might levy the tributes what is more might make the Laced√ monians confederates to the king and might at length convey to him either aiive or dead Amor ges the bastard son of Pissuthnes who had revolted in Caria as the king had expressly commanded The Chians therefore and Tissaphernes were now nego tiating this point in concert Calligitus the son of Laophon a Megarean and Ti magoras the son of Athenagoras a Cyzicene both ex iles from their native places and refuged with Phar nabazus the son of Pharnabacus arrive at Laced√ mon about the same point of time commissioned by Pharna bazus to procure an aid of hipping for the Hellespont by which he might be enabled the very same thing as Tissaphernes desired to work the revolt of the cities within his district from the Athenian obedience be cause of the tributes and expeditioufly to gain for him self the credit of having procured for his master the al liance of the Laced√ monians As the agents of Phar nabazus and those also of Tissaphernes were negotiating the same point though apart from each other a great de bate arose among the statesmen at Laced√ mon one party insisting with vehemence that an aid of shipping  and a land force should be sent toTonia and Chios an other party that they should be sent first to Hellespont The Laced√ monians however complied by far the soon est with the demands of the Chians and Tissaphernes Al cibiades indeed espoused the cause of the latter from an extraordinary zeal to mark hereditary friendship toEn dius whoat thisjuncturepresided in thecollege oiEfbori B VIII THE PELOP0NNES1AN WAR a87 On this account it was that the family of Alcibiades in compliment to this friendship had taken a Laced√ mo nian name for this Endius was the son of an Alcibiades Yet previously the Laced√ monians dispatched Phry nis a person born and educated in those parts to Chi os to inspect the state of afsairs there and report whe ther they had so large a number of stripping as they pretended and their situation in other respects equali zed the fine account they had given of it Accordingly when Phrynis had reported  that all the accounts they had heard were true the Chians and Erythr√ ans were instantly admitted allies They voted far ther to fend them forty sail of shipping as there were already assembled at Chios not fewer than sixty from places which the Chians named Ten of these they de signed to dispatch as soon as possible under the com mand of Melanchridas who was appointed admiral But afterwards the shock of an earthquake being felt instead of Melanchridas they sent Chalcideus and in stead of ten equipped in Laconia only five ships for this service Here the winter ended and the nineteenth year of this war came also to an end of which Thucydides hath compiled the history YEAR XX J SUMMER now coming on as the Chians were most earnestly soliciting the dispatch of the ships and also afraid lest the Athenians should get notice of their transactions ‚ for the whole of the negotiation had been carried on without the knowledge of the latter ‚ the Laced√ monians fend to Corinth three citizens of Spar ra to prevail with that State for the transportation of their ships with all possible expedition across the isthmus  Before Cbiist 412 from a88 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII from the other sea into that which lies towards Athens that all in a body might stand away for Chios as well those which Agis had destined for the service of Lesbos as the rest The whole number of shipping belonging to the alliance now assembled together there amount ed to thirty nine But Calligitus truly and Timagoras refused in the name of Pharnabazus to have any participation in the expedition to Chios nor would part with the money they had brought with them which was  five and twenty talents to disburse this equipment They in tended to get another fitted out which should sail away under their own orders As for Agis when now he perceived that the Lace d√ monians were determined to go first to Chios he no longer suffered his own projects to clash with those of the State but the confederates now assembling at Corinth proceeded to draw up a plan of operations It was ac cordingly agreed that they should go first to Chios under the command of Chalcideus who fitted out the five ships in Laconia from thence to Lesbos under the command of Alcamenes whom Agis had destined for that service in the last place they should proceed to Hellespont and in this service it was agreed before hand that Clearchus the son of Ramphias should take upon him the command But the first step should be the transportation of a moiety of their shipping across the isthmus which were immediately to stand out to sea that the attention of the Athenians might be less engaged upon such as were already in their course than on those which were to follow for now they determi ned to cross the sea in an open insulting manner as they contemned the present impotence of the Athenians because they had no considerable force any where at sea When these resolutions were formally completed they immediately transported one and twenty ships  4845 151 Sterling Expeditious B VIIT THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 289 Expeditious sailing was earnestly solicited but the Co rinthians declared a reluctancy to go the voyage till they had celebrated the Isthmian games which were at hand To remove this obstacle Agis declared him self ready to have the whole procedure charged to his own account that they might be cleared from a breach of the Isthmian cessation The Corinthians not com plying with this proposal and delay necessarily result ing from it the Athenians gained by this an earlier dis covery of the negotiation of the Chians and dispatch ing Aristocrates one of their generals charged them openly with the guilt of such a procedure The Chi ans as strenuously denying the charge they commanded them to send away their shipping forthwith to Athens by way of pledge for their safety The Chians accordingly sent seven But the detach ment of these was intirely owing to the popular party of that island who had been kept in utter ignorance of the late negotiation The few who were privy to it had no mind to incur the popular resentment before they were enabled to stem its fury especially as now they had resigned all hope of the arrival of the Pelopon nesians whose motions were exceeding dilatory In the mean time the Isthmian games were solem nized j and at these the Athenians who had the regu lar invitation sent them assisted in form The practices of the Chians became here more apparent to them than ever No sooner therefore were they returned to A thens than they put all the needful expedients in rea diness to prevent the squadron which was to fail from Cenchre√ from passing undiscovered When the festival was over the latter with one and twenty fail under the command of Alcamenes stood out to sea in order for Chios And the Athenians ad vancing against them at first with an equal number os ships stood off again into open sea j but when the Pcloponnesians would not follow them far but stood in to the land the Athenians disappeared for having Vol II U amongst 2 90 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIlI amongst their number the seven ships of the Chians they thought it not safe to trust them But having af terwards manned out others to the amount of thirty seven they drive the enemy along the coast into Pira us of the Corinthians This is a desart harbour and the last upon the confines of Epidauria One hip In deed which the enemy came up with at sea the Pelo ponnesians lost but all the rest they draw together to a station Within the harbour Here the Athenians at tacked them on the water with their ships and by land with a party sent purposely on shore The attack was attended with great confusion and carried on in a disorderly manner The party of the Athenians which attacked from the land disable the bulk of the squa dron and kill the commander Alcamenes some also of their own people perished in the action But when the dispute was ended they posted a sufficient number of their ships to lie facing those of the enemy and with the remainder anchor near a little ifle on which as it lay at a small distance they form ah incampment and send away to Athens for a reinforcement In favour of the Pelopohnesians came up on the day following not only the Corinthians but soon after a num ber also of others from the adjacent country in aid of the squadron who perceiving that the preservation of it would be a work of laborious toil on so desart a coast were sadly perplexed Some argued vehement ly for setting the ships on fire but at length it was concluded to draw them ashore and incamping with their land forces round them to guard them from the enemy till some convenient opportunity should offer of getting them away Agis also when informed of their situation sent to them Thermo a citizen of Sparta To the Laced√ monians the first advice that had been sent was this ‚ that  the squadron had set sail from the  isthmus for orders had been given Alcamenes by the Epbori that when this point was executed he should B VUI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 291 should dispatch a horseman to them Aad immediate ly the¬ they had determined to dispatch away the com mander Chalcideus accompanied by Alcibiades with the five ships of their own equipment but at the in stant they were ready to move off the news arrived ‚ that  the squadron had been drove into Pir√ us De jected by this unexpected event because they had stum bled in the very first entrance on an Ionian war they no longer persisted in the design of sending away their owa Ihips but even thought of recalling some of those which were already at sea But as this was discovered hy Alcibiades he again persuades Endius and the o ther Effort by no means intirely to give up the expedi tion i alluring them that  by a timely dispatch they  yet might make that island before any information of the disaster which had befallen the squadron  could reach the Chians and of himself were he  once in Ionia he could easily effectuate the revolt of the cities by opening their eyes in respect to the weakness of the Athenians and the hearty and vigo  rous interposition of the Laced√ monians since on  these topics he should he heard with greater deference  than any other person whatever He also privately encouraged Endius with the prospect of  great glory to  himself if through him Ionia could be brought to i revolt and the king be made consederate to Laced√ mon whilst Agis had no hand in these masterly strokes of policy  for he happened now to be ac  variance with Agis By such insinuations Alcibiades U 2 prevailed  Na reason are here assigned for the variance between Alcibiades and Agis Numbers of probable poes might occur from the different tempers and manners of he persons but we learn from Plutarch that Alcibiades had been intriguing with Timsea the wife of Agis and had had a son by her who was called Leotychides disowned afterwards by A¬ s and incapacitated from succeeding to the throne Alci biades w s always dissolute and yet this it seems was merely to gratify his pride since he declared his intention in this intrigue to have been that his dependents might reign at Sparta This fine gentleman from Athens was exceeding agreeable in the eyes of her Spartan majesty j even though his deportment at Sparta VMS such at if he 292 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII prevailed upon the Ephoriand Endius and sailed away wich the five ships in company with Chalcideus the Laced√ monian  and the voyage they performed with all possible expedition About the fame time the sixteen ships which had been at the war of Sicily under the orders of Gylippus regained in sasety the Peloponnesian ports They had been intercepted near Leucadia and terribly harrasscd by twenty seven sail of Athenians commanded by Hip pocles the son of Menippus who was stationed there to watch the return of the fleet from Sicily Yet only a single ship was lost The rest escaping the Athe nian chace arrived sase in the harbour of Corinth But Chalcideus and Alcibiades who were now upon their voyage stopped and detained whatever they met that their course might not be divulged And touch ing first at Corycus on the main and there setting at liberty such as they had detained and gaining a conse rence wich some of the Chians who were privy to their designs by whom being advised to make directly for the harbour of Chios without any formal notification they arrive there entirely unexpected by the Chians By this the many were thrown at once into astonish ment and terror but the few had so conducted mat ters that the council was that moment sitting in which Chalcideus and Alcibiades being admitted to speech it ‚ that  many other ships are coming up ‚ but sup pressing all mention of the squadron blocked up at Pi r√ us the Chians declare a revolt from the Athenians and

preparations for war At Athens soon the news arrives of the revolc of Chios They were now convinced that horrid and ap parent dangers already environed them about and that the rest of their dependents would not long be quiet when the most powerful State amongst them had thrown off the yoke Now therefore the  thousand talents which through all the course of the war they had reli giously refrained from touching the penalties being discharged which the law inflicted upon him who should move or whoever should vote it amidst their present consternation they decreed  should be employed in the public service and that a large number of ships should by this means be equipped  ‚ that sarther  from the squadron which blocked up Pir√ us eight ships should immediately be detached which ac cordingly quitting the blockade pursued the squadron under Chalcideus bur being unable to come up with them returned again This detachment was com manded by Strombichides the son of Diotimus ‚ that  soon after twelve others under the orders of Thra  fycles should repair to Chios there also to be de  tached from the same blockade Having more over fetched off the seven vessels belonging to the Chi ans which assisted in forming the blockade at Pir√ us they set at liberty the slaves who were on board them and threw all the freemen into prison But to replace the whole number detached from the blockade of the Peloponnesians they lost no time in fitting out other vessels and sending them to that post They had also 3 scheme for the expeditious equipment of thirty more Great indeed was th ir ardour and nothing of small 193750 Stirling V 3 importance kft THE TELOPONWESIAN WAR B VIH importance was taTccn in hand as the point in agitation was no less than the recovery of Chios In the mean

lions From Chios also Chakideus was now co filing over to Teos with a fleet of three and twenty fail and the land force of the Clazomenians and also of the Erythr√ ans attending his motions was march ing thither by land But Strombichides having timely notice of their approach pot out again before thefrr ar rival Standing out aloos into open sea he had a view of this numerous fleet in their course from Chios upon Which he fled amain to Samos But the enemy fol lowed in pursuit The Teians who at first refused admittance to the land forces when now the Athenians plainly fled thought proper to open their gates Here the busk of them were inactive for a time attending the return of Chalcideus from the pursuit But when time wore on without his appearing they demolished of their own accord the wall Which the Athenians had built on the ‚ fide of Teos facing the continent In this they were also assisted by a small party of Barbarians who in this interval had joined them and were commanded by Tages the deputy of TissaphernCs But Chalcideus and Alcibiades when they had chased Strombichides into Samos having furnished the mari ners of the Peloponnesian vessels with proper arms leave them as a garrison in Chios Having manned their vessels afresh at Chios with an additioivof twenty others they stood away for Miletus as meditating its revolt This was owing to Alcibiades who having an interest in persons of the first rank among the Mile sians made it a point to effectuate their accession before the fleet should come up from Peloponnesus and to fe cure the whole honour to the Chians and himself and Chalcideus B VIJI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 295 Chalcideus And Endius who had sent him in pursuance of his engagements to work the revolt of the cities with the sole power of the Chians and

lately come up from Athens with twelve ips and in junction with she former followed after them they cawse Miletus to revolt The Athenians indeed with nineteen sail arrived upon their heels but as the Milesians denied them a reception they took their station at Lade an adjacent isle The first alliance between the king and the Laced√ monians was made immediately after the revolt of Mi letus by

An√ a being desirous to pick up some information of what was doing at Miletus and at the fame time to cause the revolt os the cities Here being reached by an order from Chal cideus to return back to Chios with an intimation that Amorges with a land army would soon be upon them they sailed away to the temple of Jupiter From hence they descry sixteen ships which Diomedon was bring ing up from Athens from whence he had sailed some what later than Thrasycles Upon this discovery they fled amain with a single ship to Ephcsus but with the rest of their fleet to Teos Four indeed of the num ber which their crews had abandoned the Athenians take yet all the hands escaped on shore but the re mainder reach in safety the city of the Telans After this the Athenians stood away into Samos But the Chians putting again to sea with the residue of their ships arid attended by a land force caused Lebedosto revolt and also Er√ And these points carried both the land force and the squadron returned respectively to their own homes About the fame time the twenty fail of Feloponne sians which had been chased into Pir√ us and lay blocked up there by an equal number of Athenians having made an unexpected sally upon the enemy and got the better in a naval engagement take four of the Athenian ships and sailing away for Cenchre√ were again fitting put for the voyage to Chios and Ionia Astyochus also came down thither from Laced√ mon as admiral in whose hands the whole command at sea was now lodged B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 197 When the land army had quitted Teos Tiflaphernes in person came thither with a body and after com pletely demolishing those parts of the wall before Teos which were yet left standing marched away Not long after his departure Diomedon arriving there with ten fail of Athenians in order to gain a re ception made a truce with the Teians From thence he coasted along to Eras and assaulted the place but not being able to take it he sailed away Coinciding with this in point of time an insurrection was made at Samos by the people against the nobility The Athenians who with three ships were then lying at Samos assisted the former On this occasion the S m ian people massacred about two hundred persons all of the nobility Four hundred others they condemned to exile and having divided amongst themselves their lands and houses and obtained from the Athenians a decree of being governed by their own constitutions as men whose sidelity was no longer to be suspected they assumed the whole civil administration leaving no share of it in the hands ofthe landed gentry and absolutely prohibiting to the people all alliance for the future with them so as neither to give their daughters to them nor ever to marry theirs    After these transactions during the same summer the Chians proceeding with unabating ardour left no thing undone to compass the revolt of the cities Even without Peloponnesian aid they made them visits with their own single force and desirous at the same time to involve as large a number as possible in their own dangers they undertake a voyage with thirteen fail of ships to Lesbos This squared exactly with the La ced√ monian plan 1 which was to make the second ac tempt upon that island and from thence to proceed to Hellespont The land force at the same time of such Peloponnesians as were at hand and their

hians The land soldiers on board them were some ¬ if the heavy armed of the public roll of Athens now pressed into this service At Cardamyle they landed and 3co THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII and at Bolissus having routed in battle a body of Chi ans that made head against them and done great exe cution upon them they reduced all the places in that quarter of the island At Phan√ also they fought a se cond time with great success and a third time at Leu conium But as after these repeated defeats the Chi ans no longer stiewed themselves in the field to oppose them the victors made cruel ravage on that rich and fertile country and which from the invasion of the Medes to the present period of time had been totally exempted from the miseries of war For next to the Laced√ monians the Chians are the only people who as far as I have been able to observe have enjoyed a series of public prosperity with a steady and uniform mo deration and in proportion as their State increased in wealth and power made suitable accessions to its do mestic splendor and security Nay even their late re volt if this should chance to be ascribed to a want of judicious and cautionary measures they never ventured to declare till they had fortified the hazardous step with numerous and gallant confederates and saw plainly that the Athenians as even the Athenians themselves could not possibly deny after the blow received in Sicily were plunged into the lowest depth of impotence and distress If therefore they proved mistaken it was one of those cases inseparable from the constant muta bility of human affairs where numbers were involved in the fame mistake with themselves who yet in their judgement were perfectly convinced that the entire ruin of Athens was fast approaching Now therefore blocked up as they were by sea whilst their lands all around were ravaged by the ene my a party amongst them were concerting the method of delivering up the city into the hands of the Athe nians But those in the administration getting wind of their design refrained indeed from making a bustle a bout it in public but fetching over Astyochus the Laced√ monian admiral in chief with his four ships from B VI1I THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 301 from Erythr√ they consulted how to prevent the exe cution of the plot by the mildest and most gentle me thods either by taking hostages for the sidelity of the suspected or some other such cautionary expedients In this posture stood affairs at Chios But from Athens in the close of the same summer one thousand five hundred heavy armed Athenians and a thousand Argives for five hundred Argives who were but light armed the Athenians had equipped in the manner more complete with the addition of a thou sand confederates in eight and forty fail of ships in cluding the transports of the heavy armed and put under the command of Phrynichus and Onomacles and Skironidas sailed away to Samos and thence stretch ing over to Miletus encamped themselves before it The Milesians marched out into the field to the a mount of eight hundred heavy armed assisted by the Peloponnesians who came over with Chalcideus and a body of foreign mercenaries furnished by Tissaphernes Tissaphernes also assisted them in person with an aid of cavalry And thus battle was joined against the Athe nians and consederates The Argives of whom a whole wing was composed advanced before the rest of the line and contemning their enemy too much as Ionians and unable to stand their shock they charged in a disorderly manner are routed by the Milesians and no less a number than three hundred of their body are destroyed But the Athenians beat first the Pelopon nesians and then cleared the field of the Barbarians and all the rabble of the enemy yet came not at all to an engagement with the Milesians For the latter return ing towards the city from the chace of the Argives no sooner perceived that their own side was vanquished than they quitted the field of battle The Athenians there fore as victors posted themselves under the very walls of Miletus It is observable that in this battle the Ionians had on both sides the better of the Dorians For the Athenians beat those Peloponnesians who were ranged 3t¬ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B Vlft ranged against them and the Milesians did the some by the Atgives But now after erecting a trop y as the town was seated on an isthmus the Athenians were preparing to cut it off by a work of circi mva latioa concluding that  if they once could get possession of  Miletus they should easily complete she reduction of the other Slates It was now about the Chut of evening and advice is brought them that  five and fifty fail of ships from  Peloponnesus and Sicily are only not at hand For from Sicily where Hermocrates the Syracusao strenu ously advised to go on with what yet remained in re gard to the total demolition of the Athenians twenty fail of Syracusans and two of Selingntians came over The Peloponnesian fleet which had been fitting e ut was now ready for service and both these were sent out in conjunction under the orders of Theramenes the Laced√ monian who was to carry them to Astyochus the admiral in chief They arrived first at Eleus an island before Miletus Being there informed that the Athenians lay before Miletus they departed thence and steering first into the gulf of Iisus were desirous to pick up information how things went at Miletus Alcibiades had now rode to Teichiussa in the Milesian in which quarter of the gulph the fleets had come to anchor for the night and receive there a full account of the battle Alcibiades had been present at it and had given his assistance to the Milesians and Tissapher nes He therefore earnestly pressed them unless  they were desirous to see all Ionia lost and all their  great expectations blasted at once to repair with all  possible expedition to the succour of Miletus and by no means to suffer it to be invested by a circumval  lation In pursuance of this it was resolved that at the first dawn of day they would stand away to its suc cour But Phrynichus the Athenian commander when advised from Lerus of the certain arrival of this united fleet BtV1II THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 303 fleet even though his collegues declared openly for keeping their ground and hazarding an engagement by sea protested boldly that  such a step for his own part he could not take 5 and were he able to hin  der it that neither they nor any one should force  him to it For since it would be afterwards in their  power when they had got better intelligence of the numbers of the enemy and made what possible ac  cessions they could to their own and when they had prepared for action in an ample and leisurely man  ner since it would be still in their power to fight the dread of a shameful or reproachful imputation should not bend him to risk an engagement against his judgement It could be no matter of reproach  to the Athenians to retire with their fleet when the exigences of time required it but in every respect it would be highly reproachful to them should they fight and be vanquished He would not therefore  involve the State not only in reproach but in the  greatest of dangers ‚ the State which but just now  respiring from the terrible blows it had received   scarce thought it prudential with most ample prepa  ration to choose voluntary hazards or even when the last necessity demanded to strike first at the ene my ‚ why now when no necessity compelled must  it be thrown into wilful spontaneous dangers He exhorted them therefore  without loss of time to  carry the wounded on board to re embark their  troops and securing what baggage they had brought  along with them to leave behind what booty they had got from the enemy that their ships might notv  be too deeply laden and make the best of their way  to Samos and from thence after collecting together  what additional force they could to watch for and  seize the seasons of advantage to attack their foes The advice of Phrynicus thus given was prevailing and accordingly was put in execution He was regar ded not only on the present but on future occasions ¬ 1 not 304 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VHf not only for this but all the subsequent instances of his conduct as a man of an excellent understanding In pursuance of this the Athenians so soon as thd evening was closed made the best of their way to Mile tus and left the victory imperfect And the Argives without making the least stay chagrined as they were at their late defeat departed immediately from Samoa to return to Argos The Peloponnesians early the next dawn weighing from Teichiusla stand into Miletus After one day s stay in that harbour on the next having augmented their squadron with the Chian ships which had formerly been chaced in company with Chalcideus they determi ned to go back again to Teichiussa to fetch off what stores they had landed there Accordingly when the were thus returned Tiflaphernes being come up with his land army persuades them to stand directly against Iasus¬ in which his enemy Amorges at that instant lay Thus falling on Iafus by surprise the inhabitants of which expected none but an Athenian squadron they become masters of it In this action the Syracu sans were the persons who gained the greatest honour Amorges farther the bastard son of Pifluthnes who was a revolter from the king was taken prisoner by the Peloponnesians They delivered him up to Tiflapher nes that if he pleased he might send him to the king in obedience to his orders Iafus farther they put to the sack and the army made on this occasion a very large booty for this city had ever been remarkable for its wealth They gave quarter to the auxiliaries in the service of Amorges and without committing the least insult upon them took them into their own troops as the bulk of them were Peloponnesians They deliver ed up the town into the hands of Tisiaphernes as like wise all the prisoners whether Oaves or freemen upon covenant to receive from him a  Daric stater for each  This B VTIt THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 305 This being done they again repaired to Miletus and from hence they detach P√ daritus the son of Leon whom the Laced√ monians had sent expressly to be go vernor of Chios to march over land to Erythr√ ha ving under his command the auxiliaries who had served under Amorges and appoint Philippus to command at Miietus And the summer ended The winter now succeeding after Tissaphernes had garrisoned and provided for the security of Iasus he re paired to Miletus and distributed a month s subsistence in pursuance of his engagements at Laced√ mon to all the ships at the rate of an  Attic drachma to each ma riner by the day but for the remainder of time he de clared he would only pay at the rate of Jdiree oboli till he had consulted the king s pleasure and in cs his master s orders were for it he said he would make it up a complete drachma But as Hermocrates the Sy racusan commander remonstrated sharply against this usage for Theramenes not regarding himlelf as ad miral since he was now at the head of the fleet merely to carry it up to Astyochus was very indolent about the article of pay it was at length compromised that ex cepting the five supernumerary ships the crews of the reft should receive more than three oboli a man For to the five and fifty ships he paid f thiee talents a month Vol II X and  7 l  J Half a drachma ‚ f Thrre is manifestly a fault here for Tfia three in the original should be read j gtaxorV thirty talents a month Mr Hobbes hath taken the pains to compute and finds that the Peloponnesian ships carried eighteen men apitce What i only so imall a crew as eighteen men for a ship of war with three banks of oars  or where he complement was perhaps two hundred did Tissaphernes only pay a tenth part of that number Xenophon in the first book of his Greek history enables us to set all to light Lyfander is negotiating with Cyrus for an increase of pay Cyrus insists upon Che former agreement made by Tissaphernes that every ship should receive but h rty m wa a month The daily pay of each was of course one mha or one hun dred drachmas Whence it appears that at chree oboli or half a drachma a man the pay of sixty ships each carrving two hundred men would be just thirty talents Thirty talents therefore paid to silty five shifS for a month wat two talents and a half thirst 3o6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL and for the rest as many as exceeded that number pay was to be furnished at the race of only three oboli a day The fame winter the Athenians now lying at Samos had been reinforced by the arrival of five and thirty fail from Athens under the command of Charminus and Strombichides and Euctemon j and they had farther assembled all their ships from Chios and others A resolution was therefore taken after assigning each his peculiar command by lot to make up against it with at naval force and awe Miletus j but to send against Chios both a naval and a land force and this accordingly they put in execution For in fact Strombichides and Onomacles and Euctemon with a squadron of thirty sail and a body of transports which had on board a detachment from the thousand heavy armed which came against Miletus stood away for Chios as this service had fallen to them by lot but the rest of the commanders who now remained at Samos having un der them seventy four ships were quite lords of the sea and sailed boldly up to awe Miletus Astyochus who happened at this juncture to be in Chios selecting hostages as a prevention against treache ry thought proper for the present to desist when he heard of the arrival of the squadron under Theramenes and that their engagements with ThTaphernes were above three Mi a day And hence it seems pretty clear that the complement rf a Fcloponnesian skip of war was two hundred men  I hare another proof ac hand which will confirm what bath already been said and seive at the same time to ascertain the number of men on board a ship of war In the sixth book Thucydidet fays the Egesleans brought to Athens sixty talents as a month s pay for sixty hips He fays also that in the Sicilian expedition the daily pay ps the Athenian seamen was raised to a drachma a man Now a talent a month reckoning thirty days to the month is two mime a day and two mirnt are just two hundred drachmas Hence it is plain the complement of an Athenian thip was two hundred men and according to the former computation that of a Peloponnefiast ihip was as might reasonably be expected exactly the fame This is a farther con firmation that there is a mistake in the printed copies of the original as was aid abort where instead of three talents which amount but to 581 51 sttrssttg daould have been read thirty talents amounting in Englisli money to 5812 101 much B Vftl THE PELOPOfrNESIAN WAR 367 much altered for the better But taking with him ten fail of Peloponnesiansand ten oFChians he putteth rb sea ahd having made an attempt upon Pceleu m though without success he crossed over to Clazomen√ He there summoned such of the inhabitants as were at tached to the Athenians to remove with their effects up to Daphhu s and leave him in possession of the place Tamus farther the sub governor of Ionia joined with him in the summons But when the inhabitants re jected this offer he made an assault upon the city which had no fortifications yet miscarrying in the at tempt he put off again to sea in a hard gale of wind and reached With those ships that kept up with him to Phocea and Cyme but the rest of the squadron was by stress of weather forced over to the isles which lie near to Clazomen√ ‚ ‚ Marathusa and Pele and Dri mussa and whatever effects belonging to the Clazo menians had by way of security been deposited there during eight days continuance which the stormy wea ther obliged them to stay they partly plundered and partly destroyed and having secured their booty on board got away to Phocea and Cyme and joined As tyochus But whilst he was yet in this station embas sadors reach him from the Lesbians imparting to him their desires to revolt Him indeed they persuade tuit when the Corinthians and the rest of the consede rates declared their repugnance because of the former miscarriage he weighed from thence and made sail for Ghifos And now a storm dispersing his squadron ac last they all come in though from different quarters to which they had been driven and rejoin him at Chios The next step to this was the junction of P√ daritus who being now at Erythr√ after marching by land from Miletus passed over in person with the troops un der his command to Chios He had also with him a botit site hundred soldiers taken out of the five ships under Chalcideus who had been left behind with their arms X Z But 3o8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII But now the Lesbians notifying again their readi ness to revolt Astyochus in a conference with P√ da ritus and the Chians maintains the necessity of go ing thither with a squadron to support the revolt of Lesbos since in consequence ot it they must ei ther enlarge the number of their confederates or even though miscarrying in the design must hurt the Athenians But they were deaf to this remon strance and P√ daritus positively declared that he should not be attended by the ships of Chios Upon this taking with him five fail of Corinthians a sixth ship belonging to Megara and one more of Hermione and all the Laconjan which he himself brought thither he stood away from thence to his station at Miletus uttering grievous threats against the Chians that how low soever they might be reduced they should  never receive any succour from him Accordingly touching fiist at Corycus of Erythr√ he moored there for the night The Athenians who from Samos with a considerable strength were now bound against Chios were lying at the fame instant of time on the other side of the cape but so stationed that neither party knew of the nearness of the other At this junc ture a letter being delivered from P√ daritus that t a party of Erythr√ ans who had been prisoners at Sa mos and released from thence are coming to Ery thr√ to betray that place Astyochus puts out a gain immediately for Erythr√ and thus narrowly on this occasion d d he escape falling into the hands of the Athenians P√ daritus farther had made the pas sage upon this affair and both having joined in ma king all necessary enquiries about those who were accu sed of this piece of treachery when they found the whole to have been a plot of the prisoners at Samos merely to recover their liberty they pronounced them innocent and so departed the latter to Chios but the other in pursuance of his first designation made the best of his way to Miletus B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 309 In the mean time the armament of the Athenians having sailed round from Corycus to Arginum falls in with three long vessels of the Chians and no sooner had descried than they gave them chace And now a violent storm ariseth and the vessels of the Chians with great difficulty escape into harbour But of the Athe nian squadron three which had molt briskly followed the chace are disabled and drive ashore at the city of the Chians The crews of them were partly made pri soners and partly put to the sword The rest of the fleet got into a safe harbour which is known by the name of Phcenicus under the Mimas From hence they afterwards took their course to Ltsbos and got all in readiness to raise fortifications From Peloponnesus the same winter Hippocrates the Laced√ monian putting out to sea with ten sail of Thurians commanded by Doricus the son of Diagoras and two collegues with one ship of Laconia and one of Syracuse arriveth at Cnidus This place was now in revolt from Tissaphernes Those at Miletus were no sooner advised of the arrival of this squadron than thay sent them orders with one moiety of their ships to keep guard upon Cnidus and with the other to post them selves at the Triopium in order to take under their convoy the trading vessels which were in their course from Egypt The Triopium is a point in the territory of Cnidus jutting out into the sea and a temple of Apollo But the Athenians informed of their designs and standing away from Samos take six of the ships which were stationed at the Triopium The crews in deed quit their ships and reach the shore This be ing done the victors sailed directly to Cnidus and making an assault upon that city which was quite un fortified had very nearly taken it On the next day they renewed the assault Yet as the inhabitants had taken care to make it more secure by favour of the night and the men escaped from the vessels taken at Triopium had thrown themselves into the place they X 3 did 3io THE PELOPONNESUN WAR B VIIJ did less damage than on the preceding day After scouring and laying waste the terjispJiy of Cnidus they failed baek to Samos About the same time Astyochus having rejoined the fleet at Miletus the Peloponnesians were still abound ing in all the needful expedients of war Good pay was regularly advanced them and the soldiers had store of rnoney yet remaining of the rich booty they made at Iafus The Milesians farther sustained with alacrity the burden of the war It was however the opinion of the Peloponnesians that the first treaty made with Tissaphernes by Chalcideus was in some articles defective and less advantageous to themselves Upon this they drew up and ratified a second in the presence of Theramenes The articles of it are these  STIPULATED by the Laced√ monians and conftderates with king Darius and the sons of the king and Tissaphernes that peace and amity subsist c on the following conditions Whatever province or city soever belongeth to king Darius or did belong to his father or ancestors  against them in a hostile manner not to march and  no injury to do are bound both Laced√ monians and  confederates of the Laced√ monians Not to exact tribute from any soch places are bound both Lace d√ monians and confederates of the Laced√ monians  Neither shall king Darius nor any subject of the king march in a hostile manner against nor dp any  injury to the Laced√ monians and confederates But in cafe the Laced√ monians or confederates  need any assistance whatever from the king or the  king from the Laced√ monians and confederates f whatever either party can convince the other to be  right let that be done Be the war against the Athenians and confederates  carried on by both parties in strict conjunction Aod¬  in B VIir THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 3rr  in cafe an accommodation be taken in hand be it  settled by both parties acting in conjunction But whatever army be brought info the territo  ries of the king at the request and summons of the king the king to defray the expence  And if any of the States comprehended in this league with the king invade the territories of the king the others to oppose and act with all their power  in defence of the king And if any province belonging to the king or subject to his dominion invade the territory of the Laced√ monians or confederates the king to oppose  and with all his power to defend the party invaded When the finishing hand was put to this treaty Theramenes after delivering up the fleet to Astyo chus puts to sea in a fly boat and entirely disappears But the Athenians from Lesbos having now made their passage and landed their forces in Chios and be ing masters of the coast and sea fortified Delphinium a place remarkably strong by nature towards the land abounding farther with harbours and seated at no considerable distance from the city of the Chians And now the Chians dispirited by the many defeats they had already received and what is worse far from be ing actuated by general unanimity bur on the con trary Tydeus the Ionian and his adherents having been lately put to death by P√ daritus for atticizing and the rest of the citizens obliged by necessity to sub mit to the few each individual amongst them suspect ing his neighbour ‚ the Chians now remained quite inactive Thus for the reasons above mentioned they neither looked upon themselves nor the auxiliaries un der P√ daritus as a match for the enemy Yet as theit last resource they send to Miletus requesting As tyochus to come over to their succour But as he was deaf to their intreaties P√ daritus fends a letter to La ced√ mon about him which accused him of injustice X 4 And 3i THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII And to this situation were brought the Athenian affairs at Chios Their squadron also at Samos made several visits to the squadron of the enemy at Miletus but as the lat ter refused to come out to engage them they returned again to Samos wirhout committing any hostilities From Peloponnesus in the same winter twenty seven sail of ships equipped by the Laced√ monians for Pharnabazus at the instances of his agents Calli gitus the Megarean and Timagoras the Cyzicene put out to sea and made over to Ionia about the solstice Antisthenes the Spartan was onboard as admiral With him the Laced√ monians sent also eleven Spartans to be a council to Aflyochus in the number of whom was Lichas the son of Arcesilaus To these an order was given that  when arrived at Miletus they should  in concert act in all respects as might be best for the  service and this squadron or one equal in strength  or larger or smaller at their own discretion should proceed to Hellespont for the service of Pharnabazus and be sent away under the command of Clearchus the son of Ramphias who accompanied them in the  voyage and in cafe it was judged expedient by the  council of eleven to dismiss Astyochus from the chief f command and substitute Antisthenes On account of the letters of P√ daritus they began to suspect the former This squadron therefore standing out to sea from Malea arrived first at Melos and falling in with ten sail of Athenians they take and burn three of them which their crews had abandoned But appre hensive that those Athenian ships which had escaped might advertise the fleet at Samos of their approach as was actually the case they stretched away for Crete and for better security keeping a good look out and taking more time they made land first at Caunus of Asia From thence as being now beyond the reach of danger they dilpatch a messenger to the fleet at Mile Jus to attend and bring them up B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 313 But about the fame juncture of time the Chians and P√ daritus not bearing to acquiesce under the di latory answers of Astyochus pressed him by repeated messages  to come over with the whole of his force and relieve them from the present blockade and by  no means to look indolently about him whilst the  most important of the confederate States in Ionia was shut up by sea and by land exposed to rapines For the domestics of the Chians ‚ being many in number nay the largest that any one community ex cept the Laced√ monians kept and accustomed be cause of their multitude to be punished with extraor dinary severity for their misdemeanors ‚ no fooner judged that the Athenian forces by throwing up works had gained a sure footing in the island than large num bers of them at once deserted to the enemy and were afterwards the persons who as persectly well acquainted with the country committed the heaviest depredations The Chians therefore urged that  the last necessity l called upon him whilst yet there was hope or a pol  Ability of success remaining the works round Del  phinium yet incomplete and a larger circle even still  to be taken in and fortified for the security of the  camp and the fleet to undertake their relief Upon this Astyochus who to verify his threats had never before thought seriously about it being now convinced that the whole consederate body was bent on their pre servation determined in person to go to their succour But just at this crisis advice is brought him from Caunus that  twenty seven sail of ships and the af sistant council of Laced√ monians are arrived Con cluding upon this that every other point ought to be postponed to this large reinforcement that his junction with it might be effected in order to invest them with the sovereignty of the sea and that the Laced√ monians who came to inspect his own conduct might securely finish their voyage throwing up immediately all con cern for Chios he sailed away for Caunus But ha 3i4 TFTE PELOFOJTNESIAN WAR B VlII ving landed in his psflage at Cos Meropidis the inha bitants of which had refuged themselves in the moun tains he rifled the city which was quite unfortified and had lately been tumbled into ruins by an earth quake the greatest that had been felt there in the me mory of us now living By excursions also through all the country he made prize of all he found except ing seamen for such he dismissed unhurr From Cos advancing by night ro Cnidus he is diC suaded by the Cnidians from landing his men but on the contrary without loss of time to get out to sea and make head against twenty sail of Athenians which Charminus one of the commanders from Samos had under his orders and with them was watching the ap proach of the twenty seven sail coming up from Pelo ponnesus which Astyochus was now going to join For they at Samos had received from Miletus advice of their coming and Charminus was appointed to cruise for them about Cyme and Chalce and Rhodes and the coast of Lycia and by this time he knew for a certainty that they were lying at Caunus Astyochus therefore without loss of time stood a way for Cyme with a view to surprise the ships of the e nemy at sea before they could get any advice of his ap proach A heavy rain and thick cloudy weather occa sioned the dispersion of his vessels in the dark and sadly disordered him When morning broke the fleet being widely separa ted and the left wing driven already within the view of the Athenians the remainder yet driving in confu sion about the island Charminus and the Athenians launch out against them with all possible expedition though with fewer than twenty sail imagining this to be the squadron from Caunus whose approach they were to observe and proceeding instantly to action they funk three and dilabled others They had by far the better jn the action till the numerous remainder of hos tile ships appeared to their great consternation and in compassed B VIII THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR 315 compassed them round on all sides Then taking to open flight they lost six of their ships but with the remainder reach in safety the iste of Teuglussa and from thence proceed to Halicarnassus This being done the Peloponnesians putting back to Cnidus and the twenty seven fail from Caunus com pleting here their junction with them they put out a gajn to sea in one body and after erecting a trophy as Cyme returned again to their anchorings at Cni dus The Athenians on the other hand had no sooner been informed of the engagements of the squadrons thao with the whole of their fleet they put out from Sa mos and made the best of their way to Cyme And yet against the fleet at Cnidus they made no sallies as neither did the enemy against them but after taking up the tackling of the vessels left at Cyme and making an assault upon Lori ma on the continent they returned toSamos The whole united fleet of the Peloponnesians now lying at Cnidus was busy in resitting completely for service and the Laced√ monian council of eleven had a conference with Tiffaphernes who was now come to them in which they notified to him their dislike of some things in past transactions and in regard to the future operations of war debated in what manner they might be carried on for their joint benesit and convenience But Lichas was the person who scrutinized most closely into the past and expressed a dissatisfaction with both treaties affirming that  even the last settled by The ramenes was far from being good but that terrible it would be should the king now claim upon that pretext the possession of that tract ofcountry of which ‚ either he or his ancestors had formerly been masters For thus he might be enabled once more to inflave  all the islands and Thessaly and Locri quite a far  as B≈ otia whilst the Laced√ monians instead of freeing would be obliged to impose the Median subjection 1 3i6 THE PELOPOMNESIAN WAR B VIII  subjection on the Grecians He insisted therefore  that a better treaty should be made or at least the  former hould be instantly disannulled for on terms  like the present they would scorn to take pay from  the king Nettled at this Tissaphernes went from them in a fit of choler without bringing affairs to any kind of settlement The scheme now next in agitation was a voyage to Rhodes which the most powerful persons there had by embassies solicited them to undertake They were full of hopes to bring into their subjection an island by no means inconsiderable either for number of mariners or soldiers and at the fame time judged themselves able by their present alliances to defray the expence of their fleet without requesting pay from Tiflaphemes Ac cordingly this winter with great dispatch they put to sea from Cnidus and arriving first at Camirus on the Rhodian coast with ninety four ships they struck a consternation into the multitude who knew nothing of past transactions and were the sooner tempted to a bandon their dwellings as the city was not guarded by the least fortification The Laced√ monians after wards summoning to a conference these and the Rho dians also from two other cities Lindus and lelysus persuaded them to revolt from the Athenians Rhodes accordingly went over to the Peloponnesians At the fame juncture of time the Athenians who had discovered their design put out with their fleet from Samos earnestly bent on preventing the scheme They were seen indeed out at sea by the enemy but made their appearance a little too late For the present therefore they put back to Chalce and from thence to Samos and asterwards making frequent trips from Chalce and Cos and Samos they warred against Rhodes The Peloponnesians exacted from the Rhodians a sum amounting to about  two and thirty talents and  6zoo Sterling having B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 317 having laid their ships aground continued with them eighty days without subjecting them to any farther im position During this interval of time nay extended farther back before they undertook this enterprise against Rhodes the following transaction happened Alcibiades after the death of Chalcideus and the bat tle of Miletus falling under the suspicion of the Pelo ponnesians and through them a letter having been sent from Laced√ mon to Astyochus to put him to death ‚ for he was an enemy to Agis and his treachery in other respects was become notorious ‚ Alcibiades s say fearful of his life withdraws himself first to Tissapher nes and in the next place did all in his power to un dermine what interest the Peloponnesians had in him Grown at length his dictator in every affair he abridged their pay that instead of an Attic  drachma three 0 boli only should be given them and that too with no punctuality He advised Tissaphernes to remonstrate with them that  the Athenians who through a long tract of time had gained experience in naval affairs paid only three oboli to their seamen ‚ not so much tf through a principle of frugality as to prevent their  seamen from growing insolent through too much  plenty some of them would otherwise render their  bodies less fit for fatigue by having wherewithal to c purchase those pleasures by which weakness is occa stoned and others would desert and leave their ar  rears to balance their desertion He instructed him farther how by seasonable gratuities to the comman ders of ships and generals of the States he might per suade them all to acquiesce in his proceedings except ing the Syracusans for amongst these Hermocrates alone made loud remonstrances in behalf of the whole alliance Nay Alcibiades himself took upon him to give the denial to such States as petitioned lor money  Six oboli or 7  Sterling making 3i8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WATt  Vllt making answer himself instead of Tiffaphernes that for instance  the Chians were void of all shame who though the most wealthy of the Grecians and  hitherto preserved by the auxiliary efforts of others yet are ever requiring strangers to expose their lives  and fortunes to keep them free As for other States he maintained they acted basely if when subjected to vast expences before they revolted froth the Athenians they refused to lay out as much nay a great deal more in their own defence He was also dextrous at proving that  Tiffaphernes since now he supported the war at his own private ex  pence was in the right to be frugal but assuredly when returns were made him from the king he  would makeup the present abatement of pay and do  strict justice to every single State He farther sug gested to Tiffaphernes that he should not be too  much in a hurry to bring the war to a conclusion  or  entertain the wish either by bringing up the Phoe  nician fleet which he had provided or by taking in  to pay a larger number of Grecians to turn the supe riority at land and sea in favour of the Laced√ mo nians He ought rather to leave both parties pretty nearly balanced in strength and fo enable the king  when one of them became troublesome to let the o  ther party loose against them Whereas should the  dominion in both elements be given exclusively to ei ther he would then be distressed for want of susfi  cient power to pull down the triumphant State un less at a prodigious expence and through infinity  of danger to himself he should choose to enter the   lists in person and war them down The risks incur  red by the other method were far more eligible be  cause attended with a smaller proportion of expence   and his master might lie by with persect security  whilst he was wearing out the Grecians by their own  reciprocal embroilments He moreover hinted to him that  the Athenians were the best suited of the  two B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 319  two to share the dominion with him because they were less desirous of power on the continent and by  their peculiar turn of politics and military conduct were better adapted for this purpose They would be glad at the same time to subdue the maritime parts to their own yoke and to that of the king all Grecians whatever who live upon the continent The Laced√ monians on the contrary came thither with the sole passion to sec them free nor in common  prudence could it be judged likely that men who  were this moment employed to deliver Grecians from the yoke of Grecians would in that case be stopped by any thing but a superior force from delivering them al so from the yoke of barbarians He advised him therefore  in the first place to wear out the strength  of both and after clipping as much as possible the wings of the Athenians then instantly to drive the Peloponnesians from off his coasts The larger part of this advice Tissaphernes deter mined to follow so far at least as may be gathered from his actions For satisfied by this means with Al cibiades as a person who on these points gave him found advice and resigning himself up to his gui dance he paid but sorrily their subsistence to the Pelo ponnesians and would not suffer them to engage at sea By the constant pretext that the Ph≈ nician fleet was coming up and then with so great a superiority of strength the war might be brought to a clear decision he ruined all operations of war he suffered the vigour of their fleet which in fact was strong and mighty in sensibly to moulder away and disconcerted them so openly in other respects that his motives in doing it were no longer to be concealed Such was the advice which Alcibiades gave to Tissa phernes and the king when he had opportunities and which he really thought to be the best in policy  But at the same time he had deep in his heart and in his study bis own return to his country  assured within himself S20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL himself that if he preserved it from a total destruc tion he might find a time to compass his own restora tion And nothing he judged could expedite his pur pose more than if it appeared to the world that Tissa phernes was his friend i which also was verified by fact For when the Athenian troops at Samos perceived that he had so strong an interest with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades had already paved the way by sending inti mations beforehand to the men of influence and au thority amongst them how desirous he was  they should patronize his return with the consent of the  persons of the greatest honour and worth in their  company since only under an oligarchy but not un   der an iniquitous cabal or that democracy which had formerly banished him could he even desire it J ‚ and thus recalled he would come and join his cares with theirs for the public welfare and procure them  farther the friendship of Tissaphernes‚ when more than this the officers of those Athenians at Sa mos and the men of highest authority amongst them were voluntarily inclined to put an end to the demo cracy  ‚ the method of bringing it about began to be agitated first in the army and from thence soon made a stir in Athens itself Some persons passed over from Samos to concert matters with Alcibiades who gave them room to hope that  he could render first Tissaphernes and in the  next place the king their friend if they would dis solve the democracy since on this sole condition could the king be assured of their sincerity This contributed to enhance their sanguine expectations that on this their affairs might take a new turn in which men of first rank in the community who in the pre sent management were most depressed might recover the administration and gain the ascendant over their enemies Returning therefore to Samos they took in the most proper persons there to be assistants to the scheme and to the many made public declarations that the B V1IL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 321 the king might be made their friend and supply them with money were Alcibiades recalled and the de mocracy suspended The effect of these declarations on the many was this that though for the present they were chagrined at the scheme in agitation yet soothed by the flattering hope of the royal subsidies they re frained from all manner of tumult But the set which was caballing in favour of an oli garchy after such open declarations to the multitude re considered the promises of Alcibiades amongst them selves and with a larger number of their associates The scheme was judged by all the rest to be feasible and sure but Phrynichus who was yet in the com mand declared a total dislike of it It appeared to him which was really the case that  Alcibiades cared as little for an oligarchical as a democratical  government and that no other thought lay seri oufly at his heart than to throw the present govern ment into some state of confusion which his friends  might so far improve as to carry his recallrrlent Of consequence the first point themselves should guard against was not to be thrown into seditions for the  benefit of the king It was not probable he plainly told them when the Peloponnesians had gained a power by sea equal to their own and were masters of cities not the most inconsiderable amidst the king s do minions that the latter should turn the balance in favour of the Athenians in whom he hath no confi dence at all whilst he might firmly depend upon the friendship of Peloponnesians who had never done him any harm As for confederate States to whom they were to give a certain pledge of future oligar  chy By setting up that government amongst them selves he told them he was well assured thac on that account neither such as had revolted would the sooner  return nor such as were at present their own would  the longer continue in their duty since the point on  which their wishes turned was not to be enslaved by Vol II Y an 3ii THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII ‚ an oligarchy rather than a democracy but to recover  their liberty indisferent equally to either form As  for those of their fellow citizens to whom was given the appellation of worthy and good even they would  perplex the train of government as much as the people  when by cajoling that people and authoritatively leading them into a series of bad measures they would principally regard their own private emoluments  And should they be subjected to the caprice of such to die by violence and without a trial must be the ge neral fate whereas the people was a sure resource in seasons of extremity and ever tempered the fury of  the great He was well convinced the States en lightened by a long tract of experience judge of  their government in the fame light Upon the whole theresore the negotiations of Alcibiades and all at present upon the carpet could in no wise be approved    by him The party however associated together in this de sign abiding by their former determinations resolved to proceed to their execution and were preparing to send Pisander and others by way of deputation to A thens to set on foot the negotiations concerning the return of Alcibiades the dissolution of the popular go vernment there and the gaining over Tissaphernes to the Athenian friendship Phrynichus ‚ now convinced that the return of Alci biades would be brought upon the carpet and the A thenians assuredly grant it apprehensive farther that from the opposition he had given it at their consulta tions he should then be exposed to his resentments as one who had endeavoured to stop it ‚ hath recourse to the following project He sends to Astyochus admiral in chief of the Laced√ monians who yet continued in the station of Miletus a secret hint by letter that Alcibiades is ruining their affairs by endeavouring  to gain over Tissaphernes to the Atheniansand after giving him a clear explanation of other matters he B VIH THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 323 he pleaded  the candour of Astyochus in his own ex cuse if he desired in this manner to ruin his mortal  foe though with some prejudice to the welfare of his  country But Astyochus had given up all thoughts of putting Alcibiades to death especially as now he never came within his reach yet on this occasion making a visit to him and Tissaphernes at Magnesia he communicates to them the advices sent him from Sa mos and becomes himself an informer He is accu sed by report not only on this but many other occa sions to have made court to Tissaphernes for his own private lucre and for the fame reason when the pay was not fully rendered before he suffered it much more pliantly than in duty he ought to have done Alcibia des fends away immediate notice to the managing party at Samos that the treachery of Phrynichus was detect ed by his own letter and insists upon it that he be put to death Phrynichus terribly alarmed and pushed to the very brink of destruction by such a discovery sends again to Astyochus blaming his indiscretion on the former1 occasion in not keeping his secret and assuring him that  now he was ready to deliver up to his fury  the whole force of the Athenians at Samos dis tinctly reciting to him the particulars by which as Sa mos was unfortified the whole scheme might be ac complished and that  undoubtedly he ought not to be censured if when his unrelenting foes had re  duced him to such extremity of danger he chose to  do this or even more than this rather than be de  stroyed by their rancour But this proposal also Astyochus communicates to Alcibiades Phrynichus perceiving in time that Astyochus be trayed him and that notice each moment was only not arrived from Alcibiades about the contents of his last anticipated the discovery and becomes himself informer ro the army that  the  enemy had resolved as Sa  mos was unfortified and the whole of their fleet not  securely stationed within the harbour te endeavour 324 THE PELOPONNESIAM WAR B VIII  a surprise Of this he had gained the most certain  informations and therefore Samos ought necessarily  to be put into a posture of defence with the utmost  expedition and proper guards in every respect be appointed He himself commanded and conse quently was impowered to see this put in execution All hands were instantly at work on the fortification and Samos though otherwise intended soon to be was by this piece of artifice immediately secured And no long time after came letters from Alcibiades import ing that  the army was betrayed by Phrynichus and in pursuance of it the enemy was coming to surprise them Their opinion of the good faith of Alci biades was not in the least established by this It was ar gued that as he was privy to the plans of the enemy from a principle of enmity he had fastened upon Phry nichus the charge of being their accomplice By the last notification therefore he was so far from hurting him that he only confirmed his evidence Yet subsequent to this Alcibiades continued to make use of all his address and persuasion with Tula phernes to gain him over to the Athenians who in sact stood most in terror of the Peloponnesians because they had a larger fleet at hand than the Athenians but was inwardly inclined were it any how feasible to comply with his suggestions especially as ever since the jar at Cnidus about the treaty of Theramenes he had been exasperated against the Peloponnesians For that jar had already happened at the time of their expedition to Rhodes and the suggestion of Alcibiades formerly mentioned that  the views of the Laced√ monians were to set the cities free was yet more verified by the behaviour of Lichas who had affirmed that  it was an article never to be suffered in treaty that the king should have those cities of which either himself or his ancestors had at any time been possessed And in truth Alcibiades as one who had important concerns at B VI1I THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 325 at stake continued with much zeal and assiduity to in gratiate himself with Tissaphernes  The Athenian deputies with Pisander at their head who were sent from Samos had no sooner reached A thens than they obtained an audience from the people where after touching in a summary manner upon many other advantages they expatiated chiefly on this that  by recalling Alcibiades and making an alteration in  the democratical form of government they might  gain the friendship of the king and a superiority over  the Peloponnesians Large was the number of those who would not hear the proposal against the demo cracy The enemies farther of Alcibiades were loud in their clamours that  shameful it would be if so  enormous a transgressor of the laws were recalled  one to whose crimes in point of the mysteries the   Eumolpid√ and Ceryces had borne solemn attesta tion the consequence of which was his exile nay  had farther denounced a curse upon those who  should restore him Pisander interposing to put a stop to this violent opposition and these tragical out cries addressed himself apart to each of these oppo nents and asked them singly Whether any hope they had left of saving their country now that the  Peloponnefians had as many ships upon the sea as  they had themselves but a larger number of confe derate States besides supplies of money from the king and Tissaphernes whilst themselves were quite exhausted unless somebody could persuade the king  to declare in their favour And when those to whom the demand was put replied in the negative he  These were sacerdotal families at Athens descended from Eumolpus and Ce ryx The former of them instituted the Eleusinian mysteries and it was the grand privilege of his descendents to preside at and regulate those sacred rites Who Ce ryx was and what the particular privileges of his descendents any farther than that according to Suidas they weie holy and venerable is not agreed AU of them were commanded to pronounce the fqjemn curse on Alcibiades when he was out lawed Vet one priestess as Plutarch relates Theano the daughter of Menon refused to obey j alledging that  it was her duty to Mess and not to curse Y 3 proceeded 3i6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII proceeded to make them this plain declaration ‚ And yet this turn in your favour can never take place  unless we temper our form of government with  greater moderation and intrust the administration in  the hands of the few that the king may have room   to place confidence in us For we are at present to if consult about the very being of the State and not to litigate the forms of its administration The sequel  may again enable us to return to the primitive form if we find it expedient and we hall recover Alci biades the only man alive who is able to accomplish the point The people in fact upon the first mention of an oligarchy were stung to the heart Yet afterwards convinced by Pisander that no other resource was left dispirited by fear and encouraged at the same time by a distant hope that another change might in the sequel be brought about they yielded up the point to the ne ceffity of the State Accordingly they pasted a decree that  Pisander and the ten joined with him in the M deputation mould pass the sea and negotiate the af fair with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades in the method  judged by them most conducive to the public ser vice At the same time as Pisander had preferred a charge of maladministration against Phrynichus they discharged him and his collegue Skirondas from their commands and sent away Diomedon and Leon to take upon them the command of the fleet The article with which Pisander charged Phrynichus was the betraying of lasus and Amorges The truth is he thought him by no means a proper person to be let into a share of their intrigues with Alcibiades And thus Pisander ‚ after visiting in order all the several juntos of the accomplices already formed in the city with the view to thrust themselves into the feats of judicature and the great offices of state and exhorting them severally to act with unanimity and by general concurrence to labour the demolition of the popular gor vernmenc  B VIH THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 327 vernment and after adjusting all previous measures to guard the best against dilatory proceedings ‚ re passeth the sea to Tissaphernes accompanied by his ten associates in the deputation In the fame winter Leon and Diomedon being ar rived at their post at the head of the Athenian fleet made an expedition against Rhodes and there they find the ships of the Peloponnesians hauled ashore They made a descent upon the coast and after defeating in battle such of the Rhodians as made head against them they stood away for Chalce and for the future carried on the war more from thence than from Cos for in that station they were better enabled to watch the mo tions of the Peloponnesian fleet  But at Rhodes arrived Xenophantidas a Laced√ monian dispatched by P√ daritus from Chios with ad vice that  the works of the Athenians were almost perfected and unless with the whole of their Ihip ping they come over to relieve them all is lost at  Chios A resolution accordingly was taken to en deavour their relief but in the mean time P√ daritus at the head of his body of auxiliaries and the Chians with all the force he could assemble together sallied out against the rampart which the Athenians had raised a rouod their ships demolished a part of it and made himself master of those vessels which were hauled a shore The Athenians ran from all quarters to their defence and having first engaged and put to flight the Chians the rest of the forces under P√ daritus are also defeated P√ daritus is killed as were numbers al so of the Chians and many arms were taken And after this the Chians were blocked up by sea and land more closely than ever and a terrible famine raged a mongst them The Athenian deputation headed by Pisander ha ving reached Tissaphernes enter into conference about terms of accommodation Alcibiades now as the conduct of Tissaphernes was still dubious and wavering Y 4 since 328 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL since he stood in great awe of the Peloponnesians and adhered to that rule of policy he had learned from him to war both fides out ‚ ‚ ‚ Alcibiades now had re course to another piece of resinement causing Tissa phernes to insist upon such exorbitant terms that no ac  commodation could ensue Tissaphernes truly seems to me to have proceeded in this manner from his own voluntary motives because fear was predominant in him But in Alcibiades it was purely art since as he found the other would not agree upon any terms whate ver he affected to strike the conceit into the Athenians that it really was in his power to manage him at plea sure and that he was already wrought to their purpose and willing to come to terms whereas the Athenians would not offer enough For Alcibiades himself made such extravagant demands since though Tissaphernes assisted at the conference the other managed it that though the Athenians had yielded to the far greater part yet the breaking off the treaty would be thrown at their doors It was insisted beside other demands that  all Ionia should be given up and what is more all the islands on the Ionian coast and other points The Athenians seeming to acquiesce in these at length upon the third meeting lest the smallness of his own influence should be plainly detected he de manded leave  for the king to build a fleet and to fail  along the Athenian coasts wherever and with what ever force he pleased Here all accommodation was over The Athenians concluding these points insu perable and that they were abused by Alcibiades broke off in indignation and return to Samos In the same winter immediately after breaking off the conference Tissaphernes repairs to Caunus with inten tion to bring the Peloponnesians again to Miletus and to form Other compacts with them the best he should be able to supply them farther with pay and by all means to staveoff an open rupture He was in fact apprehensive that should so large a fleet be deprived of subsistence or  B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 329 or necessitated to engage with the Athenians should susfer a defeat or should the mariners quit their vessels the Athenians then would carry their point without thanks to him j but his greatest fear was this lest for the fake of subsistence they should ravage the continent Upon all these considerations and the prudential mo tives arising from each co operating with his principal maxim of balancing the Grecians against one another he sent for the Peloponnesians pays them their arrears of subsistence and makes the following treaty the third of the kind with them IN the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius A lexippidas presiding in the college of Ephori at Lace  d√ mon articles are signed in the plain of M√ an der between the Laced√ monians and consederates on one side and Tissaphernes Hieramenes and the sons of Pharnacus on the other concerning the af  fairs of the king and those of the Laced√ monians and  confederates The whole of the king s dominions situate in Asia belongeth to the king and all his own dominions let  the king govern as to him seemeth meet   The Laced√ monians and confederates are not to  enter the dominions of the king to commit any act of hostility whatever Nor he those of the contract  ing parties for any act of hostility whatever And in case any of the Laced√ monians or confe M derates enter in a hostile manner the dominions of the  king the Laced√ monians and consederates are bound to restrain them And in case any subjects of the  king act in a hostile manner against the Laced√ mo  nians and confederates be the king also bound to re  strain them Tissaphernes shall pay subsistence to the ships now  upon the station according to the rates agreed on  till the king s fleet come up ¬ But 330 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII But the Laced√ monians and confederates so soon  as the king s fleet shall be come up shall have it in  their own option to maintain if they please their own fleet or in case they choose to take subsist f ence from Tissaphernes he is bound to supply them  Yet the Laced√ monians and confederates at the ex piration of the war shall repay to Tissaphernes whatever sums they may thus receive from him  When the king s fleet cometh up let the ships of the Laced√ monians and those of the confede rates and those of the king carry on the war in con cert by the joint counsels of Tissaphernes and of the  Laced√ monians and confederates  And whenever a peace with the Athenians be thought adviseable it shall be concluded hy the joint consent of both parties The treaty was made and ratified in these terms And after this Tissaphernes employed himself with diligence to bring up the Ph≈ nician fleet as hath been mentioned and duly to perform all the branches what ever of his engagements At least he was willing to convince the Peloponnesians by the measures he took that he was heartily in earnest In the close of this winter the B≈ otians got possession of Oropus by treachery though an Athenian garrison was in it The business was effectuated by the ma nagement of a party of Eretrians and those Oropians who were plotting the revolt of Eub≈ a For as this town was situated over against Eretria it was impossible but whilst in Athenian hands it must terribly annoy both Eretria and the rest of Eub≈ a Having therefore thus gained Oropus the Eretrians repair to Rhodes inviting the Peloponnesians to come over to Eub≈ a but their inclinations were rather to relieve Chios how sadly distressed Putting therefore from Rhodes with the whole of their fleet they stood away to sea and having gained the height of Triopium they descry the Athenian B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 331 Athenian squadron out at sea in a course from Chalce yet neither making any motion to bear down upon the other one fleet pursued their course to Samos the o ther put into Miletus They were now convinced that without fighting at sea they could not possibly relieve Chios Here this winter ended And the twentieth year of this war expired the history of which Thucydide¬ hath compiled YEAR XXI J I N the ensuing summer upon the first commence ment of the spring Dercylidas a Spartan at the head of an army not considerable for numbers was senr over land to Hellespont to effectuate the revolt of Abydus They are a colony of the Milesians The Chians also whilst Astyochus was perplexed about thejmethod of re lieving them were necessitated by the intolerable closeness of the blockade to hazard an engagement ac sea It happened whilst Astyochus was yet in Rhodes that Leon a Spartan who came over with Anrislenes though merely as a passenger had arrived at Chios from Miletus to act as governor after the death of P√ daritus with twelve sail of hipping draughted from the squa dron stationed at Miletus Of thelc five were Thurian four Syxacusan one belonged to An√ a another was Milesian and one was Leon s own Upon this the Chiang having sallied out with all their force and carried a strong post from the enemy and at the same time their fleet consisting of six and thirty sail launching forth against the thirty two Athenian an engagement followed and after a battle hotly maintained on both sides the Chians and allies who had not the worst of the dispute sheered off again into harbour for by this time it began to grow dark I Before Cbiifl 411 Instantly 332 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII Instantly upon this Dercylidas having completed his march from Miletus Abydus in Hellespont revolts to Dercylidas and Pharnabazus and two days after Lampsacus did the fame But intelligence of this having reached Strombichides at Chios and he with four and twenty fail of Athe nians including the transports which carried the heavy armed stretching thither with all possible expedition the Lampsacenes sallied out to repulse him He de feated them in battle and having at a shout made himself master of Lampsacus which was quite unfor tified he gave up all the efsects and slaves for pillage to his men and after re establishing such as were free in their old habitations proceeded against Abydus But finding them deaf to all schemes of accommodation and himself unable to reduce them by force crossing over to the spot opposite to Abydus he garrisons Sestus a city in the Chersonese which had formerly belonged to the Medes and put it in a condition to guard the Hellespont r During this interval of time the Chians had very much enlarged their room at sea and those stationed at Miletus and even Astyochus upon receiving the par ticulars of the late engagement and advice that Strom bichides was drawn off with so many ships began to be high in spirits Astyochus accordingly arriving at Chios with only two ships carrieth off along with him what shipping was there and with the whole force is now at sea in order to make an attempt upon Samos But when the enemy there because mutually embroiled in jealousies came not out against him he returned again to the station of Miletus For about this time or rather before the democracy was overturned at A thens The deputation at the head of which was Pifander were no sooner returned to Samos from Tissaphernes than they found their schemes had gained a stronger footing in the army and that the Samians had been encouraging B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 333 encouraging the men of power amongst the Athenians to join their efforts with them for the erection of an oligarchy though a party was very busy in opposing them with a view to quash the projected alteration The Athenians farther at Samos had in private con ferences come to a resolution ‚  to think no longer  of Alcibiades since he shewed himself so averse to   join them and in fact was by no means a proper person to have a share in an oligarchical administra tion ‚ Bur merely from a principle of self preser vation as now they were environed with dangers  they should take all possible care that the project  should not drop in the execution ‚ That farther they should prosecute the war with vigour and con tribute largely towards it from their own private purses and answer every other exigence of service  since no longer for others but their own sakes they  must continue the struggle Determined there fore to proceed in this manner they dispatch Pisander and half the former deputation once more to Athens to manage the execution of the project there To whom farther instructions were given at whatever places in their dependency they should touch upon the voyage to set up the oligarchy The other half they sent se verally about to other of the dependent States Dio trephes also who was now at Chios but appointed to take upon him the command of the Thracian pro vinces they ordered away immediately to his post Diotrephes upon his arrival at Thasus dissolved the popular government And in the second month at most aster this the Thasians fortified their city as men who no longer cared for an aristocracy under Athenian influence but were in daily expectation of receiving liberty from the Laced√ monians For a number of their countrymen driven out by the Athenians were now refuged among the Peloponnesians These were labouring the point with their correspondents in Tha sus to bring off their shipping and declare a revolt The 334 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIff The present alteration therefore fell out exactly to their own wish their State was restored to its ancient form without any trouble and the people who alone were able to disconcert them were divested of their power In Thasus therefore the event took an op posite turn to what those Athenians who labcired the oligarchy had at heart  and in my judgement the cafe was the fame with many other of their dependent States For having now their eyes open to their own welfare and being exempted from the dread of suffer ing for what others did they ran into the scheme of a total independence which they preferred before the precarious situation of being well governed by the A thenians Pisander and his collegues in the course of their voy age observed their instructions and dissolved the popular governments in the cities where they touched From some of these they also procured parties of heavy armed to aid them in the grand project and so landed at A thens Here they find affairs in great forwardness through the activity of their accomplices For some of the younger fort having combined together in a plot against Androcles who had the greatest sway amongft the people and had also been deeply concerned in ba nishing Alcibiades they secretly dispatch him Oil him for a double reason because of his influence with the people and with the thought that it might oblige Alcibiades whose recallment was now expected and through his interest the friendsliip of Tiflaphernes they chose first to wreak their fury Of some others also whose instability they doubted they had rid them selves by the same practices A specious harangue had farther been dresled up for the purpose that  none ought to receive the public money but such as served ¬ the State in war with their persons that affairs of  state ought not to be communicated to more than  five thousands and those to be  men who were best    qualified B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 335  qualified by their estates and personal bravery to serve the public This with the majority of the city had a fair outside since such as should concur in the change bid fairest for a share in the administration Yet still the assembly of the people and the council of the bean continued their meetings but then they only passed such decrees as were approved by the cabal Nay of this number were all who spoke and who had previously considered together what should be said upon every occasion No other person presumed at any time to oppose their mo tions through dread of a cabal which they saw was large or did any one venture to open his mouth by some dextrous contrivance he was certainly put to death Who were the agents in these murders no en quiry at all and of who were suspected no kind of jus tification The people on the contrary looked on with stupid gaze and such a fit of consternation as to think it clear gain not yet to have suffered violence e ven though they held their tongues imagining be sides that the conspiracy had spread much farther than it really had they were quite dispirited To discover any certainty of their numbers they were quite unable because of the great extent of the city and their igno rance how far their neighbours might be concerned On the fame account it was also impossible for him who deeply resented his condition to bemoan himself in the hearing of another or to participate counsels for reci procal desence he must either have opened his mind to one whom he did not know or to an acquaintance in whom he durst not conside for all the popular party regarded one another with jealous eyes as in some measure involved in the present machinations Some in fact were concerned who could never have been suspec ted of oligarchical principles and these men gave rise to the great disfidence which spread amongst the many and drew after ic the highest security tothefchemes of the  Tb senate  33 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL few as it kept alive that mutual distrust which reigned among the people Pisander therefore and his associates arriving at this very juncture gave the finishing stroke without de lay In the first place having called an assembly of the people they moved for a decree ‚ That a commit  tee of ten mould be elected with full discretionary  power This committee of ten mould draw up the  form of a decree to be reported to the people on a  day presixed in what manner the State may be best administered In the next place when that day came they summoned an assembly of the people at Co lonus This is a temple of Neptune without the city and distant from it about  ten stadia And here the committee reported no other proposal than this ‚ That  it be lawful for any Athenian to deliver whatever o  pinion he himself thought proper They then en acted heavy penalties against any man who hereafter mould accuse the speaker of a breach of law or should bring him into any trouble whatever This being done it was now without the least re serve or ambiguity moved ‚ That  no magistrate  whatsoever should continue in his post upon the old  establishment nor receive a public salary but that  five f presidents be chosen who should choose one  hundred persons and each of these hundred should  name three persons for associates That these per  sons should enter into the senate be invested abso  lutely with the administration and should farther be  impowered to convene the five thousand whenever  they should deem it proper Pisander was the person who made this proposal and who also in other respects shewed himself openly one of the most zealous to pull down the democracy But he who contrived the whole of the plan and by what steps the affair should be thus carried into execution ‚ One English mile was B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 337 was Antipho a man who in personal merit was second to no Athenian then alive and the greatest genius of his time to devise with sagacity and ingeniousty to express what he had once devised At the assemblies of the people or any public debate he never assisted if he could possibly decline it since the ¬ ¬ ¬ ¬ wasjealous of the great reputation he had gained Yet in the courts of judicature or appeals to the people he was the only person who was able effectually to serve those clients who could get him for their patron And this same Antipho when in pro cess of time the government of the four hundred was quite demolished and severely prosecuted by ihepeople is judged to have defended their conduct and plt aded in a cause where his own life was at stake the best of any person that down to this time was ever heard to speak Phrynichus also was another who singularly distin guished himself in his zeal for the oligarchy He dreaded Alcibiades as conscious that he was privy to the whole of the correspondence he had carried on with Astyo chus He proceeded thus on the supposition that Al cibiades would never be restored by an oligarchical go vernment And then he was a man in whose capacity and zeal if once engaged the greatest considence might reasonably be placed  Theramencs farther the son of Agnon a man who both in speaking and acting made no ordinary figure had a principal share in the dissolution of the popular government No wonder therefore as the business was managed by so many and so able agents that spite of every obstacle it was brought to effect Grie vous indeed it was to the Athenian people to submic to the loss of their liberty a century after the expulsion of their tyrants during which period they had not only been independent but accustomed for above half that space to give law to others To return When in the assembly of the people not a soul was heard to oppose the motion it passed into a law and the assembly was adjourned They aster Vol II Z wards 338 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR B VllI wards introduced the four hundred into the senate in the following manner The whole body of the citizehs were daily under arms either upon the Walls or in the field to bridle the excursions of the enemv from Decelea Therefore on the day appointed they susfered such as were not ih the secret to repair to their posts as usual But to those in the plot it had been privately notified by rtd means to repair to their posts but to lag behind at   distance and in cafe any one should strive to oppose what was now to be agitated they should take up arms and quell all opposition Those to whotri these orders were previously imparted were the An drians and Teiians three hundred of the Carysthians and other persons now established in √ gina whom the Athenians had sent thither by way of colony but Were how invited to repair to Athens with their arms to sup port the scheme When these dispositions Were formed the four hundred each carrying a concealed dagger and guarded by one hundred and twenty youths of Greece whose hands they had employed when assassination was ihe point broke in upon the  counsellors of the ieatl who were this moment sitting in the senate house and called out to them  to quit the place and take thik  f salaries Accordingly they had ready fo them the full arrears due to them which they paid to each as he went out of the house In this manner the Senate without giving the least opposition removed themselves tamely from their office and the rest of the citizens trade no effort to check such proceedings and re frained from any the least tumult The four hundred having thus gained poflessjOh ¬ f the senate house proceeded immediatefy tfd ballot Fdr a ¬ set of presidents from amongst their own body  ahd  The senate cfJive hundred s The stated salary for a senator of

magistrates exe cute their office By their subsequent proceedings they introduced considerable alterations in the popular form of government  excepting that on account of Alci biades they refrained from recalling exiles But in all other respects they ruled with all possible severity Some persons whose removal was deemed convenient though sew in number they got assassinated some they threw into prison and some they banished Tp Agis also king of the Laced√ monians who was still ac Decelea they dispatched a deputation notifying their readiness to accommodate all disputes and that with greater considence he might proceed to make  up matters with them than with a democracy which was not to be trusted Agis full of the imagination that the city would not quietly submit to these changes and that the people would not thus tamely pare with their ancient liberty or should they now behold his numerous army ap proaching that public combustions must ensue amongst them unable to persuade himself that at the present juncture they could possibly be kept from tumult Agis I say returned no proposal of terms to the depu tation which came to him from the four hundred Buc having sent for a numerous reinforcement from Pelo ponnesus he advanced soon after with the garrison of Decelea and the frestj reinforcements up to the very walls of Athens He took this step on the presump tion that  thus either thrown into utter confusion  they might be mastered whenever he gave the word  or even at the first sight of his approach through the great confusion which in all probability must fol  low both within and without Since to make hirn self master of their long walls as there could not be  hands at leisure for their defence he could not fail But when upon his nearer approach the Athenians within were thrown into no stir or bustle at all when ¬ 2 even 34o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII even they caused their cavalry and detachments of their heavy armed light armed and archers to sally out into the field who made a slaughter of such as were too far advanced and became masters of their arms and dead bodies  ‚ finding then he had proceeded upon wrong presumptions he again drew oft7 his army Af ter this he himself with the former garrison conti nued in the post of Decelea j but the late reinforce ment after some continuance in the country was sent back to Peloponnesus Yet subsequent to this the four hundred persisted in sending deputies to Agis with as much eagerness as e ver j and he now receiving them in a better manner with encouragements to proceed they even send an em bassy to Laced√ mon to propose a treaty being of all things desirous to obtain an accommodation They also send to Samos a deputation of ten in or der to satisfy the army and give them ample assurance that  the oligarchy was not set up for the prejudice ei ther of the State or any individuals but as the only expedient left to preserve the whole community ‚ that the number of those who now had the manage   ment was five thousand and not barely four hundred 1 and yet on no occasion whatever had the Athenians partly through employs in their armies abroad or o   ther foreign avocations ever met together to consult on affairs of state in a number so large as five thou  sand Having instructed them to insert some other alleviating pleas they sent them away upon the first in stant of the change they had made apprehensive of what actually came to pass that the bulk of their seamen would never quietly submit to an oligarchical govern ment and an opposition beginning there might over turn all that had hitherto been done For at Samos some stirs had already arose about the oligarchy and that which is now to be recited happened exactly at the time that the four hundred seized the admi nistration at Athens The B VIIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 341 The party which at this juncture was subsisting atSa mos against the nobility and were of the popular side having now altered their schemes and followed the sug gestions of Pilander ever since his return from Athens and gained the concurrence of Athenians at Samos combined together by oath to the number of about three hundred and resolved to fall upon their antagonists as factious on the side of the people Accordingly they murder one  Hyperbolus an Athenian a scurvy fel Z 3 low  Thii wai the person whom the ostracism made in some measure famous and who made the ostracism quite infamous Plutarch hath repeated the story thrice The following extract is taken from the life of Nicias When the opposition wai very hot at Athena between Alcibiades and Nicias  and the day for ostracixtng was drawing on which at certain intervals the peu  pie of Athens were used to inforce and fend away into a ten years exile some one citizen suspected of designs against their liberty or odious for being too il lustrious or rich ‚ ‚ each of these grand competitors was under grievous appre ¬ hensions and with reason too that it might be hit own lot to be exiled on this occasion Alcibiades was hated for his way of life and for his bold and enter prising genius Nicias was envied on account of his wealth hit way of living was neither sociable nor popular as he avoided a crowd and herded with a few intimates he gave great distaste  besides as he had often opposed the caprices of the people and constrained them to pursue their real interest he was deep in  their displeasure In short the contest ran high between the young and military men on one side and the old pacific Athenians on the other whilst each were endeavouring to throw the ostracism upon the hated object But Parties ran high and scoundrels got renown Such distensions in the community gave scope to knaves and incendiaries There  was one Hyperbolus of Ferithadae very assuming without the least reason to be fo however by dint of impudence working himself into power and the disgrace  of his country so soon as he had made himself conspicuous in it On this oc canon Hyberbolus could have no suspicion of becoming himself the butt of an eftratijm he had a much better title to the gallows Presuming on the contrary that when either of these great men were exiled he himself could easily make head against the other he manifested great pleasure at the contest and irritated the fury of the people against them both Nicias and Alcibiades perceiving hla roguish intent conferred privately together and getting their several factions to unite secured one another and threw the votes on Hyperbolus Such a turn at first gave the Athenians much pleasure and diversion j yet soon after they were  highly chagrined by reflecting that making such a scoundrel the object of it was fluming the ostraeijm for ever There was dignity even in punishments The  ostracism was of such a nature u to suit a Thucydides an Aristides and men of iuch 3 1 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL low and banished by the ostracism not from a dread of his influence or weight but for the profligacy of his life and his being a public disgrace to his country In this they were countenanced by Charminus one of the commanders and some of the Athenians afibciated with them to whom they gave this pledge of their sidelity Some other acts of the fame nature they committed by instructions from them and had it in agitation to multi ply their blows but those marked out for destruction getting wind of their design communicate the whole to Leon and Diomedon who thought of an oligarchy with high regret because their credit was high with the peo ple to Thrasybulus also andThrasyllus the former captain of a trireme and the latter of a band of heavy armed and to such others as were judged most likely to stem the fury of the conspirators These they con such exalted characters It was dear honour to Hyperbolus and gave him room to boast that though a scoundrel he had been distinguistied like the greats and best Athenians as Plato the comic poet fays of him He always acted worthy of himself But quite unworthy of luch high reproof The jhtll was ne er design d to honour scoundrels In a word no person was ever banished by the ostracism after Hyperbolus j it was he who closed the list  Thrasybulus whose name now first occurs acts a very high spirited and noble yart in the close of this history If virtue could be weighed merely by itself without any regard to outward circumstance I should not hesitate fays Cor nelius Nepos to prefer him before all the great men in Greece But I aver that not one of them ever surpassed him in integrity in resolution in grandeur of soul and true patriotism ‚ Yet 1 know not how it it though nobody excelled him in real merit many have outstripped him in point of fame In the Peloponnesian war ibi tpart if it vibicb n m rtmaim Thrasybulus did many things without Aleibiades

of Thrasybulus his exploits separately fronvsnd in concert with Akibiades But the iglory of his lite was ridding Athens some year s after of thirty tyrants at a blow fer which he was rewarded by a

without leaving them some ships for their guard insomuch that when the three hundred made their attempt as all these united in their obstruction but most heartily of all the Para Mans the popular party at Samos was rescued from de struction Thirty of those three hundred they even slaughtered and three of the most factious amongst the iurviyars they doomed to banishment Then havings published

turned over from that vessel into another ship of war and ordered che n away as a guard ship for the station of Eub≈ a But Cti√ reas sensible in what train affairs were going ijiad he good fortune to make his escape and return ing again to Saraos related to the soldiery all that had been done in Athens exaggerating every point with a fottndantisoveritiy r ‚ That every citizen was now kept 4 in a vsie‚ wi ch whips and scourges and that even their Z 4 ‚ own 34 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIIL own wives and children daily felt the insolence of those tyrants nay they have it now in agitation that  if any on duty at Samos shall presume to oppose their pleasure immediately to arrest and imprison the whole of their kindred and in case the former will not  submit to put the latter to death On many other points he also expatiated all aggravated with false hoods His audience in the first instant of their passion were fully bent on the destruction of all those who had appeared most active for an oligarchy and in short of all who had any hand in its promotion but being stop ped by the interposition of others more moderate and listening to the remonstrance that  they ought not to  accelerate the ruin of their country now that a fleet of the enemy lay almost ranged against them for bat  tie they desisted And afterwards those who had openly avowed the design of restoring the democra tical form at Samos namely Thrasybulus the son of Ly cus and Thrasyllus for these had the principal agen cy in this new revolution caused every soldier to swear the most solemn oaths more especially such as were for an oligarchy that  they would submit to no form but  the democracy and would act in this cause with gene ral unanimity and farther would zealously prose cute the war against the Pcloponnesians that eternal enemies they would remain to the four hundred and would enter into no treaty of accommodation with them All the Samians farther that were old e nough to bear arms took the fame oaths and hence forth the army communicated all their asfairs to the Sa mians and gave them an insight into all the dangers which might attend the sequel convinced that other wise no sase resource remained for either but if the four hundred or the enemy at Miletus proved too hard for them their ruin was unavoidable Terrible were the present embroilments of the times whilst those at Samos were striving to re establish the de n  mocracy B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 345 mocracy at Athens and those at Athens to force an olu garcbical form upon the army The soldiers farther immediately summoned a general assembly in which they deposed their former commanders and all such captains of triremes as fell under their suspicions and then chose others to fill up the vacancies both captains of triremes and land commanders amongst whom were Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus The last rose up in the assembly and encouraged them by every topic of per suasion particularly ‚ ‚ that  they had not the least reason to be dispirited though Athens itscif had re volted from them for this was merely the secession  of a minority from men whose numbers were greater  and who were better furnished for every exigence  because the whole navy of Athens was their own by  which they could compel dependent states to pay in their former contingents of tribute as fully as if they  sailed on such an errand from Athens itself Even yet they were masters of a city at Samos a city despi  cable in no respect but which once in a former war  had well nigh wrested the empire of the sea from the Athenians The feat of war in regard to their  public enemies would continue the fame as it was  before nay by being masters of the fleet they  were better enabled to procure all the needful sup plies than their opponents who were now at Athens  It was purely owing to their own peculiar situation at Samos that the others had hitherto been masters of the  entrance into the Pir√ us and they soon should be 4 highly distressed if they refused to restore them their  ancient polity since these at Samos could more easily  bar them the use of the sea than be barred up by  them What assistances Athens had hitherto given  them against the enemy were but trifling and of no  real importance Nothing could be lost from that  quarter which was no longer able to supply them  with money since with that they had been supplied  by the army nor to send them any valuable instruc  tions 346 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII dons for the sake of which alone the troops abroad were submissive to the orders of the State at home  Nay in some points those at Athens had most egre gioufly offended since they had overturned the Jaws  of their country which those here had preserved and  were exerting their efforts to compel others to the oh servance of them and therefore in every method of valuation the men who here provided well for the public welfare were in no respect worse patriots  than the men at Athens Even Alcibiades sliould  they grant him an indemnity and a afe return  would readily procure them the king s alliance And  what had the greatest weight should they mifcarry  in every branch of their present designs many pla  ces of refuge lay always open to men possessed of so 4 considerable a fleet in which they might find fresh cities and another country After such occurrences in the aflembly convened by the soldiery and theconclusion of their mutual exhor tations they continued their preparations for war with unremitting diligence But the deputation of ten sent from the four hundred to Sacnos being informed of these proceedings when they were advanced in their voyage io far as Dek s thought proper to proceed no farther About this very time the iPelopownesiaos on board the fleet stationed at Miletus clangoured loudly amongst themselves that  they are betrayed toy Aftyocbus and  Tifiaphernes as the former had already refused to  engage when themselves were hearty and in fine condition and the fleet of the Athenians was small j  nor would do so even now when the latter are repor M ted lo be embroiled with intestine seditions andtheir  own ships are daily impairing but under pretextof a  Ph≈ nician fleet to be brought up by Tifiaphernes an aid merely nominal and which would never join ‚ them he was ruining all by dilatory measures And ‚ as for Tifiaphernes it was never his intention to bring  up chat Atti t but ¬ e was p lainly undermining the  strength B VI1I THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 347 ‚ strength of theirs by not supplying them constantly and fully with their pay The time therefore they  insisted ought no longer to be thus idly wasted but an engagement hazarded at once Yet in such cla mours thole deepest concerned were the Syracusans The confederates and Astyochus himself being af fected with these clamours and having declaimed in a council of war for engaging the enemy forthwith as they had received undoubted intelligence of the confu sions at Samos putting out to sea with the whole of their fleet amounting to a hundred and twelve sail and having ordered the Milesians to march thither over land they stood away for Mycale At GJauc√ of My cale the Athenians were now lying with eighty two ships of the Samian department For in this quarter of Mycale Samos lies but a small distance from the con tinent But when they saw the fleet of the Peiopon ¬ esians approaching they retired to Samos judging their own strength insufficient for an engagement with the foe which might prove decisive Besides as they had discovered the intention of those at Miletus to ven ture An engagement they expected Strombichides from the Hellespont who was to bring to their assistance the ships on the station of Chios which had gone up to Abydus and a message had already been dispatched to hasten him up For these reasons they plied away to Samos The Peloponnesians arriving at Mycale en camped upon the shore along with the land forces of the Milesians and those sent in by the bordering people On the next day when they were fully bent on stand ing directly against Samos advice is brought them that Strombichides is come up with the ships from the  Hellespontupon which they made the best of their way back again to Miletus And now the Athenians having gained so large an accession of strength shew themselves immediately before Miletus with a hun dred and eight fail desirous of coming to an engage  ‚  ‚  ¬ i rhent 348 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII ment with the enemy But as nothing stirred out against them they also returned to Samos In the same summer immediately after the former movements the Peloponnesians ‚ who had waved coming out to an engagement since with the whole of their strength they thought themselves by no means a match for their enemy and were now reduced to great perplexities about the methods of procuring subsistence for so numerous a fleet especially as Tissaphernes was so remiss in his payments ‚ fend away to Pharnabazus pursuant to the prior instructions from Peloponnesus Clearchus the son of Ramphias with a detachment of forty sail For Pharnabazus had demanded such a force and was ready to support the expences of it and it had been farther notified to them in form that By zantium was ripe for a revolt And thus this detach ment of Peloponnesians having run out far to sea to get clear of the Athenians during the course met with very tempestuous weather The bulk of them it is true with Clearchus rode it out to Delos and from thence return again to Miletus But Clearchus setting out again travelled over land to Hellespont and took upon him the command Ten ships however of rhe detachmenr under Elixus the Megarean who was joined in the command reached the Hellespont without damage and effectuate the revolt of Byzantium The Athenians at Samos informed of these incidents fend away a detachment to the Hellespont to support and guard the adjacent cities And a small engagement happens before Byzantium between eight ships on a fide Those who were in the management at Samos and above all Thrasybulus adhering still to the sentiments they had entertained ever since the last turn of affairs there that Alcibiades must needs be recalled the lat ter at last obtained in full assembly the concurrence of the soldiery Accordingly when they had voted a return and an indemnity to Alcibiades Thrasybulus repaired B VIU THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 349 repaired immediately to Tissaphernes and brought Al cibiades back with him to Samos convinced their last resource depended on his being able to alienate Tissa phernes from the Peloponnesians Hereupon an as sembly being called Alcibiades at large expatiated upon and deplored the malignity of his fate in having been exiled from his country And then having amply run over every topic relating to the present posture of af fairs he raised their expectations high in regard to the future He magnified with a mighty parade of words his own interest in Tissaphernes i from the view not only to intimidate the patrons of the oligarchical go vernment at Athens and put a stop to their cabals but also to render himself more respectable to these at Sa mos and to raise up their considence in him as high as possible ‚ to give the enemy farther as many han dles as he was able to calumniate Tissaphernes and to lower all their present sanguinary expectations These were the schemes of Alcibiades when with all imagi nable ostentation he gave the strongest assurances to his audience that  Tissaphernes had pledged his word to him that could he once firmly depend upon the Athenians they never should be distressed for want of supplies whilst he had any thing left nay though M at last he should be forced to turn into ready cash the  very bed be lay on and the Ph≈ nician fleet already come up to Alpendus he would join with the Athe nians but never with the Peloponnesians The only  pledge of fidelity he required from the Athenians  was for Alcibiades to be recalled and pass his word  for their future conduct The army delighted with these and many other soothing topics proceed immediately to associate him with the rest of the commanders and implicitly trusted every thing to their management Not a man was any longer to be found amongst them who would have parted with his present considence of certain security And revenge on the four hundred for all the treasure in 3so THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII the universe Nay they were ready this very moment upon the strength of what Alcibiades had said to flight the enemy now at hand and steer directly for the Pi r√ us But though numbers with vehemence recom mended the step he stopped their ardour by remon strances that  they ought by no means to think of steering for the Pir√ us and leave their nearer ene mies upon their backs But in relation to the ope  rations of war since he was elected a general he said he would first go and confer with Tissaphernes the assembly was no sooner dissolved than he immedi ately departed that he might appear in all respects to be perfectly united with Tissaphernes  desirous also to raise himself in his esteem and give him a sensible proof that he was appointed a general and by virtue of this enabled either to do him service or to do him harm It was the peculiar fortune of Alcibiades to awe the Athenians by Tissaphernes and Tissaphernes by the Athenians The Peloponnesians at Miletus had no sooner heard of the recal of Alcibiades than as before they suspected treachery in Tissaphernes they now loudly vented in vectives against him What more inflamed them was that ever since the Athenians shewed themselves before Miletus and they had refused to put out to sea and en gage them Tissaphernes had flackened more than ever in his payments and thus hated by them for that reason sufficiently before he now became more odious on account of Alcibiades The soldiery again as on former occasions ran together in parties and enume rated their grievances Nay some of higher ranks persons of real importance and not merely the private men were full of remonstrances that  they had at  no time received their full subsistence his payments u had been always scanty and even those had never  been regular In snort unless they were led di  rectly against the enemy or carried to some other and would then proceed to action ¬  ¬ station B VIIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 35s  station where they might be sure of subsistence the crews would abandon their vessels And the whole blame of all that befel ought to be charged upon Astyochus who for private lucre endured patiently the caprices of Tissaphernes Employed as they were in thus enumerating grievances a tumult actually broke out against Astyochus For the mariners belong ing to the Syracusan and Thurian vessels by how much they enjoyed the greatest liberty of all others in the fleet by so much the more heightened confidence did they flock about him and demand their pay Upon this Astyochus returned an answer too full of spirit threat ening hard  that Dorian who seconded and encoura ged the demands of his men and even lifting up his stars and shaking it at him This was no sooner per ceived by the military croud than seamen as they were with a loud uproar they rushed at Astyochus to knock him down But aware of their design he flies for refuge to an altar He escaped indeed without any blows and the fray was ended without any harm committed   The Milesians also made themselves ‚ masters by fur prise of a fort erected by Tissaphernes at Miletus and oblige the garrison left in it to evacuate the place These things pleased the rest of the allies and not least of all the Syracusans Lichas however was by no means satisfied with these proceedings Ht insisted  the Milesians were obliged in duty to be submissive  to Tissaphernes and that all others who lived in the  dominions of the king lay under the same obligation and were bound to pay due regard to his juct autho  rity till such time as the war was handsofnely com  pleted This drew upon him the re sent mem of the Milesians and because of these expressions and some others of the fame nature when he afterwards died of a natural disease they woutd not suffer him to be bu  Hermortate     ried 352 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII ried in a spot of ground which the Laced√ monians who were amongst them had chose for his interment Whilst asfairs were thus sadly embroiled between the foldiery on one side and Astyochus and Tissaphernes on the other Mindarus arrived from Laced√ mon as suc cessor to Astyochus in the chief command of the fleer Accordingly he takes the command upon him and Astyochus sailed away for home But with him as embassador Tissaphernes sent one of his own creatures by name Gaulites aCarian who spoke both languages to accuse the Milesians about the seizure of the fort and also to make apologies for his conduct He knew that the Milesians were already set out with an outcry chiefly against him and that Hermocrates was gone with them well armed with proofs that Tissaphernes in concert with Alcibiades basfled all the Peloponnesian schemes and basely tampered with both the warring parties But an enmity had always subsisted between these two about the payments of subsistence And at length when Hermocrates was banished from Syra cuse and other Syracusans came to Miletus to take upon them the command of the Syracusan vessels namely Potamis and Myscon and Demarchus Tissaphernes vented his choler more bitterly than ever against Hermocrates now an exile and amongst his other accusations of him asfirmed that  he had de manded a sum of money which being refused him he had ever since declared himself his enemy As tyochus therefore and the Milesians and Hermo crates are now sailed for Laced√ mon By this time also Alcibiades had repassed from Tissa phernes to Samos And from Delos the deputation lent from the four hundred on the late revolution to soothe and gain the concurrence of those at Samos ar rive also whilst Alcibiades is there Upon which an assembly being called they endeavoured to open the cause The soldiers at first refused to hear them and ioared aloud for the murder of those who had over turned RVIH THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 353 turned the popular government At length with great difficulty being quieted they gave them a hearing The deputies remonstrated that  not for the ruin of Athens was this new change introduced but purely for its preservation ‚ in no wise to betray it into the hands of the enemy  because that might  have been done effectually upon the late approach of its enemy to her walls since they were in power Every single person amongst the five thousand was intended to have a regular share in the administra tion Their friends and relations are not treated in an insolent manner as Ch√ reas had maliciously sug  gested to them nay were not in the least molested but every where remained in the undisturbed posses fion of their property Though on these topics they amply enlarged yet they were heard with no manner of complacence but with manifest indignation Different methods of pro ceeding were recommended by different persons but the majority declared for sailing away at once for the Pir√ us On this occasion Alcibiades first shewed him self a true patriot nay as much a patriot as ever A thenian had been For when the Athenians at Samos were hurried furioufly along to invade their own selves the plain consequence of which was giving up at once Ionia and Hellespont to their public foes he mollified their fury and at a crisis when no other man living could have been able to restrain the multitude he per suaded them to desist from this strange invasion and by reprimanding those whose private resentments burst out most violently against the deputies prevented mis chief At length he himself dismissed them with the following answer ‚ That  the administration in the hands of five thousand he had no intention to oppose  But he ordered them to give an immediate discharge to the four hundreds and to restore the council of five hundred to their prior state If farther from a  principle of frugality they had made retrenchments Vol II A a in  3S4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIH  in order that those who served in the armies of the  State might be better subsisted he praised them alto  gether He then recommended to them a steady re  sistance and by no means in any shape to give way  to the enemy For could the State once be secured  from its public fops a reconciliation amongst its members might easily be hoped for but should  either party be once destroyed either this at Samos or theirs at Athens none would soon be left to be  reconciled at all There were present at this audience embassadors from the Argives who brought assurances of aid to the peo ple of Athens at Samos Alcibiadcs commended them for their zeal j and then exhorting them to hold them selves in readiness to come upon a summons sent he civilly dismissed them These Argives came to Samos in company with the Paralians who had been lately turned over by the four hundred into a vessel of war to cruize round Eubcea and to carry to Laced√ mon the embassadors L√ spodias Aristophon and Melesius sent thither from the four kundred But when ad vanced to the height of Argos they put the embassa dors under arrest as chief agents in pulling down the democracy and delivered them up to the Argives They had no business now at Athens and so came from Argos to Samos convoying the Argive embassadors in the trireme which they had seized The fame summer Tissaphernes ‚ about that junc ture of time in which the Peloponnesians were most fu rious against him for the other reasons and the recall ment of Alcibiades as having now pulled off the mask and declared for the Athenians ‚ desirous as in truth it appeared to efface the bad impressions they had en tertained of him got ready to go to Aspendus to the Ph≈ nician fleet and prevailed with Lichas to bear him company In regard to the Peloponnesians he decla red that he substituted his own lieutenant Tamas to pay them their subsistence whilst he himself should be absent B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 355 absent Various accounts are vented about this step i nor can it certainly be known with what view he re paired to Aspendus or why when there he did not bring up the fleet That a Ph≈ nician fleet confiding of one hundred forty seven sail was now come up to Aspendus is allowed on all sides but why they did not come forwards is variously conjectured Some think he went out of sight merely to carry on his old scheme of wearing away the Peloponnesians  and in consequence of this Tamas paid in their subsistence which he was ordered to pay not better but even worse than Tissaphernes Others fay it was that since he save large sums by dismissing them there as he never had sincerely designed to make use of their service Others again attribute it to a desire to quiet the cla mours against him at Laced√ mon and to get himself represented there as one abounding in good faith and who is actually gone to bring up a fleet fairly and ho nestly fitted out for service But in my opinion the true solution of the mystery is this He would not bring them up merely to wear out and to balance the strength of the Grecians that during his absence and this studied prolongation the latter might be running into ruin and farther for the fake of balancing to join with neither party for fear of making them too strong for had he once determi ned to join heartily in the war the consequence was cer tain beyond a doubt Had he brought them up to join the Laced√ monians he must in all probability have gi ven them the victory since already their naval strength was rather equal than inferior to that of their opponents But that their ruin alone was designed by him is plain from the excuse he made for not bringing up that fleet He pretended they were fewer in number than the king bad ordered to be assembled yet if this were so he might have ingratiated himself more abundantly with the kingy if he made a great saving of money for his mas  Ph≈ nicians to Aspendus he might A a 2 ter 356 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII ter and with less expence had accomplished his service To Aspendus however whatever was his view Tissa phernes repairs and joins the Ph≈ nicians nay far ther at his own desire the Peloponnesians sent Philip pus a noble Laced√ monian with two triremes to take charge of this fleet Alcibiades had no sooner received intelligence that Tissaphernes was at Aspendus than taking with him thirteen sail he hastened thither after him promising to those at Samos an assured and important piece of ser vice For  he would either bring the Ph≈ nician fleet to the Athenians or at least prevent their junc tion with the Peloponnesians It is probable that from a long acquaintance he was privy to the whole intention of Tissaphernes never to bring up this fleet and his project was now to render Tissaphernes still more odious to the Peloponnesians for the regard he shewed to himself and the Athenians that so he might at last be necessitated to strike in with the latter He stood away therefore directly by Phaselis and Caunus and held oh his course upwards The deputation sent from the car hundred being re turned from Samos to Athens reported the answer of Alcibiades how  he encouraged them to hold  out and give way in no shape to the enemy and that his confidence was great he should be able tho roughly to reconcile them with the army and give them victory over the Peloponnesians By this re port they very much revived the spirits of many of those who had a share in the oligarchy and yet would gladly extricate themselves from the business upon assurances of indemnity They had already begun to hold sepa rate cabals and shew open discontent at the train of af fairs They were headed by some of principal authori ty even in the present oligarchy and who filled the great offices of state namely Theramenes  the son of Ag non  Theramenes was very expert at turning about and shifting his party He got by it the nick name of Cothurnus or the Bujkin because the tragedians bulkin was made B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 357 non and Aristocrates the son of Sicelius and others who were most deeply concerned in late transac tions and from a dread as they gave our of the army at Samos and Alcibiades had concurred in sending an embassy to Laced√ mon lest by unseasonable dissents from the majority they might have done mischief to the public Not that they hasted themselves even now to put an utter end to the oligarchical government but to inforce the necessity of making use of the five thousand not merely in name but in act and to render the polity more equal This was it must be owned the politi cal scheme which they all pretended but through pri vate ambition the majority had given into that course by which an oligarchy founded upon the ruins of a de mocracy is ripe for subversion For it was the daily claim of each single person concerned not to be equal with the rest but to be pre eminently the first where as when out of a democracy a preference is awarded the distinction is the more easily brooked as if it were the real consequence os superior worth But what of a certainty elevated them most was the great influence of Alcibiades at Samos and their own conscioulnels that this business of an oligarchy carried with it no pros pect of firm or lasting continuance A contention therefore ensued among them which of them should shew the greatest zeal for the people But such of the four hundred as made the greatest op position to this new scheme and were leaders of their party  ‚ namely Phrynichus who formerly during made large enough for any foot to go into it He was however a man of great abili ties and generally regarded as a lover of his country His turns were dextrous well timed and made with a view of public good Caesar when making Cicero a compliment likened him to Theramenes He was deeply concerned in all the subse quent revo utions at Athens He put the finishing hand to the peace with the Lace d√ monians after the talcing of Athens by Lyfander when they demolished their long walls opened their harbours and gave up their shipping He was afterwards nominally one of the thirty tyrants For he soon began to oppose them first with moderation then with vehemence j which exasperated them so that they put him to death A a 3 his 358 THE PELOPONNES1AN WAR B VHI his employment as general at Samos had embroiled himself with Alcibiades and Aristarchus one of the most violent and also most inveterate opponents of the people and Pisander and Antipho and others of the greatest influence amongst them who formerly upon establishing themselves first in the government and ever since the army at Samos had dissented from them in fa vour of the democracy had bestirred themselves in send ing embassies to Laced√ mon in more firmly establish ing the oligarchy and erecting a new fortification on the spot which is called Eetionela these I fay exer ted themselves with much greater ardour than ever since the return of the deputies from Samos as they plainly saw the inclinations os numbers and some of their own body on whose perseverance they had highly de pended were intirely changed They even caused An tipho and Phrynichus and ten others to set out with all expedition so apprehensive were they of fresh op position both in Athens itself and from Samos and charged them with instructions to strike up an accom modation with the Laced√ monians upon any tolerable terms they could possibly procure They also carried on with redoubled diligence the new works at EetioneKa These works were intended as was given out by Thera menes and his party not se much to keep out of the Pir√ us those from Samos should they endeavour to attempt it as to enable themselves at their own discretion to receive both the ships and land forces of the enemy  for Eetioneia is the mole of the Pir√ us and the entrance into it opens at the end of this mole The new work was therefore joined in such a manner to that which guarded it before on the side of the land that a small party posted behind could command the entrance For the extremities of it were continued down to the fort in the very mouth of the harbour which was narrow j and both the old wall which was built on the land side and this new fortification within reached down to the sea They also enlarged arid secured the great portico which adjoined B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 35 adjoined to the new work erected in the Pir√ us and kept it intirely in their own custody Here they obliged all the citizens to lodge what corn they already had and all that should hereafter be imported and here on ly to expose it to sale and to vend it These proceedings had for a long time drawn sharp1 insinuations from Theramehes arid when the embassy returned from Laced√ mon without bringing to any mariner of issue a general accommodation for the wholei of the Std et he averred that  by this new work the  safety of the city toas visibly endangered For from Peloponnesus at this instant of time at the rex quest of the Eub≈ ans no less than forty two fail of hips were on the coast of Laconia some of which were Ita lian from Tarentum and from Locri and some Sici lian and all were now bound sor Eub≈ a At the head of this equipment was Hegesandridas a Spartan the son of Hegesander Theramenes maintained that it was set out less for Eub≈ a thdri for those who were now fortifying at Eetiorieia j ants unless we stand upon our guard they will surprise and corh plete the rilin of Athens There was really some thing in the conduct of the rrien he accused to counte nance this charge nor was it merely thev Outcry of slan der Those who now composed the oligarchy were principally desirous to preserve in their hands the whole appenage of the republic j if this were impracticable to secure the shipping and walls and subsist with inde pendence but should they be unable to compass this rather than fall the first victims to the democracy re esta blished to let in the enemy and resigning their ship ping and fortifications to make any terms whatever for theState provided they could obtain security for their own persons They accelerated therefore this nev work which was lo contrived as to have posterns and sally ports and passages enow to let in the enemy and they proceed with all imaginable dispatch in order to outstrip prevention A a 4 Hitherto 360 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII Hitherto indeed this charge against them had only been whispered with an air of secrecy amongst a few But when Phrynichus upon his return from the em bassy to Laced√ mon was treacherously stabbed by one of the patrole in the forum at the hour of public resort bjing got but a few steps from the house where the council was sitting and dropped down dead upon the spot when farther the assassin made his escape and a stranger from Argos who assisted at the fact being apprehended and tortured by the four hundred discovered not the name of any one person who set them pn nor made any farther confession than that he knew large numbers met at the house of the officer who commanded the patrole and at other places ‚ then at length as nothing could be made of this affair Theramenes and Aristocrates and as many either of the scur hundred or of others as were combined with them proceeded to act in a more open and resolute manner For by this time the fleet was come round from Laco nia and riding before Epidaurus had made ravages upon √ gina Theramenes therefore averred it impro bable that  were they intended for Euboea they would ever have put into √ gina and then go again and lie at Epidaurus unless they had been sent out at f the express invitation of those whom he had always  accused of traiterous designs and it was impossible to be passive any longer under such practices In fine after many speeches made to excite a tumult and many suspicions disseminated abroad they fell to work jn earnest For the heavy armed posted in the Pir√ us to carry on the new works of Eetione ia amongst whom Aristocrates himself was employed at the head of his own band lay under an arrest Alexicles who com manded there for the oligarchy and was a most vehe ment adversary to the opposite party and carrying him into a houie put him under confinement To this action they were also emboldened by the concurrence of others as well as by Hermon who commanded the patrole B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 361 patrole assigned for Munichia and what was of most importance it was openly countenanced by the whole body of the heavy armed The news of it was imme diately carried to the four hundred who were this mo ment assembled together in council and all except ing those dissatisfied with their measures were ready to run to arms and vented terrible threats against Thera menes and his associates But he apologizing for himself declared his readi ness to take up arms along with them and attend them to the rescue of Alexicles and taking with him one of the generals who was in his secret he hurried down to the Pir√ us Aristarchus also ran down to assist as did farther the young men belonging to the cavalry of the State Great in truth was the tumult and full of horror For those who were left in the upper city imagined that the Pir√ us was already seized and that Alexicles was lain and they in the Pir√ us each moment expected an assault from those in the city Not without difficulty could the men of years and experience stop such as were wildly running up and down the streets and rushing to arms And Thucydides the Pharsalian public host of the State who happened then to be at Athens threw himself with lively zeal in the way ot all who were flock ing down conjuring them earnestly  not to finish f the ruin of their country when the enemy lay so near to strike the blow But thus at length their fury abated and the effusion of one another s blood was prevented As for Theramenes he was no sooner got down to the Pir√ us than assuming authority for he himself was at this time a general he pretended to rate the heavy armed for this piece of mutiny at least so far as mere making a noise could do it whilst Aristarchus and all the opposite faction were angry with them in earnest But the bulk of the heavy armed drew together in a body and betray no sign of regret for what they had done 362 THE PELOPONNESIAtt WAR fc VIII done Nay they demanded aloud from Therarrieries ‚  If in his judgement these new Works were raised  with a good design or would not better be derilo lifhed His reply was this ‚ That  if they  thought it expedient to demolish them his opinion should concur with theirs Hereupon at a signal given the heavy armed and many others who belonged to the Pir√ us rushed on in a moment and pulled down all the new fortification The watch word now published to the multitude was this ‚  Whosoever would have the administration lodged in the five thousand instead of the four hundred let him join in the work For even still they judged it politic to veil their design under the name of the five thousand and not to say downright‚  Whosoever would have the democracy restored ‚ lest possibly the former might have been actually in force and a person speaking to any one of them might spoil all by some inadvertent expressions And on the same ac count the four hundred would neither have the five thousand declared nor yet have it known that they had never been appointed To admit so large a number into a share of the government they judged was in sact a mere democracy but that leaving the matter in sus pense would strike a dread of his neighbour into every Athenian The next morning the four hundred though highly disordered in their politics assembled however in coun cil But those in the Pir√ us after enlarging Alexietes wnom they had put under confinement and comple ting the demolition of the new works marched to the theatre of Bacchus in Munichia and there all armed as they were held a formal assembly and then in pursuance of what had been resolved marched directly into the upper city and posted themselves in the Ana ceum Here they were accosted by a select committee sent from the four hundred who man to man reasoned calmly with them and perceiving any to be tracta B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 363 blc plied them with persuasions to proceed in a gentle manner and to restrain the fury of their associates giving them assurances that  the five thousand would be declared  and from them by regular succession M at the pleasure of the five thousand the sour hundred should be appointed conjuring them in the mean time  not to forward through impatience the de  struction of the State nor give it up for a prey to the public enemy The whole multitude of the heavy armed attentive to these arguments on which many expatiated at large and pressed home upon num bers became more tractable than they were at first and were most terribly alarmed at the mention of the to tal destruction of their polity It was at last concluded that on a set day an assembly should be held in the temple of Bacchus to devise an accommodation But when this assembly to be held in the temple of Bacchus came on and all parties were only not com pletely met comes in the news that  the two and  forty fail and Hegesandridas are coasting along from Megara towards Salamis Not one of the heavy armed this moment but pronounced it true what be fore was given out by Theramenes and his friends that to the new fortifications these ships are now bound and it was judged that in the nick of time they had been levelled with the ground But Hegesandridas as per haps had before hand been concerted only hovered a bout at Epidaurus or the adjacent coast It is however probable thai on account of the present sedition a mongst the Athenians he lay for a time in this station in hope to seize some fair opportunity to strike a blow Be this as it will the Athenians no sooner heard the news than to a man they flocked down amain to the Pir√ us j less alarmed at their own domestic war than ae an invasion from a public enemy no longer remote but at their very ports Some of them threw themselves on board what shipping was ready others launched such as were 364 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIII were aground and others posted themselves upon the walls and at the mouth of rhe harbour But the Peloponnesian fleet having sailed by and doubled the cape of Sunium comes to anchor between Thoricus and Prasi√ and proceeds afterwards to Oro pus Hereupon the Athenians in all imaginable hurry manning out their ships with what hands could be got on this sudden emergency as in a city distracted with sedition and yet eager to stave off the greatest danger that had ever threatened it for as Attica was occu pied by the enemy Eub≈ a was now their all cause Thymocharis a commander to stand away with their fleet to Eretria On their arrival there and their junc tion with such as were already in Eubcea they amounted to six and thirty sail and were immediately forced to engage For Hegesandridas after the hour of repast came out in line of battle from Oropus The distance of Oropus from the city of the Eretrians across the sea is about  sixty stadia And therefore upon his approach the Athenians ordered their men on board imagining the soldiers to be ready at hand to obey their orders whereas they happened not yet to be returned from the market whither they had gone to buy provisions For through the management of the Eretrians nothing could be got by way of sale except in such houses as lay in the most remote quarters of the city i with an intent that the enemy might attack the Athenians before they were all embarked and oblige them in a hurrying and disorderly manner to begin the fight Nay a signal had even been held out to the enemy from Eretria towards Oropus at what time they ought to come forward to the attack Upon so short a notice the Athenians having formed their line as well as they were able and enga ging the enemy before the harbour of Eretria made however a gallant resistance for a time At length be  About fix English mile ing B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 365 ing compelled to sheer off they are pursued to land and as many of them as ran for sasety to the city of the Eretrians suffered the most cruel treatment in being murdered by the hands of men whom they supposed their friends Such indeed as could reach the fort of Eretria which was garrisoned by Athenians arc safe as also the vessels which could make Chalcis But the Peloponnesians after making prizes of two and twenty Athenian vessels and either butchering or making prisoners all on board them erected a trophy And no long time after they caused all Eub≈ a to re volt excepting Oreus which an Athenian garrison se cured and then settled the state of that island at their own discretion When advice of what was done at Eub≈ a reached Athens the greatest consternation ensued of all that had to this day been known Not even the dreadful blow received in Sicily though great concern in truth it gave them nor any other public disaster caused so terrible an alarm amongst them For at a time when their army at Samos was in open revolt when they had no longer either shipping in store or mariners to go on board when they were distracted with intestine sedi tion and ready each moment to tear one another to pieces ‚ and on the neck of all these this great cala mity supervened in which they lost their fleet and what was more of consequence Eub≈ a which had better supplied their necessities than Attica itself ‚ had they not ample reason now to fall into utter dejection But what alarmed them most was the proximity of ruin in case the enemy flushed with their late success should stand immediately into the Pir√ us now utterly destitute of ships Not a moment passed but they ima gined they were only not in the very harbour which in truth had they been a little more daring they might easily have been Nay had they made this step and blocked up the city they must infallibly have increased the seditions within it must have necessitated the fleet to 366 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VlIf to come over from Ionia though averse to the oligar chy in order to prevent the ruin of their own relations and the total destruction of their country And in the mean time Hellespont Ionia the isles even up to Eu b≈ a in a word the whole empire of Athens must have been their own Yet not in this instance only but many others the Laced√ monians shewed them selves most commodious enemies for the Athenians to encounter For as nothing differed more than their respective tempers the one being active the other stow enterprising these but timorous those especially in na val competitions they gave them many advantages The truth of this the Syracusans most plainly hewed who very nearly resembled the Athenians in disposition and so warred against them with the highest spirit and success Terrified however at these tidings the Athenians made a shift to man out twenty vessels and convened an assembly of the people on the first report of their loss in the place which is called the Pnyx and where generally that assembly was held In this they put an end to the administration of the sour hundred and de creed  the supreme power to be vested in the Jive thousand which number to confist of all such citi zens as were enrolled for the heavy armour and  that no one should receive a salary for any public ma  gistracy whoever offended in this point they de dared a traitor Other frequent assemblies were afterwards held in which they appointed Nomatheta and filled up the other posts in the government And now at least though for the first time in my opinion the Athenians seem to have modelled their government  The general course of appointing Nomatbtta was by lot Their number in the whole was a thousand and one Their business was not as the nane seems to im ply to make new laws since that belonged to the lupreme power lodged in the peo ple but to inspect such as were already made to re considcr such as were thought to be or were complained of as grievous aud tegularly report fab as ought to be continued or ought to be repealed aright E VUI THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 367 aright A moderation finely tempered between the few and the many was now inforced And from the low situation into which their affairs were now plunged this enabled Athens co re erect her head They decreed sarther the recallroent of Alcibiades and his adherents and dispatching a deputation to him and the army at Samos exhorted them to exert their utmost efforts for the public service In the first moments of this new revolution Pisander and Alexicles with their partisans and in general all the great sticklers for the oligarchy withdraw privately to Decelea But Aristarchus who was one of the ge nerals of the State took a different route from all the rest and carrying off a party of archers though rank Barbarians went off towards Oenoe Oenoe was a for tress of the Athenians on the frontiers of B≈ otia But the Corinthians on a provocation peculiar to them selves having procured the concurrence of the B≈ o tians held it now blocked up because a party of their countrymen drawing off from Decelea had been put to the sword by a sally of the garrison from Oenoe A ristarchus therefore having in a conference settled mat ters with the besiegers deceives the garrison in Oenoe by afluring them that  as their countrymen in A  thens had made up all their quarrels with the Lace dasmonians they also were bound to deliver up this  place to the B≈ otians and that this was an exprese provision in the treaty Qiying credit therefore to htm as in public command and ignorant of all the late transactions because closely blocked up they agree with the enemy and evacuate the fortress In this manner the B≈ otians regained possession of abandoned Oenoe And thus the oligarchy and sedition were suppressed at Athens But about the same space of time in the current sum mer in regard to the Peloponnesians at Miletus ‚ ‚ When none of those who were substituted by Tissa phernes during his absence at Aspcndus made regular payments 368 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VIH payments and nothing could be seen either of Tissapher nes or the Ph≈ nician fleet and Philippus who accompa nied him sent advice to Mindarus the admiral in chief and Hippocrates farther a citizen of Sparta who was then at Phaselis advised him also that  this fleet would never join him and in all respects they were shamefully abused by Tissaphernes ‚ as Pharnaba zus had made them an invitation and declared him self ready if aided by the consederate fleet to engage as strongly as Tiflaphernes for the revolt of what cities yet remained in subjection to the Athenians  ‚ Minda rus hoping to find more punctuality in the latter with notable conduct and by a sudden signal to the fleer that his motions might not be discovered at Samos weighs from Miletus with seventy three sail and bent his course to the Hellespont But earlier this sum mer sixteen ships had steered their course thither and ravaged part of the Chersonesus Mindarus met with tempestuous weather in his passage which forced him to put into Icarus and after staying there five or six days for want of weather to keep the sea he arrives at Chios Thrasyllus so soon as informed of the departure from Miletus stood after him wich five and fifty sail ma king the best of his way lest the other should enter the Hellespont before he reached him But gaining intel ligence that he was put into Chios and concluding he designed to remain there he sixed his scouts at Lesbos and the opposite continent that if the Peloponnesian fleet put out their motions might be delcried He himself repairing to Methymne ordered quantities of meal and other necessaries to be prepared that in case he should be forced to stay in these parts he might make frequent cruises from Lesbos against Chios But as Eressus in Lesbos had revolted his design was farther to attempt its reduction in cafe it were fea sible For some of the Methynean exiles and those not the most inconsiderable of the number having brought B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 36 brought over from Cyme about fifty heavy armed who were most firmly attached to their cause and hired o thers from the continent which increased their number to about three hundred ‚ AnaxarchuSj the Theban irt respect of consanguinity being chosen their leader ‚ assaulted first Methymne j and being repulsed in the attempt by the Athenian garrison which came up from Mitylene and then driven quite off by a battle fought in the field they retired across the mountain and make Eressus revolt Thrasyllus therefore steering with his fleet against Eressus projected an assault But Thrasybulus with five ships from Samos arrived there before him upon information received of the re passage of the exiles yet coming too late before Eressus to prevent a revolt he lay at anchor before it Two other ships also bound homewards from the Hellespont came in and the Methymnean All the ships in the fleet amounted now to sixty seven from which they draughted an army for the operations of land as fully bent if possible to take Eressus by a bold assault with engines and all the arts of attack In the mean time Mindarus and the Peloponnesiarl fleet at Chios after two whole days employment in ta king in provisions and receiving from the Chians every man on board three Chian teJseracofts on the the third day with urgent dispatch launch out from Chios into the wide sea that they might not be deserted by the fleet before Eressus and leaving Lesbos on the left stood over to the continent There putting into the harbour of Crater√ i on the coast of Phocea and taking their noon repast they proceeded along the coast of Cyme and supped at Arginus√ of the continent over against Mitylene From thence at

Harmatus which lies facing Methymne and having cat their dinner there they passed with the utmost speed by Lectus and Larissa and Amaxitus and other ad jacent places and reach Rh√ tium of the Hellespont before midnight Not but that some ships of the fleet got up no farther than to Sig√ um and some other adja cent places on that coast The Athenians who were lying with eighteen fail at Sestus when the lights were waved by their own friends for signals and they beheld numerous fires kindled on a sudden on the hostile coast were well assured that the Peloponsesians are approaching The fame night therefore under favour of the dark and with the ut most expedition they crept along under the Chersone sus and reached Eleus desirous to put out to sea and avoid the enemy and for the sixteen ships at Abydus they stole away unperceived of the Abydians though notice had been sent them from their friends just arrived to keep a good look out and not suffer them to steal off Yet morning no sooner appeared than finding themselves in sight of the fleet under Mindarus and that they were actually chaced they could not all get off The greater part indeed fled safe to the conti nent and Lemnos but four that got last under fail are overtaken by the enemy near Eleus one also that ran ashore at the temple of Protesilaus they seize with all her hands  and two more the crews of which escaped One sarther but abandoned they burn ¬ t Imbrus This done the ships from Abydus having joined them and the whole fleet being now increased to four score and six sail they spent the rest of the day in inves ting Eleus but as it would not surrender they drew osf to Abydus The Athenians who had been deceived by their scouts and never imagined that so large a number of hostile ships could pass along undelcried were very coolly carrying on their siege but yet were no sooner informed B VJIL THE PELOPONNESUS WAft jt informed of the enemy s motions than instantly quit ting Eressqs they advanced with the utmost expedi tion to secure the Hellespont They also pick up ttyo ships of the Peloponnesians which running out too boldly to sea in the lafe pursuit fell in amongst them i And coming up only c ne day aster them they anchor at Elieus and r e afieflible from Imbrus the ships which had fled thither Five whole days they spend here in getting every thing in readiness for a general engage ment And after this respite they came to an action in the following manner The Athenians ranged In linp of battle a headj stood along shore towards Sestus The PeloponnesianSj aware of their design stood out to sea from Abydus to be ready to receive them And as both sides werp determined to engage they unfolded their lines to a greater length the Athenians along the ChersonefiiSj reaching from Idacus to Arrhianse in all sixty eight Iail and the Peloponnesians over against them from Abydust to Dardanus being eighty six The line of the Peloponnesians was thus formed The Syracusans had the right and on the left was ranged Mindaru j and the ships most remarkable for beipg good sailors Amongst the Athenians Thrasyllps had the left and Thrasybulus the right The rest of the commanders were regularly posted according to their rank The Peloponnesians shewing most eagerness to begin the engagement endeavoured with their left to over reach the right of the Athenians in order to exclude them if possible from stretching out into the main sea and by keeping them cramped up to force their center a gainst the shore which was not far distant The Athe mans aware ot the enemy s design to shut them up plying up a head forced themselves an opening and in velocity beat them all to nothing By these motions the left of their line became ex tended beyond the cape called Cynos sema The con sequence of which was exposing their center composed B b 2 only 372 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR B VI1I only of the weakest ships and those ranged at too great a distance from one another especially as in number of vessels they were quite inferior and as the coast round the Cynos sema was sharp and in an acute angle runs out into the water so that part of the line on one side was out of fight of the other The Peloponne sians therefore charging the center drove at once the ships of the Athenians upon the beach and being so far manifestly victors leaped boldly on shore to pursue them But neither those under Thrasybulus could assist the center from the right because of the multitude of ships that stood in to awe them nor could those under Thrasyllus do it from the left be cause the interposition of cape Cynos sema hid from him the view of what had passed and at the same time the Syracusans and others who equal in strength lay hard upon him prevented his moving At length the Pe loponnesians presuming the victory their own broke their order to give different chace to single ships and in too heedless a manner threw confusion upon a part of their own line And now those under Thrasybulus finding the squadron opposed to them began to slacken stopped all farther extension of their line a head and tacking upon them resolutely engaged and put them to flight Charging next the dispersed ships of the Pe loponnesians which composed the squadron that pre sumed itself victorious they made havoc and by stri king them with a panic routed the greater part without resistance Now also the Syracusans were beginning to give way before the squadron under Thrasyllus  and feeing others in open flight were more easily tempted to follow their example The defeat now being mani festly given and the Peloponnesians flying away for shelter first towards the river Pydius and afterwards to Abydus the Athenians made prize of only an incon siderable number of shipping for the Hellespont be ing narrow afforded short retreats to the enemy How ever they gained a victory by sea most opportune in deed B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 373 deed in their present situation For hitherto afraid of the naval strength of the Peloponnesians because of the rebusfs they had lately received from it and the cala mitous event of the Sicilian expedition from this mo ment they stopped all fruitless self accusations or ground less exaggerations of the enemy s ability by sea Some ships of the enemy in fact they take for instance eight Chian five Corinthian two Ambraciot two B≈ otian but of Leucadian and Laced√ monian and Syracu san and Pellenean a single one of each But then they sufsered the loss of fifteen ships of their own After erecting a trophy upon the cape of Cynos sema and picking up the shatters of the fight and giving up under truce their dead to the enemy they dispatched a trireme to Athens to notify the victory On the ar rival of this vessel those at home after hearing the news of this unhoped for success greatly resumed their spirits which had been dejected by the recent misfor tunes at Eub≈ a and the fad efsects of their sedition and hoped the State might again resume its power if they cheerfully exerted their efforts in its behalf On the fourth day after the battle the Athenians having diligently resitted their fleet at Sestus sailed a gainst Cyzicus which had revolted And descrying eight ships from Byzantium riding at anchor under Harpagium and Priapus they crouded fail towards them j and having in battle upon the shore deseated their crews made prizes of them all Repairing thence against Cyzicus which was quite unfortified they re duced it once more and exacted large contributions from it But during this interval the Peloponnesians made a trip from Abydus to Eleus and brought off as many of their own ships which had been taken as were able to  fail j the residue the Eleusians burnt They also dis patched Hippocrates and Epicles to Eubcea to setch up their fleet from thence B b 3 About 374 THE PELOPONNESlAK WAR B VHI About the same space of time Alcibiades also at the head of his squadron of thirteeri sail returned from Caunus and Phasclis into the harbour of SamoS report ing that  by his management he had diverted the junction of the Ph≈ nician fleet with the Peloponne sians and made Tissaphernes a faster friend than  ever to the Athenians After enlarging his squa dron by the addition of nine more just manned he le vied large contributions upon the Halicarnasseans ahd fortified Cos After these exploits and putting the government of Cos into proper hands he returned a gain about autumn to Samos From Aspendus also Tissaphernes rode back post haste into Ionia so soon as advised of the departure of the Peloponnesian fleet from Miletus for the Helles pont Buti as the Peloponnesians were now in the Helles pont the Antandrians who are of √ olic descent  As the English reader is here to take his leave of Alcibiades he may have the curiosity to know what became of him after ‚ Every thing succeeded so well under him and his active collegues that the Laced√ monians having received several de feats ooth by land and sea and lost two hundred ships were again necessitated to sue for peace After such great services Alcibiad s returned triumphant to Athens The whole city flocked down to the Pir√ us to meet hirfc All strove to get a fight of Alcibiades they caressed him crowned him cursed the authors of his exile and hurried him away to an assembly of the people There he harangued them fora tinttj then flopped and ihed teats in abundance then harangued them again In fliott they undid all they had ever done against him  and Alcibiades for a time was all in all at Athens Yet in subsf auent commands he happened not to be successful j 1 crime which his countrymen very seldom forgave He became a second time an aile from Athens His great abilities made him a continual terror both to foreign and domestic enemies Yet now he persevered to serve his country by caballing in their favour and advising them on critical occasions Yec all in vain j Lysander was soon master of the Pir√ us and of Athens Alcibiades retired into Phrygia and was hand somely supported by the bounty of his friend Pharnabazus who however was wrought upon at last by the joint solicitations of his em mies and the plea of its necessity for the service of the king to undertake hit destruction The agents of Pharnabazus durst not attempt him in an open manner but set fire to his house by night By throwing in clothes to damp the flames he got out safe The Barbarians soon spied him ihot him to death with arrows and darts then cut off his bead and carried it to Pharnabazus I shall only add that he was birt forty years old when he was thus destroyed haying B VIII THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 375 having procured from Abydus a party of heavy armed who marched across mount Ida received them into their city provoked to this step by the injurious con duct of Arsaces a Persian lieutenant to Tisiaphernes This man pretending he had enemies to cope with whom yet he never named prevailed with the Delians settled in Adramittium because they had been obliged by the Athenians to quit Delos in the affair of the ex piation to attend him in this secret expedition with the flower of their strength and leading them forwards with ail the shew of friendship and alliance watched the opportunity when they were busy at their meal surrounded them with a body of his own soldiers and shot them to death with darts Fearing him therefore because os this instance of a cruel temper lest some such act of violence he might execute also upon them as in other respects he had imposed some burdens upon them which they could not bear the Antandrians eject his garrison out of their citadel But Tissaphernes perceiving how deeply the Peloponnesians were con cerned in this affair and esteeming himself sadly in jured also at Miletus and Cnidus since in those places too his garrisons had been ejected and fearing they would proceed to other commissions of the same nature chagrined moreover that perhaps Pharnabazus in less time and with less expence having obtained their con currence should make a greater progress against the Athenians ‚ he determined in person to repair to Hel lespont in order to expostulate with them about their late proceedings at Antander and to wipe off as hand somely as he could the aspersions thrown upon his own conduct in regard to the Ph≈ nician fleet and other points Arriving therefore first at
