   THE HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR BY THUCYDIDES VOL I CHARACTER op the WORK The public is here presented with a translation of one of the best histo ries of antiquity  a history full of important instruction The pernicious consequences of faction in states the tendency that power rigorously or wantoi y exercised has to make men desperate and that liberty when abused has to make them insolent is no where more strongly represented than in the grave and judicious Thucydioes In him too we see false pa triots and venal orators dressed out in genuine colours and those who em ploy their eloquence and abilities to promote the public interest and exert themselves to the utmost of their power in the support of liberty drawn at full length and in just proportions With regard to the translation now before us we shall only say that its merit is superior to any praises we can bestow and that it will we are persuaded approve itself to the judgment of such and such only are pro per judges as have an Attic taste and are well acquainted with the turn and manner of the original That our readers may see in some measure how our ingenious translator has succeeded both in the oratorial

History of Thucydides hath been studiously read and admired by the greatest Princes and may therefore presume to lay some claim to the Protection of Your Royal Highness Great Britain of all the States now existing in the world most nearly resem bleth what Athens was at the time when the War which is the Subject of it broke out in Greece A love of Liberty which hath erroneously been supposed to thrive and flourish best in a democratical Govern ment was then warm and active in every Athenian Athens it is true had thus been raised to a great height of maritime power and was become a very formidable State But Faction disjointed a noble Plan and at length brought on the loss of her Sovereignty at Sea The Athenians soon ceased to be great when they de viated from those salutary maxims which their worthiest Patriots and most consummate Statesmen had recom mended to their constant observance VI DEDICATION The Maritime power of Great Britain is more sub stantially founded and hath ever been more steadily supported dian was that of Athens The most com plete and most lasting Form of Government that man can invent happily subsists in this Realm under Your Royal Grandfather The

translation of Thucydides was first undertaken To explain the motive more largely might perhaps incur the imputation of imperti nence or vanity The performance upon the whole must justify the undertaking In what manner it is done and not why it was done will be the point of public arbitration It will be also needless to tell the English Reader how many versions have been made of Thucydides into Latin Their design was to bring the author more under the obser vation of what is generally styled the learned world  as the translations of him into modern languages have aimed at in troducing him into general acquaintance as a historian ca pable of innocently amusing most ranks of men but of use fully instructing the persons who from duty and from passion would guard the rights or secure the welfare of pub lic communities The grand business of History is to make men wiser in themselves and better members of society For this purpose it recals past ages to their view and thus opens a more extensive scope to reflection than any personal expe rience can offer To be well versed in a similarity of cases prepares men better for counsel or action on present contin gencies The statesman the patriot the friend to liberty and reason will be better enabled to plan and to regulate his own measures when he can see the tendency and consequence of such as were followed on parallel occasions and adjust the degrees in which they were either prejudicial or serviceable to public good Vox T B X PREFACE All men have neither the turn of mmd nor the leisure to make themselves proficients in the dead and learned lan guages Such as have are certainly honestly perhaps bene ficently employed in holding out light to others The Greek historians as they take a precedency in time lay further a strong claim to precedency in merit Thucydides is the most instructive of these  and since the restoration of letters in the western world each nation that hath piqued itself at all about humanity or politeness as his manner was soon found to be excellent have given thanks to those who have endea voured to investigate his matter and lay it open to public view It is to the honour of the French that they took the lead The first translation of Thucydides into French published at Paris in 1527 was that of Claude de Seyssel bishop of Mar seilles However performed it went within the space of lit tle more than thirty years through four impressions It is said to have been done at the command of Francis I king of France and to have been carried about with him in his wars and diligently studied by the Emperor Charles V The Germans had also a translation of him soon afterwards in the year 1533 In 1545 Francis di Soldo Strozzi published an Italian translation dedicated to Cosmo di Medicis The first English translation made its appearance in London in 1550â but in fact was only the translation of a translation since it was intitled a version from the French of Claude de Seyssel In 1564 he was published in Spanish A second French translation by Louis Jonsaud d Usez was published at Gene va in 1600 The second into English by the famous Mr Hobbes of Malmsbury was first published in the year 1628 about which it will be necessary immediately to inlarge A third French translation by the Sieur d Ablancourt was published at Paris in 1662 and hath since gone through four editions There is a Danish translation which clo seth the list given of them in the Bibliotheca Graca of Fa bric i us PREFACE Mr Hobbes declares in his Preface that  the virtues of  this author so took his affection that they begot in him a M desire to communicate him further He considered also that  he was exceedingly esteemed of the Italian and French  in their own tongues notwithstanding that he be not very  much beholding for it to his interpreters He says after wards that by the first translation of Nicholls from the French of Seyssel he became at length traduced rather  than translated into our language  alluding perhaps to the Italian sarcasm on translators Traduttore traditore He then resolved himself  to take him immediately from the Greek  â knowing that when with diligence and leisure I should  have done it though some errors might remain yet they  would be errors but of one descent of which nevertheless  says he I can discover none and hope they be not  many Mr Hobbes however sorry and mischievous a philoso pher was undoubtedly a very learned man He hath shewn it beyond dispute in his translation of Thucydides He is an excellent help for any one who consults him to find out the meaning and adjust the sense But though his transla tion hath now passed through three editions and hath pro fitably been read by many yet I speak not from my own private judgment he cannot now be read with any compe tent degree of pleasure He is faithful but most servilely so to the letter of his author Even in the orations he mere ly acts the interpreter and hath quite forgot the orator He translates literally throughout and numbers rather than weighs the words of Thucydides By this means the con struction is very often intricate and confused the thoughts pregnant with sense are not sufficiently opened nor the glow ing ideas of the author or his orators transfused with proper degrees of warmth and light Too scrupulous an attachment to the letter of die original hath made the copy quite flat and heavy the spirit is evaporated the lofty and majestic air hath intirely disappeared Too many low and vulgar expressions Xti PREFACE are used which Thucydides ever studiously avoided Such frequently occur in the midst of some grand circumstance which they throw into a kind of burlesque and may excite a reader s laughter The English language has gone through a great variation hath been highly polished since Mr Hobbes wrote Hence though his terms be in general very intelli gible yet they have not that neatness precision and dignity to which the polite and refined writers within the last century have habituated our eats And after all I am inclined to think that Mr Hobbes either executed in great haste or per formed his revisals in a very cursory and negligent manner I am inclined to think so from the very many passages neces sary and emphatical periods nay sometimes in the very speeches which to my great surprise I have found omitted in his translation A particle an epithet or even a comma may with the greatest attention sometimes be dropped in a long work But the omissions in Mr Hobbes are too nu merous and important to be excused in any tolerable con sistence with repeated care and circumspection Monsieur Bayle hath ascribed the translation of Thucy dides by Mr Hobbes to a motive of which he hath not left the least hint himself in his preface â in order to shew the  English in the history of the Athenians the disorders and  confusions of a democratical government Mr Hobbes could not possibly so long before they happened foresee the strange revolutions that were soon to take place in the go vernment of his country The very actors in them could not possibly discern the consequences of their own embroil ments Some violent incroachments had indeed been made on the liberty and property of Englishmen and a spirit of dis content began to spread throughout the nation But it can not be supposed that the plan of a commonwealth was form ed at that time or for several years after The history of Thucydides abundantly shews how dangerous and destruc tive is faction in a State  that severe or wanton power may make men desperate  and that liberty abused may make PREFACE Xlii them insolent and mutinous It detects and exposeth venal orators and false patriots  but it exhibits men who are stu dious and eloquent in behalf of public welfare and active in support of liberty and honest power in full beauty and pro portion And his lessons lie not so apposite and ready for the application of any State now existing in the world as for that of Great Britain The reader may by this time have caught a glimpse of several reasons for which the present translation of Thucy dides was finished and is now made public No care hath been omitted to make it as correct as possible It hath been attentively reviewed  the narrative part more than once  the oratorial part with repeated endeavours to reach the spirit and energy of the original In the former the Author hath been followed step by step  Bold deviations here might imperceptibly have misrepresented or distorted the facts and quite banished the peculiar stile and manner of the author In the latter it hath been often judged necessary to dilate the expression in order fully to include the primary idea though where it seemed possible the studied conciseness of the author hath been imitated provided the thought could be clearly expressed and the sententious maxim adequately conveyed The turns and figures of expression have been every where diligently noted and an endeavour constantly made at imitation This was judged a point of duty  or a point at least where though something may be permitted to a translator s discretion or to the genius of a modern language yet he must not indulge himself in too wide a scope lest when what ought to be a copy is exhibited the prime dis tinctions of the original be lost and little or no resemblance be left behind It is very just and true what Mr Hobbes hath observed that  this author so carrieth with him his own light through  out that the reader may continually see his way before htm  and by that which goeth before expect what is to follow And he who applies to any commentator but Thucydidt s PREFAGE himself for an explanation of his own meaning must exceed ingly often get quite wide of the sense The writers of Scholia and the notes of verbal critics put us frequently on a wrong scent and more frequently leave us utterly in the dark But if we will be patient at a dead lift something will soon occur in the author himself to help us out the obscurity will vanish and light beam in upon us Though sometimes we may be forced to divine his meaning since in many cases it is vain to apply to the aids of Grammar to develope the con struction yet the context at length will shew whether we have succeeded or help us to ascertain the sense This however demands repeated and attentive revisals The present trans lator hath not been frugal of his time or labour in these points And wliether he hath generally succeeded in ascertaining the thought and properly expressing it in another language must be left to the decision not of men of no learning nor of mere learning but to that class of judges who are well acquainted with the state of Athens at the time of the history and are really Attic both in taste and judgment This class it may be thought will be but small It is larger however and higher seated in this our community than the generality have either opportunity enough to discover or good nature enough to own The complaints so often made by the most able translators are indeed alarming Their performances they say may very much disgrace but can never commend them The praise of all that is clear and bright and pleasing and inn structive is reflected back upon the original author but every appearance of a different nature is laid with severity of censure at the door of the translator If it be so we know the terms beforehand on which either able or unable we en gage and must patiently acquiesce in the issue But candor is always expected nay ever will be had from persons of good sense and sound judgment Few but such may be pleased with Thucydides either in his old native Greek or in a modern English garb  and if such confer the honour of PREFACE their applause the clamour of some will not terrify nor the silence of others mortify at all The bookseller it is true forms his own judgment and then dictates to the judgment of others from the sale And it must be owned that every original writer as well as every copyist is heartily glad to re ceive that mark of public approbation The present translation of Thucydides Is accompanied with a few notes and three preliminary Discourses Concerning each of these something must be added The notes are only designed for the English reader to give him light into that antiquity with which he may be little ac quainted  And therefore the first time that any thing rela ting to the constitution or forms of the Athenian republic or peculiar to their fleets and land armies occurs I have endea voured in a note to give him a competent perception of it I have done the same in regard to the characters of the chief personages in the history which seemed to need a farther opening than what Thucydides hath given them The per sons were well known when he wrote  But a modern reader may not be displeased to be regularly introduced and early to be made acquainted with the characters of the principal agents in these busy and important scenes In notes of ver bal criticism or mere learning I have been very sparing judging they would never be read with patience Of the preliminary Discourses the two first were due by V the rules of decorum observed by editors and translators to the author In the last I have thrown into one continued discourse what might have been broke into pieces and inter spersed occasionally by way of notes The method observed appeared most eligible as it will give the reader a clear pros pect of the whole history  preparing him for or inciting him to a close and attentive perusal of it or enabling him after he hath perused it to recollect the most instructive passages and most material occurrences By this means also a more lively and succinct account could be given of the speakers and PREFACE the speeches than could have been done by way of set and formal arguments I think the English reader can want nothing more to en able him to read Thucydides with pleasure and profit  es pecially if he be at all acquainted with the Grecian history of which few that ever read can now be ignorant since Mr Stanyan s History of Greece and the Universal History are in so many hands I dismiss the work with some hope but more terror about its success That hope is encouraged and supported by the list of my Subscribers There are Names that do me honour indeed and which whether the work may suit the generality or not will preserve me from ever repenting that I have bestowed so much time on translating THUCYDIDES r SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF DR SMITH BY THE REV THOMAS CRANE OF CHESTER WILLIAM SMITH son of the Rev Richard Smith Rector of the Church of All Saints and Minister of St An drews in the city of Worcester was born in the Parish of St Peter s Church in that city on the 30th day of May in the year 1711 He was educated in grammar learning at the College School in his native city where he made great pro ficiency in his studies In January 1725 6 it pleased God to deprive him of his father On the 27th day of Novem ber 1728 he was matriculated at New College in Oxford where he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in June 1732 and that of Master in July 1737 Soon after he had taken his Bachelor s degree his merit caused him to be recommended to the Right Hon James Earl of Derby that great Patron of Arts and Sciences and he was retained three years in his lordship s house in the office of Reader to his lordship His connections with my Lord of Derby introduced him to the honour of being known to several other persons of fortune and quality which was of singular service to him in his progress through life A gentleman by birth blessed with an excellent capacity and education and having ready and easy intercourse with the great and good it is no wonder that he was adorned with manners most polite with literary accomplishments most splendid and solid and with morals becoming a faithful ser vant of the holy Jesus Well qualified for the work of the Vol I C XVlii SOME ACCftUNT

Bishop of that See was instituted the same day and inducted the next Mr Smith s first publication was  Dionysius Longinus on the Sublime translated from the Greek with Notes and Observations and some Account of the Life Writings and Character of the Author in one volume 8vo inscribed to the Right Hon the Earl of Macclesfield The anony mous Author of  the History of the Works of the Learned for May 1739 says of this work â The Translation of  Longinus is according to the most impartial judgment I  can frame of it after a comparison with others the most  elegant version that has been made of that Author into the  English tongue The preliminary Discourse excels that of  the celebrated Boileau which he has prefixed to his edition Father Philips in  A Letter to a Student at a Foreign Uni versity published 1756 recommending among other books Longinus on the Sublime says â A late English Translation  of the Greek Critic with Notes and Observations by Mr  Smith is a credit to the Author and reflects a lustre on  Longinus himself As conversant as you are in the original  language you cannot but be highly pleased with this per  formance In the  Weekly Miscellany by Richard Hooker of the

is the best I shall lake no notice of Troup The frontispiece to Longinus describes the power of eloquence It was delineated not by a professed limner but by Dr Wall of Worcester an eminent physician SOME ACCOUNT OF DR SMITH six ber 8 1739 we read â Mr Smith Rector of Trinity in Ches ter justly deserves the notice and thanks of the public for  his version of Longinus on the Sublime Though the learned  will not be satisfied without tasting the beauties of the origi  nal which cannot be translated in all their perfection yet  they may reap benefit and pleasure from the judicious sen u timents and ingenuity of the Translator in his account of  his Author and from the notes which help to illustrate the  text and discover the excellency of the rules To the un  learned also it may be of use and give pleasure It will  enable him to read with more satisfaction when he can  read with more judgment and distinguish the perfections  and faults of a writer He will be the better able to bear  his part in a rational conversation and appear with credit  when his observations are just and natural Such compo  sitions while they form the understanding to a true taste  kindle an inclination to literature and excite an emulation  in mankind to distinguish themselves by such excellencies  as distinguish men from brutes Athens and Rome were  even the glory of the whole world when they were the 44 universities of the whole world and those were reckoned M the most accomplished gentlemen who were the greatest 4 scholars the deepest philosophers the most eloquent ora  tors

happiness of being known  to you yet as I perceive by your public writings that you  are a gentleman of learning and parts I take the liberty of  desiring your assistance in the public design committed to  my care Though it is the common concern of every one  who wishes well to Religion and the Church of England â Mr Smith did not comply with Ihia request respecting the Weekly Miscellany

was printed at the request of his parishioners and inscribed to them The Right Hon Edward Earl of Derby had succeeded that nobleman who presented Mr Smith to Trinity Church but Mr Smith still continued to be es teemed at Knowsley notwithstanding Knowsley had changed its master He who had been long considered as the Earl of Derby s Chaplain was constituted in form by letters patent the 2d

ACCOUNT 01 DR SMITH â 4 The History of the Peloponnesi an War translated from  the Greek of Thucydides The Translator has added three preliminary Discourses on the Life of Thucydides on his Qualifications as a Historian and a Survey of his History In these Discourses as well as in the Life of Lon ginus he has abundantly proved his own excellence in origi nal composition This work has been several times reprinted in 8vo and was highly recommended by the Reviewers and others on its first publication and since that period In January 1758 the Deanry of Chester became vacant by the decease of the Rev Thomas Brooke LL D There were many candidates for this dignity but Mr Smith was so well supported by several of his illustrious friends especially by his noble patron the carl of Derby whose interest was powerful at Court and who prevailed on the Right Hon Earl Granville then Lord President of the Council and on his Grace the Duke of Newcastle to unite with him in recom mending Mr Smith that his Majesty King George the Second presented him to the Deanry He now took the Degree of Doctor in Divinity On the 28th of July Doctor Smith re ceived institution and was installed the same day by that learned and accomplished preacher the Rev Mr Mapletoft Vicedean On the 30th day of April 1766 the Dean was instituted to the Rectory of Handley near Chester on the presentation of the Dean and Chapter Doctor Smith had since he left the University if we except short excursions chiefly resided first with my Lord of Derby afterwards at the Rectory of Trinity in Chester then one year in Essex and of late at St George s in Liverpool from whence he went occasionally to Chester Cathedral But about the beginning of the year 1767 he resolved to resign St George s Church and wrote a letter to that effect to the body corporate  which letter produced the following resolution  At a Council held this fourth day of February 1767  On Mr Dean Smith s Letter this day

do immediately after such his re  signation make him a compliment of one hundred and fifty  guineas for his eminent and good services in the said Church In July the same year he came to the Deanry house in Ches ter with intent to pass the rest of his days there The fa vourable reception of his Thucydides induced the Dean in this healthy and pleasant retreat to finish his Translation of  Xenophon s History of the Affairs of Greece which he published in one volume 4to in the year 1770 this Translation appeared without any dedication To form a judg ment of its merit we may only quote the words of the title page that it is  by the Translator of Thucydides When the Dean retired within the precincts of his Cathe dral he had resigned St George s and held with the Deanry the parish churches of Handley and Trinity only till the Rectory of West Kirkby inthe hundred of Wirrall in Cheshire became vacant by the decease of that excellent magistrate and persuasive preacher the Rev Mr Mainwaring Prebendary of Chester The Dean was instituted to this Rectory on the 4th of October 1780 This is a valuable living in the pa tronage of the Dean and Chapter At this time the Dean resigned the Rectory of Trinity Doctor Smith was now Dean of Chester Rector of Handley and West Kirkby but his best parochial preferment happened late in life  he was advanced into his seventieth year and be gan to feel the infirmities ever attendant on age and a delicate constitution He had hitherto been a constant and powerful preacher he began now to preach less frequently as every ex ertion fatigued him exceedingly But when he could no longer preach from the pulpit he preached from the press by publish ing in 8vo  Nine Discourses on the Beatitudes in the year 1782 â The good and learned Doctor Lowth late Bishop of London hiphly commends these sermons in a letter to the Dean dated at Fulham July 8th 1782 Bishop Lowth and Dean Smith were contemporaries at Oxford where an intimate friendship commenced between them which continued till that year in which these two luminaries of the Church of Christ were  snatchedâ so Heaven decreed â away SOME ACCOUNT OF DR SMITH From this time the Dean s friends saw with infinite con cern his health gradually declining In the year 1786 he Was exceedingly indisposed In November he was confined to his room  in December to hisâ bed About eight on Friday morning the 12th of January 1787 the Dean meekly resigned his spirit into the hands of a mer ciful Redeemer On the Friday following the funeral pro cession passed the nearest way to the Cathedral the

as you retire from the choir an elegant and costly Monument is erected to his memory by Mrs Smith who was a Miss Heber of Essex He only once married The Dean never was a stipendiary curate The moment he was ordained a Priest he became a Rector and enjoyed ever after an income which far exceeded his expenses An enemy to ostentatious legacies he bequeathed the chief of his fortune which was very considerable to his widow and his nephew for he had no children He gave one hundred pounds to the Chester Infirmary and one hundred pounds to the fund for widows of clergymen in the archdeaconry of Chester these he esteemed useful charities The Dean was tall and genteel his voice was strong clear and melodious He spoke Latin fluently and was complete master not only of the Greek but Hebrew language His mind was so replete with knowledge that he was a living li brary His manner of address was graceful engaging de lightful His sermons were pleasing informing convincing His memory even in

ought at least to have something to say about him and something rather tending perhaps to give favoura ble impressions All his editors and translators have reckon ed this a point of duty incumbent upon them But it hath been generally performed in a very imperfect and slovenly manner His life wrote by Marcellinus a crude incoherent morsel hath been prefixed to all the Greek editions That by Suidas is an unsatisfactory mere dictionary account A third in Greek by an anonymous author is also but a very slight and shapeless sketch and seems the work of a gramma rian who hath read indeed but very superficially read his history Some incidental escapes from his own pen are the marks which should be always kept in view by him who would give any tolerable account of Thucydides Writers of a better age and class will contribute now and then a little xxviii On the Life of Thtjtcvdides assistance And the laborious care of a late author in ad justing the chronology and clearing away rubbish will enable one now to give at least a coherent though by no means an accurate account of him Thucydides an Athenian by borough an Halymusian was born in the year before Christ four hundred seventy one twenty five years after Hellanicus thirteen after Hero dotus according to Aulus Gellius and about three years before Socrates as the birth of the latter is settled by Laer tius He was descended of a very splendid and noble family though perhaps not so honourable as many others since it was not purely Attic Its splendour can no longer be doubt ed when it is known to be the family of Miltiades Miltia des the elder born a citizen of Athens had reigned over thÂ Dolomci a people in Thrace  and left vast possessions in that country to his descendents  And Miltiades the younger had married Hegesipyle the daughter of Olorus a Thracian kingf Yet foreign blood though royal was always thought to debase the Athenian The firm republicans of Athens had a hereditary aversion to every circumstance of royalty and the polite inhabitants of it abhorred all connexion with Barbarians the scornful title they gave to all the rest of the world except their countrymen of Greece Iphicrates a fa mous Athenian in later times was the son of an Athenian shoemaker and a Thracian princess Yet being asked to which of his parents he thought himself most obliged  he replied haughtilyâ To my mother She did all she could  to make me an Athenian my father would have made me  a Barbarian The younger Miltiades whom wars had obliged to quit his hold in Thrace commanded the troops of Athens in the famous field of Marathon He died after wards in a jail unable to pay a large fine set upon him by the people of Athens His son Cimon contrived afterwards to pay it The family for a time had been in poverty and â Vitoe Thucydidii Synopsis chronologies ab Henrico Dodwell i Herodotus iÂ Erato DISCOURSE I distress but emerged again in Cimon Cimon the same day gained a victory both by land and sea over the Persians at Mycale By his conduct he very much enlarged the power of Athens and put it in a train of much greater advance ments In civil affairs he clashed with Pericles who was leader of the popular party Cimon always sided with the noble or the few  as were the party distinctions in vogue at Athens The proofs that Thucydides was of this family are strong and convincing Plutarch directly asserts it in the life of Cimon His father in grateful at least if not honourable re membrance of the Thracian king whose daughter Miltiades had married bore the name of Olorus His mother also was another Hegesipyle He inherited rich possessions in Thrace particularly some mines of gold A monument of him was to be seen for many ages after in the Coele at Athens amongst the Cimonian or those belonging to the family of Cimon and stood next according to Plutarch to that of El pinice Cimon s own sister His father s name in the in scription on this monument at least some later grammarians have averred it was Orolus Thucydides himself in the fourth book of his history calls it Olorus Can we want stronger authority  Whether any stress ought to be laid on the variation or whence the mistake though a very minute one might proceed are points too obscure and trifling to take up any attention Such was the family of which Thucydides was descended His pedigree might be fetched from the Gods  since that of Miltiades is traced down from ifiacus But like my au thor I should choose to keep as clear of the fabulous as possible Cicero says of him Though he had never  written a history his name would still have been extant  be was so honourable and noble I quote this merely as a testimony to the splendor of his birth since it may be questioned whether the historian in the present instance â In the Oral op On the Life of Thucydides hath not intirely preserved his memory and been solely in strumental in ennobling and perpetuating the man His education no doubt was such as might be expected from the splendor of his birth the opulence of his family and the good taste then prevailing in Athens the politest city that then existed or ever yet existed in the world It is impossible however to give any detail of it The very little to be found about it in writers of any class whatever seems merely of a presumptive though probable kind It is said Anaxagoras was his preceptor in philosophy because the name of Anaxagoras was great at this period of time Anaxagoras the preceptor of Euripides of Pericles and of Socrates is named also by Marcellinus for the preceptor of Thucydides And he adds quoting Antyllus for an evi dence that  it was whispered about that Thucydides was  atheistical because he was so fond of the theory of Anax  agoras who was generally reputed and stiled an atheist The solution of an eclipse from natural causes accounting for appearances from the laws of motion and investigating the course of nature were sufficient proofs of atheism amongst a people so superstitious as the Athenians Thu cydides possibly might be well acquainted with the philo sophy of Anaxagoras without having personally attended his lectures However that be his own history abundantly shews that he was no atheist it may be added and no polytheist By his manner of speaking of the oracles and predictions tossed about in his own time it is plain he looked upon them as equivocal or rather insinuates them to be mere forgeries  And yet says Mr Hobbes he con  firms an assertion of his own touching the time this war  lasted by the oracle s prediction The passage occurs in the fifth book of this history But whoever considers it will find it only an argumentum ad hominem to stop the mouths of such as believed in oracles from contesting his own com putation of the whole time the Peloponnesian war lasted Of the Life and History of Thucydides DISCOURSE I I can only say that he was undoubtedly a serious man and of a large fund of solid sense which deriving originally from the bounty of nature he had most certainly improved by a regular and sound education For a reason of much less weight Antipho is assigned for his master in rhetoricâ because he speaks handsomely of him in the eighth book He there indeed pays due acknow ledgment to the merit of Antipho as a speaker but it can not be inferred from hence that he had ever any connexion with him Others have made Antipho a scholar of Thucy dides with full as little reason Thucydides certainly was never a teacher by profession It is pity to waste so much time on uncertainties It is certain Thucydides had a libe ral education though the particular progress of it cannot now be traced But to shew the peculiar bent of his genius and a re markable prognostic what sort of person he would prove the following story is recorded by several authors and dated by Mr Dodwell in the fifteenth year of his age â His father carried him to the Olympic games He there heard Hero dotus read his history to the great crowd of Grecians assem bled at that solemnity He heard him with fixed attention and at length burst out into tears  Tears childish in deed  it hath been remarked But however such as few children would have shed and highly expressive of his in ward spirit The active aspiring mind of Themistocles was not stronger shewn when the trophy of Miltiades would not let him be at rest nor the genius of the lad at West minster school when he could not sleep for the colours in Wesminster hall Herodotus is said to have observed it and to have complimented Olorus on his having a son that had so violent a bent to letters A similar passage in any person s life would always be called to mind when he was the subject of conversation In about two years more Thucydides was obliged bj â Plutarch s Livef of the ten Orators On the Life of Thucydides the laws to take his exercise in the study of arms and to begin to share in the defence of his country Every citizen of Athens was also a soldier They served at first within the walls or on great emergencies marched though to no great distance from home As years and skill advanced they were called upon to join in more distant and foreign expe ditions We are quite in the dark about the particular ser vices in which he might thus be employed We are sure at least he much improved in the theory of arms He qua lified himself for the great trust of heading the forces of the State i and in the sequel we shall Bee him invested with a command The anonymous author of his life relates that Thucydides was one of the number whom the Athenians sent to found a colony at Thuria in Italy Lampo and Xenocritus were the leaders of this colony and Herodotus is said to have been associated in it If Thucydides went the voyage and the strange inconsistencies of him who relates it render his whole account suspiciousj he must have been about twenty seven years of age One thing is pretty certain his stay at Thuria could have been of no very long continuance This is not to be inferred from the ostracism which the same writer says he soon after suffered  a mistake incurred it is highly probable by confounding him with Thucydides the son of Milesias who was of the same family and being a leader in the oligarchical party at Athens had the ostracism thrown upon him by the interest and popularity of Pericles But the quarrel between the Corcyreans and Corinthians about Epidamnus broke out soon after this The enemies of Athens were now scheming the demolition of its growing power Thucydides writes all the preparatory transactions marks all the defensive measures of the Athenians as a per son who was privy to every one of them And there should be very strong and very positive proofs of the contrary be fore any reader of his history doubts of his having been all the time at Athens DISCOURSE I XXX111 His own Introduction of itself in a great measure esta blished the fact He perceived the storm was gathering he knew the jealousies of the States which composed the Lacedaemonian league he also knew the real strength of Athens and heard all the preventive measures recommend ed by Pericles to put his countrymen in a proper posture of defence He himself seems to have been alert for the con tention and ready both with lance and pen not only to bear his share in the events but also to perpetuate the memory of them His own words iatiÂ Â Â and TiKn ie nitÂ r seem to denote the great earnestness and attention of his mind to the wide field of matter which was now going to be opened He longed to become a historian  he saw a fine subject for history fast approaching  he immediately set about noting all occurrences began at once to collect materials  and was re solved to write the History of The Pehponnestan War before it was actually on foot Can we doubt then of his residence during this portion of time at Athens  He was arrived at the breaking out of this war to the full vigour and ripeness of his years and understanding according to his chronologist Mr Dodwell was just forty years old We learn from himself that he knew personally the whole series of things  he was ever present at the transactions of one or other of the contend ing parties more after his exile at those of the Pelopon nesians  and consequently before his exile at those of the Athenians He speaks of Pericles as one who was an eye witness of his conduct as one who heard him harangue in the assembly of the people convincing that a war there would necessarily be and for that reason they ought not to weaken themselves by ill judged concessions but gallantly to exert that naval power which had made Athens envied and dreaded and which alone as it had made could keep her great He must regularly have taken his post upon the walls and seen the Peloponnesians in the first year of the â Book the fifth Vol I E xxxiv On the Life of Thucydides war lay all the adjacent country waste He must have Inarched under Pericles to retaliate on the territories of Me gara since the whole force of the State was obliged to take the field on this occasion He must have assisted at the public funeral solemnized in the winter for the first victims of this war and heard Pericles speak in honour of the dead and the living and make his countrymen enamoured of their Own laws and constitution The plague broke out immedi ately after this we are absolutely certain he was then in Athens He himself assures us of it He was an eye witness to all that horrid scene He had the plague himself and hath given a circumstantial detail of it The war proceeds with vigor and through a great variety of events Thucydides must have borne his share in the service  the particulars he haih not recorded No man was ever less guilty of eg otism he never mentions himself but when it is absolutely necessary His next six years were cer tainly employed in fighting and in writing the latter was his passion and the former his duty In the forty seventh year of his age he was joined in the command of an Athe nian squadron and land force on the coasts of Thrace He might be assigned to this particular station on account of his possessions and interest in this part of the world It was judged at Athens that he was best qualified to senx his country in this department The Lacedaemonian com mander in Thrace dreaded his opposition Let us wait a little for the event It is the most important passage in the Life of Thucydides It was intirely on the authority of Plutarch that Thucy dides was asserted above to be a descendant from Miltiades and in the mode of consanguinity to have inherited his fine estate in this part of the world Marcellinus who is for ever jumbling and confounding facts hath also made him marry a Thracian lady who brought him his gold mines for her fortune Mr Hobbes is willing to reconcile the facts and solves all the difficulty in a very plausible manner DISCOURSE I XXXV  In Thrace says he lay also the possessions of Thucy  dides and his wealthy mines of gold as he himself pro  fesseth in his fourth book And although those riches  might come to him by a wife as is also by some affirmed  which he married in Scapte Hyle a city of Thrace yet  even by that marriage it appeareth that his affairs had  a relation to that country and that his nobility was not  there unknown I cannot believe that Thucydides ever married a lady that was not purely Attic He seems to have been high spirited in this respect and proud of his country Miltiades indeed had married a Thracian princess and nothing but the vast estate brought into the family by this match could have made his descendants easy with such a blemish in their pedigree  For a blemish undoubtedly it must have been thought at Athens Let us see how Thucy dides himself drops his sentiment of such another match The passage I have in view occurs in the sixth book He is speaking of Hippias the son of Pisistratus tyrant of Athens  To iEantidas the son of Hippoclus tyrant of  Lampsacusâ to a Lampsacene though he himself was an  Athenianâ he married his daughter Archedice I can not think that he who let such a sarcasm fall from his own serious pen could ever condescend to marry a Barba rian let her fortune be never so great The reader if it be worth his while to think at all about it may determine for himself â This digression was caused by the express mention Thucydides hath made of his mines the very mo ment he is going to enter the lists against the most gallant and active commander at this time in the armies of the Lacedaemonian league It was Brasidas the Spartan who was now at the head of the Peloponnesian troops in Thrace He had made a forced march thither through Thessaly and Macedonia By his fine deportment and his persuasive address joined to uncommon vigilance and activity he had hitherto carried all before him He at length endeavoured to get possession xxxvi On the Life of Thuctdides by surprise of the important city of Amphipolis He had very nearly succeeded Eucles commanded there for the Athenians Thucydides was at this time in the isle of Thasus about half a day s sail from Amphipolis A mes senger was dispatched to him to hasten him up for the de fence of that city He put to sea immediately with a small squadron of seven ships Brasidas knowing he was com ing opened a negotiation with the Amphipolitans and gained admission for his troops Thucydides stood up the Strymon in the evening but too late since Brasidas had got fast possession of Amphipolis The city of Eton is situated also upon the river Strymon lower down and about two miles and a half from Amphipolis Thucydides put in here and secured the place  Brasidas in his own words had de  signed that very night to seize Eton also And unless  this squadron had come in thus critically to its defence at  break of day it had been lost Thucydides without losing a moment provided for its defence Brasidas with armed boats fell down the river from Amphipolis and made two attempts upon it but was repulsed in both tJpon which he gave up the scheme and returned back One would imagine that Thucydides had done all that could be done on this occasion and deserved to be thanked instead of punished The people of Athens made a different determination Cleon was now the demagogue of greatest influence there and is generally supposed to have exasperated them against the man who had not wrought impossibilities in saving their valuable town of Amphipolis It is certain their fury rose so high against him that they stripped Thucy dides of his command and passed the sentence of banish ment upon him It is himself who tells usf  It was his lot  to suffer a twenty years exile from his country after the  affair of Amphipolis We have thus lost Thucydides the commander to secure more fast Thucydides the historian Though sadly treated â Book the fourth f BÂ Â k the fifth DISCOURSE I xxxvii he scorned to be angry with his country His complexion was not at all choleric or resentful there appears not the least sign of any gall in his constitution Discharged of all duties and free from all public avocations he was left without any attachments but to simple truth and proceeded to qualify himself for commemorating exploits in which he could have no share He was now eight and forty years old and intirely at leisure to attend to the grand point of his ambition that of writing the history of the present war a calm spectator of facts and dispassionate observer of the events he was deter mined to record To judge of him from his history and we have no other help to form our opinion about him he was so nobly complexioned as to be all judgment and no passion No murmur or complaint hath escaped him upon account of his severe undeserved treatment from his country Great souls are congenial their thoughts are always of a similar cast Sweet are the uses of adversityt Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head Shakespeare hath thus expressed what Thucydides as it is highly probable must have thought  Exile according to  Plutarch was a blessing which the Muses bestowed upon  their favourites By this means they enabled them to  compleat their most beautiful and noble compositions He then quotes our author for the first proof of his observa tionâ Thucydides the Athenian compiled his History of  the Peloponnesian War at Scaptesyle in Thrace At that place he fixed his residence It lay convenient forQtaking care of his private affairs and overlooking his mines They lay not within the dominions of Athens  for then they would have been forfeited to the State Hence he made excursions â Of Banishment xxxviii On the Life of Thucydides at proper seasons to observe transactions and pick up intelli gence He was now more conversant in person on the Pelo ponnesian side Some private correspondences he might still carry on with Athenians And he had money to pur chase all proper materials was ready and knew how to lay it out This was his employment until the very end of the war and it is certain he had collected materials for carrying down his history to that period of time  when in his own  words the Lacedaemonians and their allies put an end to  to the empire of Athens and became masters of the Long  walls and the Piraeus But whoever reads it will be in clined to think that he drew it not up in that accurate and elaborate manner in which it now appears until the war was finished He might keep every thing by him in the form of annals  he might go on altering or correcting as he saw bet ter reason or gained more light His compleat well connected history though the first thing in his intention was the last in execution His exile lasted twenty years It commenced in the eighth year of the war in the year before Christ four hundred twenty three Consequently he was restored the year be fore Christ four hundred and three being at that time sixty eight years old In that very year an amnesty was published at Athens in the archonship of Euclides after the demoli tion of the thirty tyrants by Thrasybulus Thucydides was now at liberty if he pleased to return and pass the remainder of his days at Athens Whether he did so or not is left quite in the dark He lived twelve years after and died in the year before Christ three hundred ninety one being then about fourscore years old He was constantly employed in giving coherence and dignity to this History â with what accuracy what severity what toil the reader may judge since he will find that after all he left it imperfect The first seven books are indeed fully and exactly â Book the fifth DISCOURSE I xxxix finished The eighth though moulded into due form hath plainly not had a final revisal and breaks off abruptly The whole work is said to have fallen into Xenophon s possession who at the time of the death of Thucydides was exiled from Athens And Xenophon is also said to have made it public This carries a great air of probability with it since Xenophon became the continuator of Thucydides not in so lofty and majestic but in a sweeter and more popular style There is a chasm indeed between the time the History of Thucydides breaks off and the Grecian History of Xenophon begins There is no accounting for this but by conjecture May I venture to offer one I believe entirely new but which for that reason I shall readily give up to the first person of judg ment who thinks it hath no foundation  It is thisâ That Thucydides left somewhat more behind him than now ap pears How it came to be suppressed or lost I will not pre tend to guess It is natural to imagine that his acknow ledged continuator resumed the subject at the very spot where his predecessor had left off Nearly two years are however wanting in which several important incidents took place It is pity but we have no redress General histo rians are by other means enabled to supply the deficiency but the loss of any thing from so masterly a hand is still to be regretted The place of the death and interment of Thucydides was most probably Scaptesyle in Thrace Long habitude might have made him fond of a spot where he had passed so many years in studious and calm retirement The hurry and bus tle and engagements of Athens could not have been much to the relish of so grave and now so old a man His monu ment there among the Cimonian confirms this opinion since most writers agree it had the mark upon it which shewed it to be a cenotaph and the words Here lieth were not in the inscription I have nothing to add about his family It is â M rcellinus On the Life of Thucydides said he left a son but the very name of that son is merely conjectural I have collected every thing that carries any consistency with it about the Man  I shall proceed with more pleasure to view him in a clearer and more steady light and mark the character in which it was his ambition to be distin guished that of a Historian DISCOURSE II ON HIS QUALIFICATIONS AS A HISTORIAN IT is now to be considered how well qualified Thucydides was to undertake that nice and arduous task of writing His tory No one certainly was ever better fitted for it by out ward circumstances  and very few so enabled to perform it well by the inward abilities of genius and understanding Lucian in his celebrated treatise  How a History ought to be written is generally supposed to have had his eye fixed on Thucydides And every person of judgment who loves a sincere relation of things would be glad if it were possible to have the writer of them abstracted from all kind of connection with persons or things that are the sub ject matter  to be of no country no party  clear of all pas sions  independent in every light  intirely unconcerned who is pleased or displeased with what he writes the servant only of reason and truth Sift Thucydides carefully and we shall find his qua lifications in all these respects very nearly if not quite com pleat  No connection with no favouring or malevolent bias to wards any one person in the world can be fixed upon him Never man so intirely detached or proceeded so far if I may use the expression in annihilating himself He had a father indeed whose name was Olorus he was an Athe nian born â But who are his relations  who were his as sociates what rival or competitor doth he sneer what Vol I F xlii On his Qualifications as a Historian friend doth he commend or what enemy doth he re proach â Brasidas was the immediate occasion of his dis grace and exile Yet how doth he describe him  He makes the most candid acknowledgments of his personal merit and doth justice to all his shining and superior abili ties Cleon is generally supposed to have irritated the peo ple against him and to have got him most severely punished when he merited much better returns from his country Doth he shew the least grudge or resentment against this Cleon  He represents him indeed in his real character of a factious demagogue an incendiary a bully and of course an arrant coward And how do all other writers  how doth Aristophanes paint this worthless man this false bellowing patriot  I would never call Aristophanes for an evidence to character but in cases where every other writer accorded fully with him on the same foundation of truth though not with the same superstructure of bitterness and abuse He should not be a voucher in regard to Socrates or Pericles but certainly may be heard about a Hyperbolus or a Cleon Thucydides never mentions himself as opposed to any man but Brasidas and never so much as drops an insinuation that he was hurt by Cleon And thus by general consent he had gained immortal honour by giving fair and true re presentations of men whom he never felt to be such but whom succeeding writers have assured us to have actually been his enemies â As to things though in the first seven years of the war he must in some measure have had employ ment yet he was soon disentangled from all business what ever in a manner which bore hard upon his reputation He hath stated the fact  and then with the greatest calmness and unconcern he hath left the decision to posterity He was henceforth of no country at all Cut off from the republic of Athens he never sought after or desired a natu ralization in any other State of Greece He was now only to choose out and fix a proper spot of observation from whence like a person securely posted on a promontory he DISCOURSE II could look calmly on the storm that was raging or the battle that was fighting below could note every incident distinguish every turn and with a philosophical tranquillity enjoy it all In short he now was and continued all the rest of the Pelo ponnesian War a citizen of the world at large as much as any man ever actually was But before this separation from the community whilst yet he continued at Athens where liberty opened the field to all passionate chaces after power where consequently competitions were ever fermenting and party was always alive and active â can we find him associated with any par ticular set of men  can we find him dabbling in political in trigue  a leader of or led by any party  or can we as suredly find out his principles  or even guess at his real thoughts about the form of government under which he had lived  His biographers indeed though ever parading his candour and impartiality are often tracing out signs and marks of party zeal and personal prejudices from the very characters in his history Marcellinus says  he described  Cleon as a madman because he hated him  forgetful what Cleon really was and of the concurrent testimonies to the truth of the character The anonymous writer says  he op  posed Pericles at Athens got the better of him and be  came the first man in the republic A ridiculous story  void of all manner of support According to this writer s way of arguing in other places who says  he cajoled the  Lacedaemonians and inveighed against the tyrannic all  grasping temper of the Athenians in his history because  he had no opportunity to rail at them in any other shape â he should have left a far different character of Pericles behind him than he hath actually left But these are strange compilers of patch work and deserve no regard From what the former hath said about him a reader might be tempted to judge him of the oligarchical from what the lat ter hath said of him of the democratical principle Mr Hobbes imagines he hath dived to the bottom of his real xliv On his Qualifications as a Historian principles and avers him a tight and sound royalist He is sure that he least of all liked the democracy as sure he was not at all fond of an oligarchy He founds this as surance on a passage in the eighth bookâ They decreed  the supreme power to be vested in the Jive thousand which  number to consist of all such citizens as were enrolled for  the heavy armour and that no one should receive a  salary â Thucydides just after pronounceth this in his own opinion  a good modelling of their government a  fine temper between the few and the many and which  enabled Athens from the low state into which her affairs  were plunged to re erect her head If this passage proves any thing of the author s principles it certainly proves them in a pretty strong degree republican Mr Hobbes however sets out from hence to prove him a royalist  For says he  he commendeth the government of Athens more both  when Pisistratus reigned saving that it was an usurped  power and when in the beginning of this war it was de  mocratical in name but in effect monarchical under Pe  ricles He praiseth it is true the administration at both these periods  and he also praiseth the good effects resulting from an administration lodged in the hands of five thousand men Under Pericles it was lodged in more but the extra ordinary abilities and influence of the man had taught all their voices to follow the dictates of his heart Yet Pericles was all the time a strong republican and owned his masters Plutarch says he never harangued them without praying beforehand that  not a word might slip out of his mouth  that was not pertinent to the business in hand and that he never put on his armour to lead them out into the field without saying to himselfâ Remember Pericles you are  going to command free men and Grecians I leave it to the reader whether the principles of Thucydides can thus be discovered It appears only that he was always candid to a good administration and might possibly think of govern ment as Mr Pope hath wrote  DISCOURSE II For modes of government let fools contest That which is best administered is best That studied obscurity in which he hath veiled himself will not let us discover whether on instant and critical oc casions he ever suffered himself to be actuated by any of the darker passions or too fondly indulged those of a brighter cast But it cannot be found from what he writes that he hath praised any man from fondness or even from gratitude degraded any one through envy or reproached any one with malice and ill nature The same will hold in regard to States or whole communities Doth he ever censure the Athenians in the wrong place  or commend the Lacedaemo nians but in the right  Were his name expunged from the beginning of the whole work and the conclusions of the years could any one guess to what State he had ever be longed whether he was a Lacedaemonian a Corinthian an Athenian or a Sicilian except from the purity of the Attic dialect in which he writes  In that dialect he was cradled he could not possibly swerve from it without it he could neither write nor speak Could he have thought that this might yield suspicion of an impassioned or prejudiced spirit he might perhaps have endeavoured to write in the Doric or Ionic idiom Independent further he certainly must have been since he had no great man to cajole and no prince to dread or flatter The powers of Greece or the monarch of Persia could affect him no more than the Germanic body or the grand monarch of France the quiet and contented refugee who lives on the sunny side of a hill in Switzerland The circumjacent powers had no more perhaps not so much in fluence at Scaptesyle than the neighbouring kingdoms can have at Lausanne The States of Greece had garrisons on the coasts but were not masters of Thrace Thrace was full of little communities and petty principalities Thucydides had credit enough amongst them to insure his personal safe ty and guard his retirement He could disoblige those about xlvi On his Qualifications as a Historian whom he wrote without fear of their resentment and could praise without being in the reach of a requital Human na ture will not admit of a stricter independence His unconcern about the opinions of a present generation is strong and clear It looks as if he thought they would scarce give him a reading so little care had he taken to sooth or to amuse them He had a greater aim than to be the author in vogue for a year He hated contention and scorn ed short lived temporary applause He threw himself on posterity He appealed to the future world for the value of the present he had made them The judgment of succeed ing ages hath approved the compliment he thus made to their understandings So long as there are truly great princes able statesmen sound politicians politicians that do not rend asunder politics from good order and the general happiness he will meet with candid and grateful acknow ledgments of his merit Other historians have sooner pleased have more diffu sively entertained They have aimed more directly at the passions have more artificially and successfully struck at the imagination Truth in its severity and Jteason in its robust and manly state are all the Muses and Graces to which Thucydides hath done obeisance Can we wonder that he hath not been more generally read and admired  or could we wonder if he had not been so much  A great work planned under such circumstances and with such qualifica tions as I have been describing cool serious judgment will always commend as a noble design even though executed it may prove too cheerless to the more lively passions its relish not sufficiently quick for the popular taste or piquant enough to keep the appetite sharp and eager But to proceed Thucydides hath been censured in re gard to the choice of his subject It hath occasioned the solidity of his judgment and excellence of his taste to be called in question Dionysius of Halicarnassus hath exert ed himself much on this account hath tried him by laws discourse ii xlvii which have poetry rather than history for their object and censures him for not delighting when his profession was only to instruct Mr Hobbes hath gallantly defended his author and shewn all the arguments of Dionysius to be impertinent and to proceed from partiality and envy I shall not repeat it will suffice to refer the curious reader to what Mr Hobbes hath written upon this topic Homer had celebrated the Trojan war and intermingled in his poems all the historic strokes of that and of preceding ages enliven ing and exalting every thing he touched That splendid part of the Grecian history in which his countrymen resist ed and triumphed over the very formidable arms of the Per sian monarch had already been recorded by Herodotus Should Thucydides plunge back into dark and fabulous ages and turn a mere legendary and romantic writer  He had he could have no subject equal to his ambition and his abilities but the war which broke out in his own days which he foresaw would prove extensive and important when the efforts of her enemies would be vigorously exerted to pull down the power of Athens to demolish that naval strength which gave her the sovereignty of the sea and made her the dread and envy of her neighbours Coolly therefore with my reason as an examiner of things and warmly with my passion as an Englishman I cannot but applaud his choice who hath projected the soundest and best system of English politics so long before the constitution had existence and hath left us fine lessons such as his factious countrymen would not observe how to support that dominion of the sea on which our glory is built and on which our welfare in tirely depends In this light it is a most instructive and in teresting history and we may felicitate ourselves on the choice of Thucydides I must not anticipate  Thucydides would have his readers pick out their own instructions I can only add that Thucydides is a favourite historian with the statesmen and patriots of Great Britain This fits him also to be a Historian for the people Other nations have ad xlviii On his Qualifications as a Historian mired him and I hope will continue to admire him gratis  We are bound to thank him and never to lose sight of that grand political scheme formed by a Themistocles and warmly and successfully pursued by an Aristides a Cimon and a Pericles the swerving from which at Athens drew after it the loss of the sovereignty at sea then sunk her into a petty State and made her end at last in a mere academy though most excellent in its kind From such considerations it will also follow that the hi tory of Thucydides is more useful than that of Livy  at least that we have more reason to applaud the choice of the former I design no comparison between these two histori ans The performance of the Jesuit Rapin on that point is in general reading Livy s history is certainly more au gust more splendid more amazing I only insist that it is not more useful And though Livy be happier in his sub ject this ought not to degrade Thucydides who seized the only fine subject that could offer itself to him In regard to him it was either this or none at all The parallel should be only drawn in regard to execution where much hath been said on both sides and the superiority still remains unde cided This brings me to the inward abilities of genius and un derstanding which capacitated my author to execute his work His genius was certainly of the highest order It was truly sublime Here the critics unanimously applaud In the arrangement of his matter he emulated Homer In the grandeur of his thoughts and loftiness of his sense he copied Pindar He is ever stately and majestic his stateliness perhaps too formal his majesty too severe He wrote as he thought far beyond an ordinary person He thinks faster than he can utter His sentences are full stored with meaning And his very words are sentences Hence comes his obscurity Where pure thought is the object he connects too fast nor is enough dilated for common apprehension But this is not the case with the narrative part of his his DISCOURSE II xllX tory which is pithy nervous and succinct yet plain strik ing and manly He never flourisheth never plays upon words never sinks into puerilities never swells into bom bast It is a relation from the mouth of a very great man whose chief characteristic is gravity Others talk more in genuously  others utter themselves with a more cheerful air yet every one must attend to Thucydides must hearken with serious and fixed attention lest they lose a word a weighty and important word by which the whole story would be spoiled It is in his Orations that he is most re markably obscure He might not be so in so high a degree to the apprehensions of mankind when his history was first made public The world was then used to hear continual harangues No business of a public nature could be carried on without them In his time the speakers aimed intirely at strength and brevity If they were not exceeding quick the apprehensions of the Athenians would outstrip or at least affect to outstrip their utterance They must think much and yet leave much of what they had thought to the ready conception of the audience An orator in the follow ing history calls them  Spectators of speeches They affected to discern at the first glance and without waiting for formal deduction and solemn inference to be masters of the point as it were by intuition The more copious and diffusive eloquence was the improvement of the next gene ration But the most forcible orator that even Athens ever boasted improved if he did not quite learn his peculiar manner from Thucydides It was Demosthenes who co pied him in the close energy of his sentences and the abrupt rapidity of his thoughts Demosthenes is said to have tran scribed him eight times over with his own hand so diligently did he persevere to form an intimate acquaintance with him and habituate himself to his quick manner of conception and to his close and rapid delivery Cicero says howeverf that  no rhetorician of Greece ever drew any thing from â Cleon s speech in book the third t IQ ll e Orator Vol I G I On his Qualifications as a Historian  Thucydides He hath indeed been praised by all I own  it but as a man who was an explainer of facts with  prudence severity and gravity Not as a speaker at the  bar but a historical relater of wars And therefore he was  never numbered amongst the orators Cicero learned nothing from him He could not neither in his own words  would he if he could His talents were different he was quite in all respects accomplished he was eloquence itself But Demosthenesâ and can there be higher praise  â Demosthenes certainly loved and studied Thucydides for whose perfection I am not arguing I would only esta blish his character of loftiness and sublimity Longinus proposeth him as the model of true grandeur and exaltation in writing history And now I have mentioned this princely and most ju dicious critic let us call Thucydides to take a trial at his bar and see whether he hath all the genuine constituents of the true sublime â For elevation of thought for his power in alarming and interesting the passions for his bold and fre quent use of figures his character will soon be established Even Dionysius of Halicarnassus bears testimony here who loved him not and would have been glad to degrade him Plutarch calls him the most pathetic and a writer of the greatest energy and variety that ever was The scenes in his history are strong most expressive paintings He makes the past to be present he makes hearing sight In the very words of Plutarchfâ His readers are thrown into  the same astonishment and hurry of passion as the eye  witnesses to every scene must have felt Demosthenes  drawing up his men on the craggy shore of Pylusâ Bra  sidas calling out on his pilot to run the vessel ashore get  ting himself on the stairs then wounded fainting falling  down on the gunnel here the Spartans fighting a land  battle from the water the Athenians a naval battle from the shore â

tual representation in all the disposition all the expres  sion and perspicuity of picture Through the whole course of the history a battle either at land or sea is an ob ject clear and distinct The writer is never confounded him self nor throws confusion on his reader That reader sees the whole from the paean of attack to the erecting of the trophy he discerns the whole train of fight and beholds exactly the loss or gain of the victory He further assists at the assemblies of the people and all important consulta tions He learns the state of affairs from the managers themselves he hears the debates is let into the tempers of the assembly pries into all the politics and preconceives the resolution Where the politics are bad he will own no other could be expected from those who recommend them Where they are sound and good nor wilfully severed from duty to their country and in moral consistence with the welfare of their fellow creatures the reader will applaud and think he hath been himself discovering the fine maxims which the author hath been teaching who never appears in person never puffs his own integrity and discernment and without digressing into comments or setting up for a politician is found upon reflexion the best of the kind that ever wrote To quote passages for the proof of his sublime thought or his pathetic address would be to transcribe the greater part of the following history They will be observed in the orations of these two different casts and the incidents of the work His figures are thick set the figures that regard both the sentiment and the diction His metaphors are strong and uncommon his hyperboles far but not over stretched the tone is still preserved they flow out from a lii On his Qualifications as a Historian warm pathetic in the midst of some grand circumstance The figures in which he most delights are the Interroga tion s the Change of number and time the Hyperbaton or transposing and inverting the order of things which seem na turally united and inseparable  and above all the Antithesis This last he hath fondly used almost to satiety Term is not only opposed to term but thought to thought sentence to sentence and sometimes whole orations to one another even where the latter speaker cannot possibly be supposed to have heard the former A constant adherence to this method car ries with it the danger of glutting the reader I am sensible there should have been more variety to make the whole quite beautiful and graceful As to the fourth constituent of sublimity which accord ing to Longinus is noble and graceful expression our au thor s claim cannot be so well established Noble undoubt edly he is but as for the gracefulâ the reader may wish he had been more careful in this particular and I am sure his translator wishes it from his heart For fear of being vul gar he is too set and solemn and from the passion to be always great he hath lost the air of ease and genteelness Dionysius of Halicarnassus says he studiously affected hard and obsolete words But yet the same writer sets him up as the standard of Attic purity  nay hath frequently strength ened his own style by using the hard and obsolete words of Thucydides However this be it is certain Thucydides hath in this respect fallen half way short And more so in the fifth constituent of sublimity composition or structure of his periods He hath no harmony hath given little or no proof of having a good ear He is rough austere  his periods are sometimes a mile long in which he labours himself both out of tune and time I acknowledge his im perfections and beg the reader would weigh them and set them in the balance with his excellencies He may then judge if the latter do not greatly preponderate He thinks nobly affects surprisingly  his expression is noble but not DISCOURSE II liii graceful his final colouring is neither bright nor cheerful But though his pieces are not so completely finished as to stand every test yet they are certainly high wrought in his own peculiar style and for greatness of design and strength of expression are beyond every other hand I think no fair comparison can be made of him except with the historians who are his countrymen who like him self are original in their own way and the first in their man ner These are only two Herodotus and Xenophon In point of life Thucydides was junior a little to the former and senior to the latter In stateliness grandeur and ma jesty he far surpasseth them both The manner of Hero dotus is graceful and manly his address is engaging he loves to tell a story  and however fabulous or trifling that story he will be heard with pleasure The course of his History is clear and smooth and yields a most cheerful pros pect That of Thucydides is deep rapid impetuous and therefore very apt to be rough and muddy You may clearly perceive the bottom of the one  But it is very hard to dive to the bottom of the other Herodotus like a master on the horn can wind a lofty air and without any harshness sink down into the lowest and mellowest notes Thucydides sounds the trumpet his blasts are sonorous and piercing and they are all of the martial strain Xenophon never pretends to grandeur his character is a beautiful simplicity he is sweeter than honey  he charms every ear the Muses them selves could not sing sweeter than he hath wrote Each beats and is beaten by the others in some particular points Each hath his particular excellence That of Herodotus is gracefulness  that of Thucydides grandeur that of Xeno phon sweetness itself If generals and admirals and states men were to award the first rank it would undoubtedly be given for Thucydides  if the calmer and more polite gentry it would go for Herodotus  if all in general who can read or hear Xenophon hath it all to nothing â Cam quodammodo Mlicum Cicero in the Orator liv On his Qualifications as a Historian As to the Roman Historians who saw what these mighty originals had done before them I cannot judge it fair to form decisive parallels Time had enabled them to judge maturely about the defects and excellencies of their Greek predeces sors Yet every Roman historian shews plainly he is a Roman himself he stood not so aloof from his subject as Thucy dides The loss of a Peloponnesian writer is never regretted in regard to the latter the loss of Carthagenian and histo rians of other nations is highly regretted in regard to the former National impartiality will admit no comparison here though excellence of composition may admit a great deal Sal ust is the only one who seems to have had our au thor ever in his eye and to have been his professed imitator Sal us t frequently translates his political maxims copies him exactly in the conciseness and laboured energy of his phrase and Salust for that reason is like him very often obscure It is entirely in his manner that he draws up his orations contrasts his speakers and fights his battles Salust hath many hath deservedly many admirers  And I hope if I am so fortunate as to bring Thucydides into more general ac quaintance that the admirers of the one will bestow regard upon the other and pay due honour to his historic progenitor I shall wind up this essay on Thucydides as a Historian with a passage from the Critic on the Sublime only desiring the reader to keep Thucydides in remembrance as Longinus extended his view to writers both in poetry and proseâ  I readily allow that writers of a lofty and towering ge  nius are by no means pure and correct since whatever is  neat and accurate throughout must be exceedingly liable to  flatness In the Sublime as in great affluence of fortune  some minuter articles will unavoidably escape observation  But it is impossible for a low and grovelling genius to be  guilty of error since he never endangers himself by soaring  on high or aiming at eminence but still goes on in the same  uniform secure track whilst its very height and grandeur â Longinus Section 33 DISCOURSE II lv  exposes the Sublime to sudden falls Nor am I ignorant  indeed of another thing which will no doubt be urged that  in passing our judgment upon the works of an author we  always muster his imperfections so that the remembrance u of his faults sticks indelibly fast in the mind whereas that  of his excellencies is quickly worn out For my part I  have taken notice of no inconsiderable number of faults in  Homer and some other of the greatest authors and cannot  by any means be blind or partial to them  however I judge  them not to be voluntary faults so much as accidental slips  incurred through inadvertence  such as when the mind is  intent upon things of a higher nature will creep insensibly  into compositions And for this reason I give it as my real  opinion that the great and noble flights though they cannot  every where boast an equality of perfection yet ought to  carry off the prize by the sole merit of their own intrinsic  grandeur DISCOURSE III A SURVEY OF THE HISTORY IN the preceding discourse we have examined into the ca pacity and qualifications of our author for writing history and settled his character Let us now take a view of the work itself first casting our eyes upon and noting the general dis position of the whole  and then surveying it more distinctly in its parts The disposition of the whole is most elaborately exact Order is scrupulously observed  and every incident so faith fully arranged in its proper time that some have doubted whether annals were not a more proper title for it than history If we should call it annals it must be owned at the same time that annals were never composed with so much majesty and spirit and never was history more accurately distinguished by the punctuality of dates so nicely inter wove Thucydides states every occurrence in just place and time But he is forced for this purpose to make fre quent transitions and to drop a particular narration perhaps the very moment a reader s attention may be most fixed up on and most eager for the event If they cannot bear a disappointment here the remedy is ready at hand By turning over a few leaves they will find it regularly resumed in due place and time and they at once may satisfy their own curiosity without disarranging the author s scheme or perplexing that work which he was determined to keep quite clear and unembarrassed They will afterwards for Discourse hi lvii give perhaps applaud him for his great care to prevent confusion and to give a neat and precise conception of all that passeth He constantly gives notice when he is ne cessitated by the method he laid down for himself to make such transitions And when we have been amused with what looks like a ramble from an engaging part of history but is really a coincidence of events not to pass unheeded j when we have been so long at it that we are convinced it lies in the road and is no excursion at all yet we are glad to see him re connect and land us on a spot where we are already well acquainted He shews a steady and inviolable attachment to chronology a necessary attendant upon his tory But the chronology of Thucydides is like a herald that exactly marshals a long stately procession adjusts the rank clears the way and preserves every step distinct and unincumbered No writer had done this before him No settled JEra was yet in use not even the famous one of the Olympiad The several States of Greece computed time by a method of their own It was not easy to make those methods coin cide with one another The Athenians reckoned by their annual archons the Lacedaemonians by their ephori the Argives by the years of the priestess of Juno The seasons of the year when the two former entered on their offices were fixed but did not suit together in point of time  the beginning of the years of the latter was variable since it depended on the death or removal of a predecessor Thu cydides to avoid confusion left all these artificial jarring rules and adhered to the course of nature He divided the natural year into two halves into a summer and winter His summer includes the spring and reacheth from the vernal to the autumnal equinox the other half year is compre hended in his winter He always records eclipses as strange events and proper concomitants for the horrors of this war I must not be so sanguine as to imagine that he supposed such appearances might some time or other be reduced to Vol I H Iviii A Survey of the History exact calculation and astronomy be made the faithful guide of chronology Book I The First Book of Thucydides is introductory to the rest It is a comprehensive elaborate work of itself It clears away rubbish opens a view from the earliest ages strikes out light from obscurity and truth from fable that the reader may enter upon the Peloponnesian war with a perfect insight into the state of Greece and the schemes interest and strength of the contending parties The au thor unfolds his design in writing magnifies his subject complains of the ignorance and credulity of mankind rec tifies their mistakes removes all prejudice and furnishes us with the knowledge of every thing proper to be known tÂ enable us to look at the contention with judgment and dis cernment when the point contended for is no less than the sovereignty of the sea which that of the land must necessari ly follow He begins at the source and traces the original of the Greek communities from certain and indisputable facts and the growth of Attica in particular from the natural barren ness of the soil which tempted no invasions  and from the shelter its inhabitants gave to all who would settle amongst them and share their polity â He shews the invention of shipping to have been exceedingly mischievous at first It filled the sea with pirates to whom it gave a ready convey ance from coast to coast enabling them suddenly to seize and at leisure to carry off and secure their booty No con siderable commerce or rather none at all could be carried on till the shore was cleared of such annoyance And when few durst venture to settle on the coasts no marts could be opened for traffic and no ports were yet secure A ship was merely the instrument of ready conveyance from place to place It was not yet become an engine of attack and defence on the water Minos king of Crete made the first attempt with success to obtain a naval strength by â Years before Christ 1006 fciBCbtrftsE in lix which he cleared the isles of the pirates who had settled up on them to set out readier from thence on their plundering excursions â The grand fleet that carried such a numerous army to Troy was a mere collection of transports Thucy dides gives us a just and clear idea of that famous expedi tion After this celebrated sera the Corinthians were the first people of Greece who became in reality a maritime power Theii1 peculiar situation gave them an inclination and opportunity for commerce  and commerce must have strength to guard and support it They first improved a vessel of burden into a ship of warf and set power afloat as well as wealth Their neighbours in the isle of Corcyra soon followed their example and though originally a colony of their own be came a rival power at sea They fought on their own dar Jing element for superiority This was the most ancient sea fight but it was not decisive They continued for twc Centuries more to be rival and jarring powers  till a third that of Athens grew up which politically joined with one to gain the ascendant over them both and to assert the empire of the sea for itself The claim both of Corcyra and Corinth to the town of Epidamnus had occasioned their most recent embroilment and a hot war in which the Corcyreans applied for the al liance and aid of Athens On this was afterwards grounded the first pretext for the Peloponnesian war and therefore our Author opens the affair at large Athens held the ba lance of power in her hands  How she came to be possessed of it will soon give room for as pertinent a digression as Thucydides could have wished Ambassadors from both parties are soon at Athens one to negotiate alliance and aid the other to traverse their negotiation The people of Athens in whom the supreme power was vested admit them both to audience and orations of course must follow â Before Christ 904 f Before Christ 697  Before Christ 657 Â Before Christ 433 he A Surtey of the History Our grave Historian is now retired to make way for states men and orators to mount the stage who are very well worth hearing The Corcyr6ans who take the lead recognize  the ne  cessity of alliances which though sometimes intangle w ments are generally security and defence Wronged as  they now are they sue for alliance as the means of redress  In granting it to them the Athenians would shew honour  and virtue and at the same time promote their own private  interest The accession of the naval strength of Corcyra  to their own was very well worth the gaining  in the end  it might preserve their State â They open the nature of  colonies shew the original contract between them and the  mother country obedience and protection are reciprocal  and imply one another â They prove that Athens may  grant them alliance in consistence with all other engage  ments  by doing it may secure herself in time against the  envy and attack of the Peloponnesians since the naval strength of Corinth joined to all the efforts of the latter in  a future war will be weak and ineffectual against the com  bined fleets of Corcyra and Athens The Corinthians in their answer inveigh highly against the Corcyreans  They describe them as a very designing  iniquitous set of men and a colony in the highest degree  undutiful to its mother state  They endeavour to prove  it unjust and ungrateful too in the Athenians to take them  into alliance and abet their criminal behaviour They  maintain that true honour points out another conduct  and schemes of interest should never supersede the laws  of equity and good faith What may happen should be  less regarded than what on present occasions is strictly  right They intreat at last though with a menacing air  44 and close with warmly adjuring the Athenians to stand  neutral in the quarrel The Athenians however resolve to enter into a defen DISCOURSE III lxi sive alliance with Corcyra The war is renewed and the Athenians send the Corcyreans a petty aid which they afterwards reinforce Corcyra is secured and all the projects of the Corinthians are baffled who are highly ex asperated against the Athenians and never will forgive them Another affair soon happens to embroil them more and to make the second pretext for a general war Potidaea a town in the Isthmus of the Pallene was a Corinthian colony but at this time tributary to the Athenians Its situation between two bays and amongst the Athenian colonies on the coast of Thrace and Macedonia would enable it to gall the Athenians sorely in case of a rupture They order it there fore to be dismantled The Potidaeans refuse obedience and revolt A war ensues The Athenians attempt to reduce Potidaea and the Corinthians to support the revolt It is at length besieged by the former The siege runs out into a great length of time and at last becomes one of the conside rable events of the Peloponnesian war The Corinthians after this repeated provocation are full of resentments and leave no stone unturned to stir up a ge neral war in Greece They were parties themselves in the Peloponnesian league of which the Lacedaemonians were the head The Corinthians never set up for a leading State They were ever content with the secondary rank though the first in that rank Their turn was always more to com merce than war Commerce had long since made them rich  riches had made them luxurious and though they often produced great and excellent soldiers yet they never piqued themselves on being a martial or formidable people Athens indeed they hated Athens had rivalled them in trade and very much abridged the extent of their commerce One of the gulfs on which Corinth is seated that of Sarone was now intirely in the jurisdiction of the Athenians who had also begun to curb and straiten them much in the gulf of Crissa They were consequently bent on the demolition lxii A Survey of the History of this all grasping rival but were unable to effect it by their own strength They solicit all the confederates to re pair to Lacedaemon all full of complaint and remonstrance against the Athenians The Corinthians reserve themselves for the finishing charge  and our author repeats or makes for them their most inveigling and alarming speech on this occasion  They address the Lacedaemonians with an artful mix  ture of commendation and reproach of commendation  for their strict adherence to good faith of reproach for  their indolence and sloth They had suffered the State of  Athens to grow too mighty for their neighbours Though  the acknowledged deliverers of Greece they had now for  a length of time taken no notice of the incroachments of  the Athenians  but through wilful ignorance and habitual  supineness had let them grow too big and able now to en  slave them all â They do all they can to irritate and pro  voke them They draw an admirable parallel between them  and the Athenians  invidious and reproachful but directly  tending to exasperate those whom they want to exasperate  â Then they warmly renew their applications to the pride  of the Lacedaemonians  they alarm their fears  they flatter  and reproach their foibles They even threaten to abandon 4 their league unless they exert themselves in defence of their  friends they endeavour to prove the necessity of active  and vigorous measures  and end with a very artful stroke  of insinuating and persuasive address An Athenian embassy now residing at Lacedaemon being informed of these loud and bitter outcries against their mas ters beg an immediate audience Accordingly they are admitted  not indeed to plead before Lacedaemonians as their judges or superiorsâ Athenians scorn such self debasement but to vindicate their State from misrepresentations to clear her reputation and justify her power  With this view they run over the great services they  had done to Greece in the time of the Persian invasions JDISCOVRSE III ixiii 0 V They had ever been the most strenuous most disinterested 44 and most gallant champions for liberty They pompously  detail their battles of Marathon and Salamis  their evacu  ating Athens on the last occasion and when they had no  polity of their own subsisting fighting ardently and success  fully for the other communities of Greece Their power  had been nobly earned and must they forego it because  it was envied  They had honourably gained and justly  used it much more jusdy than the Lacedaemonians had it  either in will or ability to have done They are calumnia 44 ted merely from that spite and discontent so common to ft mankind who ever hate and abuse their superiors and ever  repine at subjection though to the most gentle masters â 4 Lacedaemonians have neither skill nor judgment for large  command and though most eagerly grasping at it are un M able to manage it with any measure of dexterity and address  They should reflect again and again before they ventured  upon war It might last longer and involve them in more Â 4 calamities than they seemed willing to apprehend They  had better submit their complaints to fair arbitration If 4 not the Athenians invoke the Gods to witness their readi  ness to defend themselves whenever and however their 4 enemies shall attack them All parties now withdraw  and the Lacedaemonians go to council amongst themselves Exasperated by the Corinthi ans and mortified by the speech of the Athenians the ma jority are for an immediate declaration of war Archidamus one of their kings rose up to temper their fury And the speech of his Spartan majesty on this occasion carries all the marks of a good king an able statesman and a thorough patriot It does honour both to his heart and head A Spar tan king never made a royal figure but at the head of an army Then he reigned indeed And yet Archidamus re tains no selfish considerations  they are lost in his regard for the public welfare He tells them  he is not fond of war himself raw un btiv A Survey of the History  experienced youth alone is liable to such weakness The 44 war now under consideration is a most important point M It may run out into a great length of time It is against  Atheniansâ a remote peopleâ a naval powerâ abounding  in wealthâ excellently provided in all respects He de  mands in every single article whether they can presume  to become a match for such antagonists  They should re  remember the high spirit the habits of activity and perse  verance so natural to these Athenians who are not to be  dejected at the first loss nor frightened at big words or  haughty threats Insults indeed must not be brooked  but adequate preparations should be made to avenge  them and time be gained to make such preparations  It would be most prudent to begin a negociation to spin it  out into length If affairs can be amicably adjusted it  would deserve their choice â If not when they are com  petently enabled it will be soon enough to act offensively  He dreads not war himself yet war cannot be carried on  without money Ample funds must be provided a work  of time and deliberation Circumspection is no real re  proach precipitation draws positive mischiefs after it  Lacedaemonians are used to be calm and considerate  they should not now be cajoled or exasperated out of their judgment The Athenians are a wise and dextrous people  The Lacedaemonians should keep that in remembrance  and support their own characters of calmness of spirit and  true manly resolution They should begin with caution  proceed with temper end all things amicably if they can   if not when duly prepared and adequately provided they  might trust the decision to arms The Kings of Sparta were ever justled on their thrones by the haughty overbearing Ephori Sthenelai das one of that college answers Archidamus in a short blunt properly laconic speech  He is severe upon the Athenians sneers  Archidamus and avers that Lacedaemonians should not  deliberate upon but instantly take the field and avenge DISCOURSE III lxv  their wrongs He then put the questionâ Whether the peace was broke â divided the council told the votes  and declared in the English style that the Ayes had it The confederates were now called in and acquainted with the resolution Yet it seems the advice of Archida mus had carried some weight and actual war was to be de ferred till all the parties in the Lacedaemonian league had ripened their measures and were ready to act with unanimity and vigor Here the author again makes his appearance and assures us the true motive of the determination for a war at Sparta was a JEALOUSY of the Athenian power now very great and a dread of its more extensive growth  the latter of which they were determined to prevent and to reduce the former within less distasteful and terrific bounds Then follows a most pertinent digression in which Thu cydides points out the steps by which the Athenians had so highly exalted their State In a close and succinct manner he runs over the history of Athens for fifty years from the invasion of Xerxes to the breaking out of the Peloponne sian war He arranges all the incidents in due place and time Herodotus hath related the splendid passages of the Grecian history during that invasion  hath exhibited The mistocles in all the lustre of his command at the battle of Salamis where the Athenians who had abandoned their all fought and through the address of Themistocles obliged all parties to fight for liberty against Xerxes On this day they earned a greater title than that of citizens of Athens they were afterwards acknowledged the sovereigns of the sea The Lacedaemonians became mortified at it but the Athenians had gloriously deserved it Themistocles was the very life and soul of Greece on this occasion In the midst of difficulties he formed a most extensive plan for his be loved Athens which he began to execute at once Thu cydides describes his address and foresight He soon sets the city bevond the reach of envy and jealousy And Vol 1  I hnri A Survey of the History though soon after he lost his country through the malice of his personal enemies and the enemies of his country in con junction with them yet the statesmen and patriots left behind pursued his plan of naval power And the steps of its pro gress and advancement are minutely traced out by our His torian Themistocles had made all safe and secure at home The Lorig walls were built the Piroeus a spacious harbour opened and fortified a magazine for traffic and an arsenal for war Aristides as true a patriot as ever lived made all secure abroad Through his honest management all Greece submitted to an annual tax for the guard of their common liberty against future invasions and the leaders at sea were made collectors and treasurers of this naval fund The isle of Delos was the place at first of lodging this fund but it was soon after removed to Athens â a shrewd political step yet capable however of an ample if not full justification The war is briskly carried on against the Persian monarch  the isles and seas are cleared of the common enemy the cities on the coast are regained or conquered Cimon also performs his part nobly he earns two victories the same day by sea and land on the coast of Ionia from the Persians He compleated a negotiation with the petty maritime States confederate with Athens who were tired of incessant war fare for accepting sums of money instead of ships and per sonal attendance By this means the shipping of those States soon mouldered away and their money was by their own agreement sent thither to increase and strengthen the maritime power of Athens In spite of all the opposition which the Corinthians and Boeotians gave them at home whose rancour to them was never to be appeased in the course of no large number of years they had established a very extensive and formidable empire indeed The isles and coasts of the iEgtan sea were mostly their own The bay of Sarone was intirely in their own jurisdiction And by being masters of Naupactus they considerably awed the DISCOURSE III bay of Crissa Their squadrons cruized round and quite awed the coasts of Peloponnesus Their interest at Ce phallene and the new alliance which gained them the acces sion of the naval strength of Corcyra rendered them masters of the Ionian and they had colonies to extend their traffic and influence both in Italy and Sicily These points are opened step by step in this digression by Thucydides till jealousy in the Lacedaemonians and malice in the Corinthians irritated all the Peloponnesian States and their allies against them and ended in the determination for war The Corinthians had now carried their point and soon hoped to gratify all their resentments Accordingly at the second grand congress at Sparta when all the rest of the States had declared their minds they warmly encourage them to enter at once upon an offensive war in a very studied and elaborate speech  They set out with handsome compliments to the Lace  daemonians They animate the landed States of Pelopon  nesus to join effectually with those on the coasts A firm  and lasting peace can only be obtained by a vigorous war  and the power of Athens must needs be reduced â They  open a planâ for establishing fundsâ for weakening the  marine of Athens and consequently for improving and  strengthening the marine of her enemiesâ for effectuating  the revolts of her dependentsâ and raising fortifications  in Attica itself Independence can never be earned at  too great a price it costs as much to be voluntary and  obedient slaves A single State should never be suffered  to play the tyrant in Greece Their own reputation their  dignity their liberty their welfare a most righteous cause  nay the very Gods themselves summon them to action  They close with a very warm and pathetic recapitulation  sounding as it were the alarm for the destruction of  Athens Now war is a second time resolved upon by ballot All are ordered to get ready with the utmost dispatch to be lyviii A Survey of the History gin its operations In the mean time the Athenians are to be amused with embassies and negotiations merely to gain time and save appearances Frivolous they really are but our author minutely details them as they give him an op portunity of introducing some notable passages relating to Cylon Pausanias and Themistocles He then shifts the scene to Athens and introduces Pericles the most com manding orator the greatest general the most consummate statesman and at this time prime minister of the republicâ introduces Pericles I say in the assembly of the people to give them an insight into the schemes of their enemies and a plan for their own conduct to encourage them to a brave and steady resistance in strict adherence to such methods as in the end will infallibly not barely secure but aggrandize their State The thoughts in this speech of Pericles are so grand so nervous so emphatically and concisely just that if the rea der be not immediately struck into an adequate conception of them I know no method of opening his eyes or enlarging his understanding He says but little but says every thing in that little He demolisheth all the assertions of the Co rinthians in their last speech at Sparta as if he had heard them speak Perhaps Thucydides here hath not sufficiently concealed his art in writing But the speech is intirely in character compleatly suited to the heart and hsad and mouth of Pericles Pericles I observe it with pleasure is an Englishman both in heart and judgment England hath adhered and will adhere to the lessons which Athens ne glected and forgotâ Of vast consequence indeed says this enlightened statesman  is the dominion of the sea But  consider it with attention For were we seated on an  island as the force of his argument evidently implies  we could never be subdued And now you ought to think  that our present situation is nearly as possible the same  and so to evacuate your houses and lands in Attica and  to confine your defence to the sea If this can need a DISCOURSE III lxil comment Xenophon will give it in his Polity of the Athe nians â Â Tn one point says he the Athenians are deficient  Â iif beside their being sovereigns of the sea they were  seated on an island it would be ever in their power to ra  vage others at pleasure and yet they could not be ravaged  themselves so long as they held the mastery at sea their  lands could never be laid waste no enemy could post  themselves upon them But now the occupiers of lands  and the wealthy Athenians fly before invaders  whilst the 4 people in general conscious they have nothing to be burnt  and nothing to be plundered live exempt from fear nor  fly before an invader The expedient used on such occa  sions is that the former deposit their most valuable ef  fects in the isles and trusting to their superiority at sea  slight all the devastations an enemy can make in Attica England is complete where Athens was deficient And how fond must both Pericles and Xenophon have been of the island and maritime power of Great Britain  I will not pre tend to anticipate the reader s pleasure by descending into more particularities It may suffice to add that the final answer of the Athenians is drawn up by the advice of Pe ricles that  they will do nothing by command they had  already offered to refer all disputes to a fair judicial deci  sion so far only but no farther compliance must be ex  pected from Athens Here all negociation comes to an end and the war will very soon commence Thus I have endeavoured to give some idea of the first book of Thucydides It is a grand piece of work beyond all denial But Rapin thinks our author hath overdone it  out  of a desire of prefixing a too stately portal to his his  tory Could the portal have been thought too stately if the whole fabric had been compleatly finished  To form a right judgment here we should examine the Resign and not the execution The latter is imperfect is broke off So look at it from the park the Banqueting house at Whitehall k too big and towering for what stands near it But hath lxx A Survey of the Histori it that appearance in the original plan of Inigo Jones for the magnificent palace once designed to be erected  Some thing of this nature may justly be pleaded in favour of Thu cydides and teach us not to judge too hastily of a whole when we cannot survey all the parts because they never were finished Moved by decorum I would gladly justify my author but I by no means pretend to decide the point Book II The Second Book opens with the first act of hostility The Thebans march by night and enter by sur prize the city of Plataea This city and petty State though just within Boeotia was not comprised in the union of which all the other cities of Boeotia were constituents with Thebes at their head but had ever been firmly attached even in the worst of times to the common liberty of Greece and was under the protection of and in fast alliance with Athens This surprize of Plataea our author describes in all its turns till its enemies are driven out or slaughtered and a place is secured for the Athenians A rupture hath now been made and the war is going to be general Thucydides sounds the charge in all the dis position and spirit of Homer He catalogues the allies on both sides He awakens our expectation  and fast engages our attention All mankind are concerned in the impor tant point now going to be decided Endeavours are made to disclose futurity Heaven itself is interested in the dis pute The earth totters and nature seems to labour with the great event This is his solemn and sublime manner of setting out Thus he magnifies a war between two as Ra pin styles them petty States  and thus artfully he supports a little subject by treating it in a great and noble method Writers who have been long contemplating the vast gigan tic size of the Roman Empire if they cast their eyes on the State of Athens even at the present juncture are apt to form a low idea of it Athens it is true was at this time in the highest meridian of her power Yet why ever to be pitching upon the most disadvantageous and incongruous parallels  DISCOURSE III lxxi His subject was certainly the greatest that to this day had occurred in the world And ought Thucydides to be degra ded or even lessened at all because he was not born in the same age with Livy  As much amusement at least accom panies and as much instruction flows from reading carefully the history of Athens as from that of Rome Wonder may be more raised by the latter and the wonder may end in detestation of a people who became enormously great by the miseries and destruction of their fellow creatures The Ro mans were but brute like men They were not tolerably hu manised till they had conquered Greece Greece re con quered them and established a better more lasting triumph over mind than the others over body Grxcia capta ferum victorem cepitâ for Who then best deserve the applause of the heart the citi zens of Athens or the citizens of Rome  I am not at all in doubt how men of a calm and considerate spirit will decide the question Or Vet such as judge only by numbers consi der a little more sedately whether Athens at this time was that diminutive and petty State which could be magnified and enobled only by artifice The first army that invaded her territories in this war consisted according to Plutarch of sixty thousand men This is an object big enough to fill the eye The state of her revenue when the value of money is adjusted will turn out by no means trifling They were possessed at the breaking out of the war of three hundred triremes fit for sea Two hundred and fifty of them were at one time in commission in the fourth year of the war Con sequently at two hundred men a ship the number of seamen employed must have been fifty thousand If the reader be not yet convinced that Athens was not a petty State nothing can get the better of his prejudice It would be pity any one should sit down to Thucydides with such low pre posses sions against his subject The confederate army of Peloponnesians is now assem btxii A survey of the History Wed and ready to march into Attica under the command of Archidamus Like an able and cautious general he ha rangues his troops  encourages them with a sight of their  own numbers but guards them from catching at that sight  a contempt of their foes The strict observation of dis  cipline is always necessary to armies be they never so  large No enemy ought ever to be despised much less  Athenians 1 hough an enemy he speaks in high com  mendation of the latter and establishes the dignity of their  characters He ends with an exhortation to his troops  to observe rules conform to discipline and bravely to  execute orders and Spartan like concludes with an en  comium on the beauty and strength of strict military obe  dience He then sends a messenger to Athens to try if a war were yet to be avoided The Athenians are as determined as ever to make no submissions The messenger is con ducted out of their territories and parts from his escort with a pathetic prediction of the miseries in which all Greece is going to be involved Attica soon after is invaded The mischief done by the invaders is described and the sense at Athens of their sufferings and distresses represented at large The reader on this occasion will be let into the form and constitution of the Athenian polity He will see how they began to be moulded into one community by the prudence of Theseus one of their earliest kings Other his torians expatiate on the method by which from being under a regal they had varied gradually into a purely republican form I shall only mention an observation that contrary to most other nations tluy had abolished the regal govern ment not from distate but reverence to kings Codrus the last of their kings had devoted himself for his country and was so worthy a man that they resolved no mortal should afterwards wear that title amongst them They de clared Jupiter king of Athens about the same time that â TourreU s Preface Historique DISCOURSE III the Jews rebelled against theocracy and would have a man to reign over them Archons for life succeeded whose term was afterwards abridged to ten years  then to a single year All general histories point out the variations till they came to the popular form which now prevailed The enemy after heavy depredations at length evacuated Attica and the Athenians take the field to retaliate upon them Their squadron had been all the time at sea cruizing upon and infesting the coasts of Peloponnesus But in the winter we are called to Athens to see the public funeral of those who were killed in the first campaign Here the first time it occurs our author describes this solemnity and Peri cles makes the Funeral oration I shall make no reflections on this celebrated performance Should the reader not think it deserving of its high reputa tion I fear the translator will be sadly to blame It is hard to give such noble ideas their proper energy and such re fined ones their due exactness The great orators of Athens were always glad to display their abilities on the same oc casion Plato hath entered the lists with a high spirit of emulation and with a high degree of success And a great master this way hath lately made him English If Thu eydides suffers by a comparison which now the unlearned but judicious reader is impowered to make the latter must be intreated to observe that the eloquence of Plato was be yond dispute more smooth and fluent more accomplished in all that is beautiful and sweet than the eloquence of Thucy dides but an adjudged inferiority in any other respect must be laid at the door of his translator After such an exhilarating and enlivening piece for such it must have been to all who heard it and must have deter mined every Athenian to suffer any thing with intrepidity and patience in the cause of his country a very mournful scene immediately succeeds which lays them under such a load of affliction and distress as no arguments no philoso â Mr West Vol I K Ixxiv A Survey of the History phy can alleviate The plague breaks out at Athens  and the reader must be ready to feel very sharp emotions in be half of his fellow creatures and in behalf of morality and virtue too Amidst their accumulated distresses Pericles is the only support of the community and like the greatest benefactors to ungrateful men is cursed for being their sup port and reproached for being steadily wise and in the right At last he convenes them and addresses them with such an air of ingenuity such spirit and conscious dignity and firm reliance on a good cause as only two orators that I know of have ever equalled on parallel occasions Those I mean are Demosthenes and St Paul All the world of letters and good taste are well acquainted with the oration of the former against iEschines about the crown  and every class of readers is surely well versed in the Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians I can but hint these resemblances since now I must attend on Pericles who sooths or thunders his countrymen out of all their discontent and malice and sends them home convinced and ashamed But domestic distress soon efFaceth any other impressions their passions are again inflamed by inwardly corroding anguish and Peri cles after all must be fined and turned out of his employ ments Yet people are not always mad good sense and conviction return upon them  and he is begged because most worthy again to accept the sole administration He enjoys it but a little time before he is carried off by the plague Athens then lost her ablest honestest statesman He was able to have sat at the helm of government to have steered the republic safe through every storm and to have insured her not bare security but open triumph His successors were very alert at catching hold of that helm  but none of them could hold it long and the vessel through their mutual quarrels must needs run aground or founder at last But the next remarkable passage in the history is the march of the Peloponnesians to invest Plataea and the so DISCOURSE III lemn parley held at their approach Archidamus is at the head of this ungenerous enterprise The malice of the The bans must be gratified since the alliance of Boeotia in this war is of mighty consequence and to be purchased at any rate Archidamus indeed struggles hard for the Plataeans  he would fain spare them could he persuade them to a neu trality But the Plataeans have too much honour and gra titude to be neutral when Athens their faithful guardian and ally is principally struck at They remonstrate in vain from the topics of honour justice gratitude the glory and sanction of the great progenitors on either side The siege is formed and strenuously plied though without success Our author always shines in exact description  No method of annoyance or defence is omitted It is at length turned into a blockade and a sufficient body of troops left behind to carry it on when the main army marcheth off The war grows warm in more remote quarters in Thrace and in Acarnania An Athenian squadron stationed at Naupactus in the bay of Crissa awed all the motions of the Corinthians and allies on their own coasts  and it was de termined to clear away this annoyance Accordingly they launch out against it with more than double the number of vessels The Athenians at one exertion of skill drive them all on a heap defeat them and make prizes of twelve The Lacedaemonians excellent land men but very awkward sea men think this an unaccountable event They send down their most active commanders to refit and reinforce the fleet and to try their fortune again at sea Much artifice is em ployed on both sides The short harangues of the admirals let us into all the views and designs of either party Phor mio at length is snared the enemy blunders then Phormio extricates himself and gives them a second defeat The reader sees every tack and the motion of every vessel Disconcerted here they form a bold project indeed to surprise the Piraeus by night and to finish the war in a mo tÂ Â vi A Survey of the History ment The project is described and the probability of suc cess established But the very grandeur of the attempt de ters the undertakers Athens indeed is alarmed and thrown into a great consternation but the project totally miscarries and the Piraeus is better secured for the future All Thrace is now arming under Sitalces against Perdic cas king of Macedonia A vast army of Barbarians is as sembled marches over a great length of country strikes a general panic effectuates no real service and soon disperses or moulders away Such bulky unwieldy armies make an awkward figure compared with the regularity exact disci pline and personal bravery of the diminutive armies of Greece Thucydides gives us once more a sight of Phormio and his gallant squadron and then closeth the book and the history of the third year of the war  Never history says  Rapin comprised so much matter in so little room nor so much action in so few words If any thing can be found fault with it is that the exploits are too closely  crowded with one another so that the coherence seems  somewhat intricate and confused and the multiplying of  objects tends only to dissipate the attention of the reader An historian however is to take his incidents in their natu ral order as they subsist in fact He is not so much to dispose as to describe them If he does the latter perti nently accurately and with a due attention to their im portance he hath acquitted himself of his duty The poet or writer of fiction must pick out and heighten his incidents with a view to fill up properly and give to every distinct object its needful splendor He is to exert his choice and by exerting it judiciously to gain applause The historian is not to pick but to make the best use of his materials He may give them indeed all possible lustre but if they crowd too thick upon one another the reader may be embarrassed with the number yet nobody can be justly blamed Book III The Third Book is no less full of matter than DISCOURSE Til Ixxvii the preceding The incidents crowd fast upon one another and politics and oratory are in full employ The revolt of Lesbos is the first occurrence of importance The people of that isle had been long in the Athenian league  But the number of this league were dependents rather than confe derates Thucydides always employs the same Greek word rvn uixÂ i for the members of either league The idea it gives is that of companions in war But there is great dif ference between such as accompany because they chuse it and such as accompany because they are summoned and cannot help it The former was in general the case of those who sided with Sparta the latter of those who sided with Athens The least thought of compulsion is grating to any State which thinks it ought and is able to be quite independent This was the case with the Lesbians a people considerable in many respects but especially for their naval strength It was well worth the while of the Lacedaemo nions to gain such confederates  it must be a sad blow to the Athenians to lose such dependents The fact was all the cities of Lesbos except Methymne declare a revolt The Athenians lose no time but are at once with a powerful squadron before Mitylene and block it up The Mityle neans had sent ambassadors to beg immediate aid from the Lacedaemonians They had an audience from them and the rest of their league at Olympia so soon as the games were ended The speech they make on this occasion is very artful very insinuating and nicely adapted to carry their point  They open the nature of a revolt and the cases in  which it merits protection and succour from others They  have been ill used by the Athenians have been made  their tools in inslaving their compatriots of Greece  have  been long caressed indeed but are well assured what their  own fate would soon have been Every State hath a na  tural right to take preventive measures against the loss of  their liberty and to stand on their defence They had bcxviii A Survey of the History  revolted sooner would the Lacedaemonians have counte  nanced the measure They had declared it on the first  invitation of the Boeotians It was a noble revolt it had  disengaged them from a combination to inslave the rest  of Greece  it had associated them in the cause of honour  and liberty It had been made indeed with too much  precipitation  but this should make others more zealous  and active in their protection who would reap a great  accession of strength by it an accession of maritime  strength  whilst the Athenians would be weakened in  point of shipping and in point of revenue It would be  a signal of revolt to others and assurance to them that  they might do it safely It would reflect abundant ho  nour on the Lacedaemonians to succour the distressed to  save men whose preservation would give them glory and  strength and prove them those hearty friends to liberty  which all Greece with united praises acknowledged them  to be Interest without rhetoric was strong enough to insure their success But the latter helped to gain them a prompt recep tion from the Lacedaemonians who resolve on sending them a succour and making diversions on the Athenians in order to oblige them to raise the siege of Mitylene The blockade of Plataea by the Peloponnesians still con tinuing our author relates the bold project and bold exe cution of the project of a party of Plataeans in making their escape over all the works of the besiegers It is a most circumstantial and a most clear and intelligible rela tion Mitylene is now forced to surrender at discretion The principal agents in the late revolt are sent prisoners to Athens where the people vote that  not they only but all the Mity  leneans in general be put to death  and an order is immedi ately dispatched to their commander at Mitylene to execute his part of the sentence This bloody decree was carried by Cleon a furious demagogue It was he who worked up the DISCOURSE III people of Athens to such a pitch of inhumanity which how ever instantly subsided They are struck with horror at their own resolution and will have it again debated We shall hear the two speakers on each side of the question Cleon and Diodotus  Cleon sets out with all the fury and fire of a man who  hath a bad heart He hath abjured humanity to shew  himself a most zealous patriot Eloquent he is acknow  ledged to have been and so appears in his invectives  against his own masters and his own tools the people for  their foolish commiseration for their being the eternal  dupes of orators of subtle and venal speakers For his  own part he loves his country and hates her enemies M Guilt shall never find an advocate in him  he calls out for  vengeance on the Mityleneans none but their pensioners  none but men who are bribed and corrupted can offer a  plea in their behalf He bids his audience throw away all  foolish pity all womanish forbearance to fix their atten  tion on the crimes of the guilty and not on the horrors a of their punishment and give this proof to their depend  ents that death shall inevitably be the portion of all re  volters that their arms may be henceforth employed in op  posing their public enemies and not in chastising their own  subjects Diodotus replies in a speech that shews him a real patriot and a man who thought good manners a calm considerate temper and a regard to humanity to be very consistent with the true patriot spirit  He therefore defends the re  committing of their former resolution since repeated con  sulfations cannot be prejudicial to the public welfare It  is a base and odious method to lavish the charge of ig  norance and venality on men who differ in sentiment it  robs the public of its ablest counsellors and sincerest  friends Strict justice in the present instance may be  with Cleon but the future and lasting welfare of their  country is the object now to be kept in view The punish A Survey of the History  ment of death hath never effectually awed the tempers of  mankind To make men desperate is very impolitic  to 44 extirpate their dependents is lopping off their own limbs  and ruining their own revenue Men should be retained M in their duty by mild discretionary precautions  severe  and sanguinary proceedings never answer the purpose  And what cruelty to doom a whole people to destruc  tion to involve the innocent with the guilty to murder  even such as had been their friends and benefactors  He  advises them not to give too large a scope to mercy but  to punish the guilty and the guilty alone This will suf  ficiently intimidate others  will secure their interest in  Lesbos better for the future and convince the world  how soundly Athenians can deliberate upon all their con Â eerns Diodotus carries his point The Athenians cruel only in the fit of choler but habitually humane repeal the bloody sen tence  and dispatch a vessel with all haste to stop execution which arrives at Mitylene but just time enough to prevent the massacre The next event of importance contrasts the Lacedaemo nian character with that of the Athenians The author takes no pains to point it out but it lies too ready and obvious to pass unobserved â Platcea after a tedious blockade is obliged by famine to surrender They surrender however to the Lacedaemonians on condition of being brought to a judicial trial and only if found guilty of unjust behaviour to be put to death Some delegates arrive from Sparta to preside in this court of mere inquisition since the whole process is confined to a single questionâ Whether they  had done any positive service to the Lacedaemonians and  allies â that is to their declared and determined enemiesâ  in the present war  The question plainly manifested a deliberate resolution to put them all to death And all the favour they obtain is to be suffered to make a kind of dying speech before men who were styled indeed judges but in DISCOURSE III IXXXJ fact wert butchers It was a case of great commiseration and the speaker lays it open with all that natural eloquence which flows from an inward and keen sensibility If men were not deaf to persuasion it must have persuaded The cause was most alarming and a more pathetic plea hath never been exhibited  They insist that on a fair and explicit condition they  had surrendered to the Lacedaemonians whereas now they  were prejudged and precondemned to gratify their unre  lenting foes the Thebans The insidious question left them  no plea at all They could not answer it and must not  be silent Since life is at stake something must be said  even by men who despair of persuading Their quarrel  with the Thebans had been just and honourable quarrel  with the Lacedaemonians they never had any Nay  merely at the desire of the latter had they cultivated  Athenian friendship that unpardonable crime for which  they were now doomed to destruction They expatiate  with truth and energy on the great services they had done  to the liberty of Greece All Greece was bound in ho 4 nour in gratitude in deference to positive and solemn  oaths to preserve the Plataeans Ought every tie to be  rent asunder generosity to be quite expunged and all be  nevolence thrown aside to serve a private turn  Ought  Plataeans to be thus basely reduced as they really had  been either to be starved or to be butchered  The Lace  cUemonians should intreat the Thebans for them should  beg them to save the lives of friends and benefactors  at  least should replace them within their walls and leave  them to the fate of war They apply to their generosity  to their humanity  they strive to give them some emotions  of pity they represent the liableness of mankind to cala  mity how brutal it is to be deliberately hard hearted  how sinful it is to be resolutely ungrateful They call upon  heaven and earth to interpose in their behalf they run  over every pathetic and persuasive topic  until they can Voi I L lxxxii A Survey of the History  add no more and yet dare not end and again intreat  the Lacedaemonians to save those worthy patriots to  whom all Greece is indebted for her liberty and indepen  dence The Thebans who were afraid the Lacedaemonians had a higher sense of honour and gratitude than they really had demand also to be heard In the speech they make on this occasion  they first  accuse the Plataeans of slander and invective They en  deavour to palliate the reproach on themselves for desert  ing the cause of liberty and joining the arms of Persia  The Plataeans had been active ever since to betray it to  the Athenians  that wicked scheme which with all their  power the Thebans had ever opposed By such iniqui  tous conduct the Plataeans had extinguished their former  glory had effaced all their former merits Nobody was  bound to redress or pity them but their friends the Athe  nians Their temper had been always bad always bent on violence and mischief always addicted to set up ty  ranny in Greece provided Athenians were the tyrants  They then endeavour to throw an anti pathetic into their  own representations They paint the death of their coun  trymen slain at the surprise of Plataea in a mournful light  as put to death contrary to every law and murdered in  the very act of stretching out their hands and pleading  a promise of life The lives therefore of such butchers  are forfeited to justice and they insist the forfeit shall  be taken The Lacedaemonians are bound in honour to  take it They beg them therefore to be deaf to vain com  plaints and intreaties to revenge the injured and to punish  the guilty to regard what bad men have done and not  what they have said to defy eloquence and heed only  simple unsophisticated truth by which alone men who  preside in judgment can satisfy their conscience and their  duty An alliance with Thebes is necessan in this war to the DISCOURSE III lxxxiii Lacedaemonians and they purchase it at a mighty price in deed The wretched Plateans by all mankind abandoned are butchered one after another to the number of two hun dred  their wives are sold for slaves  their city is rooted up from its foundations Thucydides soon after describes the sedition of Corcyra the horrors of which are scarcely to be paralleled in story He paints all the dreadful consequences of faction in a community And what pity it is that a warm generous and innate love of liberty when carried to excess should be the source of so much misery to reasonable creatures Our author contrary to his custom runs out here into manv grave and judicious reflexions in the interest of no party a champion for no particular form but as a friend to man and a friend to virtue It is the lust of power that throws embroilments and confusions into all communities In go vernments strictly republican the ambitious are eager to ob tain more than an equal share In an oligarchical form the few in power want ever to retain and often to enlarge their share  and the cry of liberty is shouted loudest by those who want most to overthrow it But yet was the mat ter ever mended or the miseries of mankind prevented by setting up a single tyrant  Communities have suffered more for the caprice for the support of the nominal glory of such a head than they have done by a number of popular seditions The reader will certainly all along reflect on the fine model of government established in his own country  and own that a community may be governed and yet be happy that the power of the one and of the few and of the many may be tempered into an apt and lasting consistence and as it hath been for ages in a train of improvement keep it but unhurt by intestine faction may last to the dissolution of this great globe itself After this tragical business of Corcyra Thucydides en ters upon the affairs of Sicily The seeds of war are sow ing in that island which will afterwards grow into a mighty lxxxiv A Survey of the History harvest â He relates other incidents until he comes to a remarkable scene of war in iEtolia where Demosthenes the Athenian commander is totally defeated â He describes the purification of the isle of Delos by the Athenians  and hath found the art to make it a cheerful and entertaining piece for the relief of the reader after he hath been engaged in so many scenes of horror and destruction and is soon going to be engaged in more â The battles of Olpe and Idomene are sufficiently stored with slaughter to glut any reader who delights in blood The armies in this history have been often thought not to be sufficiently numerous They make no havoc  they do not knock one another on the head fast enough to preserve attention But these old Greeks were men and not brutes And it is pity that the history of men should be so much a history of the destruction of the human species Book IV In the Fourth Book the Athenians and La cedaemonians principals in the war are matched directly against one another Demosthenes a wise and brave com mander had seized and fortified Pylus in the territories of the latter had placed such a garrison in it as annoyed the whole country and in the end might wound the very vitals of that State The Lacedaemonians slight it at first as if their bare appearance would remedy all But upon trial their land armies and their squadrons are unable to dislodge the enemy It is with the true martial spirit of an experienced and gal lant commander that Demosthenes harangues his small body of Athenians when he draws them up on the beach of the sea to beat off the ships of the enemy Thucydides shines on these occasions  in him the addresses are always made and pertinently made to the soldiers who are present they interest and animate but never run out into declama tion and common place â The turns of war at Pylus are sud den and engage attention They fight by land and fight by sea nay what is more land battles are fought from the water and naval battles fought from off the shore The eye DISCOURSE III lxXXV will distinctly view these strange occurrences they are painted strong the groupes are not mere heaps of confu sion and the principal figures are eminently distinguished The body of Spartans intercepted in the isle of Sphacteria who must either starve or what to Lacedaemonians is full as bad must surrender their persons and their arms is a point that exceedingly alarms that martial community Things had long since gone against them  but now then hereditary honour and military glory on which and which alone they piqued themselves are in danger of being misera bly tarnished Their proud spirits condescend to heg a truce that they may send an embassy to Athens to solicit an no commodatlon It must have afforded a high degree of spiteful joy at Athens to find the Lacedaemonians lengthening their mo nosyllables and petitioning for peace It is curious to heaf in what manner they solicit when admitted to audience They declare themselves sent  in behalf of their country  men to propose an expedient very much for the honour 44 of Athens and which would extricate themselves from  difficulties that now bore hard upon them Athens never  had so fine an opportunity of raising her credit securing  her acquisitions and carrying her glory to the highest  pitch They should not be puffed up but reflect on the  strange vicissitude of human affairs Who could expect  the Lacedaemonians should ever be sunk so low as to sue 44 for peace  Yet what was the lot of Sparta might possibly  become some time or other the lot of Athens The lat 44 ter should be moderate now should accept of offered  friendship should chearfully receive a submission made  only to prevent desperation in great and gallant souls and  open a field for mutual benevolence The rival States  may now be reconciled and only now before things are 4 brought to extremities and disgrace hath rendered one  party desperate At this crisis the Athenians may con 44 fer on Greece the bksaiag of a firm and lasting peace Ixxxvi A Survey of the History  and reap all the honour and advantage of it since all the  credit of it will be their own Lacedamonians may be  obliged but will not be compelled At length they propose  their expedient not explicitly but with a shrewd insinuation  that would the Athenians strike up a bargain with them  they might jointly lord it over Greece for the future  beyond controul Had Pericles been now alive we may easily guess how readily he would have laid hold on this opportunity to end a burthensome and distressful war which on the side of Athens had at first been necessitated and merely defensive But success had elevated Athens quite too high  and no real friend to the State had at present so much influence as Cleon that loud and boisterous demagogue Hence it comes that such terms are insisted upon as the Lacedaemonians cannot in honour accept The truce expires  and all the attention of Greece is fixed on the important scene of contention at Pylus The author here interposeth an account of what was now doing in Sicily and then returns to Pylus The Spartans in the isle seem as far off a surrender as ever The people of Athens murmur at the slowness of their troops and begin to think that after all they shall not carry the point Cleon amuses them with lies and exasperates them by slanders  In short though quite undesigning it he bullies himself into the command and at the head of a reinforcement joins Demosthenes at Pylus The author describes the event with so much state and dignity that he raises it into another Thermopylae There three hundred Spartans stopped for a long time the whole numerous army of Xerxes and perished in the sen ice About the same number of them struggle here as long as they can against the troops of Athens  but to the disappointment of all Greece they at last surrender prisoners of war and are carried nay are carried by Cleon in triumph to Athens The territories of Corinth are invaded soon after by the discourse in lxxxvii Athenians under Nicias the consequence of which is the battle of Solygia We are then recalled to view the last acts of the tragical sedition at Corcyra quite of a piece with or rather in cruelty and horror transcending the pre ceding In the eighth year of the war the Athenians proceed with success The conquest of the isle of Cythera by Nicias is another sad blow to the Lacedaemonians They are quite dispirited  and dare no longer face in the field these active and lively and now more so because successful enemies Our author repasseth to Sicily The Athenians had been hovering with a squadron on that coast on pretence of aid ing the Egesteans but in fact to excite a war and embroil the States of that island Syracuse the leading State per ceived all their schemes and endeavoured to prevent them They first obtain a suspension of arms amongst all the par ties at war and prevail on the Sicilians to hold a general congress at Gela for the amicable adjustment of all their quarrels and a perfect re union against foreign enemies Hermocrates the plenipotentiary from Syracuse opens the true interest of Sicily on this occasion The warrior must now give place to the politician who shews himself a master in the business  He is here he tells them as representative of the  greatest of the Sicilian States As such he cannot speak  from pusillanimity or a sense of fear though he declares  himself averse to war It is difficult to enlighten ignor  ance and difficult to check ambition But there is a pru  dence which all ought to learn  a prudence which points  out the proper season for every pursuit It was separate  interest that first kindled the flames of war in Sicily but  separate interests should always be hushed when the ge  neral welfare is at stake The Athenians have been busy  amongst them to inflame their mutual resentments to  note their indiscretions and turn them to their own ad Ixxxviii A Survey of the History  vantage that when the Sicilians have warred one an  other down they may seize the whole island for them  selves The great passion of these Athenians is conquest  they regard no ties of consanguinity  they aim at acquir  ing vassals no matter who He blames them not he  can never blame men who are desirous of command  but  he must blame such as are ready and willing to put on  their chains The Athenians have no strength in Sicily  but in the division of its States Let those States but once  re unite and Athenians must get them gone  and may  depart with a face of success as if they had united  whom they really wanted to disunite and had effectually k4 re settled peace when their latent design was war â He toucheth every topic in a succinct but masterly manner He hath recourse often to figures renders his addresses em phatical by making his own community speak from his mouth He applies the first person and the singular number with great energy and weight He useth those figures in in the same manner as Saint Paul does in the Epistle to the Romans He presseth harmony and cordial re union amongst them in a manner best fitted to persuade The whole speech in a word is a very interesting and persuasive piece of oratory The consequence is a peace is settled in Sicily to general satisfaction  and the Athenian commanders are obliged to return to Athens with their squadron to be punished there for what they could not possibly prevent The war continues hot through the remainder of this book The Athenians take their turn in being checked and vanquished Their attempt on Megara is related at large  and this piece of narration is by far the most intricate of the kind to be met with in Thucydides The matter is quite too much crowded when he endeavours to comprehend in a few terms the various incidents of this struggle for Megara the fluctuation of events the views and motives of the par ties engaged Brasidas at last secures the city and quite DISCOURSE III Ixxxix disconcerts the main project of the Athenians â The latter also had another great scheme in agitation for a total revo lution in Boeotia Arms and intrigues were at once to act both without and within The whole force of Athens takes the field on this occasion under the command of Hippo crates The famous battle of Delium ensues before which the generals harangue their troops Pagondas the Theban is an excellent speaker on this occasion The Boeotians are not represented in this history as that gross and stupid peo ple which was their character from the succeeding wits of Athens The Athenian general begins also to harangue his troops but is cut short by the attack of the enemy The battle is finely described and the dispute afterwards about the dead The Athenians have received a dreadful blow which will soon make them begin to accuse their own judg ments in refusing the accommodation lately offered from Sparta In other quarters also the balance of war begins to in cline in favour of the enemy Brasidas that active and ac complished Spartan had now compleated a march at the head of a small army through Thessaly and Macedonia into Chalcidic Thrace His bravery prevails much but his con duct more He disjoins Perdiccas king of Macedonia from the Athenian league Whenever he fights he conquers and whenever he harangues he effectually persuades His speech to the Acanthians is strong pertinent laconic He says all that can be said in favour of his countrymen in recommendation of the cause of liberty There is that air of sincerity and good faith in it which were constantly ap proved and verified by his personal deportment The towns revolt to him as fast he hath opportunities to address them The reader will follow him with pleasure through his many and great exploits and acknowledge he wears his laurels deservedly and with peculiar grace Book V In Book the Fifth Cleon appears again upon the stage to stop the rapid conquests of Brasidas The for Vol I M xc A Survey of the History mer had been laughed into a general and is now grown so conceited that he wants to enter the lists against that truly heroic Spartan He accordingly arrives in Thrace at the head of a squadron and a fine body of land forces He retakes a town or two is confident he shall soon recover the important city of Amphipolis and though contemned by his own soldiers he endeavours to brave the enemy Brasidas having harangued his men with his usual spirit throws open the gates sallies out of Amphipolis and routs him in an instant Cleon falls a victim to his own cowar dice and Brasidas also drops a victim to his own valour The latter lives long enough to know his own side had con quered and then expires admired by all that knew him and most highly regretted by the allies of his country Their riddance from Cleon diminished the loss of Athens in this defeat and the Lacedaemonians had dearly purchased the victory with the loss of their hero As the principal States were now pretty nearly balanced and sadly tired of the war a truce is concluded for a year and a peace soon after settled by the management chiefly of Nicias Thucy dides hath given us the forms of negotiating and drawing up treaties They are curious morsels of antiquity and the reader will see with admiration how solemn how concise and yet how guarded they are The peace turns out to be merely nominal The Corinthians who cannot relish it at all set their invention to work in order to embroil Greece afresh and to re kindle a general war Several wars break out in which the Athenians and Lacedaemonians are con cerned as auxiliaries And another State in Greece which hitherto had been neutral and saving its strength entire endeavours now to seize the primacy of Greece for itself We shall be made privy to all her negotiations for carrying on the plan and see it all blasted by one battle at Manti nea This State was the republic of Argos in Peloponne sus which had been in long alliance with but in no depend ence at all upon Athens and had been for a long time also DISCOURSE III XCI at peace with Sparta by means of truces for thirty years Young Alcibiades doth all he can to promote the quarrel till at length the troops of Sparta and Argos come to an en gagement near the city of Mantinea Thucydides intro duceth the battle with all the spirit and precision of Homer The auxiliaries are marshalled and animated by such exhor tations as are best suited to the peculiar circumstances of each The Spartans are exhibited at last in all their glorv Trained up for a camp and the day of battle we shall view them in their discipline and actual exertion of their personal bravery They were excellent combatants indeed  and the reader will judge whether Thucydides did not love good soldiers and take a pleasure in doing them justice It was the greatest battle which for many years had been fought in Greece The Spartans on this occasion wiped off all the imputations that had lately been thrown on their bravery because they had not been always successful And the Spiring State of Argos is compelled to acquiesce in her usual rank and still leave the contention for supremacy to the leading States of Athens and Sparta This Book affords but one incident more of consequence enough to be particularly distinguished  and that is the conquest of the isle of Melos by the Athenians which fell out in the sixteenth year of the war When the Athenians were landed and encamped on that island they summon the Melians to a conference of which Thucydides hath drawn out the particulars It is really an uncommon one and had sadly puzzled the critics whether they should praise or con demn it But is there any thing more unnatural in reciting what was said at it than in holding a conference  It is my business only to look at the management of it and not draw a veil over the Athenian politics as they are avowed on this occasion since my author was too impartial to do it No thing could tempt him to make palliating representations or to suppress the truth  The Athenians on this occasion avow without a blush xcii A Survey of the History  that principle on which conquerors and tyrants have al  ways acted and yet have been ashamed to own They are  ever hunting for colourings and pretexts and would fain  give to greedy power a little of the air of equity But here  without the least shame or remorse the Athenians assert  their right to inslave another community because it suits  their own interest and because they have power to do it  This is the principle from which they argue  and how  scandalous soever it be they argue strongly from it They  represent the politics of their own State of the Lacedae  monian State nay of all mankind as incroaching oppres  sive rapacious and totally estranged from humanity good  faith and the least tincture of morality The whole con  ference yields perhaps a just representation of human na  ture in the gross  but then the representation is distaste  ful to a mind that is cool and disengaged Such a mind  must interest itself on the side of the Melians  and be  sorry that the Athenians have not more equity and hon  our to qualify their power  or that the Melians with the  regard they show to honour and justice should not have  had more power or been able to interest at least one ally  in defence of their liberties and rights In short through  the whole course of this History the Athenians never  make so scandalous a figure as on this occasion Book VI In the Sixth Book a spacious theatre is opened for a renewal of the war The scene is going to shift from Greece to Sicily The Athenians who have so bravely resisted all their enemies in Greece are now going to do for those enemies what they could not do themselves No patriot no statesman no orator is able to dissuade them from lavishing their strength on the projects of sanguine am bition and foreign conquests Their enemies in the mean time are at leisure to note their indiscretions and improve them all to their own advantage till the great name of Athens is quite eclipsed and an end is put to that empire of the sea which she had maintained for seventy years with great lustre and reputation discourse in xciii The Sicilian war which some critics are inclined to think hath no connection with the subject of Thucydides and to be mere digression whatever it may appear at first the reader will at length be satisfied was an essential part of the Pelopon nesian war and hastened its decision But supposing it remote from the principal subject it must however be ac knowledged that it is the history of a war nobly related well connected very closely followed and full of incidents to en gage attention to alarm and interest the passions Thucy dides in the course of it which takes up the two following books which display the excellencies of the poet and the painter as well as of the historian Let his merit be regula ted from this portion of his work it is presumed that with out a negative he will be allowed the master of History He begins with describing the theatre on which two mighty States are going to enter the lists â The geography and an tiquities of Sicily could not in their nature be very entertain ing and therefore they are drawn up in the concisest manner â The soaring enterprising genius of Alcibiades hath formed a superb plan for the aggrandizement of himself and his country Alcibiades could plan with all the magnificence and wild ambition of an Alexander  but a citizen of Athens could not have the means of executing in so imperial a man ner as the Monarch of Macedonia and Captain General of Greece He was able soon to convince the younger and more numerous part of the Athenian community that the enter prise was most inviting and carried with it such a probabi lity of success as over balanced all expence and hazard It was long the subject of general conversation it gradually inflamed the public ardour and at length ingrossed all their hopes and wishes In a word the expedition to Sicily is for mally proposed and decreed in the assembly of the people A second assembly is convened on ways and means On this occasion a grand debate ensued the managers of which are Nicias and Alcibiades â See Rapin s comparison of Thucydides and Liry xciv A Survey of the History Nicias declares himself  totally averse to the expedition  but doth it with that diffidence which was a principal foi  ble in his character The honour conferred upon himself 4 in his nomination to the command shall not suppress his  real sentiments He is neither fond nor prodigal of his  life But he loves his country and would advise them to  give up the expedition â He next runs over the political  topics and shews it to be in every light an undesirable and  ill judged project And then without naming him strikes  at Alcibiades  proves him not qualified in any respect for u so important a command  he reflects with some severity on  his life and behaviour and though owning himself afraid  he shall be out voted yet would fain have the question put  again whether the expedition shall proceed   Beside all the natural vivacity and fire of his temper Al cibiades was now provoked by the personalities that Nicias had thrown out against him He had been a constant oppo ser of the latter who was beloved at Athens for his amiable qualities For though Nicias had not spirit enough to lead the people yet he had influence enough oftentimes to check and restrain the aspiring busy Alcibiades The reply he makes on this occasion strongly marks the character and com plexion of Alcibiades  and delivered with that life and grace and pretty lisp for which he was remarkable must have en gaged all the attention of his hearers and drawn their appro bation perhaps in spite of their judgment  Censured and provoked by Nicias he begins with a vin  dication of himself He maintains his right to the com  mand He hints at the splendor of his birth his public  spirit the generosity of his heart He recites with a haughty  and exulting air his victories at the Olympic games his  magnificence at home and his capacity for political intrigue  already and successfully exerted He then justifies the  wisdom of the decree for the Sicilian expedition He shews  all the political topics in a different light from Nicias He  insinuates the advice of the latter to proceed from indo DISCOURSE III XCV  lence and a desire to sow dissentions amongst them He  exhorts to union and to the observation of order So a Athens rose  so Athens may yet be much higher exalted  The fire of youth the temper of the middle aged and  the experience of the old should ever duly accord and act M together Sloth ruins a community practice enables it 44 to go through every conflict and to triumph over all oppo  sition Such an address could not but affect such arguments could not but be persuasive with the people of Athens  The expedition must go forwards But Nicias makes a second effort if possible to divert them from it He begins with  a prayer for its success  and a desire  that the preparations may be adequate to the ends pro 44 posed He states the nature the power and strength of  the people they are going to invade He then in gene  ral terms gives in a bulky roll of necessary articles for  those who invade them He hopes to frighten and deter 44 his audience by the vast expence which he shews must  necessarily be incurred on this occasion The Athenians 44 must provide every thing themselves and trust for nothing  to the care and fidelity of Sicilian allies The public wel 44 fare and the safety of all who are to be employed in this 44 expedition demand all manner of previous foresight and  care This speech had a different effect to what Nicias designed Instead of discouraging it animated his countrymen more than ever for execution Accordingly a decree was soon passed investing himself and his colleagues who were Alci biades and Lamachus with full power to provide every thing needful for the service All hands now were soon at work The quotas from the dependents were demanded the fleet was equipped and manned  the levies went on briskly since all men came into the service with alacrity  and every thing was soon ready for the expedition xcvi A Survey of the History At this juncture some drunken frolics in which Alcibi ades was engaged threw Athens into consternation They were soon construed by his enemies into a plot to bring about a revolution in the government Informers came in and he was directly accused of being a party He avowed his inno cence insisted on an immediate trial which he was sure would end in his justification The plot which in fact was a plot against Alcibiades was not yet ripe enough to ruin him  and therefore by a strange preposterous stroke of cunning he is ordered to proceed in the expedition and take his trial at his return Our author next describes the departure of the grand ar mament in all its solemnity and with all the medley of hopes and fears shewn by the whole people of Athens on this occa sion He lays open to our view the very hearts of the spec tators The prime flower of their strength nay Athens itself is now sailing out of the Pineus never again to return They make the best of their way to Corcyra where they are left for a time that we may be made privy to the consulta tions and defensive measures of Sicily The scene is now removed to Syracuse the most powerful state in that island inhabited by Grecians and if indeed inferior yet second at this time to no other State in Greece but Athens alone It had frequently been harassed by seditions had often been plagued with tyrants but was at present under a democratic constitution Advice had been received there of the intended invasion The people are convened about it Harangues are made  and the temper of mankind when party is fermenting justly exemplified Some are incredulous others magisterially pronounce it all a falsehood At length Hermocrates riseth up and gives them his own sense of the affair He assures them  his country is eminently indangered  and neither incredulity nor ridicule shall awe him into si  lence To his certain knowledge the Athenians are already  at sea fully bent on the conquest of Sicily The Syracusan Discourse hi xcvii  ought to believe it and to prepare for their defence Fear  will unite all Sicily against the invaders Athens will only u reap disgrace but Syracuse abundant glory on this occasion  Large armaments are seldom successful they moulder  away for want of supplies or are ruined for want of con  duct They should therefore prepare for gallant resistance  by getting every thing in readiness at home and strength  ening themselves by foreign alliances They should do  more  they should at once put out to sea and dispute their  very passage with the enemy A defeat or even delay  thus given them might oblige them to give up the pro ject He supports his advice by many strong and judici  ous arguments  and ends with warm exhortations to his  countrymen to be lively and active by no means to de  spise the enemy except in action but vigorously and with  all their foresight to prepare for resistance since their ene  mies are undoubtedly at sea and only not arrrived on their  coasts Such advice was now given to the people of Syracuse by Hermocrates  That community it is evident was full of cabal and faction since this worthy patriot was regarded as a party tool and a public incendiary Athenagoras the blus tering demagogue who replies treats him in this light His virulence shews that he regarded Hermocrates as one who wanted by any means whatever to force himself into employ ment He seems more alarmed for the lucrative posts of the State than for the welfare of his country He throws out a deal of good sense but in a very impertinent and scurrilous manner Such are the persons who study popularity more than duty and sacrifice all their talents to ambition or private lucre He affirms that  none but cowards and traitors wish  the Athenians might not invade them and so infallibly  meet their destruction  But the whole account is a glaring  falsehood the forgery of a factious cabal He appeals to  his audience whether it carries the least probability with Vol I N xcviii A Survey of the History  it Athenians invade them  The Athenians esteem them  selves happy they are not invaded by the Syracusans Yet  supposing them so mad nothing but their own disgrace  and ruin can be the consequence But it is all a fiction  a  scheme to dishearten the friends of the people and seize the  government of the State Some men have ever been and  ever will be dabbling in such vile machinations But let  them not hope to escape detection The intention is plain  already and ought to be punished like open treason He  then exhorts the people or the many to support their friends  and intirely to disarm the malice of their domestic foes   and inveighs severely against the few or the party  whom he supposeth to be bent on the overthrow of the de  mocracy at Syracuse The speech of Athenagoras was so full of ill timed choler and party animosity that had the debate proceeded dissensions might have run very high at a season when un animity was so needful in all the members of that commu nity A General of great eminence and weight thinks it high time to interpose  who in a short speech reprimands Athenagoras recals the general attention to their own pre servation from the imminent danger and adjourns the as sembly The grand fleet of Athens is now putting to sea from Corcyra The Historian takes a review of the whole and gives a short account of its numbers and strength They arrive on the coast of Italy where they are refused a recep tion Every thing yields them a discouraging and gloomy aspect They soon find they had been grossly deluded by their Sicilian friends who instigated them chiefly to the ex pedition The trick which the Egesteans had put on their embassadors is particularly recited The commanders at a council of war differ highly in opinion and at last come to no sound resolution They hover about the coast of Sicily and parade in sight of Syracuse Alcibiades endeavours to persuade the Catanians to join with and receive them but a DISCOURSE III xcix mere accident accomplishes what his eloquence could not The command of Alcibiades came here to an end One of the State vessels arrives and summons him to Athens to take his trial for the late frolics and irregularities committed there That city ever since the departure of the fleet had been filled with confusion and horror A plot there was or rather a plot it was determined there must be to set up a tyrant that most odious sound to Attic ears Recollection of the dismal things they had heard about the tyranny of the Pisistratidae increased their fears and drove them into furious and desperate proceedings Thucydides here digres seth to settle some facts relating to that set of tyrants and their demolition particularly the affair of Harmodius and Aristogiton one of the most famous incidents in the annals of Athens He differs indeed from most other writers and the moderns have not thought proper to rest the point upon his authority great as it is  or though no man ever traced out facts or made his enquiries with more sedateness and impartiality But to return to Alcibiades  He was obliged to quit the command and he seemed quietly to submit to the orders of the State But determined not to face his countrymen in their present mood nor to hazard a trial he gave them who were sent for him the slip and sheltered himself in Pelopon nesus He became instantly a most violent and dangerous enemy to his country He is gone to pave the way for the ruin of Athens  of Athens which he loved better than any thing except the parade of his own personal importance and the gratification of his private caprice Nicias and Lamachus who now remained in the com mand of the fleet by help of a stratagem land at Syracuse without opposition and seize a strong post for their encamp ment The Syracusans determine on a battle to dislodge them Both sides form in order Nicias encourages his men by a short but spirited and forcible harangue Thu cydides paints the battle with the exactness perspicuity t A survey of the History and ardor of Homer The Athenians had the better  yet not so decisively as to think proper to continue in their post since they re embark and sail back to Catana The winter it is true was approaching which both sides spend in negociations for the acquisition of allies That at Camarina where ambassadors from both the warring parties are at the same time admitted to an audience is particularly recited Hermocrates in behalf of Syracuse makes the first address  It is masterly like all that Hermocrates per  forms It is designed to convince the Camarineans how  insidious and how vile the schemes of the Athenians had  ever been and still continue to be He arraigns all their  politics and all their conduct since the Persian invasion   and gives that artful turn to his remarks which might  well deter others from entering into any connexion or alli  ance with them His strokes are severe and cutting He  makes use of the figures which give force and energy to  discourse No person better understood the common wel  fare of Sicily  and no person could better explain it He  unfolds the political scheme at present in agitation  de  clares the consequence in case the Athenians prevail to  alarm the concern of the Camarineans for their country  and further to alarm their fears for themselves He even  threatens them with a severe revenge in case the Syracu  sans without their aid get the better of the invaders In short if the Camarineans had been good Sicilians his argu ments must have prevailed Euphemes who is the mouth of the Athenian embassy Â n this occasion makes a bold and spirited defence for his country  He at once briskly attacks Hermocrates for the  bitter imputations he had cast upon Athens He asserts her fair reputation and justifies her series of politics ever  since the invasion of Xerxes Liberty had been the ob ject of all her care and all her conduct The Athenians  had guarded had established it in Greece  and were  come to support and secure it in Sicily He throws back DISCOURSE III Cl   the charge of inslaving projects on the Syracusans who  now are eager to deprive the rest of Sicily of their best  defence by raising distaste towards the Athenians He  spares no artifice omits no topic that is likely to affect  He proves a notable advocate for his Athens pompously  celebrates her passion and her care for liberty and most  ingeniously strives to conceal her present ambition under a  veil of most generous and disinterested principles The issue is that the orators have just counterpoised one another s arguments and the Camarineans declare a neutrality The embassies from Syracuse succeed much better in Pe loponnesus The Corinthians are zealous and active in their behalf and they have now got an advocate to rouse up and inflame the phlegmatic Spartans who was born to be of every party and to be the best support of whatever party he by times espoused It is the exiled Alcibiades who pleads most effectually in their behalf at a grand con sultation at Sparta His speech on this occasion is a mas terpiece  He insinuates himself into the favour and con  fidence of men who had feared and hated him Whilst  he is making his own personal justification he praiseth  and magnifieth himself He betrays all the schemes of  Athens discloseth all her plan points out her weak and  unguarded parts directs towards them the attack of her  foes  and full as he is of resentment against and skilful  to annoy her she totters whilst he speaks Syracuse and Sparta are now to grow famous by the debasement of this mighty and imperial Republic Her glory hath reached its summit It immediately will begin to sink and her laurels will fade away apace In the summer of the eighteenth year of this war the Athenians stand away from Catana and land by night at Syracuse They instantly march and seize Epipolae a strong post that commanded the city The Syracusans fight but without success to beat them from it The siege now com A Survey of the History menceth in form It is clearly represented in the whole of its progress in all its forms Every skirmish is a distinct and lively picture In one of them old Lamachus is killed and Nicias of course left singly in the whole command He carries on the siege with vigor and success for a short space of time  but Gylippus from Sparta and the Pelopon nesian aids are now only not arrived Book VII  If you would read truly great things said a Spartan to Augustus Caesar  read the Seventh Book  of Thucydides Thither we have now brought this cur sory survey The reader of it will undoubtedly own that no Historian ever executed so closely so strongly so clearly and so pathetically as Thucydides No fleet but that of  the Athenians it is the observation of Cicero  was  ever able to enter the harbour of Syracuse The fleet  was only able to atchieve it by the mighty force and  number of three hundred ships But here first was the  power of Athens defeated lessened depressed In this  harbour the fame the empire the glory of Athens are  judged to have suffered a total wreck Schemes projected and actions conducted by Hermocrates and Gylippus the Spartan prove too hard for Nicias whose phlegm and natural diffidence are no match against such vigilance and activity The besieging party soon becomes as it were the besieged The Letter of Nicias to the people of Athens represents all the difficulties to which he finds himself reduced No man ever wrote so precisely and perspicuously about military af fairs The reader of it wants no light no dictionary of arts or an adept in war to explain the terms  and can judge as could the meanest citizen of Athens to whom it was read what was proper to be done Secure in the consciousness of his own integrity he neatly reprimands his countrymen for the great foible in their behaviour justifies his own con duct and begs to be recalled In short Nicias is finely jcharacterized bv his own pen in this epistle â Orat quinla in Vcrrcm DISCOURSE III The Athenians are too high spirited to recal their troops and have too good an opinion of Nicias to dismiss him from the command Though Attica was now invaded by the Pe loponnesians and a fortress raised by them within sight of Athens itself for their lasting annoyance they send a power ful reinforcement to Nicias under the command of Demos thenes They empty Athens of the residue of her strength so highly wanted for domestic support The Syracusans when advised of this reinforcement redouble their alacrity and hope to finish the war before it could arrive They had had a career of success against Nicias had just beat him both by land and sea when Demosthenes steered into the harbour of Syracuse The sight caused a strange alter native of elevating hope and dreadful apprehensions in the contending parties The Syracusans again become the be sieged  and Demosthenes is intent to put an end to the siege if possible by vigorous and daring measures His attempt to re take Epipohe is in our author s de scription of it as fine a night piece as can possibly be drawn and no pencil could express it stronger The moon shines just bright enough to shew us the Athenians gaining the ascent and to give a glimpse of the approaches of the armies and their first struggles with one another The whole soon becomes gloomy confusion and horrid tumult What a medley of singing their paeans of conflict of flight of pursuit friends and countrymen routing one another till numbers come tumbling down the precipices and perish in the fall The hope of the Athenians is blasted Syracuse erects her trophies fast Demosthenes is now convinced the most prudent step they could take is to raise the siege and Nicias at last com plies The very moment they are going to embark their troops the moon is eclipsed Who but must pity the weak ness of Nicias at so dangerous a crisis  who but be sorry in deed that so good and amiable a man should stop an army from a principle of superstition and detain them for so long civ A Survey of the History a time on a spot of ground where nothing but ruin and de struction could befal them  Men so dispirited can make but faint opposition against an always high spirited and now successful enemy They soon lose another battle and the decisive engagement is fast approaching But before it is fought Thucydides animated with more than historic spirit emulates his admired Homer reviews the parties concerned and catalogues the troops now warring against and in defence of Syracuse This catalogue is far from being a mere muster roll of names It is full of such strokes as must imprint many useful and moral reflections in the mind His little incidental sketches represent mankind in a true light as Homer s do the world of nature Homer paints the soil and Thucydides the people The mouth of the harbour is now barred up by the enemy The Athenians must fight their way out or burn all their ships and march off by land It is determined to attempt the former and the consequence is the battle with in the harbour of Syracuse A more striking more astonish ing battle piece was never exhibited  and a masterly pencil though none but a masterly one might exactly delineate it from this description The present temper of the comba tants on both sides is strongly marked in the harangues be fore the engagement Nicias then said all and the Athe nians in action did their best but all was unavailing I shall say no more about it since the reader hath nothing to do but to turn his eye towards it and distinctly view it through the whole of its process till the Syracusans sail in triumph to their city and raise the most glorious of all their trophies The wretched perplexities of the Athenians the raising of the siege the mournful decampment the good heart of Nicias sympathising in all their distress and endeavouring to chear a little their desponding minds their laborious marches whilst the enemy is harassing them both in front and in rear and on all sides the surrender of the column DISCOURSE III CV under Demosthenes the carnage in the river Asinarus of the troops under Nicias his surrender too the butchery of the generals and the miseries of the captivated residue of once so flourishing and gallant an army â These are the several incidents of this book for which an attentive reader will give the highest commendation to the Historian when he hath read them through He will have no leisure until then to think of Thucydides Book VIII The catastrophe hath now taken place in this history and the reader is assured how all will end The wings of this soaring republic of Athens are clipped never to reach their full growth again Yet like an eagle in the same situation she will struggle hard a long time as it were with beak and talons and would yet repulse her assailants did she not grow sick at heart Intestine faction will assist her enemies to finish her ruin as a State imperial and com mercial A regular deduction of such incidents as these is the subject of the Eighth and last book of Thucydides As a writer he now performs in a more faint and less engaging manner compared with what hath gone before He hath but drawn his lines but just sketched his pieces  But the draw ings and sketches will still manifest the master s hand We will give them a cursory view The reader will give them a more exact and deliberate perusal He sets out in his usual grave and solemn manner to de scribe the people of Athens dispirited and distressed as they are bv the overthrow in Sicily All the passions and emo tions of the human nature take their turn They are incre dulous  they are angry they are convinced  and then they despond  they pluck up their spirits again and are resolved to stand it out nor abandon their own preservation They now cast their thoughts towards every resource and prepare again for war with spirit and resolution All the rest of Greece is ready to concur with the victorious party  all are eagerly running in to share the glory and the spoil Their own dependents are meditating revolts and some make them Voi I O cvi A Survey of the History at once without premeditation The Lacedaemonians amidst the many applications made to them are puzzled which of the revolving States they shall first countenance and assist Alcibiades is busy at Sparta advising proper measures and guiding their counsels Even the Persian monarch by his lieutenants enters into league against them and some of their finest islands are immediately rent asunder from sub jection to the Athenians The various turns of war at Chios and on the coast of Ionia are distinctly but concisely related until Alcibiades appears in action and exerts his busy and intriguing genius Suspected at length and hated by the Lacedaemonians he became again their enemy and turned all his projects on ac complishing his return to Athens and saving his country from impending ruin His partizans in the fleet and troops of Athens now lying at Samos cabal in his favour A change of government is judged a necessary measure to bring about his recalment It is the scheme of Alcibiades himself but it is opposed and disconcerted by Phrynichus by Phrynichus who soon after turns out a violent enemy to the democracy whilst Alcibiades is active and zealous in its support None but our author s pen could have so clearly unfolded that series of caballings that fluctuation both in principle and conduct and that horrid embroilment of the leading mem t bers of the Athenian State amongst themselves which brought on seditions amongst the troops abroad and a revolution of government in the city of Athens The democracy is at length overturned  and an oligarchy consisting of four hun dred persons erected in its stead The Athenians atSamos where the project was first laid declare against the Atheni ans at Athens Alcibiades is grown again a hearty republi can  and Thrasybulus alone manifests throughout a sincere love and regard for his country Parties newly formed are broke again into divisions  and Athens was indebted to no thing but the indolence of the Lacedaemonians that she did  DISCOURSE in cvii not fall immediately into their hands through the violence of her own intestine seditions But the new administration proved of short continuance  the democracy though on a model somewhat varied is again established  and Athens thus obtains a respite Full of matter as this part of the history is Thucydides hath kept his narration clear and unembarrassed But then it is a simple unadorned narration and never received the finishing hand There are scattered occasionally through out it some short accounts in what manner the principal agents delivered their sentiments at important junctures They seem to have been memorials laid down as the ground work for regular and full orations The reader will be sorry the author was hindered by what accidents can only be guessed from drawing out some of them at least into full proportion particularly that of the deputation from the army at Samos to Athens in which  the people are per  suaded to part with their darling democracy â â of Thrasy bulus to the troops at Samos when they mutiny in favour of the democracy in which  he must pathetically have  expatiated on the revolt of Athens from liberty and her  choicest patriots who might now form another Athens at  Samos and preserve her empire though they had lost  the city that of Alcibiades further when on his recal ment he harangues the army at Samos which recalled him where  he deplores the malignity of his fate magnifies his  ability yet to serve his country and again shines in the  character of an able statesman a subtle politician and a  zealous patriot Upon the whole One point more must be particularly distinguished in honour of the Athenians The characters of them and of the Lacedaemonians are strongly contrasted through the whole course of this History and highly to the credit of the former Their spirits rise with difficulties and patriotism starts out of mutiny and faction The Lacedae monians are indolent in success and shew neither alacrity A Survey of the History nor address in promoting that cause of liberty which was the grand pretext for engaging in this destructive war They seem at last more intent on pocketing the royal subsidies than doing their duty as leaders and champions of Greece They have not yet learned to make a figure at sea The last view we have of them is at the battle of Cynos sema where they receive a signal defeat from those very men whose ruin they judged was well nigh compleated When Athens is totally to be vanquished as her doom is fast approaching she must aid her own conquerors and tyrants in demolishing her own trophies and trampling under foot her liberties and rights Her own factions will help to accomplish what with out them no foreign enemy could have done Whatever is human must decay The best constituted State in the world may be undermined by its own members when they could not be conquered and at length be rendered an easy prey to foreign powers May GREAT BRITAIN prove an exception to this affecting but just observation  THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR BOOK I INTRODUCTION THUCYDIDES an Athenian hath compiled the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians as managed by each of the contending parties He began to write upon its first breaking out from an expectation that it would prove important and the most deserving regard of any that had ever happened He grounded his conjecture on the earnestness of both the flourishing parties to make all necessary preparations for it and he saw that all the rest of Greece was engaged on one side or the other some joining immediately and others intending soon to do it for this was the greatest commotion that ever happened amongst the Gre cians since in it some Barbarians and it may be said the greatest part of mankind were concerned The actions of an earlier date and those still more ancient cannot possibly through length of time be adequately known yet from all the lights which a search into the remotest times hath afford ed me I cannot think they were of any great importance either in regard to the wars themselves or any other consider ations It is certain that the region now known by the name of Greece was not formerly possessed by any fixed inhabitants but was subject to frequent transmigrations as constantly every distinct people easily yielded up their seats to the vio lence of a larger supervening number For as to commerce there was none and mutual fear prevented intercourse both 2 THE PELOPONKESIAN WAR by sea and land as then the only view of culture was to earn a penurious subsistence and superfluous wealth was a thing unknown as planting was not their employment it being uncertain how soon an invader might come and dis lodge them from their unfortified habitations and as they thought they might every where find their daily necessary support they hesitated but little about shifting their seats And for this reason they never flourished in the greatness of their cities or any other circumstance of power But the richest tracts of country ever were more particularly liable to this frequent change of inhabitants such as that which is now called Thessaly and Boeotia and Peloponnesus most ly except Arcadia and in general every the most fertile part of Greece For the natural wealth of their soil increas ing the power of some amongst them that power raised civil dissentions which ended in their ruin and at the same time exposed them more to foreign attacks It was only the barrenness of the soil that preserved Attica through the longest space of time quiet and undisturbed in one unin terrupted series of possessors One and not the least con vincing proof of this is that other parts of Greece because of the fluctuating condition of the inhabitants could by no means in their growth keep pace with Attica The most powerful of those who were driven from the other parts of Greece by war or sedition betook themselves to the Athe nians for secure refuge and as they obtained the privileges of citizens have constantly from remotest time continued to enlarge that city with fresh accessions of inhabitants in â They were admitted to the same privileges with free born Athenians But this was practised only in the infancy and early growth of that state It was afterwards an honour veiy seldom and with difficulty granted Those who came from other places to settle at Athens are distinguished from mAitmi citizens by the name of fi iroiKti sojourners who had taken up their residence and cohabited with them They performed several duties as subjects to the state which gave them protection but never became Athenians or citizens of Athens in the emphatical sense of those terms The English reader will please to remember this as the distinction often uccurs in the sequel of our history B I INTRODUCTION 3 somuch that at last Attica being insufficient to support the number they sent over colonies into Ionia There is another and to me a most convincing proof of the weakness of the ancients Before the affairs of Troy it doth not appear that Greece or Hellas was ever united in one common undertaking  nor had the whole country that one general appellation nor indeed did the same subsist at all before the time of Hellen the son of Deucalion  the se veral nations taking their distinguishing names from their own selves and Pelasgicum being that of the greatest tract But when Hellen and his sons had acquired power in Pthiotis and led out their dependants by way of aid to other cities conversation made the use of this name become much more frequent among the several people though it was long be fore it so prevailed as to become the general appellation of them all For this Homer is my principal authority who though born a long time after the Trojan war hath no where mentioned them all in this general stile but hath appro priated it to those who came with Achilles from Pthiotis and were the first that bore this name of Grecians or Hel lenes In his poems Danaans and Argives and Achaeans are their distinguishing titles Nor hath he farther once mentioned the Barbarians for this plain reason in my opin ion because Grecians were not yet distinguished by this one comprehensive name in contra distinction to that other These Grecians therefore whatever whether so apart in their different cities or united by mutual converse or at length comprehended in one general name for want of strength and correspondence never acted together in joint confederacy before the war of Troy nor was it till the use of the sea had opened free communication amongst them that they en gaged together in that expedition For jMinosjis the earliest person whom we know from tradition to have been master of a navy and to have been chiefly lord of the sea which is called the Grecian To him were the isles of the Cyclades subject nay most of them he 4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR planted himself with colonies having expelled the Carians and substituted his own sons in their different commands And then of course he exerted his utmost power to clear that sea of pirates for the more secure conveyance of his own tributes The GrecjaÂ s_ formerly as well as those Barbarians who though seated on the continent lived upon the coast and all the islanders when once they had learned the method of passing to and fro in their vessels soon took up the business of j iracy under the command of persons of the greatest ability amongst them for the sake of enriching such adven turers and subsisting their poor They landed and plun dered by surprise unfortified places and scattered villages and from hence they principally gained a subsistence This was by no means at that time an employment of reproach but rather an instrument of glory Some people of the con tinent are even to this day a proof of this who still attri bute honour to such exploits if genteelly performed so also are the ancient poets in whom those that sail along the coasts are every where equally accosted with this question Whether they are pirates  as if neither they to whom the question was put would disown their employment nor they who are desirous to be informed would reproach them with it The people of the continent also exercised robberies upon one another and to this very day many people of Greece are supported by the same practices  for instance the Ozolian Locrians and Etolians and Acarnanians and their neighbours on the continent and the custom of wearing their weapons introduced by this old life of rapine is still re tained amongst them The custom of wearing weapons once prevailed all over Greece as their houses had no manner of defence as tra velling was full of hazard and their whole lives were passed â  With due respect with humanity as the scholiast explains it For then they never made booty of or carried away by stealth the labouring cattle They never made their attacks by night nor committed any mur der Si I INTRODUCTION 5 in armour like Barbarians A proof of this is the continu ance still in some parts of Greece of those manners which were once with uniformity general to all The Athenians were the first who discontinued the custom of wearing their swords and who passed from the dissolute life into more po lite and elegant manners And it is not a long time since those amongst the rich who were advanced in years and studied their ease left off wearing their linen garments and fastening the hair of their head behind with grasshoppers of gold though the aged amongst the Ionians have con stantly persevered in the use of these ornaments as marks of their affinity That modest uniformity of dress which is still in vogue was first introduced by the Lacedaemonians  amongst whom in other points also there was the greatest equality of dress and diet observed both in the highest and the meanest ranks They also were the first who performed their exercises naked stripping themselves in public and anointing with oil before they entered the lists  though be fore the custom had prevailed at the Olympic games for the champions to wear scarfs about their loins  and it is only a few years since these were quite disused But even yet amongst some Barbarians more especially those of Asia where the matches of boxing and wrestling are in repute the combatants engage with scarfs round their loins Many other arguments might with ease be alleged to prove that ancient Greece had forms and modes of living quite similar to those of the present Barbarian world As for cities so many as are of a later foundation and better placed for The increase of wealth since the improve ment of naval skill all these have been built on the sea shore and walled about and are situated upon necks of land jutting out into the sea for the sake of traffic and greater â To intimate their being the original possessors and pure natives of the soil as much as the very grasshoppers which they supposed to be a natural and spontaneous production of the earth They regarded themselves as coteinporary with the insects t See Mr West s Dissertation on the Olympic Games p 50 Vol I P 6 THE PELOPONNE5IAN WAR security from the insults of neighbouring people But those of an earlier date having been more subject to piratical de predations are situated at a great distance from the sea not only on islands but also upon the main For even those who lived upon the coast though inexpert at sea were used to make excursions up into the country for the sake of plunder And such inland settlements are discernible to this very day But the people of the islands that is the Carians and the Phoenicians were by much the most expert at these piratical adventures For by them the greatest part of the isles was inhabited This is proved from the expiation solemnized at Delos in the course of this war  on which occasion all the sepulchres of the dead in that island being broke open more than half of the number appeared to be Carians known to be such from the weapons found in their graves and a particu larity of interment still used amongst them It was not till after the equipment of fleets by Minos that a communication was opened at sea For by him the mischievous banditti was ejected from the islands and many colonies of his own planted there in their stead And from this period it was that the maritime people grown more intent on the acquisi tion of wealth became also more fond of settled habitations  And such of them as then surpassed in wealth strengthened their settlements by walling them about And this their pas sion for gain continuing to increase the poorer hired out their services to those who had affluence  and the great who had all needful supplies at hand reduced less powerful cities into their own subjection And their power by these methods gradually advancing they were enabled in process of time to undertake the Trojan expedition â The Carians first invented the boss of shields and the crest of helmets In remembrance of this a small shield and a crest were always buried with them By this means were the Carians known The Ph4enicians were distinguished by the manner of their interment For whereas Uier nations laid the faces of their dead towards the east the Phrenicians vf CersMl theposture and laid thrm to the west Scholiast B I INTRODUCTION 7 It is farther my opinion that the assemblage of that ar mament by Agamemnon was not owing so much to the at tendance of the suitors of Helen in pursuance of the oaths they had sworn to Tyndarus as to his own superior power 4t is related by those who received from their ancestors the most certain memorials of the Peloponnesian affairs that Pelops arriving there from Asia with abundance of wealth soon gained so great an influence over those needy people that though a foreigner he had the honour to have the Country called after his own name  and that the power thus gained by him was successively enlarged by his posterity Eurystheus indeed whose mother was the sister of Atreus perished in Attica by means of the Heraclida e  and Euryst heus when he departed on that expedition left the govern ment of Mycenae and his kingdom because of his affinity in the care of Atreus who then resided with him having fled from his father upon the murder of Chrysippus When therefore the return of Eurystheus was prevented by death and the Myceneans from a dread of the Heraclida e were well inclined to Atreus as a person of great abilities and deep in the affections of the people he easily obtained the kingdom of Mycenae and all the territories which had belonged to Eurystheus  and from hence the family of Pelops quite overpowered the family of Perseus To these enlargements of power Agamemnon succeeding and being also superior to the rest of his countrymen in naval strength he was enabled in my opinion to form that expedition more from awe than favour It is plain that he equipped out the largest number of ships himself besides those he lent to the Arca dians Homer is my witness here if his testimony have any force  who hath farther at the delivery of the sceptre styled him  Or many isles and sf all Argos king And a king who lived upon the continent could not possibly be lord of islands except such as were adjacent the number of which must needs be small unless he had a competent 8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR strength at sea But from this armament we have good light afforded to guess at the preceding  What though Mycenavwas a small city or though any place at that time remarkable appear at present inconsidera ble to us  yet no one ought on these motives prematurely to imagine that armament to have been less considerable than it is described by the poets and reported by tradition Supposing the city of Lacedaemon to be now in a ruinated condition nothing left but the temples and the pavements of the mass I fancy in process of time posterity could not easily be induced to believe that their power had ever been proportioned to their glory Of the five divisions of Pelo ponnesus they are actually possessed of two have the com mand of the whole and of many confederate states without  yet as the city is neither closely built as the temples and public edifices are by no means sumptuous and the houses detached from one another after the old mode of Greece it would suffer disparagement from such a view If we far ther suppose the Athenians in the same reverse of fortune from the view the city then would afford it might be guess ed that once it had double the strength which it really hath We ought not therefore to be incredulous nor so much to regard the appearance of cities as their power and of course to conclude the armament against Troy to have been greater than ever was known before but inferior to those of our age And whatever credit be given to the po etry of Homer in this respect who no doubt as a poet hath set it off with all possible enlargement yet even according to his account it appeareth inferior For he hath made it to consist of twelve hundred ships those of the Boeotians carrying each one hundred and twenty men those of Phi loctetes fifty pointing out as I imagine the largest and the smallest rates  for of the rate of other ships he hath not made the least mention in his catalogue though he hath â These were Laconia Arcadia Argolica Messenia and Elis The Lacedemonians were possessed of I aconia and Messenia Scholiast B I  INTRODUCTION 9 expressly informed us that every person of the crews be longing to the ships of Philoctetes were both mariners and soldiers since he hath made all who plied at the oar to be expert at the bow It is not probable that any ships carried supernumeraries excepting kings or persons in command especially as their point was a mere transportation with all the necessary habiliments of war and as their ships were not decked but built entirely in the fashion of the old piratical cruizers If therefore a mean be taken between the largest and smallest rates the number of the whole will turn out of small account for quotas sent in general from the whole of Greece The reason of this was not so much a scarcity of men as want of money They adjusted the number of men to the slender store of provisions they already had and the probability of procuring a competent subsistence in the course of the war On their first landing they got the bet ter in fight the proof is that they could not otherwise have fortified their camp with a wall Neither doth it appear that they exerted all their strength at once numbers being de tached for supplies of provisions to till the Chersonesus and to forage at large Thus divided as they were the Tro jans were better able to make a ten years resistance being equal in force to those who were at any time left to carry on the siege For had the stores of provision at the first land ing been ample enough for the whole number of men they brought and had they been able to prosecute the war free from the avocations of foraging and tillage their superiority in the field must have given them an easy and expeditious conquest Cut in fact they did not ply the work with all their number but only with a part constantly reserved for the purpose  Had they formed the siege with their whole force in less time and with less difficulty they must have taken Troy Through want of money tt was that expedi â Thucydides makes it of small account in repardtotliewar which is his subject But the number of men employed in the expedition against Troy was 102000 For the mean between 120 and 50 is 85 and 85 x by 1200  102000 10 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR tions prior to this and even this the most celebrated of all that ever happened are plainly found to have been less in re ality than they are in fame or current estimation at present through poetical assistance  Nor did the prosperous event of the Trojan expedition put  an end to the unsettled and fluctuating state of Greece or secure that tranquillity so necessary to advancement The return of the Grecians from Ilium after so long an absence gave rise to many innovations Seditions were excited in almost every city and those who were forced to withdraw built cities for themselves in other places The present Boeo tians for instance being driven out of Arne by the Thessa lians sixty years after the taking of Troy planted them selves in the country now called Boeotia though before that time Cadmeis But a body of them had already seated them selves there of whom were those who went in the expedition against Troy And eighty years after it the Dorians with the Heraclidae took possession of Peloponnesus It was not without much ado and length of time that Greece quiet and settled at home had opportunity to send colonies abroad Then the Athenians planted Ionia and most of the islands the Peloponnesians the greatest part of Italy and Sicily and even some colonies in the different tracts of Greece But all these transactions are of a later date than the Trojan war But when once the state of Greece was grown more ro bust and increase of wealth became their study more than ever before as the public revenues grew apace in many places tyrannies started up For before this kingdoms were hereditary and with limited authority Now Greece through out was employed in building navies and became addicted to naval affairs with unusual application The Corinthians are said to have been the first who by varying the make of their ships brought them to that model which is now in use and Corinth to be the first place of Greece where triremes  The triremes were the ships of war of the galley kind and take their name from the three banks of oars with which they were furnished They B I INTRODUCTION 11 were built It is a known fact that Aminocles a s hip car penter from Corinth built four ships for the Samians Now from the arrival of Aminocles at Samos to the conclusion of the war which is now my subject there passed at most but three hundred years The oldest sea fight we know any thing of was that of the Corinthians against the Corcyreans But the distance between that and the same period is not more than two hundred and sixty For the city of the Co rinthians being seated on the Isthmus hath ever been a place of trade as formerly the Grecians both within and without Peloponnesus more accustomed to land than sea could have no traffic with one another without passing through their territory They were also remarkable for wealth as clearly appeareth from the ancient poets who have given that city the epithet of rich And when once navigation was prac tised in Greece they lost no time in their own equipments  they cleared the sea of pirates  and opening their town as a public mart both by land and sea made Corinth powerful by the increase of its revenue The Ionians had no naval force till a long time after this in the reign of Cyrus first king of the Persians and his son Cambyses And waging war with Cyrus they were for a time masters of the sea which lieth upon their own coasts Polycrates also who was tyrant of Samos in the reign of Cambyses having a powerful navy subdued many of the islands and among the rest Rhenea which as soon as conquered he consecrated to Delian Apollo The Phoceans also when planting their colony at Marseilles had a successful engagement at sea against the Carthaginians These were the most remarkable equipments of a naval force and these though beyond contest many generations later than the war of Troy had a very small number of tri were also masted and carried sails  but they generally lowered the sails when they came to action and relied chiefly on their oars that they might be more able to tack about or to run down upon the enemy with more force aijd steadiness See Potter s rtfi w logia voL ii c 14  THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR remes but consisted chiefly of vessels of fifty oars and barges of the more ancient model And it was but a little while be fore the Median war and the death of Darius who succeeded Cambyses in the kingdom of Persia that the tyrants of Sicily and the Corcyreans became masters of any considerable num ber of triremes For these last were the only instances of a naval strength in Greece before the invasion of it by Xerxes that deserve particular mention The vessels of the iEgine tae of the Athenians and some others were few in number and most of them but of fifty oars It was not till later times when the Athenians had war with the iEginetae and also ex pected the approach of Xerxes that at the persuasion of The mistocles they built those ships with which they fought suc cessfully against the Barbarians and even these were not yet compleatly decked over Such therefore were the navies of Greece both of an earlier and later date And the states to which they belonged gain ed by them considerable strength through an increase of their revenue and the enlargement of their dominions Em barkations grown more frequent especially to those who were pent up in a narrow soil occasioned the reduction of the isles but for a land war and in consequence of that an accession of power none such was at that time known All conflicts of that sort which ever happened were disputes of boundaries between contiguous states The Grecians had not yet launch ed forth into distant expeditions nor aimed ambitiously at foreign conquests There were no dependent cities which furnished quotas at the will of others who gave them law nor did those who were upon equality concur in any joint under taking  each petty state took up arms occasionally in its own defence against the incroachments of its neighbours At most the greatest division of Greece that ever happened was in the old rupture between the Clulcideans and Erctrians when leagues were formed in favour of both By these means was the growth of many states prevented and that of the Ionians by a different causeâ the great and INTRODUCTION 13 surprising growth of the Persian power For Cyrus after he had compleated the conquest of Croesus and all the country which lieth between the fiver Halys and the sea invaded them and inslaved their towns upon the continent And Da rius afterwards victorious by the strength of a Phoenician fleet did the same by the islands As for those tyrants who had any where usurped the go vernment of Grecian cities â their whole application being confined to their own private concerns to the guard of their persons or aggrandizement of their familiesâ they resided in their own cities so far as was consistent with their own secu rity Nothing worthy of remembrance was atchieved by them unless we take into account the frequent broils be tween them and their neighbours  Not but that the tyrants of Sicily had advanced their power to a great height But Greece in general was thus withheld for a long course of time from performing any remarkable exploit by the strength of her united or the adventurous efforts of her sepa rate states But after that the tyrants of Athens and all the tyrants of other parts of Greece generally and of old subject to these violent incroachments notwithstanding their number and the fresh vigour of the last were all except those of Sicily demolished by the Lacedaemonians â For Lacedae mon ever since it came into the hands of the Dorians in whose possession it still continueth though harassed with se ditions the longest of any place we know yet hath ever been happy in a well regulated government and hath always been exempt from tyrants For reckoning to the conclusion of this present war it is somewhat more than four hundred years that the Lacedaemonians have enjoyed the same polity On this basis was their power at home founded and this en abled them to exert it in regulating other states â But after that the tyrants were by them extirpated from Greece not many years intervened before the battle of Marathon was fought by the Medes against the Athenians And in the Vol I Q L4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR tenth year after that the Barbarian Xerxes again with a vast armament invaded Greece in order to inslave it Hang ing then on the very brink of ruin the Lacedaemonians on account of their pre eminent power took the command of all the Greeks combined together in their own defence  whilst the Athenians on the approach of the Medes having already determined to abandon their city and laid in their necessary stores went on board their ships and made head against him by sea Having thus by their common efforts repulsed the Barbarian the Grecians not only those who revolted from the king but those also who had combined together against him were soon after divided among themselves siding either in the Athenian or in the Lacedaemonian league  For the mastery appeared plainly to be in their hands since these were the most powerful by land and those by sea The agreement between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians was but of short continuance  variance ensued  and they entered the lists of war one against another each with the additional strength of their own respective allies  And hence if any other Grecians quarreled they went over in parties to these as their principals Insomuch that from the invasion of the Medes quite down to the breaking out of this war one while striking up truces another while at open war either with one another or the confederates revolting from either league they had provided themselves with all military stores and much improved their skill by constant practice exercised in dangers As for the Lacedaemonians they gave law to their con federates without the heavy imposition of tributes Their study was only to keep them well affected to themselves by introducing the oligarchy among them But the Athenians lorded it over theirs having got in course of time the ships of all those who might oppose them into their own hands excepting the Chians and the Lesbians and imposed on them a certain payment of tribute And their own particu lar preparations for the present war were more ample than B I INTRODUCTION 15 former times had known even during the greatest vigour of their state and the most perfect harmony between them and their allies Such are the discoveries I have made concerning the an cient state of Greece which though drawn from a regular series of proofs will not easily be credited For it is the cus tom of mankind nay even where their own country is con cerned to acquiesce with ready credulity in the traditions of former ages without subjecting them to the test of sedate ex amination Thus for instance it is yet a received opinion amongst the bulk of the Athenian People that Hipparchus was the tyrant and therefore slain by Harmodius and Aris togiton and they have not yet discovered that Hippias then governed by virtue of his being the eldest of the sons of Pi sistratus and that Hipparchus and Thessalus were his bro thers Harmodius and Aristogiton on the very day appoint ed and just at the crisis suspecting that information had been given to Hippias by some who were privy to the design made no attempt upon him as put already on his guard Yet willing before they were apprehended to shew their resolu tion and contempt of danger they accidentally found Hippar chus at the Leocorium superintending the Panathenaical pro cession and immediately slew him There are many other things of a more recent date and of memory not yet invali dated by time about which the other Grecians are very wrong in their notions such as that the Lacedaemonian kings had each of them a double and not a single vote in public questions  and that amongst them the Pittanate was a a military band which never yet existed So easy a task to numbers is the search of truth  so eager are they to catch at whatever lieth next at hand  â This procession was made at the great Panathenxa which festival was celebrated once in five years in commemoration of the union of all the peo ple of Attica by Theseus The lesser Panathenxa was celebrated every third year some say every year and was lengthened out by public games These were also used at the great Panathenxa in which the greatest splendour and magnificence were employed and the procession added here mentioned by Thucydides and of which the curious reader may see a particular account in Potter s Archxologia vol i p 421 16 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  But from the testimonies alleged in support of what I have hitherto advanced any one may depend on my account of things without danger of false opinions Let him with hold his credit from the songs of poets whose profession it is to give all possible enlargements to their subjects  Let him do so farther by the writers of prose who study more that artful composition which captivateth the ear than the plain and simple recital of truth where proper attestations are never to be found and many things through length of time have incredibly sallied out into mere fable and then he will be convinced upon the plainest proofs that the state of an cient Greece was very nearly the same as I have described it And this present war when considered in all its opera tions notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to imagine that war in which they are personally engaged to be the greatest that ever happened and so soon as it is over to re place their admiration upon others more ancient will easily be owned to have been the most important of all As to the speeches of particular persons either at the com mencement or in the prosecution of the war whether such as I heard myself or such as were repeated to me by others I will not pretend to recite them in all their exactness It hath been my method to consider principally what might be pertinently said upon every occasion to the points in debate and to keep as near as possible to what would pass for genu ine by universal consent And as for the actions performed in the course of this war I have not presumed to describe them from casual narratives or my own conjectures but either from certainty where I myself was a spectator or from the most exact informations I have been able to collect from others This indeed was a work of no little difficulty because even such as were present at those actions disagreed in their accounts about them according as affection to either side or memory prevailed My relation because quite clear of fable may prove less â Thucydides is here supposed to glance at Herodotus  and again a little af cr he justly thinks thatyferion and fable ought to have no place in history B I 17 VNTRODUCTIBN delightful to the ears But it will afford sufficient scope to those who love a sincere account of past transactions of such as in the ordinary vicissitude of human affairs may fully oc cur at least be resembled again I give it to the public as an Everlasting Possession and not as a contentious in strument of temporary applause Of former transactions the greatest was that against the Medes which however by two engagements at sea and as many at land was brought to a speedy conclusion But the continuance of this war ran out into a much greater length  and Greece in the course of it was plunged into such cala mities as were never known before in an equal space Never had so many cities been made desolate by victories some by Barbarians and some by the violence of intestine feuds  to say nothing of those where captivity made room for new possessors Never so many instances of banishment never so many scenes of slaughter either in battles or seditions Such calamities farther as were known only by report but had rarely been felt in fact now gained credit from experi ence  Earthquakes for instance which affected the largest part of the habitable globe and shook it with the utmost vio lence Eclipses of the sun which happened more frequently than former times had remembered  Great droughts in some places the consequence of which was famine And what made not the least ravage but did its share of destruction the noisome pestilence For all these things ensued in the sequel of this war which was carried on between the Athenians and Peloponnesians after breaking the thirty years truce concluded between them upon the reduction of Euboea The reasons for which this truce was broke and their course of Variance I have in the first place thought proper to write that none may be at a loss about the origin of so momentous a war among the Grecians The growth of the Athenian power I conceive to have been the truest occasion of it though never openly avowed The jealousy struck by 18 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR it into the Lacedaemonians made the contest necessary But the pretences publicly alleged on either side for breaking the truce and declaring open war shall now be related EPIDAMNUS is a city on the right hand as you sail into the Ionian gulf Adjoining to it live the Barbarian Tau lantii a people of Illyria The Corcyreans settled a colony here the leader of which was Phalius the son of Herato clidcs a Corinthian by birth of the lineage of Hercules invited to the office out of the mother city according to the custom of ancient times  and besides this some Corinthians and others of Doric descent joined themselves to this colony In process of time the city of the Epidamnians became great and populous Yet having been afterwards harassed with seditions of many years continuance they were brought very low according to report by a war waged against them by the neighbouring Barbarians and were deprived of the greatest share of their power But the most recent event at Epidamnus before the present war was that the people there had driven the nobles out of the city These sheltering them selves amongst the Barbarians began depredations on those who remained behind both by land and sea The Epidam nians of the place suffering vastly from these depredations dispatched ambassadors to Corcyra as their mother city be seeching them  Not to behold their destruction with eyes unconcerned biit to reconcile their exiles to them and to deliver them from this Barbarian war The ambassadors sitting down submissively in the temple of Juno offered these supplications  But the Corcyreans refusing to receive them sent them home again without effect The Epidamnians thus convinced that no redress could be had from Corcyra and ignorant how to proceed in their present perplexities sent to Delphos to enquire of the God  Whether they should surrender their city to the Corinthians as their founders and should seek security from their protection  He answered that  they should surrender and take them for their leaders The Epidamnians in pursuance of this oracle arriving at B I 19 INTRODUCTION Corinth make there a tender of the colony representing that  the leader of it had been at Corinth and communi cating the oracle  and farther intreated them  not to look on with eyes of unconcern till their destruction was com pleated but to undertake their redress The Corinthians granted them their protection from a regard to justice ima gining themselves to be no less interested in this colony than the Corcyreans But they were also actuated by a hatred of the Corcyreans from whom though a colony of their own they had received some contemptuous treatment For they neither paid them the usual honour on their public so lemnities nor began with a Corinthian in the distribution of the sacrifices which is always done by other colonies This their contempt was founded as well on the sufficiency of their own wealth in which at that time they equalled the richest of the Greeks as on the superiority of their military force Their insolence became greater in time with the enlargement of their navy and they assumed glory to them selves in a naval character as succeeding the Phaeacians in the possession of Corcyra This was their chief incentive to furnish themselves with a naval strength and in it they were by no means inconsiderable  For they were masters of an hundred and twenty triremes when they began this war Upon all these reasons the resentments of the Corinthians rising high against them they undertook with pleasure the relief of Epidamnus  encouraging all who were so disposed to go and settle there and sending thither a garrison of Am braciots and Leucanians and their own people These marched by land to Apollonia which is a colony of the Corinthians from a dread of the Corcyreans lest they should have hindered their passage had they attempted it by sea As soon as the Corcyreans heard that the new inhabitants and garrison were got to Epidamnus and that the colony was delivered into the hands of the Corinthians they grew hot with indignation and putting out immediately with 20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR twenty five ships which were soon followed by another equip ment they command them  at their peril to receive their exiles â For those who had been driven out of Epidamnus had already been at Corcyra where pointing to the sepulchres and claiming the rights of consanguinity they had intreated them to undertake their restoration â and to send away the garrison and new inhabitants which they had received from Corinth The Epidamnians were quite deaf to these haughty commands And upon this the Corcyreans with a squadron of forty ships accompanied by the exiles whom they pretended to restore and an aid of Illyrians began hostili ties Having blocked up the city they made proclamation  That all Epidamnians who were willing and the strangers might depart without molestation or otherwise they should be treated as enemies But this having no effect the Cor cyreans beset the place which is situated upon an isthmus on all sides in regular siege The Corinthians upon the arrival of messengers from Epidamnus with an account of the siege dr w their forces together They also gave public notice  That a new co lony was going to Epidamnus into which all that would enter should have equal and like privileges with their prede cessors  that if any one was unwilling to set out immedi ately and yet chose to have the benefit of the colony he might deposit fifty Corinthian drachmas and be excused his personal attendance The number of those who entered for immediate transportation and of these who deposited their money was large They sent farther to the Mega reans requesting a number of ships to enlarge their con voy that their passage might not be obstructed by the Cor cyreans from whom they received a supply of eight and four more from Pale of the Cephallenians The same re quest was made to the Epidaurians who sent five A single ship joined them from Hermione  two from Troezene  ten from the Leucadians  and eight from the Ambraciots Of the Thebanr and Phliasians they requested money of the B I INTRODUCTION 21 Eleans empty ships and money And the number of ships fitted out by themselves amounted to thirty and three thou sand heavy armed When the Corcyreans were informed of these prepara tions they went to Corinth purposely accompanied by am bassadors from Lacedaemon and Sicyon There they charged the Corinthians  to fetch away their garrison and new set tlement from Epidamnus as having no manner of preten sions there That if they had any thing to allege to the con trary they were willing to submit to a fair trial in Pelopon nesus before such states as both sides should approve and to whichever party the colony should be adjudged by them it should be held They also intimated  their readiness to refer the point in dispute to the oracle at Delphos â war in their own inclinations they were quite against But if it must be so on their sides they said mere necessity would prescribe the measure  and if thus compelled to do it they should for assistance have recourse to friends not eligible indeed but better able to serve them than such as they already had The Corinthians answered that  if they would with draw their fleet and their Barbarians from before Epidamnus they would then treat of an accommodation but till this was done their honour would not suffer them to submit to a re ference whilst their friends were undergoing the miseries of a siege The Corcyreans replied that  if they would recall their people from Epidamnus themselves also would do the like  but were ready further to agree that both parties should remain in their present situation under a suspension of arms till the affair could be judicially determined The Corinthians were not only deaf to every proposal but so soon as ever they had manned their ships and their allies were come up dispatching a herald before hand to declare war against the Corcyreans and then weighing anchor with a force of seventy five ships and two thousand heavy armed they stretched away for Epidamnus to make head against the Corcyreans The commanders of this fleet were Aris Vol I R 2j2 â THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR teus the son of Pellicas Callicrates the son of Callias and Timanor the son of Timanthes Those of the land forces were Archetimus the son of Eurytimus and Isarchidas the son of Isarchus When they were come up as far as Actium in the district of Anactorium where standeth the temple of Apollo in the mouth of the gulf of Ambracia they were met by a herald dispatched expressly in a row boat by the Corcyreans forbid ding them  at their peril to proceed But at the same time the Corcyreans were busied at home in manning their own ships repairing such as were old to make them fit for service and equipping the rest with the utmost expedition When the herald brought back nothing pacific from the Corinthians and their squadron was now compleated to eighty ships for they had forty employed in the siege of Epidamnus they sailed in quest of the enemy and drawing up against them came to an engagement The victory fell beyond dispute to the side of the Corcyreans and fifteen ships of the Corinthi ans were utterly destroyed Their good fortune was such that on the very same day Epi damnus was surrendered to the besiegers upon a capitulation by which  all the strangers in the place were to be sold for slaves  but the Corinthians to be detained prisoners at discretion After the engagement at sea the Corcyreans having erected a trophy upon Leucimna a promontory of Cor â This was constantly done by the Grecians upon a victory Nay when the victory was claimed on both sides both sides erected trophies of which several instances occur in Thucydides The trophies for a victory at land were decked out with the arms they had taken  Those for a victory at sea with arm s also and the shatters of the enemy s ships To demoKsh a tro  phy was looked on as unlawful and a kind of sacrilege because they were  all consecrated to some deity  Nor was it less a crime to pay divine ado  ration before them or to repair them when decayed as may be likewise Cl observed of the Roman triumphal arches  This being the means to revive  the memory of forgotten quarrels and engage posterity to revenge the  disgrace of their ancestors  For the same reason those Grecians who  tirst introduced the custom of erecting pillars for trophies incurred a se â vere censurr from the ages thry lived in Putter s Archwlogia vol ii c 1 2 B I INTRODUCTION cyra put to death all the prisoners they had taken except the Corinthians whom they kept in chains And after this as the Corinthians and allies having been vanquished in fight were forced to retire within their own harbours they were quite masters of all the adjacent sea and sailing first to Leucas a colony of the Corinthians they laid its territory waste and then burnt Cyllene a dock of the Eleans be cause they had supplied the Corinthians with ships and mo ney In this manner they continued masters of the sea a long time after their naval victory and in their cruises very much annoyed the allies of the Corinthians It was not till the beginning of the summer that a check was given them by a fleet and land army who were commissioned in order to relieve their harrassed allies to station themselves at Actium and round the Chimerium of Thesprotis There they lay to cover Leucas and other places which were in friendship with them from the ravage of the enemy The Corcyreans upon this with a naval and land force sta tioned themselves over against them at Leucimna But neither party venturing out to attack the other they lay quiet in their opposite stations the whole summer and on the approach of winter both sides withdrew to their respec tive homes During the remainder of the year after the engagement at sea and all the following the Corinthians whose indig nation was raised in this their war against the Corcyreans were building new ships and sparing neither labour nor cost to get a strong armament ready for sea and sent through out Peloponnesus and the other parts of Greece to hire ma riners into their service The Corcyreans hearing of these great preparations were terribly alarmed and with reason For at that time they were in no alliance with any of the Grecians nor comprehended either in the Athenian or La cedaemonian league And hence they thought it quite ex pedient to go and sue for the alliance of the Athenians and endeavour to obtain some succour from them The Corin thians gaining intelligence of their design dispatched ah 24 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR embassy at the same time also to Athens instructed by any means to prevent the junction of the Athenian to the naval strength of the Corcyreans which might hinder them from bringing this war to a successful issue The Athenians being met in general assembly both embassies rose up to plead their own cause and the Corcyrean spoke as followeth â The lx X ri or assembly of the people In this the sovereignty was vested  and it is proper the English reader should grow acquainted with this particular form in the Athenian democracy The people of Athens were divided into ten tribes which presided by rotation The year was divided into ten courses and each tribe presided about five weeks The tribe in course elected fifty persons to manage by their authority and in their name  These were called Prytanes This being too large a number for business they were subdivided into tens each of these divisions presiding for a week  and these were called Proedri One of the Proedri presided or was in the chair for a day and was stiled Epis tates For that day and he never enjoyed this pre eminence a second time in his life he was invested with the highest trust in the government He kept the public seal and the keys of the citadel and treasury In the as sembly of the people he ordered all the proclamations regulated proceed ings put the question and declared the majority The assemblies of the people were of two kinds ordinary and extraordina ry Of the first kind four were regularly held during each presidency of the tribes and at the third of them ambassadors from foreign states had public audience The latter were occasionally convened by the president in course or by the generals of the state Some days before hand notice was publicly given by the senate or council of five hundred upon what sub jects they were to deliberate but this could not be observed upon sudden emergencies They met early in the morning generally in the Pnyx at the summons of the public crier At the second summons they were obliged to attend at their peril For then the proper officers ran along the forum with a rope stretched across and rubbed over with vermilion and all upon whom a mark was found were fined  but those who attended early and regularly received half a drachma each for attendance The number which attended gene rally amounted to five or six thousand The assembly opened with the sacrifice of a young pig to Ceres and the blood was sprinkled round by way of purification Then a prayer was pro nounced aloud by the crier for the prosperity of the commonwealth of Athens  which ended a curse was next pronounced on every citizen who did sny thing to the prejudice of his country Then the presidents of the week opened the points upon which they were convened and the assem bly proceeded to business B r INTRODUCTION 25  IT is quite proper Athenians that those who address  themselves to a neighbouring power imploring their suc  cour which is now our case without being able to plead  the merit of prior good services or an old alliance in their  own behalf should previously convince them chiefly that  a compliance with such requests must turn to their advan  tage  at least that it will cause no manner of inconve  nience  and then that the favour will be returned with  effectual gratitude If they are unable to give satisfac  tory conviction in any of these particulars they can have  no reason to be angry if their suit be rejected The Cor  cyreans confident that they can clear up these points be  yond the reach of scruple have sent us hither to request your alliance  The method indeed which hitherto we have fondly  observed hath proved in fact absurd towards you in this our exigency and prejudicial to our own affairs in our present  situation In preceding times we never chose to grant our  alliance to any yet now are we come to sue for alliance  from others being through our own maxims quite destitute  of friends in this our war against the Corinthians  and that  which before appeared the conduct of refined prudence to  keep clear of danger by shunning the intanglements of a  foreign alliance we now find by the event to have been  bt h impolitic and weak  Once already we have engaged the Corinthians at sea  and repulsed them merely by our own strength But since  with a greater force collected from Peloponnesus and the  rest jof Greece they are again preparing to attack us  since  we perceive ourselves unable to resist them merely with  our own domestic strength  since further with our subjec  tion the danger will spread abroad we are necessitated to  apply to you and every where else for succour  and though  now emboldened to act in opposition to our former inactive  maxims yet we deserve your pardon as they were not the  result of bad designs but of mistaken judgments  and could  we but obtain redress from you this incidental necessity of 26 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  ours will turn out highly to your honour upon several  accounts  In the firstplace you will favour those with your assist  ance who have felt but never committed injustice In the  next place by protecting those whose lives and liberties are  at stake you will confer so vast an obligation that the memo  ry of it can never be abolished We are now masters of  the greatest naval force except your own Consider there  fore how fair an occasion very seldom to be met with of  the greatest advantage to yourselves of the greatest vexation  to your enemies now lieth before you  when that very  power the accession of which you would readily have pur  chased with ample sums of money and a weight of obliga  tion cometh here to invite your acceptance and make a ten  der of itself without any danger or expence to you  nay 4 what is more enabling you to gain the praise of the world  the grateful acknowledgments of those you defend and an  increase of power to yourselves Few people in pre  ceding ages have ever had at any one time so many fine op  portunities within their reach And few there are who  suing for alliance do it not rather from a view of receiving  than conferring security and reputation by their suit  If there be any one amongst you who imagineth that war  will never happen in which we may do you service in such  imagination he is quite mistaken He doth not penetrate  the designs of the Lacedaemonians who alarmed at your  power are intent on war 1 nor those of the Corinthians  who powerful of themselves and your enemies have begun  with us to open the way for attacking you  that united by  common resentments we might not stand up in our mutual  defence against their violence nor they be disappointed at  least in one of their views either effectually to humble us  or securely to establish their own power It is your in  terest to prevent them by accepting that alliance which we  offer and rather to anticipate their designs than countef  plot them when ripening into act 8 I INTRODUCTIQN 2  If farther they tax with a breach of justice your pre  suming to interfere with their colonies let them learn that  every colony whilst used in the proper manner payeth ho 4 nour and regard to its mother state but when treated with  injury and violence is become an alien They are not sent  out to be the slaves but to be the equals of those who remain  behind Their violence and injustice require no proofs  For invited by us to submit the business of Epidainnus to  a judicial trial they chose rather to prosecute their claims  at war than at equity And let such behaviour towards tis  their relations put you timely on your guard that you may  not be over reached by their collusions nor hesitate one  moment to grant our petitions For he who findeth the  least room to repent of having gratified his enemies is most  likely to persevere in uninterrupted security  You will not break your treaty with the Lacedaemonians  by our admission who are allied to neither of you By that  treaty it is expressly stipulated thatâ If any of the states  of Greece be not at present in alliance with either of the u contracting parties permission is given them to go into Ci either league at their own discretion And terrible in  deed it is if they must be at liberty to man their fleets out  of places in their alliance nay more than that out of Greece  at large and to no small amount even out of your depend  ents  and we must be debarred not only your most inviting  alliance but every possible expedient of succour then after  all they must raise a cry of injustice if we offer our re  quests to you and have them granted But much greater rea  sons of complaint will lie with us if we cannot prevail upon  you For then you will throw at a distance those who are be  set with dangers and never were your enemies you will not  only not restrain the incroachments of enemies and invaders  but will behold them through your negligence assuming  strength out of your dominions which you ought never to  endure You ought either to hinder them from seducing  your subjects into their pay or send an imipediate succour 28 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR  to us in what manner you may be persuaded is the most  expedient but the course you ought principally to take  iAA to form with us a defensive alliance and to act inline  diately  The advantage of such a measure as we premised at  first we are clearly proving But that which carrieth the  greatest weight is this that our enemies are enemies also  to you a point too clear to require proof and enemies  by no means despicable but able to make revolters feel  their vengeance The bad consequences of rejecting a  land cannot be equal to those of rejecting a naval alliance  especially to you who should exert your utmost efforts to  let none be masters of a fleet beside yourselves  or if that  be not feasible to make the most powerful in that respect  your fast allies And whosoever allowing the plain ad  vantage of these our arguments may yet dread a rupture  if their influence prevail let such a one know that  the event he feareth accompanied by strength will strike  greater dread into all your enemies but that the zeal of  him who would have us now rejected since it is founded  on a weak presumption of their strength must the sooner  encourage those enemies to attack you The present con  sultation is not confined to Corcyra but very nearly con  cerneth Athens also Let him therefore be assured  that he doth not provide the best for the welfare of Athens a when directly foreseeing a war fast approaching and only  not on foot he hesitateth the least about gaining a people  provided with all the necessary means of being a most ser  viceable friend or a most prejudicial foe  a people op  portunely situated in the course to Italy and Sicily so ca  pable to hinder the accession of any naval force from  thence to the Peloponnesians and to secure a passage from  hence to any of those coasts not to mention the commodi  ousness of Tt in many other respects  To reduce the whole to one short point wherein all and  every individual of you is concerned learn from hence that B t INTRODUCTION 29   we are not to be abandoned There are but three naval  powers amongst the Grecians of any consideration your  own our own and that of the Corinthians If you indo  lently suffer two of these to be incorporated by leaving us  a prey to the Corinthians you must for the future make  head against the Corcyreans and Peloponnesians both  But if you grant your alliance to us the contest will lie  against them alone and your own naval strength be con  siderably augmented In this manner the Corcyreans spoke  and when they had concluded the Corinthians took their turn as follow eth  SINCE these Corcyreans have not confined their dis  course merely to solicit the favour of your alliance but  have enlarged it with invectives against our injustice iri  making war upon them we also lie under a necessity to  make some previous observations on both of those points  before we proceed to other matters By this means you  will perceive your own great security in complying with  our demands and what weighty reasons you have to reject  their importunate solicitations  They allege it as a maxim of prudence that they have  been hitherto averse to any foreign alliance But their  motives in this were founded upon malice and not upon  virtue They would have no ally to be a witness of the  wrongs they do  they declined the society of such as  might put them to the blush Their very island farther  which is finely situated for such arbitrary tempers suffer  eth them alone to judge those outrages they themselves u commit exempting them from fair and equitable trials  because they seldom go abroad to visit their neighbours  as their harbours are the constant and necessary resort of  others Here then lieth the modesty of their unassociating maxim It was designed to prevent their having anypart  ners in violence that they might have it all to themselves   that when they were superior they might oppress without Vol I S 30 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR  controul when there were none to watch them they might 44 engross the spoil and might enjoy their rapine without  danger of a blush Had they been those virtuous souls they  proclaim themselves then clear of every bad imputation  from their neighbours they had a fine opportunity to  manifest their integrity to the world by doing and by sub 44 mining to justice  But such neither we nor any other people have in fact  experienced them For though planted by us they have  ever isowned their allegiance to us and now wage open  war against us pleading that they were not sent abroad to  be maltreated and oppressed We also aver in our own  behalf that neither did we send them to receive their in  jurious requitals but to retain them in lawful dependence  and to be honoured and reverenced by them Such duti  ful returns the rest of our colonies punctually make us and  by such no other people are so well respected as ourselves  From the great satisfaction therefore we give to all the  rest it plainly appeareth that we afford no reasonable dis 44 gust to these alone and that without some glaring injury  we should have had no inclination to declare war against  them But though we had actually transgressed it would  have been quite decent on their part to have shewn con  descension when we were angry and then it would have  been base in us to have pressed too far on such moderation 44 To their pride and the insolence of wealth their many  transgressions against us are justly to be ascribed Hence  it was that they laid no claim to Epidamnus which be  longeth to us whilst harrassed with intestine feuds but when  we came to its redress then by force they seize and detain  it And now they pretend that previous to that they were  willing to have submitted to a fair arbitration â Such pleas  are not to be regarded when offered by men who are 44 already masters in possession and on that security make ap  peal to justice They are only of weight when facts and  words are equitably to be judged before the point hath JB I IKTRODUCTION 31  been decided by arms And it was not before they had  besieged that city but when they thought that we were in  tent on saving it that they had recourse to the specious  pretence of a fair arbitration And here they are at pre  sent by no means content with the wrongs they have there  committed presuming to ask conjunction from you not  in league but in violence and on the merit of being rebels  against us to beg your protection Then was the proper  time for such an address to you when their affairs securely  flourished  not now when we have been outraged by them  and they are beset with dangers  not when you who have  shared no benefit from their former power are to relieve  their distress and by no means their accomplices in crimes  are to come in for an equality of censure from us A  prior conjunction of force justly entitleth to a share of what  may be the event But those who had no participation in  the guilt ought to be exempted from the consequences of  it And thus we have clearly shewn that we have ad  dressed ourselves before you with all the requisites of a  rightful cause and that their proceedings are violent and  rapacious  It is now incumbent upon us to convince you that you  cannot with justice receive them into alliance For grant  ing it to be expressly stipulated in the treaty that any of  the states not particularly mentioned may go into either  league at their own discretion yet the intent of the stipu  lation reacheth not to those who join one party to the pre judice of another but to such as having withdrawn from  neither side are in need of protectionâ to such as bring not  war instead of peace to those who receive them â if they  know their interest And yet the latter must be your por  tion if our arguments lose their influence For you will  not only become auxiliaries to them but enemies also to  us who are your allies by treaty Of necessity if you join a with them our vengeance must be levelled at them without separating you Right above all things it would be for you to keep yourselves at a distance from us both â if that will  u 32 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  not please to reverse your proceedings and join with us in  opposition to themâ For to the Corinthians you are bound  by firm and lasting treaties with the Corcyreans you have  never yet transacted even for a truce and by no means to  establish a new law for receiving rcvolters from the other  league We ourselves did not upon the Samian revolt  give our suffrage against you when the rest of the Pelo  ponnesians were divided upon the questionâ whether they  ought to be supported But we openly maintained that  every state had a right to proceed against its own depend  ents For if you receive and undertake the defence of  those who have behaved amiss the event will shew that  the greater number will come over to our side and that  you establish a law prejudicial to yourselves much more  than to us  The points of justice we have thus sufficiently cleared  up to you according to the general laws of Greece We  have only to add a word of advice and the claim of a fa  vour such a one as we now affirm upon a principle of grati  tude ought not to be denied us who are neither your ene  mies so far as to hurt you nor ever were your friends so  far as to burden you When formerly before the invasion  of the Medes you were in want of long ships in your war  against the iEginetae you were supplied by the Corinthians  with twenty The service which we then did you and  that other more recent about the Samians when we pre  vented their receiving any support from the Peloponnesi  ans enabled you in their turns to vanish the iEgineta e and  to chastise the Samians And these services were done you  at a season when the human attention fixed intirely on war  regardeth nothing but what tendeth to victory Whoever  forwardeth this men esteem their friend though he was be  fore their foe  and him who checketh it their foe though  perhaps he may be their real friend For even domestic  affairs are sorrily conducted at a time when the mind is in  flamed by contention  Recollect these things Let the young man learn the B I INTRODUCTION 33  truth of them from his elders and acknowledge that we ft ought to be properly requited Let him not entertain the  thought that what we say is agreeable to equity but that in  case of a war interest inclineth another way For interest is  most surely to be found there where the least injustice is  committed The contingency of that war from the dread  of which the Corcyreans encourage you to act unjustly lieth  yet in obscurity and ought not to inflame you into open and  immediate hostilities against the Corinthians It would be  prudent farther to lessen that jealousy we have already con  ceived from the proceedings at Megara For a latter obn  gation by the favour of time though of less weight in itselfi  is able to cancel a charge of greater moment Neither suf  fer yourselves to be allured with the promise of a powerful  conjunction of naval force  For never to act unjustly against  equals is a firmer security of power than to be elevated upon  present plausibilities and enlarge it through a scries of dan  gers Our present circumstances resemble those concerning  which we expressly declared at Lacedaemon that every state  had a right to proceed against its own dependents And now  we beg that liberty from you  and that you who have reaped  the benefit of such a suffrage from us would not prejudice us by yours Render us for it the just requital  remembering  that this is the critical season in which he who aideth is the  best of friends and he that opposeth the greatest foe And  as for these Corcyreans take them not into your alliance in  despite of us nor abet them in the injuries they have done  us By acting in this manner you will discharge the obli  gations incumbent upon you and will take those measures  which are most for your own advantage This is the substance of what was said by the Corinthians The Athenians having heard both parties met twice in full assembly on this occasion At the first meeting they thought â Here the English reader should be informed in what manner business went on when difficulties diversities of opinion and consequently debates ensued  34 THE PELOPONNESIAK WAR there was validity in the arguments of the Corinthians  but at the second they came to a different resolutionâ not indeed to form such an alliance with the Corcyreans as to have the same enemies and the same friends for then if the Corcyreans should summon them to join in an expedition against Corinth their treaty with the Peloponnesians would be broke but an alliance merely defensivej for the reciprocal succour of one an other if either Corcyra or Athens or any of their respective allies should be assaulted A war with the Peloponnesians seemed to them unavoidable  and they had no mind to leave Corcyra which had so great a naval force for a prey to the Corinthians  but to break them to the utmost of their power against one another that upon occasion they might be the bet ter able to war with the Corinthians thus weakened to their hands though joined by other states of Greece which had pow er at sea At the same time that island appeared to them most conveniently situated in the passage to Italy and Sicily Upon these motives the Athenians received the Corcyreans into their alliance And not long after the departure of the Corinthians sent ten ships to their aid under the command of Lacedaemonius When it appeared that the point proposed would not pass unanimously the crier at the command of the president in the chair proclaimed aloud  What citizen above fifty years of age hath a mind to speak i When such had been heard the crier made a second proclamation that  any Athenian  whatever had liberty to speak The debate being ended the president in the chair bade the crier put the question It was decided by holding up of hands The chairman distinguished the numbers in the affirmative and negative and declared the majority Then the resolution or decree was drawn up in form  and the Archon s name who gave title to the year the day of the month and the name of the presiding tribe were prefixed The public decorum of the Athenians is worthy observation The sen timents of age and experience were first to be heard and then the spirit and resolution of the younger were called in to assist at the public consul tation Nay they carried it farther no person convicted of profaneness debauchery cowardice or public misdemeanor was suffered to speak in this assembly From them they expected no sound instruction no disin terested advice If any such offered to speak the president of the assembly immediately enjoined them silence  or if they were refractory ordered1 their officers to pull them down and turn them out of the assembly B Â 3o INTRODUCTION the son of Cimon Diotimus the son of Strombichus and Pro teas the son of Epicles Their orders were  by no means to  engage the Corinthians unless they stood against and en  deavoured to make a descent at Corcyra or any of its de  pendent places if they did so to resist them with all their  efforts These orders were given with a view of not in fringing the treaty And this their aid of shipping arriveth at Corcyra The Corinthians when they had compleated their pre  parations set sail for Corcyra with a fleet of one hundred and fifty ships Of these ten belonged to the Eleans twelve to the Megareans ten to the Leucadians twenty seven to the Ambraciots one to the Anactorians and the other ninety were their own The quotas from the allied cities had each of them their respective commanders  but the Corinthian squadron was commanded by Xenoclides the son of Euthy cles with four colleagues So soon as they were all assem bled at that part of the continent which looks towards Cor cyra they set sail from Leucas and arrive at the Chime rium in Thesprotis A harbour openeth itself here and above it is the city of Ephyre at a distance from the sea in Eleatis a district of Thesprotis Near it is the outlet into the sea of the lake of Acherusia into which the river Ache ron having run through Thesprotis is at last received from which it also deriveth its name The river Thyamis also runneth here dividing Thesprotis from Cestrine and be tween these two rivers ariseth the cape of Chimerium The Corinthians therefore arrive at this part of the continent and fix their station there But the Corcyreans so soon as ever advised of their sailing having manned a hundred and ten siups under the command of Miciades iEsimides and Eurybatus took their station at one of those isles which are called the sijbota accompanied by the ten Athenian ships Their land force was left at the promontory of Leucimna with an aid of a thousand heavy armed Zacynthians The Co rinthians had also ready upon the continent a numerous aid 36 THE PEtOPONNESIAN WAR of Barbarians For the people on that coast have ever con tinued their friends When every thing was in order among the Corinthians taking in provisions for three days they weigh by night from Chimerium with a design to fight and having sailed along till break of day they discover the ships of the Corcyreans already out at sea and advancing against them When thus they had got a view of each other both sides form into the order of battle In the right wing of the Corcyreans were the Athenian ships the rest of the fleet was all their own ranged into three squadrons each of which were respectively under the orders of the three com manders  In this manner was the order of the Corcyreans formed In the right of the Corinthians were the ships of the Megareans and Ambraciots in the centre the other allies in their several arrangements The Corinthians formed the left wing themselves as their ships were the best sailers to oppose the Athenians and the right of the Corcyreans When the signal flags were hoisted on both sides they ran together and began the engagement both sides having stowed their decks with bodies of heavy armed with many further that drew the bow or tossed the javelin Their pre parations still retained something of the awkward manner of antiquity The engagement was sharply carried on yet  To give the English reader once for all a proper light into their I method of beginning an engagement I shall quote the following para graph from archbishop Potter s Archaologia o ii c 21  Before they joined battle both parties invoked the Gods to their assist ance by prayers and sacrifices  and the admirals going from ship to ship in some of the lighter vessels exhorted their soldiers in a set oration to behave themselves like men  Then all things being in readiness the sig nal was given by hanging out of the admiral s galley a gilded shield as we read in Plutarch or a red garment or banner which was termed ctlfm vrifwitt During the elevation of this the fight continued and by its de pression or inclination towards the right or left the rest of the ships were directed in what manner to attack their enemies or retreat from them To this was added the sound of trumpets which was begun in the admi ral s galley and continued round the whole navy it was likewise usual for the soldiers before the fight to aing a paran or hymn to Mars and after the fight another to Apollo B I r  INTRODUCTION without exertions of skill and very much resembling a battle upon land When they had laid one another close they were not easily separated again because of the number and hurry of the vessels The greatest hope of victory was placed in the heavy armed fighting on the decks who fixed to their post engaged hand to hand whilst their ships continued without any motion They had no opportunity to make their charges and tacks but fought it out by dint of strength and courage without any dexterity The tumult was great on all sides and the whole action full of disorder In which the Athenian ships relieved the Corcyrean wherever they were pressed too hard and did what they could to intimidate the enemy  but their commanders refrained from any direct at tack remembering with awe the orders of the Athenians The right wing of the Corinthians suffered the most For the Corcyreans with twenty ships having put them to flight chased them when dispersed to the continent j and continu ing the pursuit to their very camp land immediately where they set fire to their abandoned tents and carried off all the baggage In this part therefore the Corinthians and their al lies were vanquished and the Corcyreans plainly superior But in the left where the Corinthians personally engaged they easily prevailed as twenty ships of the Corcyreans and those too from a number at first inferior were gone off in the pursuit But the Athenians seeing the Coreyreans thus dis tressed now came up to their support more openly than be fore having hitherto refrained from any direct attack And when the chace was clearly begun and the Corinthians fol lowed their suqeess then every one amongst them applied himself to action There was no longer any time for discre tion  Corinthians and Athenians were forced by absolute necessity to engage one another The chace being thus begun the Corinthians towed not after them the hulks of the vessels they had sunk but turned all their attention to the men who were footing about and cruize at large more to slaughter than take alive And Voi I T 38 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR having not yet discovered the defeat of their right they slaughtered through ignorance their own friends For the number of ships being large on either side and covering a wide extent of sea after the first confusion of the engage ment they were not able easily to distinguish which were the victors or which the vanquished Since Grecians against Grecians had never at any time before engaged at sea with so large a number of vessels But after the Co rinthians had pursued the Corcyreans to land they returned to look after their shattered vessels and their own dead And most of these they took up and carried to Sybota where also lay the land force of their Barbarian auxiliaries This Sy bota is a desert haven in Thesprotis Having performed this duty they gathered together again into a body and went in quest of the Corcyreans who with those damaged vessels that yet could swim and with all that had no damage toge ther with the Athenians came out to meet them fearing lest they might attempt to land upon their shore It was now late in the day and they had sung their pcean as going to attack when on a suden the Corinthians slackened their course having descried a reinforcement of twenty sail coming up from Athens This second squadron the Athe nians had sent away to support the former ten fearing what really happened lest the Corcyreans might be vanquished and their own ten ships be too few for their support The Corinthians therefore having got a view of them and sus pecting they came from Athens and in a larger number than they yet discovered began gradually to fall away They were not yet descried by the Corcyreans for the course kept them more out of their ken who were surprized to see the Corinthians thus slacken their course till some who had gained a view informed them that such ships are coming â The original is trpifittit Upttotlt they knocked the hind deet a phrase elegantly applied by Thucydides to those that retreat fighting and still facing their enemies It was done by running their ships backwards upon their hind decks in order to tack about See Potttt t Architolagia vol ii c 20 B I TNTRODOCTIOW 39 up and then they also fell back themselves For now it began to be dark and the Corinthians being turned about had dissolved their order In this manner were they sepa rated from one another And the naval engagement ended With the night The Corcyreans having recovered their station at Leucym na those twenty ships from Athens under the command of Glauco the son of Leager and Andocides the son of Leogo ras having passed through floating carcases and wrecks came up to the station not long after they had been descried Yet the Corcyreans for now it was night were in great conster nation lest they should be enemies But they were soon known and then came to anchor Next morning the thirty Athenian ships accompanied by such of the Corcyreans as were fit for sea weighed away and made over for the haven at Sybota where the Corinthians lay designing to try whether or no they would engage again The Corinthians putting their ships from off the shore and draw ing up into order in the deeper water remained there without advancing They had no design or inclination to begin an other engagement as they were sensible of the junction of the fresh Athenian ships and of the numerous difficulties with which they were beset about the custody of the prisoners whom they had on board and the want of necessary materials to repair their ships upon this desert coast Their thoughts were more employed upon their return home and the method to accomplish it from the apprehension lest the Athenians judging the league to be broke as they had come to blows might obstruct their passage For this reason they determined be forehand to dispatch a boat with proper persons though with out the solemn protection of a herald and so to sound their intentions The message to be delivered was this   YOU are guilty of injustice ye men of Athens in be  ginning war and violating treaties For you hinder us  from taking due vengeance upon our enemies by lifting  up your arms against us If you are certainly determined 40 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR â to hinder our course either against Corcyra orÂ ny other  place whither we are willing to go and so violate treaties  take us first who are here in your power and treat us as  enemies The persons sent thus delivered their message and the whole company of the Corcyreans who heard it shouted out immediately to  apprehend and put them to death But the Athenians returned this answer  We neither begin war ye men of Peloponnesus nor vio  late treaties We are come hither auxiliaries to these Cor  cyreans our allies If therefore you are desirous to sail to  any other place we hinder you not But if you go against  Corcyra or any other place belonging to it we shall endea  vour to oppose you to the utmost of our power UPON receiving this answer from the Athenians the Corinthians prepared for their return home and erected a trophy at Sybota on the continent But the Corcyreans were employed in picking up the wrecks and bodies of the dead driving towards them by favour of the tide and the wind which blowing fresh the night before had scattered them all about and as if they too had the victory erected an opposite trophy at Sybota in the island The reasons upon which each side thus claimed the victory were theseâ The Corinthians erected a trophy because they had the better of the engagement till night and so were enabled to pick up most of the shatters and the dead  they had further taken a number of prisoners not less than a thousand and had disabled about seventy ships of the enemy â The Cor cyreans did the same  because they also had disabled about thirty and upon the coming up of the Athenians had re covered all the wreck and dead bodies driving towards them j and because the Corinthians tacking about had retired from them the night before so soon as they descried the Athenian ships  and when they came to offer them battle at Sybota durst not come out against them In this manner did both sides account themselves victorious INTRODUCTION 41 The Corinthians in their passage homewards by strata gem seized Anactorium which lieth in the mouth of the gulf of Ambracia It belonged in common to the Corcyreans and themselves They put it entirely into the hands of the Corinthian inhabitants and then retired to their own home Eight hundred of their Corcyrean prisoners who were slaves they sold at public sale Two hundred and fifty they reserv ed in safe custody and treated them with extraordinary good usage that after their ransom they might serve them in their design of gaining Corcyra For the majority of them were persons of the greatest authority in that state Thus there fore is Corcyra preserved in the war of the Corinthians and the ships of the Athenians after such service left them But  this was the first ground of war to the Corinthians against j the Athenians because they had assisted the Corcyreans in a  naval engagement against themselves who were in treaty with them IMMEDIATELY after this transaction other misunder standings also happened between the Athenians and Pelo ponnesians tending to a war For all the schemes of the Corinthians aiming at revenge the Athenians jealous of their enmity sent an order to the inhabitants of Potidaea si tuated upon the isthmus of Pallene and though a Corin thian colony yet allied with and tributary to them  to de  molish that part of the wall which faceth the Pallene to  give them hostages to send away the epidemiurgi and  not to receive those magistrates for the future who were  annually sent them from Corinth They were apprehen sive of a revolt at the instigation of Perdiccas and the Co rinthians and their seducing into the same defection the other dependents of Athens in Thrace These steps the Athenians thought proper to take with the people of Poti daea immediately after the sea fight of Corcyra For the Corinthians were manifestly at variance witli them and Per diccas the son of Alexander king of the Macedonians was now become their enemy who before had been their ally 43 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR and friend His enmity was occasioned by an alliance the Athenians had formed with his brother Philip and Derdas who were jointly in opposition against him Alarmed at this he sent proper persons to Lacedaemon to stir up against them a Peloponnesian war and to draw over the Corin thians into his interest in order to bring about the revolt of Potidxa He had also been tampering with the Chalci deans of Thrace and the Bottiaeans to persuade them to re volt at the same time  concluding that if he could bring about a junction of the adjacent people he might venture a war against them with greater probability of success The Athenians perceived his scheme and were desirous to pre vent the revolt of the cities They had begun an expedi tion against his territories with a fleet of thirty ships and a thousand heavy armed under the command of Achestratus the son of Lycomedes associated with ten others in this ser vice They gave particular orders to the commanders to take hostages from the Potidaeans and to demolish their walls and to keep a watchful eye over the neighbouring cities that they might not revolt The Potidaeans had al ready sent ambassadors to the Athenians to dissuade them if possible from the execution of any new designs against them And had at the same time dispatched an embassy to Lacedaemon along with the Corinthians instructed to procure a promise of redress if there should be occasion But when their long negotiation at Athens proved quite in effectual and the fleet was gone out to sea both against Ma cedonia and themselves when farther the regency at La ceda mon had given a promise to make an irruption into Attica if the Athenians should attempt any thing against Potidaea upon this encouragement without loss of time they revolt in conjunction with the Chalcideans and Bot tiaeans all combined by an oath of mutual defence and sup port Perdiccas farther prevaileth with the Chalcideans to abandon and demolish all their towns upon the sea coast and then to remove to Olynthus and fortify that town by a J I INTRODUCTION 43 junction of all their strength And to these people thus abandoning their own homes he made a cession of that part of Mygdonia which lieth round the lake of Bolbe for their subsistence during the war with the Athenians Having thus demolished their own cities they went to another place of residence and were employed in preparations for the war The thirty ships of the Athenians arriving on the coasts of Thrace find Potidea and the other cities already re volted The commanders judging it impossible with their present strength to act against Perdiccas and the revolted cities both turn their course towards Macedonia pursuing the first design of the expedition Landing there they joined in the war with Philip and the brothers of Derdas who with an army had made an irruption from the inland country In the mean time Potidaea being now in revolt and the Athenian fleet on the Macedonian coasts the Corinthians anxious for the security of that place and making the dan ger their own dispatched thither some volunteers of their own people and other Peloponnesians taken into their pay in all sixteen hundred heavy armed and four hundred light armed The command of this body of men was given to Aristeus the son of Adimantus since out of their own private affection to him who had ever been a steady friend to Potidaea most of the volunteers from Corinth had under taken the service  and the time of their arrival in Thrace was the fortieth day after the revolt of Potidaea An express soon arrived at Athens with the news of the revolt of the cities and when afterwards they heard of the  The heavy armed wore a complete suit of armour and engaged with broad shields and long spears They were the flower and strength cf the Grecian armies and had the highest rank of military honour The light armed were designed for skirmishes and fighting at a distance Their weapons were arrows darts or slings The targeteert mentioned often in this history were a middle sort of soldiery armed with targets or narrow shields and spears neither large nor heavy 44 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR arrival of that body under Aristeus they send away two thousand of their heavy armed and forty ships under the command of Callias the son of Calliades and four colleagues to reduce the revolted These arriving first of all in Ma cedonia find the former thousand employed in besieging Pydne having a little before got possession of Therme They sat down with them for a time to carry on the siege of Pydne  but afterwards making with Perdiccas a composi tion and alliance the best the y could in their present exi gency since Potidoea and the arrival of Aristeus were very urgent points they evacuate Macedonia They marched next to Beraea and turning from thence after having first made an unsuccessful attempt upon the place they marched by land towards Potidaea Their army consisted of three thousand heavy armed of their own without including a large body of auxiliaries and six hundred Macedonian horse who had served with Philip and Pausanias  Seventy ships at the same time sailed along the coast And thus by moderate inarches they came up in three days to Gigonus and there encamped The Potideans with the body of Pcloponnesians com manded by Aristeus expecting the Athenians had formed a camp near Olynthus within the isthmus and had a market kept for them without the city The command of the in fantry had been given to Aristeus by the voice of the con federates and that of the cavalry to Perdiccas For now again he had abruptly broke with the Athenians and joined the Potidaeans deputing Iolaus to command in his absence It was the design of Aristeus by encamping the body under his own command within the isthmus to observe the mo tions of the Athenians if they advanced whilst without the isthmus the Chalcideans and allies and two hundred horse belonging to Perdiccas should continue at Olynthus whov when the Athenians came forwards against them were to throw themselves in their rear and thus shut up the enemy between the two bodies But Callias the general of the INTRODUCTION 45 Athenians in concert with his colleagues detaches the Ma cedonian horse and a few of their allies to Olynthus to pre vent any sally from thence  and then breaking up their camp they marched directly for Potidaea But when they were advanced as far as the isthmus and saw their enemies drawn up in order to fight they also formed and in a little time they came to an action The wing under Aristeus Corinthians and the very flower of their strength who en gaged with him soon compelled their enemies to tuna their backs and pursued execution to a great distance but the rest of the army composed of Potidaeans and Peloponne sians were defeated by the Athenians and chased to the very walls of Potidaea Aristeus returning from his pursuit perceived the rout of the rest of the army and knew not whither with the least hazard to retreat whether to Olynthus or Potidaea But at last he determined to embody toge ther those he had about him and as Potidaea lay at the smallest distance to throw himself into it with all possible speed This with difficulty he effected by plunging into the water near the abutments of the pier amidst a shower of missive weapons with the loss indeed of some of his men but the safety of the larger number Those who should have come to succour the Potidaeans from Olynthus which is at no greater distance than sixty stadia and situated in view at the beginning of the battle when the colours were elevatedf advanced indeed a little way as designing to do it and the Macedonian horse drew up against them as designing to stop them But as the vic tory was quickly gained by the Athenians and the colours â About six miles t The elevation of the colours or ensigns was the signal of joining battle and they were kept up during the whole continuance of it The depression of them was a signal to desist or the consequence of a defeat The depres sion of the colours in this mstance was a proof to the Macedonian cavalry that all was over The Athenians in their colours bore an owl as sacred to Minerva the tutelary goddess of Athens See Puffer s Jrcfuro Â gia Or 7 ol ij e 9 Vol I U  48 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR were dropped they retired again within the walls and the Macedonians marched away to the Athenians so that the cavalry of neither side had any share in the action After the battle the Athenians erected a trophy and granted a sus pension of arms to the Potida ans for fetching off their dead There were killed of the Potidaeans and allies very near three hundred and of the Athenians one hundred and fifty with Callias their general The Athenians without loss of time throwing up a work against the wall which faceth the isthmus blockaded the place on that side but the wall towards the Pallene they left as they found it For they thought their number was by no means sufficient to keep the guard within the isthmus and to pass over to the Pallene side and block it up also there They were apprehensive that thus divided the Poti daeans and their allies might fall upon them And the Athe nians at home hearing there was no work on the Pallene side send thither a thousand and six hundred heavy armed of their own people under the Command of Phormio the son of Asopius who arriving upon the Pallene and having landed his men at Aphytls marched forwards to Potidaea advancing slowly and laying waste the country as he moved along And as nobody ventured out to give him opposi tion he also threw up a work against that side of the wall which faceth the Pallene By these methods was Potidaea closely blocked up on either side and also by the ships which lay before it at sea The blockade being thus perfected Aristeus destitute of any means of saving the place unless some relief should ar rive from Peloponnesus or some miracle should happen pro posed it as his advice that  all excepting five hundred men should lay hold of the first favourable wind to quit the place that the provisions might for a longer time support the rest declaring  his own readiness to be one of those who stayed behind Though he could not prevail with them yet willing in this plunge to do what could be done and to man age affairs abroad in the best manner he was able he made INTRODUCTION his escape by sea undiscovered by the Athenian guard Con tinuing now amongst the Chalcideans he made what military efforts he could and killed many of the inhabitants of Ser myle by an ambuscade he formed before that city  and en deavoured to prevail with the Peloponnesiahs to send up a timely relief Phormio also after compleating the works round Potidaea with his sixteen hundred men ravaged Chal cidica and Bottiaea And some fortresses he took by storm THESE were the reciprocal causes of dissension between the Athenians and Peloponnesians The Corinthians were enraged at the blockade of Potidaea a colony of their own in which were shut up both Corinthians and other Peloponne sians The Athenians resented the proceedings qf the Pelo ponnesians in seducing to a revolt a city in alliance with and tributary to them and siding openly by a voluntary expedition with the warring rebels of Potidaea Yet a war open and avowed had not yet broke out between them Hostilities were suspended for a time Hitherto it was merely a private quarrel of the Corinthians But when once the blockade of Potidaea was formed the Corinthians could hold no longer In it their own people were shut up and they were at the same time in anxiety about the place They summoned their allies to repair immediately to Lacedaemon and thither they went themselves with loud ac cusations against the Athenians that  they had violated the treaty and injured Peloponnesus The iEginetae indeed from a dread of the Athenians did not openly dispatch their embassy  but underhand they had a great share in fomenting the war asserting that they were restrained in the privilege of governing themselves which had been allowed them by the treaty The Lacedaemonians summoning to appear before them not barely their allies but whoever had any manner of charge to prefer against the Athenians assembled in grand council as usual and commanded them to speak Others who were present laid open their respective complaints but the Mega  48 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR reans preferred the largest accusations in particular that 44they had been prohibited the use of all the harbours in the  Athenian dominions and the market of Athens contrary  to the treaty The Corinthians were the last who stood forth Having first allowed sufficient time to others to exas perate the Lacedaemonians they preferred their own charge as followeth  THAT faith ye Lacedaemonians which ever both in 4â 4 public conduct and in private life you so punctually observe  renderetl what others what we ourselves may have to say  more difficult to be believed By it you have gained in A deed the reputation of probity but contract a prejudicial ig  norance in regard to remote occurrences For though we  have frequently suggested to you what wrongs we were  apprehensive of receiving from the Athenians yet have you  not deigned to make enquiry into the grounds of those sug  gestions but rather have suspected our ingenuity as speak  ing from selfish views and private resentments And it is  not to prevent our sufferings but now when we already  feel their weight that you convene these confederates to M gether Before whom we ought to be indulged in a larger  share of discourse as we have by much the largest share of  complaints to utter wronged as we have been by the Athe  nians and by you neglected  If indeed by treachery lurking and Unobserved they 44 had violated the peace of Greece those who had not dis  cerned it might justly have demanded explicit proofs But  now what need can there be of multiplying words when  some you already sec enslaved  against others and those  not the meanest of your allies the same fate intended  and  the aggressors fully prepared to receive you if at Length  a war should be declared  With other views they had not 41 clandestinely laid hands on Corcyra and forcibly detained  it from us nor had they dared to block up Potidiea of  which places this latter lieth the most convenient for ex k tending our power in Thrace the forfner could supply Per B I 4y INTRODUCTION  loponnesus with the greatest navy But to your account  these events are to be charged who after the invasion of 44 the Medes first suffered the strength of Athens to be en  creased and afterwards their long rvalln to be erected 44 Ever since you have connived at liberty overthrown not only in whatever communities they have proceeded to en  slave but now where even your own confederates are con 44 cemed For not to the men who rivet on the chains of 44 slavery but to such as though able yet neglect to prevent  it ought the sad event with truth to be imputed  especially  when assuming superior virtue they boast themselves the  deliverers of Greece  With much ado we are now met together in council 44 but not even now upon the plain and obvious points We  ought not to be any longer debating whether we have been  injured but by what measures we should avenge ourselves  The aggressors having long since planned out their pro  ceedings are not about to make but are actually making  attacks upon those who are yet come to no resolution  Nor are we unexperienced by what steps what gradual  advance the Athenians break in upon their neighbours  Imagining themselves to be still undiscovered they shew  themselves the less audacious because you are insensible  But when once they know you alarmed and on your guard  they will press more resolutely forwards For you Lace 44 daemonians are the only people of Greece who sit iudo  lently at ease protecting not with present but with pro 44 mised succour You alone pull down not the commencing  but the redoubled strength of your foes You have indeed 44 enjoyed the reputation of being steady but are indebted  for it more to report than fact We ourselves know that 44 the Persian had advanced from the ends of the earth quite  into Peloponnesus before you exerted your dignity in re  sistance Now also you take no notice of the Athenians  not remote as he was but seated near you  and instead of  Invading them criuse rather te lie upon year defener 50 THE PELOPOKKESIAN WAR  against their invasions  and to expose yourselves more to  the hazards of war against a grown augmented power  And all this while you know that the Barbarian was guilty  of many errors in his conduct And the very Athenians  frequently in their contests with us have been defeated  more through their own blunders than the vigour of your  resistance For their confidence in you hath caused the  destruction of some who upon that very confidence were  taken unprepared  Let no one in this assembly imagine that we speak  more from malice than just grounds of complaint Com  plaint is just towards friends who have failed in their duty   accusation is against enemies guilty of injustice And  surely if ever any people had we have good reason to  think we have ample cause to throw blame upon our  neighbours especially when such great embroilments  have arose of which you seem to have no manner of feel  ing nor ever once to have reflected in regard to the  Athenians with what sort of people how far and how in  every point unlike yourselves you must soon contend  They are a people fond of innovations quick not only to M contrive but to put their schemes in effectual execution  Tour method is to preserve what you already have to  know nothing further and when in action to leave some  thing needful ever unfinished They again are daring be  yond their strength adventurous beyond the bounds of judgment and in extremities full of hope Tour method  is in action to drop below your power never resolutely to  follow the dictates of your judgment and in the pressure  of a calamity to despair of a deliverance Ever active as  they are they stand against you who are habitually indo  lent ever roaming abroad against you who think it misery  to lose sight of your homes Their view in shifting place  is to enlarge their possessions Ton imagine that in foreign  attempts you may lose your present domestic enjoyments  They whtn once they have gained superiority over ene B I INTRODUCTION 51  mies push forward as far as they can go  and if defeated  are dispirited the least of all men More than this they  are as lavish of their lives in the public service as if those  lives were not their own whilst their resolution is ever in  their power ever ready to be exerted in the cause of their  country Whenever in their schemes they meet with dis  appointments they reckon they have lost a share of their  property  When those schemes are successful the acqui  sition secmeth small in comparison with what they have 4 farther in design  If they are baffled in executing a pro  ject invigorated by reviving hope they catch at fresh ex  pedients to repair the damage They are the only people  who instantaneously project and hope and acquire so ex  peditious are they in executing whatever they determine  Thus through toils and dangers they labour forwards so 4 long as life continueth never at leisure to enjoy what they  already have through a constant eagerness to acquire  more They have no other notion of a festival than of a  day whereon some needful point should be accomplished   and inactive rest is more a torment to them than laborious  employment In short if any one abridging their charac  ters should say they are formed by nature never to be at  quiet themselves nor to suffer others to be so he describeth  Mew justly  When such a state hath taken the lists of opposition  against you do ye dally O Lacedaemonians  do you ima  gine that those people will not continue longest in the en  joyment of peace who timely prepare to vindicate them  selves and manifest a settled resolution to do themselves  right whenever they are wronged  You indeed are so far  observers of equity as never to molest others and stand on  your guard merely to repel damage from yourselves â  points you would not without difficulty secure though this  neighbouring state wese governed by the same principles  as you are But now as we have already shewn you your â 1 customs compared with them are quite obsolete  whereas THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  those which progressively improve must like all the works  of art be ever the best Were indeed the continuance of  peace ensured unvarying manners would certainly be pre  ferable  But such people as are liable to frequent vicissi  tudcs of foreign contest have need of great address to vary  and refine their conduct For this cause the manners of  the Athenians improved by a long tract of experience are  formed in respect of yours upon a model entirely new  Here therefore be the period fixed to that slow moving  policy you have hitherto observed Hasten to the relief of  others to that of the Potidaeans as by contract you are  bound Invade Attica without loss of time that you may  not leave your friends and your relations in the mercy of  their most inveterate foes and constrain us through your  sloth to seek redress from a new alliance Such a step  if taken by us could neither scandalize the gods who take  cognizance of solemn oaths nor men who own their ob  ligation For treaties are not violated by those who  left destitute by some have recourse to others but by such  as being sworn to give it withhold their assistance in the  time of need Yet if you are willing and ready to per  form your parts with you we firmly abide In changing  then we should be guilty of impiety and we never shall  find others so nicely suited to the disposition of our own  hearts Upon these points form proper resolutions  and  exert yourselves that the honour of Peloponnesus be not impaired under your guidance who have received from  your ancestors this great pre eminence To this effect the Corinthians spoke And it happenedr that at this very juncture an Athenian embassy was at Lace daemon negotiating some other points who so soon as they were advertised of what had been said judged it proper to demand an audience of the Lacedaemonians It was not their design to make the least reply to the accusations pre ferred against them by the complainant states but in general to convince them that  they ought not to form any sudden B I 53 INTRODUCTION resolutions but to consider matters with sedate deliberation They were further desirous  to represent before them the extensive power of their own state to excite in the minds of the elder a recollection of those points they already knew and to give the younger information in those of which they were ignorant concluding that  such a representation might turn their attention more to pacific measures than military operations Addressing themselves therefore to the Lace daemonians they expressed their desire to speak in the present assembly if leave could be obtained An order of admit tance being immediately sent them they approached and de livered themselves as followeth  IT was not the design of this our embassy to enter into  disputations with your confederates but to negotiate the  points for which our state hath employed us Yet having  been advertised of the great outcry raised against us hither  we have repaired not to throw in our plea against the ac  cusations of the complainant states for you are not the  judges before whom either we or they are bound to plead   but to prevent your forming rash and prejudicial resolu  tions upon concerns of high importance through the in  stigation of these your confederates Our view is farther  to convince you notwithstanding the long comprehensive f charge exhibited against us that we possess with credit  what we have hitherto obtained and that the state of  Athens is deserving of honour and regard  And what need is there here to go back to remote an  tiquity where hearsay tradition must establish those facts  to which the eyes of the audience are utter strangers  This  we shall waive  and call forth first to your review the Per  sian invasions and those incidents of which you are con  scious without regarding that chagrin which the remem  brance of them will constantly excite in you Our achieve  meats there were attended with the utmost danger The  consequence was public benefit of which you received a  substantial share and though the glory of that acquisi Vol I  THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR  tion may not be all our own yet of a beneficial share we  ought not to be deprived This shall boldly be averred  not with a view of soothing you but doing justice to our  selves and giving you to know against what a State if  your resolutions now are not discreetly taken you are going  to engage For we aver that we alone adventured to en  S S he Barbarian in that most dangerous field of Mara  thon And when upon the second invasion we were not  able to make head by land we threw ourselves on ship  board with all our people to fight in conjunction with you  by sea at Salamis  which prevented his sailing along the  coast of Peloponnesus and destroying one by one your  cities unable to succour one another against that formid tfc able fleet The truth of this the Barbarian himself hath  undeniably proved  For thus defeated at sea and unable  to gather together again so large a force he hastily retired  with the greatest part of his army In this so wonderful an  event where beyond dispute the preservation of Greece  was atchieved at sea the three most advantageous instru  ments were contributed by us the largest number of  shipping a person of the greatest abilities to command  and the most intrepid courage For of the number  of ships amounting in all to four hundred very near two  thirds were our own Themistocles was the commander  to whom principally it was owing that the battle was  fought in the straits which was undeniably the means of  that great deliverance  And you yourselves paid him ex  traordinary honour on that very account more than ever â Herodotus relates that after the great victory at Salamis  the Gre  cians sailed to the Isthmus to bestow the prize upon him who had de  served best of Greece by his behaviour in the war But upon their arri  val when commanders gave in their billets on the altar of Neptune in  which they had wrote the name of him who had behaved best and of  htm who was second each of tbem had given the preference to his own  self but most of them agreed in awarding the second place to Themis tocles Thus while each competitor was only honoured with his own â single voice for the first place Themistocles was clearly adjudged to de  serve the second Envy prevented ihe Grecians from proceeding to a  just declaration and they broke up and departed leaving the point un INTRODHCTIOJJ 55  to any stranger who hath appeared amongst you We our  selves shewed further on this occasion the most daring cou  rage since though none before marched up to our succour  and every state already enslaved had opened the road against  us we bravely determined to abandon even Athens to de M stroy our own effects nor like the generality of those who u were yet undemolished to desert the common cause or dis  persing ourselves to become useless to our allies butâ  to embark at once to face the urgent danger without the  least resentment against you for your preceding backward  ness of aid So that we avfer the service we then did you  to be no less than what we afterwards received Forto our  aid indeed at last you came from cities yet inhabited from  cities you ever designed should still be inhabited when once  you were alarmed for your own safety much more than for  ours So long as we were safe your presence was in vain  expected But we launching forth from a city no longer our  own and hazarding our all for a place we almost despaired  of recovering effected our own preservation and with it in  a great measure yours Had we overcome wUhiear gone  over early to the Mede as others did to save our lands  had  we afterwards not dared as men undone beyond recovery  to throw ourselves on board  you never had been obliged  to fight at sea as not having sufficient strength to do it but  decided Themistocles however waa celebrated and honoured as the  man who in prudence far surpassed all the Grecians then alive Thus  denied the honour due to him for having undoubtedly excelled them all  in the affair of Salamis he immediately repaired to Lacedaemon desirous  to have justice done him there The Lacedaemonians received him no  bly and honoured him abundantly They gave indeed to Euribiades the  crown of olive as first in valour but for wisdom and dexterity they be  stowed a second crown of olive on Themistocles They presented him  further with the first chariot in Sparta And after so much applause he  was conducted in his return to the frontier of Tegea by three hundred  picked Spartans who composed the royal guard He was Â 4 e only per  son ever known Ui have received such a compliment from the Spartan1 Herodotus in Urania  56 THE PEiOPONNESIAN TiR  the invader without a struggle would have leisurely deter  mined the fate of Greece  Do we then deserve Lacedaemonians that violence of  envy with which the Grecians behold us for the courage  we manifested then for our judicious resolution and the  superior power we now enjoy  That power superior as it  is was by no means the effect of violent encroachments  You would not abide with us to glean away the relics of  the Barbarian war To us the associated states were  obliged to have recourse and intreat us to lead them to  its completion Thus by the necessary exigence of af  fairs obliged to be in action we have advanced our power  to what it now is  at first from a principle of fear then  from the principle of honour and at length from that of  interest When envied by many when obliged to reduce  to their obedience some who had revolted when you no  longer well disposed towards us were actuated by jealousy  and malice  we thought it not consistent with our own se  curity to endanger our welfare by giving up our power  since every revolt from us was an accession of strength to  you No part of mankind will fix any reproach on men  who try every expedient to ward off extremities of danger  Nay it is your own method also Lacedaemonians to ma  nage the states of Peloponnesus as suits your own interest  best and to prescribe them law And had you abided  with us and persevered in that invidious superiority as we  have done we are well convinced that you would soon have  grown no less odious to your allies  and so obliged either  to have ruled with rigour or to have risked the loss of  your all It followcth therefore that we have done no  thing to raise surprise nothing to disappoint the human  expectation in accepting a superiority voluntarily assured  in firmly maintaining it thus accepted upon those most pre  vailing principles of honour and fear and interest  The maxim by which we have acted was not first  broached by tts since it hath been ever allowed that in B I BTTRODUCTIOW â 57  feriors should be controled by their superiors To be the  latter we thought ourselves deserving You thought so too  till now when private interests engaging your attention  you begin to cry out for justice which no people ever yet  so studiously practised as when able to carry a point by  strength to check their inclination and let it drop And  worthy farther are they of applause who pursuing the  dictates of human nature in gaining rule over others  observe justice more steadily than their scope of power  requireth from them And so far we have reason to con  elude that were our power lodged in other hands plain  evidence would soon decide with what peculiar modera  tion we use it Though so hard indeed is our lot that  calumny and not applause hath been the consequence of  such our lenity In suits of contract against our depend  ents we are often worsted and though ever submitting  to fair and impartial trials in our own courts we are  charged with litigiousness Not one of them reflecteth  that those who are absolute in other places and treat not  their dependents with that moderation which we observe  are for that very reason exempted from reproach For  where lawlÂ ss violence is practised there can be no room 4 for appeals to justice But our dependents accustomed  to contest with us upon equal footing if they suffer never  so little damage where they fancy equity to be along with  them either by a judicial sentence or the decision of  reigning power express no gratitude for the greater share  of property they yet enjoy but resent with higher chagrin 44 the loss of such a pittance than if at first we had set law  aside and seized their all with open violence Even in  this case they could not presume to deny that inferiors  ought to submit to their superiors But mankind it  seemeth resent the acts of injustice more deeply than the  acts of violence Those coming from an equal are look  ed upon as rapines these coming from a superior are n complied with as necessities The far more grievous op  58 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  pressions of the Mede they bore with patience but our  government they look upon as severe  It may be so For  to subjects the present is always grievous If you therefore  by our overthrow should gain the ascendant over them you  would soon perceive that good disposition towards you  which a dread of us hath occasioned to be vanishing away  especially should you exert your superiority according to  the specimens you gave during your short command against  the Mede For the institutions established here amongst  yourselves have no affinity with those of other places and ft more than this not one Spartan amongst you when delega  ted to a foreign charge either knoweth how to apply his 4 own or make use of those of the rest of Greece  Form your resolutions therefore with great deliberation  as on points of no small importance Hearken not so far  to the opinions and calumnies of foreign states as to embroil  your own domestic tranquillity Reflect in time on the  great uncertainty of war before you engage in it Pro  tracted into long continuance it is generally used to end in  calamities from which we are now at an equal distance   and to the lot of which of us they will fall lieth yet to be  determined by the hazardous event Men who run eager  ly to arms are first of all intent on doing some exploits  which ought in point of time to be second to something  more important and when smarting with distress they  have recourse to reason But since we are by no means  guilty of such rashness ourselves nor as yet perceive it in  you we exhort you whilst healing measures are in the elec  tion of us both not to break the treaty not to violate your  oaths but to submit the points in contest to fair arbitration  according to the articles subsisting between us If not we  here invoke the Gods who take cognizance of oaths to bear M us witness that we shall endeavour to revenge ourselves  upon the authors of a war by whatever methods yourselves a shall set us an example These things were said by the Athenian embassy And B I 59 INTRODUCTION when the Lacedaemonians had thus heard the accusations of their allies against the Athenians and what the Athe nians had urged in their turn ordering all parties to with draw they proceeded to serious consultation amongst them selves The majority agreed in the opinion that the Athenians were already guilty of injustice and that a war ought to be immediately declared But Archidamus their king esteemed a man of good understanding and temper standing forth expressed his own sentiments thus  I HAVE learned myself by the experience of many  wars and I see many of you ye Lacedaemonians as great  proficients in years as I am that no one should be fond of  an enterprize because it is new which is a vulgar Weak 44 ness judging it thence both advisable and safe The war  which is at present the subject of your consultation you  will find if examined discreetly to bode a very long con  tinuance Against Peloponnesians it is true and bor M derers upon ourselves we have ever a competent force  in readiness and by expeditious steps con advance against  any of them But against a people whose territories are  far remote who are farther most expert in naval skill who  with all the expedients of war are most excellently pro  vided with wealth both private and public with shipping  with horses with arms and with men far beyond what  any other state in Greece can singly pretend to who more  than this have numerous dependent states upon whom  they levy tributeâ where is the necessity sanguinely to  wish for war against such a people  and wherein is our 44 dependence if thus unprepared we should declare it  against them  Is it on our naval force  But in that we 44 are inferior And if to this we shall apply our care and 44 advance ourselves to an equality with them why this will  be a work of time Or is it on our wealth  In this we  are yet much more deficient and neither have it in any  public fund nor can readily raise it from private purses 44 But the confidence of some may perhaps be buoyed up THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  with our superiority in arms and numbers so that we may  easily march into their territory and lay it waste Yet  other territories and of large extent are subject to their  power and by sea they will import all necessary supplies  If further we tempt their dependents to a revolt we  shall want a naval strength to support them in it as the  majority of them are seated upon islands What therefore  will be the event of this our war  For if we are unable  either to overpower them at sea or divert those revenues  by which their navy is supported we shall only by acting  prejudice ourselves And in such a situation to be forced  to give it up will be a blemish on our honour especially  if we shall be thought to have been the authors of the  breach For let us not be puffed up with idle hope that  this war must soon be over if we can lay their territory  waste  I have reason on better grounds to apprehend that  we shall leave it behind us a legacy to our children It is  by no means consistent with the spirit of Athenians either  to be slaves to their soil or like unpractised soldiers to  shudder at a war Nor again on the other hand am I so  void of sensibility as to advise you to give up your confe  derates to their outrage or wilfully to connive at their en  croachments  but only not yet to have recourse to arms  to send ambassadors to prefer our complaints without be  traying too great an eagerness for war or any tokens of  pusillanimity By pausing thus we may get our own af  fairs in readiness by augmenting our strength through  an accession of allies either Grecian or Barbarian where  soever we can procure supplies of ships or money And  the least room there cannot be for censure when a people  in the state we are at present exposed to all the guiles of the  Athenians endeavour to save themselves not merely by Gre  cian but even by Barbarian aid And at the same time let  us omit no resource within the reach of our own ability  If indeed upon our sending an embassy they will u hearken to reason that will be the happiest for us all If B I INTRODUCTION 61  not after two or three years delay then better provided  we may if it be thought expedient take the field against  them But in good time perhaps when they see our pre  parations and the intent of them clearly explained by our  own declarations they may make each requisite concession  before their territory is destroyed by ravage and whilst  yet they may save their property from utter devastation  Regard their territory I beseech you in no other light than  as a hostage for their good behaviour and the more firm  ly such the better may be its culture Of this we ought to  be sparing as long as possible that we drive them not into  desperate fury and render more impracticable their defeat  For if thus unprovided as we are and worked up to anger  by the instigations of our confederates we at once begin  this ravage reflect whether we shall not taint its reputa  tion and the more embroil Peloponnesus Since accusa  tions as well of states as private persons it is possible to  clear away But in a war begun by general concurrence  for the sake of a single party which it is impossible to see  how far it will extend we cannot at pleasure desist and  preserve our honour  Let no one think it a mark of pusillanimity that many  as we are we do not rush immediately upon one single State  That State has as large a number of dependents who con  tribute to its support And a war is not so much of arms  as of money by which arms are rendered of service  and the more so when a landed power is contending against a  naval Be it therefore our earliest endeavour to provide â amply for this nor let us prematurely be too much fer  mented by the harangues of our allies Let us to whose  account the event whatever it be will be principally charged  Let us with sedate deliberation endeavour in some  degree to foresee it and be not in the least ashamed of  that slow and dilatory temper for which the Corinthians so highly reproach you For through too great precipi  tancy you will come more slowly to an because you Vol I Y  63 TH PELOPONNESIAN WAR  set out without proper preparations The state of which  we are the constituents hath ever been free and most cele  brated by fame And that reproach can at most be nothing  but the inborn sedateness of our minds By this we are  distinguished as the only people who never grow insolent  with success and who never are abject in adversity And  when again they invite us to hazardous attempts by uttering  our praise the delight of hearing must not raise our spirits  above our judgment If any farther endeavour to exas  perate us by a flow of invective we are not by that to be  provoked the sooner to compliance From tempers thus  evenly balanced it is that we are warm in the field of bat  tle and cool in the hours of debate  The former because  a sense of duty hath the greatest influence over a sedate  disposition and magnanimity the keenest sense of shame  And good we are in debate as our education is not polite  enough to teach us a contempt of laws and by its severity  giveth us so much good sense as never to disregard them 4 We are not a people so impertinently wise as to invalidate  the preparations of our enemies by a plausible harangue  and then absurdly proceed to a contest but we reckon the  thoughts of our neighbours to be of a similar cast with our  own and that hazardous contingencies are not to be de  termined by a speech We always presume that the pro jects of our enemies are judiciously planned and then se  riously prepare to defeat them For we ought not to found  our success upon the hope that they will certainly blunder  in their conduct but that we have omitted no proper step  for our own security We ought not to imagine there is so Â mighty a difference between man and man but that he is  the most accomplished who hath been regularly trained  through a course of needful industry and toil  Such is the discipline which our fathers have handed  down to us  and by adhering to it we have reaped consi  derable advantages Let us not forego it now nor in a  small portion of only one day precipitately determine a B I INTRODUCTION 3  point wherein so many lives so vast an expence so many  states and so much honour are at stake But let us more  leisurely proceed which our power will warrant us in doing  more easily than others Dispatch ambassadors to the  Athenians concerning Potidaea dispatch them concerning  the complaints our allies exhibit against them  and the  sooner as they have declared a readiness to submit to fair  decisions Against men who offer this we ought not to  march before they are convicted of injustice But during  this interval get every thing in readiness for war Your  resolutions thus will be most wisely formed and strike into  your enemies the greatest dread Archidamus spoke thus But Sthenelaidas at that time one of the Ephori standing forth the last on this occasion gave his opinion as followeth  THE many words of the Athenians for my part I do  not understand They have been exceeding large in the  praise of themselves but as to the charge against them that  they injure our allies and Peloponnesus they have made no  reply If in truth they were formerly good against the  Medes but are now bad towards us they deserve to be  doubly punished because ceasing to be good they are  grown very bad We continue the same persons both then  and now and shall not if we are wise pass over the injuries  done to our allies nor wait any longer to revenge them since  they are past waiting for their sufferings But other  people forsooth have a great deal of wealth and ships and  horses We too have gallant allies whom we ought not  to betray to the Athenians nor refer them to law and plead  ings since it was not by pleadings they were injured  But  we ought with all expedition and with all our strength to  seek revenge How we ought to deliberate when we have  been wronged let no man pretend to inform me It would  have better become those who designed to commit such  wrongs to have deliberated a long time ago Vote then the  war Lacedaemonians with a spirit becoming Sparta And 64 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  neither suffer the Athenians to grow still greater nor let us  betray our own confederates but with the Gods on our  side march out against these authors of injustice Having spoke thus by virtue of his office as presiding in the college of Ephori he put the question in the Lacedaemo nian council But as they vote by voice and not by ballot he said  he could not amidst the shout distinguish the ma  jority  and being desirous that each of them by plainly declaring his opinion might shew they were more inclined to war he proceeded thus  To whomsoever of you Lace  daemonians the treaty appeareth broke and the Athenians  to be in the wrong let him rise up and go thither point ing out to them a certain place  But whoever is of the con  trary opinion let him go yonder They rose up and were divided  but a great majority was on that side which voted the treaty broke Upon this calling in their confederates they told them  They had come to a resolution that the Athenians were  guilty of injustice  but they were desirous to put it again to  the vote in a general assembly of all their confederates that  by taking their measures in concert they might briskly ply  the war if determined by common consent Matters being brought to this point they departed to their respective homes and the Athenian ambassadors having ended their negotiations staid not long behind This decree of the Lacedaemonian council that  the treaty was broke was passed in the fourteenth year of the treaty eoncluded for thirty years after the conquest of Euboea But the Lacedaemonians voted this treaty broke and a war â The college of Ephori or inspectors at Sparta consisted of five They were annually elected by the people from their own body and were design cd to be checks upon the regal power They never forgot the end of their institution and in fact quite lorded it over the kings In a word the whole administration was lodged in their hands and the kings were never sove reigns but in the field at the head of the troops One of the Ephori had the honour to give its stile to the year in the same manner as the first Archon did at Athens B I 65 INTRODUCTION necessary not so much out of regard to the arguments urged by their allies as from their own jealousy of the growing power of the Athenians They dreaded the advancement of that power as they saw the greatest part of Greece was already in subjection to them Now the method by which the Athenians had advanced their power to this invidious height was this After that the Medes defeated by the Grecians both at land and sea had evacuated Europe and such of them as escaped by sea were utterly ruined at Mycale Leotychides king of the Lacedaemonians who commanded the Grecians at My cale returned home drawing away with him all the confed erates of Peloponnesus But the Athenians with the con federates of Ionia and the Hellespont who were now revolt ed from the King continuing in those parts laid siege to Sestus then held by the Medes  and pressing it during the winter season the Barbarians at length abandoned the place After this they separated sailing away from the Hellespont every people to their own respective countries But the Athenian community when the Barbarians had evacuated their territory immediately brought back again from the places of refuge their wives and children and all their remaining effects and vigorously applied themselves to rebuild the city of Athens and the walls For but a small part of these was left standing  and their houses most of them had been demolished and but few preserved by way of lodgings for the Persian nobles The Lacedaemonians in formed of their design came in embassy to prevent it part ly to gratify themselves as they would behold with pleasure â The series of history on which Thucydides now enters though nul strictly within the compass of his subject yet most needful to give it liglii and to shew how present events are connected with and how far tlicy re sulted from preceding is excellent in its kind He states important facts in the clearest and most orderly manner  he opens before us the source of the Athenian power and by a neat and concise enumeration of notable events conducts it to that height which excited the jealousy nf o l er states and was the true political cause of the Succeeding vs 66 THE PEIOPONHESIAN WAR every city in Greece unwalled like Sparta  but more to gra tify their confederates inviting them to such a step from a jealousy of the naval power of the Athenians now greater than at any time before and of the courage they had so bravely exerted in the war against the Medes They requir ed them to desist from building their walls and rather to join with them in levelling every fortification whatever with out Peloponnesus Their true meaning and their inward jealousy they endeavoured to conceal from the Athenians by the pretence that  then the Barbarian should he again invade them would find no strong hold from whence to as sault them as in the last instance he had done from Thebes alleging farther that  Peloponnesus was a place of secure retreat and certain resource for all To these representa tions of the Lacedaemonians the Athenians by the advice of Themistocles made this reply that  they would send am bassadors to them to debate this afTair and so without far ther explanation dismissed them Themistocles next advis  ed that  he himself might be dispatched forthwith to La ceda mon and by no means hastily to send away the others who were to be joined in the commission with him but to detain them till the walls were carried up to a height neces sary at least for a defence that the work should be expedited by the joint labour of all the inhabitants without exception of themselves their wives and their children sparing neither public nor private edifice from whence any proper materials could be had but demolishing all Having thus advised them and suggested farther what conduct he himself design ed to observe he sets out for Lacedaemon Upon his arrival there he demanded no public audience he protracted mat ters and studied evasions Whenever any person in the public administration demanded the reason why he asked not an audience his answer was that  he waited for the arrival of his colleagues who were detained by urgent business he expected they would speedily be with him and was surpriz ed they are not yet come As they had a good opinion of B I IlJTRODUCTION Themistocles they easily acquiesced in such an answer But other persons afterwards arriving and making clear affirma tion that  the wall is carrying on and already built up to a considerable height they had it no longer in their power to be incredulous Themistocles knowing this exhorts them  not rashly to be biassed by rumours but rather to send away some trusty persons of their own body who from a view might report the truth With this proposal they com ply  and Themistocles sendeth secret instructions to the Athe nians how to behave towards these delegates â to detain them though with as little appearance of design as possible and by no means to dismiss them before they received again their own ambassadors For his colleagues were by this ar rived Abronychus the son of Lysicles and Aristides the son of Lysimachus who brought him an assurance that the wall was sufficiently compleated His fear was that the Lacedae monians when they had discovered the truth would put them under arrest The Athenians therefore detained the delegates according to instruction And Themistocles going to an audience of the Lacedaemonians there openly declared  that Athens was now so far walled as to be strong enough for the defence of its inhabitants  For the future when the Lacedaemonians or confederates sent ambassadors thither they must address themselves to them as to a people who perfectly knew their own interest and the interest of Greece since when they judged it most advisable to abandon their city and go on ship board they asserted their native courage without Lacedaemonian support and in all subsequent mea sures taken in conjunction had shewn themselves not at all inferior in the cabinet or the field At present therefore they judge it most expedient to have Athens defended by a wall and thus to render it a place of greater security for their own members and for all their allies It would not be possible with strength inferior to that of a rival power equally to pre serve and evenly to balance the public welfare of Greeoe â From hence he inferred that  either aH cities of the state 68 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR which formed the Lacedaemonian league should be disman tled or it be allowed that the things now done at Athens were just and proper The Lacedaemonians upon hearing this curbed indeed all appearance of resentment against the Athenians â They had not sent their embassy directly to prohibit but 10 advise them to desist upon motives of gene ral good at that time also they had a great regard for the Athenians because of the public spirit they had shewn against the Mede But however thus baffled as they were in their political views they were inwardly provoked and the ambas sadors on each side returned home without farther embroil ments By this conduct the Athenians in a small space of time walled their city around And the very face of the structure sheweth plainly to this day that it was built in haste The foundations are laid with stones of every kind in some places not hewn so as properly to fit but piled on at random Many pillars also from sepulchral monuments and carved stones were blended promiscuously in the work For the circuit of it was everywhere enlarged beyond the compass of the city and for this reason collecting the materials from every place without distinction they lost no time Themistocles also persuaded them to finish the Piraeus For it was begun before this during that year in which he himself was chief magistrate at Athens He judged the place to be very commodious as formed by nature into three harbours and that the Athenians grown more than ever intent on their marine might render it highly conducive to an enlargement of their power For he was the first person who durst tell them that they ought to grasp at the sovereignty â The number of the Archons or Rulers was nine They were annually elected by lot and were required to be of noble birth of a pure Attic des cent irreproachable both in ir oral and political character dutiful to their parents and perfectly sound in body The first of the nine gave its stile to the year and was therefore called Eponymus or the Namer  The second was stiled King  The third Polemarch  The other six in common Thesmo thettt All the cm and relipious affairs of the state belonged to their de part merit j INTRODUCTION 69 of the sea and immediately began to put the plan in execu tion And by his direction it was that they built the wall round the Piraus of that thickness which is visible to this day For two carts carrying the stone passed along it by one another  Within was neither mortar nor mud  but the entire structure was one pile of large stones hewn square to close their angles exactly and grappled firmly together on the outside with iron and lead  though in height it was not carried up above half so far as he intended He contrived it to be both in height and breadth an impregnable rampart against hostile assaults  and he designed that a few and those the least able of the people might be sufficient to man it whilst the rest should be employed on board the fleet His attention was chiefly confined to a navy  plainly dis cerning in my opinion that the forces of the King had a much easier way to annoy them by sea than by land He thence judged the Piraus to be a place of much greater im portance than the upper city And this piece of advice he frequently gave the Athenians that  if ever they were press ed hard by land they should retire down thither and with their naval force make head against all opponents In this manner the Athenians without losing time after the retreat of the Medes fortified their city and prepared all the neces sary means for their own security Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus was sent out from La cedaemon as commander in chief of the Grecians with twenty sail of ships from Peloponnesus joined by thirty Athenians and a number of other allies They bent their course against Cyprus and reduced most of the towns there From thence they proceeded to Byzantium garrisoned by the Medes and blockaded and carried the place under his directions But being now grown quite turbulent in command the other Grecians especially the Ionians and all who had lately recovered their liberty from the royal yoke were highly cha grined They addressed themselves to the Athenians re Vol I Z 0 TJJE PELOPONJJESIAN WAR questing them  from the tie of consanguinity to undertake their protection and not to leave them thus largely exposed to the violence of Pausanias This request was favourably heard by the Athenians who expressed their willingness to put a stop to such grievances and to re settle the general or der to the best of their power â But during this the Lacedae monians recalled Pausanias that he might answer what was laid to his charge Many of the Grecians had carried to them accusations against him for an unjust abuse of his power since in his behaviour he resembled more a tyrant than a general And it so fell out that he was recalled just at the time when the confederates out of hatred to him had ranged themselves under the Athenian orders excepting those troops which were of Peloponnesus Upon his return to Lacedae mon he was convicted upon trial of misdemeanors towards particulars but of the heaviest part of the charge he is ac quitted  For the principal accusation against him was an at tachment to the Medish interest and it might be judged too clear to stand in need of proof Him therefore they no longer intrust with the public command but appoint in his stead Dorcis with some colleagues to command what little force of their own remained To these the confederates would no longer yield the supreme command which so soon as they perceived they returned home And here the Lacedaemoni ans desisted from commissioning any others to take upon them that post fearing lest those who should be sent might by their behaviour still more prejudice the Lacedaemonian in terest a case they had reason to dread from the behaviour of Pausanias They were now grown desirous to rid them selves of the Medish war they acknowledged the Athenians had good pretensions to enjoy the command and at that time were well affected towards them The Athenians having in this manner obtained the su preme command by the voluntary tender of the whole con federacy in consequence of their aversion to Pausanias  they F xed by their own authority the quotas whether of ships or B I INTRODUCTION Tl money which each state was to furnish against the Barbarian The colour pretended was  to revenge the calamities they had hitherto suffered by carrying hostilities into the domin ions of the King This gave its first rise to the Athenian office of General Receivers of Greece whose business it was to collect this tribute  For the contribution of this money was called by that title The first tribute levied in conse quence of this amounted to foiir hundred and sixty talents Delos was appointed to be their treasury and the sittings were held in the temple there Their command was thus at first over free and independ ent confederates who sat with them at council and had a vote jn public resolutions The enlargement of their authority was the result of wars and their own political management during the interval between the invasion of the Medes and the present war when the contests were against the Barbari an or their own allies endeavouring at a change or those of the Peloponnesians who interfered on every occasion on pur pose to molest them Of these I have subjoined a particular detail and have ventured a digression from my subject be cause this piece of history hath been omitted by all preceding writers They have either confined their accounts to the affairs of Greece prior in time or to the invasions of the Medes Hellanicus is the only one of them who hath touch ed it in his Attic history  though his memorials are short and not accurately distinguished by proper dates But this at the same time will most clearly shew the method in which the Athenian empire was erected  This nice and difficult point was adjusted by Aristides to the general satisfaction of all parties concerned Greece conferred upon him this most important trust he was called to this delicate commission by the united voice of his country   Poor says Plutarch when he set about it but poorer when he had finished it The Athenian state was now furnished with a large annual fund by which it was enabled not only to annoy the foreign enemies of Greece but even those Greeks who should at any time presume to oppose the measures of Athens They soon found out that their own city was a more convenient place for keeping this treasure than â he isle of Delos and accordingly took care to remove it thither THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR In the first place under the command of Cimon son of Miltiades they laid siege to Eion a town upon the Strymoii possessed by the Medes which they carried and sold all found within it for slaves They afterwards did the same by Scyros an island in the iEgean sea inhabited by the Dolopes and placed in it a colony of their own people They had far ther a war with the Carysthians singly in which the rest of the Euboeans were unconcerned who at length submitted to them upon terms â After this they made war upon the Nax ians who had revolted and reduced them by a siege This was the first confederate state which was enslaved to gratify their aspiring ambition  though afterwards all the rest as op portunity occurred had the same fate The occasions of such revolts were various  though the principal were deficiencies in their quotas of tribute and shipping and refusals of common service For the Athe nians exerted their authority with exactness and rigour and laid heavy loads upon men who had neither been accus tomed nor were willing to bear oppression Their me thod of command was soon perverted they no longer cared to make it agreeable and in general service disal lowed an equality as it was now more than ever in their power to force revolters to submission But these points the confederates had highly facilitated by their own proceed ings For through a reluctancy of mingling in frequent expeditions a majority of them to redeem their personal attendance were rated at certain sums of money equivalent to the expence of the ships they ought to have furnished â Cimon was a great general a worthy patriot brave open and ingeni ous upright in his political conduct like Aristides and though an able po litician yet not so mischievously refined as to discard honesty and sincerity from public measures His father Miltiades after performing most signal services to his country was heavily fined thrown into prison because una ble to pay and there ended his days Cimon afterwards paid the fine is now going also to perform great services to the state is afterwards banished but recalled and again employed in foreign commands dying at last in the service of his country highly regretted not only at Athens but throughout Greece R I 73 INTRODUCTION The sums paid on these occasions to the Athenians were em ployed by them to increase their own naval force and the tributaries thus drained whenever they presumed to revolt had parted with the needful expedients of war and were without resource After these things it happened that the Athenians and their confederates fought against the Medes both by land and sea at the river Eurymedon in Pamphylia Cimon the son of Miltiades commanded and the Athenians were victo rious the very same day in both elements They took and destroyed the ships of the Phoenicians in the whole about two hundred Later in time than this happened a revolt of the Thasians arising from disputes about places of trade on the opposite coasts of Thrace and the mines which they possessed there The Athenians with a sufficient force sailed against Thasus and after gaining a victory by sea landed upon the island â About the same time they had sent a colony consisting of about ten thousand of their own and confederate people towards the Strymon who were to settle in a place called the Nine ways but now Amphipolis They became mas ters of the Nine ways by dispossessing the Edonians But advancing farther into the midland parts of Thrace they were all cut off at Drabescus of Edonia by the united force of the Thracians who were all enemies to this new set tlement now forming at the Nine ways â But the Tha sians defeated in a battle and besieged implored the suc cour of the Lacedaemonians and exhorted them to make a diversion in their favour by breaking into Attica This they promised unknown to the Athenians and were intent on the performance but were prevented by the shock of an earthquake The Helots farther had seized this opportu â Helots was the name given in general to the slaves of the I acedamo niani The first of the kind were the inhabitants of Helos in Messenia who were conquered and enslaved by the Lacedaemonians and all their slaves in succeeding times had the same denomination The tillage of the ground the exercise of trades all manual labour and every kind of drudge ry was thrown upon them They were always treated by their Spartan 74 THE PELOPONMESIAN WAR nity in concert with the neighbouring Thuriafce and Ethe ans to revolt and seize Ithome Most of the Helots were descendants of the ancient Messenians then reduced to slavery and on this account all of them in general were called Messenians This war against the revolters in Ithome gave full employ to the Lacedaemonians And the Thasians after holding out three years blockade were forced to surren der upon terms to the Athenians â They were  to level their walls to give up their shipping to pay the whole arrear of their tribute to advance it punctually for the future and to quit all pretensions to the continent and the mines The Lacedaemonians as their war against the rebels in Ithome ran out into a length of time demanded the assist ance of their allies and amongst others of the Athenians No small number of these were sent to their aid under the command of Cimon The demand of assistance from them was principally owing to the reputation they then were in for their superior skill in the methods of approaching and at tacking walls The long continuance of the siege convinced them of the necessity of such methods though they would fain have taken it by storm The first open enmity between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians broke out from this expe dition For the Lacedaemonians when the place could not be carried by storm growing jealous of the daring and in novating temper of the Athenians and regarding them as aliens lest by a longer stay they might be tampering with masters with great severity and often with the utmost barbarity at their caprice or sometimes for reasons of state they were wantonly put to death or inhumanly butchered There is a remarkable instance of the latter in the fourth book of this history According to Plutarch it was a common saying in Greece That a freeman at Sparta was the freest and a slave the greatest slave in the world â Tims miserably oppressed no wonder they seized an opportunity of revolt The earthquake here mentioned was so violent that according to Plutarch it demolished all the houses in Sparta except five The Helots rose at once effectually to demolish those Spar tans too who were not buried in the ruins But Archidumus had already by way of precaution sounded an alarm and got them together in a body The Helots thus prevented marched off and seized Ithome where they made a long and obstinate resistance B I INTRODUCTION 75 the rebels in Ithome and so raise them fresh embarrassments give a dismission to them alone of their allies They strove indeed to conceal their suspicions by alleging  they have no longer any need of their assistance The Athenians were convinced that their dismission was not owing to this more plausible colour but to some latent jealousy They reckoned themselves aggrieved and thinking they had merited better usage from the hands of the Lacedaemonians were scarcely withdrawn than in open disregard to the league subsisting between them against the Mede  they clapped up an alliance with their old enemies the Argives And in the same oaths and same alliance the Thessalians also were comprehended with them both The rebels in Ithome in the tenth year of the siege un able to hold out any longer surrendered to the Lacedemo nians on the following conditionsâ that  a term of security be allowed them to quit Peloponnesus into which they shall never return again that if any one of them be ever found there he should be made the slave of whoever apprehended him The Pythian oracle had already warned the Lacedae monians  to let go the suppliants of Jupiter Ithometes The men therefore with their wives and children went out of Ithome and gained a reception from the Athenians who acted now in enmity to the Lacedaemonians and assigned them Naupactus for thÂ ir residence which they had lately taken from the Locrians of Ozoli The Megareans also deserted the Lacedaemonians and went over to the Athenian alliance because the Corinthians had warred upon them in pursuance of a dispute about settling their frontier Megara and Pegae were put into the hands of the Athenians who built up for the Megareans the long fva lf that reach down from Megara to Nisa a and took their guard upon themselves This was by no means the least occasion of that violent enmity now beginning to arise between the Corinthians and Athenians Inarus the son of Psammetichus a Libyan and king of 76 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR the Libyans bordering upon Egypt taking his route from Maraea a city beyond the Pharos had seduced the greatest part of Egypt into a revolt from king Artaxerxes He him self was constituted their leader and he brought over the Athenians to associate in the enterprize They happened at that time to be employed in an expedition against Cyprus with a fleet of two hundred ships of their own and their allies But relinquishing Cyprus they went upon this new design Being arrived on that coast and sailed up the Nile they were masters of that river and two thirds of the city of Memphis and were making their attack upon the remaining part which is called the White wall It was defended by the Persians and Medes who had resorted thither for refuge and by those Egyptians who had stood out in the general de fection â The Athenians further having made a descent at Haliae a battle ensued against the Corinthians and Epidaurians in which the victory was on the Corinthian side â And after wards the Athenians engaged at sea near Cecryphelea with a fleet of Peloponnesians and compleatly gained the victory â A war also breaking out after this between the iEginetae and Athenians a great battle was fought at sea by these two contending parties near iEgina Both sides were joined by their respective confederates  but the victory remained with the Athenians who having taken seventy of their ships landed upon their territory and laid siege to the city under the command of Leocrates the son of Stroebus The Pelo ponnesians then desirous to relieve the iEginetae transported over to Egina three hundred heavy armed who before were auxiliaries to the Corinthians and Epidaurians In the next place they secured the promontory of Geranea The Co rinthians now with their allies made an incursion into the district of Megara judging it impossible for the Athenians to march to the relief of the Megareans as they had so large a force already abroad in iEgina and in Egypt or if they Were intent on giving them relief they must of necessity B I  INTRODUCTION 77 raise their siege from iEgina The Athenians however re called not their army from iEgina but marched away all the old and young that were left in Athens to the aid of Megara under the command of Myronides And having fought a drawn battle against the Corinthians both sides retired and both sides looked upon themselves as not worsted in the action The Athenians however upon the departure of the Corinthians as being at least so far victorious erected a tro phy The Corinthians at their return heard nothing but re proaches from the seniors in Corinth so after bestowing an interval of about twelve days to recruit they came back again and to lay their claim also to the victory set about erecting a trophy of opposition Upon this the Athenians sallying with a shout out of Megara put those who were busy in erecting this trophy to the sword and routed all who endea voured to oppose them The vanquished Corinthians were forced to fly and no small part of their number being closely pursued and driven from any certain route were chased into the ground of a private person which happened to be encom passed with a ditch so deep as to be quite impassable and there was no getting out The Athenians perceiving this drew up all their heavy armed to front them and then form ing their light armed in a circle round them stoned every man of them to death This was a calamitous event to the Corinthians But the bulk of their force got home safe again from this unhappy expedition About this time also the Athenians began to build the long walls reaching down to the sea both towards the Pha lerus and towards the Piraus The Phocians were now embroiled with the Dorians from whom the Lacedaemonians are descended Having made some attempts on Boeon and Cytinium and Erineus and taken one of those places the Lacedaemonians marched out to succour the Dorians with fifteen hundred heavy armed of their natives and ten thousand of their allies

surrender upon terms the town they had taken were preparing for their return Now in case they attempted it by passing over the sea in the gulf of Crissa the Athenians having got round with a squadron were ready to obstruct it Nor did they judge it safe to at tempt it by way of Geranea as Megara and Pegai were in the hands of the Athenians  for the pass of Geranea is ever difficult and now was constantly guarded by the Athenians  and should they venture this route they perceived that the Athenians were there also ready to intercept them They de termined at last to halt for a time in Boeotia and watch for an opportunity to march away unmolested Some citizens of Athens were now clandestinely practising with them to obtain their concurrence in putting a stop to the democracy and the building of the long walls But the whole body of the Athenian people rushed out into the field against them with a thousand Argives and the respective quotas of their allies in the whole amounting to fourteen thousand They judged them quite at a loss about the means of a retreat and the design also to overthrow their popular government began to be suspected Some Thessalian horsemen came also up to join the Athenians in pursuance of treaty who afterwards in the heat of action revolted to the Lacedaemonians They fought at Tanagra of Boeotia and the victory rested with the Lacedaemonians and allies but the slaughter was great on both sides The Lacedaemonians afterwards took their route through the district of Megara and having cut down the woods returned to their own home through Geranea and the Isthmus On the sixty second day after the battle of Tanagra the Athenians had taken the field against the Boeotians under the command of Myronides They engaged them and â Plutarch in his Apothegm relates that when Myronides was putting himself at the head of the Athenians on this occasion his officers told him  they were not all come out yet into the field he replied briskly  All are

Tanagra They took from the Lo crians of Opus one hundred of their richest persons for hos tages  and had now completed their own long walls at Athens Soon after the iEginete surrendered to the Athenians upon terms â They  demolished their fortifications gave up their shipping and submitted to pay an annual tribute for the future The Athenians farther in a cruize infested the coast of Peloponnesus under the command of Tolmidas the son of Tolmaeus They burnt a dock of the Lacedaemonians took Chalcis a city belonging to the Corinthians and landing their men engaged with and defeated the Sicyonians During all this interval the army of the Athenians and allies continued in Egypt amidst various incidents and events of war At first the Athenians had the better of it in Egypt Upon this the king dispatched to Lacedaemon Megabazus a Persian noble furnished with great sums of money in order to prevail upon the Lacedaemonians to make an incursion into Attica and force the Athenians to recal their troops from Egypt When Megabazus could not prevail and some money had been spent to no manner of purpose he carried back what was yet unexpended with him into Asia He then send â This battle is represented by some as more glorious to the Athenians than even those of Marathon or Plataea In the latter they fought accom panied by their allies against Barbarians  but here with their

Grecians out of Memphis  and at last shut them up in the isle of Prosopis Here he kept them blocked up for a a year and six months  till having drained the channel by turning the water into a different course he stranded all their ships and rendered the island almost continent He then marched his troops across and took the place by a land assault And thus a war which had employed the Grecians for six continued years ended in their destruction Few only of the numbers sent thither by taking the route of Libya got safe away to Cyrene  the far greater part were entirely cut off Egypt was now again reduced to the obedience of the king Amyrteus alone held out who reigned in the fenny parts The large extent of the fens prevented his reduction and besides the Egyptians of the fens are the most remarkable of all for military valour Inarus king of the Libyans the au thor of all these commotions in Egypt was betrayed by treachery and fastened to a cross Beside this fifty triremes from Athens and the rest of the alliance arriving upon the coast of Egypt to relieve the former were come up to Me dasium a mouth of the Nile quite ignorant of their fate These some forces assaulted from the land whilst a squadron of Phoenicians attacked them by sea Many of the vessels were by this means destroyed hut some few had the good for tune to get away And thus the great expedition of the Athe nians and allies into Egypt was brought to a conclusion But farther Orestes son of Echecratidas king of the Thessalians being driven from Thessaly persuaded the Athenians to undertake his restoration The Athenians in conjunction with the Boeotians and Phocians now their allies marched up to Pharsalus of Thessaly They became mas ters of the adjacent country so far as they could be whilst keeping in a body for the Thessalian cavalry prevented any detachments They took not that city neither carried any B I INTRODUCTION 81 one point intended by the expedition but were obliged to withdraw and carry Orestes back again with them totally unsuccessful Not long after this a thousand Athenians going on board their ships which lay at Pegae for Pegae was now in their possession steered away against Sicyon under the command of Pericles the son of Xantippus They made a descent and in a battle defeated those of the Sicyonians who endea voured to make head against them From thence they strengthened themselves by taking in some Achaeans and stretching across the gulph landed in a district of Acarnania and laid siege to Oenias  yet unable to carry it they soon quitted and withdrew to their own homes Three years after this a peace to continue for five years was clapped up between the Peloponnesians and Athenians Upon this the Athenians now at leisure from any war in Greece engaged in an expedition against Cyprus with a fleet of two hundred ships of their own and allies commanded by Cimon Sixty of these were afterwards detached to Egypt at the request of Amyrtaeus king of the fenny part but the rest of them blocked up Citium Yet by the death of Cimon and a violent famine they were compelled to quit the blockade of â Here the name of Pericles first occurs and a hint should be given to those who are not well acquainted with him to mark a person that was a true patriot a consummate statesman a great general and a most sublime speaker He was born of one of the most illustrious families in Athens He was educated in the best manner and learned his philosophy or the knowledge of nature from Anaxagoras whose doctrines agreed so little with the superstitious practices and tempers of the Athenians that the mas ter and all his disciples were charged with atheism for which many of them were prosecuted and the divine Socrates most injuriously put to death He angaged early in public affairs gained the ascendant over aU bis competitors became at length and continued to his death master of the affections and liberties too of the Athenian people and though master yet guardian and increaser of the latter In short according to writer of the best authority and the gravest historians he was one of the most able and most disinterested ministers that Athens ever had Athens the most demo cratical state that ever existed so fertile in every thing great and glorious and so over run at the same time with faction licentiousness and wild tu multuary caprice 82 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Citium And being come up to the height of Salamis in Cy prus they engaged at one time a united force of Phoenicians and Cyprians and Cilicians both by land and sea They gained the victory in both engagements and being rejoined by the detachment they had sent to Egypt returned home After this the Lacedaemonians engaged in that which is known by the name of the holy war and having recovered the temple of Delphi delivered it up to the Delphians But no sooner were they withdrawn than the Athenians marched out in their turn retook it and delivered it into the hands of the Phocians At no great interval of time from hence the Athenians took the field against the Boeotian exiles who had seized Or chomenus and Chaeronaea and some other cities of Boeotia Their force sent out upon this service consisted of a thou sand heavy armed of their own with proportional quotas from their allies and was commanded by Tolmidas the son of Tol maeus Having taken and enslaved Chaeronaea they placed a fresh garrison in it and so withdrew But upon their march they are attacked at Coronea by a body of men con sisting of the Boeotian exiles sallying out of Orchomenus join ed by Locrians and the exiles from Euboea and others of their partizans After a battle the victory remained with the lat ter who made great slaughter of the Athenians and took many prisoners Upon this the Athenians evacuated Boeotia and to get the prisoners released consented to a peace The Boeotian exiles and all others in the same circumstances were by this re settled in their old habitations and recovered their former liberty and rights It was not a great while after these last occurrences that Euboea revolted from the Athenians And Pericles was no sooner landed upon that island with an Athenian army to chastise them than news was brought him that  Megara also had revolted  that the Peloponnesians were going to make an incursion into Attica that the Athenian garrison had been put to the sword by the Megareans excepting those who â This revolt of Megara a little republic almost surrounded by the do minions of Atbens leagued closely with her and under her protection gave B I INTRODUCTION 83 had thrown themselves into Nisaea  and that the Megareans had effected this revolt by a junction of Corinthians and Sicy onians and Epidaurians Upon hearing this Pericles re embarked with the utmost expedition and brought back his army from Euboea And soon after the Peloponnesians march ing into Attica as far as Eleusis and Thria laid the country waste under the command of Pleistionax the son of Pausa nias king of Sparta And then without extending the ravage any farther they withdrew to their own homes Now again the Athenians transported a military force into Euboea under the command of Pericles and soon completed its reduction The tranquillity of the rest of the island was re established upon certain conditions  but they wholly ejected all the inha bitants of Hestiaea and repeopled it with a colony of their own â And not long after their return from Euboea they concluded a peace for thirty years with the Lacedaemonians and their al lies in pursuance of which they restored them Nisaea and Chal cis and Pegae and Traezene all which places though belonging to the Peloponnesians were in the hands of the Athenians In the sixth year of this peacef a war broke out between rise to that decree which excluded the Megareans from the ports and mar kets of Athens Others add that they slew an Athenian herald who was sent to expostulate with them on this account Could such outrages be pocketed by Athenians  Could Pericles dissuade the people of Athens from shewing resentment  They decreed farther though not explicitly mentioned by Thucydides that the generals of the state should swear at their election to make an incursion twice a year into the Megaris We shall soon see that the Peloponnesians made it a pretext for the ensuing war and that Pericles justified the decree and persuaded the Athenians to hazard a war rather than repeal it This is the true history of the point though comedy and raillery and libelling strangely vary tho account â As Pleistionax on this occasion evacuated Attica on a sudden he was banished from Sparta as having been bribed by the Athenians to quit their territory Diodorus Siculus relates that he did it by the advice of Clean dridas his guardian who attended him in the field on account of his youth  and that Pericles afterwards passing his accounts at Athens charged  ten talents properly laid out for the service of the state which passed without farther explanation or exception t Pericles here performed a great and signal service to his country The motives to this war are according to our historian sufficiently strong upon 84 THK PKLOPONNESIAN WAR the Samians and Milesians about Priene The Milesians having the worst in the dispute had recourse to the Athenians to whom they bitterly exclaimed against the Samians Nay even some private citizens of Samos joined with them in this outery whose scheme it was to work a change in the govern ment The Athenians therefore putting to sea with a fleet of forty sail landed upon Samos where they set up a democracy and exacted from them fifty boys and as many grown men for hostages whom theydeposited at Lemnos Theyhad farther at their departure left a garrison behind to secure that island But a body of Samians who would not submit to the new form of government and therefore had refuged themselves upon the continent having gained the correspondence of the most powerful persons abiding in Samos and the alliance of Pissuthncs son of Hystaspes at that time governor at Sardis the scheme nowcarrying on by Pericle9 to extend the sovereignty or Athens by sea Yet the comic poets and writers of memoirs and private history give another account of the affair which it is surprising to find the authors of the Universal History inclined to think as welt founded as what is given by Thucydides that  Pericles engaged the republic in this war merely to gratify the resentment of Aspasia who was a native of Miletus against the Samians As this Aspasia had all the honour of Pericles s merit im puted to herself and he hath suffered a weight of reproach in her behalf the reader will accept a short account of this famous lady She is allowed on all hands to have been a woman of the greatest beauty and the first ge nius  but averred by some to have been a libertine a prostitute a bawd nay every thing scandalous and vile Pericles was doatingly fond of her and got divorced from a wife whom he did not love to marry her She taught him it is said his refined maxims of policy his lofty imperial elo quence  nay even composed the speeches on which so great a share of his reputation was founded The best men in Athens frequented her house and brought their wives to receive lessons from her of economy and right deportment Socrates himself was her pupil in eloquence and gives her the honour of that funeral oration which he delivers in the Menexenus of Plato There must have been some ground even for complimenting her in this extraordinary manner And after every abatement what must we think of a lady who was in such high esteem with the greatest men that ever lived at Athens who taught force to orators grace to philosophers and conduct to ministers of state  in a word who had Pericles for her lover and Socrates for her encomiast  See Bayle s Dictionary under Peri cles and Universal History

of them into their pow er  In the next place they conveyed away the hostages from Lemnos by stealth  they openly declared a revolt  and deli vered up the Athenian garrison with their officers whom they had seized to Pissuthnes and then immediately prepared to renew their war against Miletus The Byzantines farther joined with them in the revolt No sooner were the Athenians informed of this than they put out against Samos with sixty sail though sixteen of them were detached for other services Some of the latter were stationed upon the coast of Caria to observe the motions of a Phoenician fleet and the rest were ordered to Chios and Â Lesbos to give there a summons of aid The remaining forty four commanded by Pericles and nine colleagues en gaged near the isle of Tragia with the Samian fleet consist ing of seventy sail twenty of which had land soldiers on board and the whole was now on the return from Miletus  and here the Athenians gained a signal victory Afterwards forty sail arrived from Athens to reinforce them and twenty five from the Chians and the Lesbians With this accession â The Athenians in the assembly of the people chose ten generals every year according to the number of their tribes They were sometimes as in the present instance all sent out in the same employ They rolled and each in his turn was gentral of the day Thucydides seldom gives more than the name of one whom we may conclude to have been the person of the greatest weight and influence amongst them in fact a general in chief Philip of Macedon was used to joke upon this multiplicity of generals  For my part said he I have never had the good fortune to find more than one general in my life  and yet the Athenians find ten fresh ones every year Not but that these generals were often re elected and con tinned years in commission Pericles it is plain did so  and in latter times Phocion is said to have been elected five and forty times Their power was great not only in the field but at Athens

Pericles drawing off sixty of the ships from this ser vice steered away with all possible expedition towards Cau nus and Caria upon receiving advice that  a Phoenician  fleet is coming up against them Stesagoras also and others had before been sent from Samos with five ships to meet that fleet In this interval the Samians launched out in a sudden sally fell upon the unfortified station of the Athenians sunk the vessels moored at a distance by way of guard and engaging those who put out against them victo riously executed their purpose were masters of their own sea for fourteen days

under Thu cydides and Agnon and Phormio and twenty under Tlepo lemus and Anticles beside thirty others from Chios and Lesbos And though after this the Samians ventured a short engagement at sea yet they now found all farther resistance impracticable so that in the ninth month of the siege they surrendered on the following termsâ To demolish their walls  to give hostages  to deliver up their

the engage ment of being held only to such obedience as had formerly been required of them Not many years intervened between this period of time and the rise of those differences above recited concerning Corcyra and Potidaea and all occurrences whatever on which the pretences of this Peloponnesian war were ground ed All these transactions in general whether of Grecians against Grecians or against the Barbarian fell out in the compass of fifty years between the retreat of Xerxes and the commencement of this present war during which period the Athenians had established their dominion on a solid ba sis and had rose to a high exaltation of power The Lace daemonians were sensible of it yet never opposed them ex cept by some transient efforts  and for the most part of the time were quite easy and indifferent about it That people had never been known in a hurry to run to arms Their wars were indispensably necessary and sometimes they were entangled in domestic broils Thus they looked on with indolent unconcern till the Athenian power was manifest ly established and encroachments were made upon their own alliance Then indeed they determined to be no longer patient They resolved upon a war in which their utmost force should be exerted and the Athenian power if possible demolished ON these motives was formed the public resolution of the Lacedaemoniansâ That  the treaty was

confederates to at tend and designed to put it to a general ballot  Whether  the war should be undertaken  The ambassadors from die several constituents of their alliance arrived and as sembled in one general council Others made what decla rations they pleased the majority inveighing against the Athenians and insisting upon war But the Corinthians who had beforehand requested every state apart to ballot for war alarmed for Potidaea lest for want of some speedy relief it might be utterly destroyed being present also at this council stood forth the last of all and spoke to this effect  WE can no longer ye confederates have any room to  complain of the Lacedemonians since their own resolu  tion is already engaged for war and they have summoned  us hither to give our concurrence For it is the duty of a governing and leading state as in private concerns they  observe the equitable conduct so ever to keep their view  intent upon the general welfare suitably to that superior  degree of honour and regard which in many points they  pre eminently receive  For our parts so many of us as have quitted Athe  nian friendship for this better association we require no  farther trials to awaken our apprehensions But those amongst us who are seated up in the inland parts at a  distance from the coast should now be convinced that  unless they combine in the defence of such as are in lower  situations they would soon be obstructed in carrying out  the fruits of their lands and again in fetching in those  necessary supplies which the sea bestoweth upon an inland  country Let them by no means judge erroneously of  what we urge as not in the least affecting them  but look  ing upon it as a certainty that if they abandon the guard B I 89  of the maritime situations the danger will soon advance  quite up to them and they of course no less than we are  concerned in the issue of our present determinations For  this reason they ought without the least hesitation to make  the timely exchange of peace for war  It is indeed the duty of the prudent so long as they  are not injured to be fond of peace But it is the duty of the  brave when injured to throw up peace and to have recourse  to arms and when in these successful to lay them down  again in peaceful composition  thus never to be elevated  above measure by military success nor delighted with the  sweets of peace to suffer insults For he who apprehensive  of losing this delight sits indolently at ease will soon be de 44 prived of the enjoyment of that delight which interesteth  his fears and he whose passions are inflamed by military  success elevated too high by a treacherous confidence hears no longer the dictates of his judgment Many are  the schemes which though unadvisedly planned through  the more unreasonable conduct of an enemy turn out success  ful But yet more numerous are those which though seem  ingly founded on mature counsel draw after them a dis  graceful and opposite event This proceeds from that great  inequality of spirit with which an exploit is projected and  with which it is put into actual execution For in council  we resolve surrounded with security  in execution we faint  through the prevalence of fear  We now having been grossly injured and in abundant  instances aggrieved are taking up arms and when we have  avenged ourselves on the Athenians shall at a proper time lay  them down again Success upon many considerations we  may promise ourselves In the first place as we are superior  in numbers and military skill In ihe next as we all advance  with uniformity to accomplish our designs A naval force  equal to that in which their strength consists we shall be en  ablcd to equip from competent stores we separately possess  and the funds laid up at Delphi and Olympia If we take â In the temple of Apollo at Delphi and that of Jupiter at Olympia  90 THE PElOPONNESIAtt WAR  up those upon interest for immediate service we are able by  enlarging their pay to draw away all the foreigners who man  their fleets The Athenian power is not supported by a natu  ral but a purchased strength And our own is less liable to  be injured by the same method as we are strong in our per  sons more than in our wealth Should we gain the victory  but in one single engagement at sea in all probability we have  done their business  or in case they continue the struggle  we shall then have a longer space to improve our naval  practice And when once we have gained an equality of u skill our natural courage will soon secure us the triumph  For that valiant spirit which we enjoy by nature it is im  possible for them to acquire by rules  But that superiority  with which at present their skill invests them we may  easily learn to overmatch by practice  Those sums of money by which these points are chiefly  to be compassed we will respectively contribute For  would it not in reality be a grievous case when their de  pendents are never backward to send in those sums which  rivet slavery on themselves if we who want to be revenged  on our foes and at the same time to secure ourownpre  servationâ if we should refuse to submit to expences and  should store up our wealth to be plundered by them to  purchase oppressions and miseries for ourselves   We have other expedients within our reach to support  this war a revolt of their dependents and in conse  quence of that a diminution of their revenue the essence of  their strength erectingforts within their territory and many  others not yet to be foreseen For war by no means yields to  the direction of a pre determined plan but of itself in  every present exigence confines and methodizeth its own  course In war who moves along with a temper in proper  command hath got the firmest support But he who hath  lost his temper is for that reason more liable to miscarry The wealth reposited in these places must have been very large consider ing the great veneration universally paid these deities and the numerous ami valuable offerings sent annually to these famous temples B I INTRODUCTION SI  Let us nemember that if any one single state amongst  us had a contest with its foes about a frontier there would  be need of perseverance But now the Athenians are a  match for us all united and quite too strong for any of us  separately to resist So that unless we support one another  with our collective forces unless every nation and every  state unanimously combine to give a check to their ambi  tion they will oppress us apart and disunited without a  a struggle Such a triumph how grating soever the bare  mention of it may be to any of your ears yet be it known  can end in nothing else but plain and open slavery To  hint in mere words so base a doubt that so many stateu  may be enslaved by one is disgrace to Peloponnesus In  such a plunge we should either be thought justly to have  deserved it or through cowardice to suffer it the degenerate  offspring of those ancestors who were the deliverers of  Greece And yet we have not spirit enough remaining to  defend our own liberty We suffer one single state to  erect itself into a tyrant whilst we claim the glory of  pulling down monarchs in particular societies We know  not by what methods to extricate ourselves from these  three the greatest of calamities from folly or cowardice  or sloth For exempt from these in fact you are not by  taking up the plea of contempt of your enemies for which such numbers have suffered The many misfortune  arising from this have changed the sense of the word and  caused it to stand for arrant folly  But on the past what necessity is there to enlarge  or to  blame any farther than may be necessary for the present  4 To prevent worse events for the future we ought by im â 4 mediate efforts with toil and perseverance to seek for re  dress Through toil to acquire virtues is hereditary to Pe  loponnesians This custom is not to be dropped though  now in wealth and power you have made some petty ad  vancements  For it never can become you to let go in af  fluence what was gained in want It becomes you rather 44 upon many accounts with manly confidence to declare  92 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  for war The oracle of a God prescribeth it that  God himself hath promised his assistance  and the rest  of Greece is ready to join you in the contest some from  a principle of fear and some from a principle of interest  Neither on you will the first breach of the peace be charged The God who adviseth war plainly judgeth that to be  already broke You will only act to redress its violation  For the breach is not to be charged on those who arm to  revenge it but on those who were the first aggressors  Since then war considered in every light appears hon  Durable in regard to you ye Lacedaemonians since we  with united voices encourage you to it as most strongly  requisite for our general and separate interests defer no  longer to succour the Potidaeans Dorians by descent and  besieged by Ionians the reverse was formerly the case and  to fetch again the liberty of others The business will ad 44 mit of no longer delay when some already feel the blow   and others if it once be known that we met here together  and durst not undertake our own defence will in a very  little time be sensible of the same Reflect within your  selves confederates that affairs are come to extremities  that we have suggested the most adviseable measures and 44 â give your ballot for war Be not terrified at its im  mediate dangers  but animate yourselves with the hope of  a long lasting peace to be procured by it For a peace  produced by war is ever the most firm but from tranquility  and ease to be averse to war can by no means abate or dissipate our danger With this certain conclusion that 4 a state in Greece is started up into a tyrant and aims indif  ferently at the liberty of us all her arbitrary plan being  partly executed and partly in agitationâ let us rush against  and at once pull her down Then shall we pass the remainder  of our lives exempt from dangers and shall immediately re  cover liberty for those Grecians who are already enslaved In this manner the Corinthians spoke  and the Laceda monians when they had heard them all deliver their several opinions gave out the ballots to all the confederates that INTRODUCTION were present in regular order both to the greater ahd lesser states and the greatest part of them ballotted for war But though thus decreed it was impossible for them as they were quite unprepared immediately to undertake it It was agreed therefore that every state should get in readiness their  several contingents and no time to be lost However in less than a year every thing needful was amply provided  and before its expiration an irruption was made into Attica and the war openly on foot But even this interval was em ployed in sending embassies to Athens charged with accusa tions that reasons strong as possible for making war might appear on their side if those should meet with disregard BY the first ambassadors therefore whom the Lacedaemo nians sent they required the Athenians  To drive away the pollution of the Goddess And the pollution was thisâ There was one Cylon an Athenian who had been victor at the Olympic games a person of noble descent and of great consequence in his own person He married a daugh ter of Theagenes a Megarean who in those days was tyrant of Megara This Cylon asking advice at Delphi about a scheme he had projected was directed by the Godâ To  seize the citadel of Athens upon the greatest festival of  Jupiter In pursuance of this being supplied with a party of men by Thiagenes and having obtained the concurrence of his own friends upon the day of the Peloponnesian Olym pics he seized the citadel as instrumental to his tyranny He imagined that to be the greatest festival of Jupiter and to bear a particular relation to himself who had been an Olympic victor But whether the greatest festival meant was to be held in Attica or any other place he had never considered nor had the oracle declared There is a festival of Jove observed by the Athenians which is called the great est festival of Jupiter the propitious This is celebrated with out the city jin full concourse of the people where many sacrifices are offered not of real victims but of artificial images of creatures peculiar to the country Concluding Vol I 2 C  9i THE PELOPONNESiAN WAR however that he had the true sense of the oracle he put his enterprize in execution The Athenians taking the alarm ran out of the country in one general confluence to put a stop to these attempts and investing the citadel quite block ed them up But in process of time being wearied out with the tediousness of the blockade many of them departed leaving the care of it to the nine Archons with a full power of  acting in whatever manner they should judge most ex pedient  For at that time most parts of the public adminis tration were in the management of the Archons The party with Cylon thus closely invested were reduced very low through scarcity of bread and water Cylon therefore and his brother privately escape But the rest reduced to extre mities and some of them had already perished by famine set themselves down as suppliants by the altar in the citadel The Athenian guard having ordered them to arise as they saw them just ready to expire in the temple to avoid the guilt of profanation led them out and slew them But some of the number who had seated themselves at the venerable goddesses at the very altars they murdered in the act of re moval And for this action not only the persons concerned in it but their descendants also were called the sacrilegious and accursed of the Goddess The Athenians indeed banished those sacrilegious persons out of the city Cleomenes the La cedaemonian drove them out again when he was at Athens on account of a sedition nay on this occasion they not only drove away the living but even dug up the bones of the dead and cast them out Yet in process of time they re turned again and some of their posterity are still in Athens â When these suppliants were ordered to come out they tied a string round the altar in the citadel and keeping hold of it were come as far as the altars of the venerable goddesses Just there the string happened to break upon which the Archons rushed in to seize them as if Minerva had thrown them out of her protection Some of the number sat instantly down for fresh protection at the altars of the venerable goddesses It was an unavailing resource and they were immediately slain upon the spot iVu Tkrch in Wen B I INTRODUCTION This was the pollution which the Lacedaemonians required them to drive away with a face indeed of piety as vindicat ing the honour of the Gods but knowing at the same time that Pericles the son of Xantippus was tainted with it by the side of his mother and thence concluding that if he could be removed the Athenians would more easily be brought to an accommodation with them They could not carry their hopes so far as actually to effect his banishment but to raise against him the public odium as if the war was partly owing to the misfortune they suffered in him For carrying with him the greatest sway of any Athenian then alive and presiding entirely in the administration he was most steady in opposi tion to the Lacedaemonians dissuading the Athenians from any concession and exciting them to the war The Athenians in return required the Lacedaemonians  to drive away the pollution contracted at Taenarus For the Lacedaemonians some time ago having caused their sup plicant Helots to rise out of Neptune s temple at Taenarus had led them aside and slew them And to this action they themselves impute the great earthquake which happened af terwards at Sparta They further required them  to drive away the pollution of the Chalciaecan Pallas the nature of which was this When Pausanias the Lacedaemonian upon his being first recalled by the Spartans from his command in Hellespont and brought to his trial before them was acquitted of the charge of male administration but was no longer intrusted with the public commission fitting out an Hermionian tri reme on his own private account he arriveth in Hellespont without any authority from the Lacedaemonians He gave out that he did it for the service of the Grecian war but his intention was to carry on his negotiations with the king which aspiring to the monarchy of Greece he had begun before He had formerly conferred an obligation upon the king from which the whole of his project took its date When after the return from Cyprus during his first appear  96 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAJl ance there he took Byzantium which was possessed by the Medes and in it some favourites and relations of the king were made his prisoners he releaseth them all to ingratiate himself with the king without the privity of the other con federates giving it out in public that they had made their escape He transacted this affair by means of Gongylus the Eretrian to whose keeping he had intrusted Byzantium and the prisoners He also dispatched Gongylus to him with a letter the contents of which as was afterwards discovered were these  PAUSANIAS general of Sparta desirous to oblige  you sends away these his prisoners of war And by it  I express my inclination if you approve to take your  daughter in marriage and to put Sparta and the rest of  Greece into your subjection I think I have power suffi  cient to effectuate these points could my scheme be com  municated with you If therefore any of these proposals  receive your approbation send down to the coast some  trusty person through whom for the future we may hold a  correspondence Thus much was contained in the letter and on the recep tion of it Xerxes was delighted and sends away Artabazus the son of Pharnacus down to the coast with an order to take upon him the government of Dascylis having first dis missed Megabetes who was the governor To him he in trusted a letter for Pausanias at Byzantium with an injunc tion to forward it with all possible expedition and to let him see his signet and that if Pausanias should charge him with any affairs he should execute them with all possible diligence and fidelity Artabazus being arrived obeyed all the other injunctions with exactness and forwarded the let ter which brought this answer  THUS saith king Xerxes to Pausanias â The kindness  done me in those persons whom from Byzantium you de  livered safe on the other side the sea shall be placed to your  account in our family eternally recorded and with the B I INTRODUCTION  other contents of your letter I am delighted Let neither  night nor day relax your earnest endeavours to effectuate  those points you promise me  Nor stop at any expence of  gold or silver or greatness of military force if such aid be  any where requisite But confer boldly with Artabazus a  trusty person whom I have sent to you about mine and your  own concerns that they may be accomplished in the most  honourable and most advantageous manner for us both Upon the receipt of this letter Pausanias who before had been in high credit with the Grecians through the lustre of his command at Plataea was elevated much more than ever and could no longer adjust his demeanor by the modes and customs of his native country He immediately dressed him self up in Persian attire and quitting Byzantium travelled through Thrace attended with Persian and Egyptian guards and refined his table into Persian elegance His ambition he was unable any longer to conceal but by short sketches mani fested too soon what greater schemes he had formed in his mind for future accomplishment He then shewed himself difficult of access and let his anger loose so violently and so indiscriminately upon all men that no one could approach him And this was not the least motive to the confederacy for going over to the Athenians But the Lacedaemonians informed of this recalled him the first time upon the account of such behaviour  and when he was returned again in the Hermionian vessel without their permission he plainly ap peared to have re assumed again his former practices And when forced to remove from Byzantium by the opposition raised against him by the Athenians he went not back to Sparta  But withdrawing to Colona e of Troas information was given that  he was negotiating with the Barbarians and had  fixed his residence there for very bad designs Upon this they could no longer be patient but the Ephori dispatched him a herald and the Scijtak with an orderâ Not to stay be â The Scytale is a famous instrument peculiar to the Lacedaemonians and used by them for the close conveyance of orders to their ministers abroad 98 THE PELOPONMKSIAN WAR  hind the herald  if he did war was proclaimed against him  by the Spartans And he desirous to clear himself as much as possible from suspicion and confident that with mo ney he could baffle any accusation returned the second time to Sparta The first treatment he met with there was to be thrown into prison by order of the Ephori For the Ephori have so large an authority even over king But afterwards by some private management he procured his enlargement and offers to submit to a trial against any who were willing to accuse him The Spartans indeed had no positive evidence against him not even his private enemies nor the general communityâ none to support them in proceeding capitally against a person of the royal descent and at that time invested with the regal dignity For being uncle to Pleistarchus the son of Leonidas their king though yet in minority he was regent guardian But by his disregard of the laws and his affectation of the Barbarian manners he afforded them strong reasons to suspect that he would never conform to the equality then in vogue They called to remembrance those other pas sages of his behaviour in which he had at any time deviated from the institutions of his country  and that further upon the tripod at Delphi which the Grecians offered as the choicest part of the Persian spoils he had formerly presumed by his own authority to place this inscription 1 It was a long black stick and the contrivance was thisâ When the ma  gistrates gave commission to any general or admiral they took two round  pieces of wood exactly equal to one another  one of these they kept and  the other was delivered to the commander to whom when they had any  thing of moment to communicate they cut a long narrow scroll of parch  ment and rolling it about their own staff one fold close upon another  they wrote their business upon it then taking it off dispatched it away  to the commander who applying it to his own staff the folds exactly fell  in one with another as at the writing and the characters which before it was wrapped up were confusedly disjoined and unintelligible appeared  very plain Potter t Archteohgia Vol II c 13 If it be asked says the Scholiast how Pausanias came to have the Scy tale with him now as he was abroad without the public commission  the answer is he had kept it ever since his former employments B t 99 IHTRODUCTION For Persia s hosts o erthrown and Graecia freed To Phoebus THIS Pausanias hath decreed Who led the Grecians to the glorious deed These verses indeed the Lacedaemonians immediately de faced from the tripod and placed in their stead the names of the several states which had joined in the overthrow of the Barbarian and in making this oblation This therefore was now recollected to the prejudice of Pausanias  and in his present situation it was interpreted from the circumstances of his late behaviour as an argument that he had been equally guilty long before They had moreover got an information that he was tampering with the Helots which in fact was true  For he promised them their liberty and the privilege of citizens of Sparta if they would rise at his command and co operate with him in the whole of his project But even this would not prevail They disdained to place so much con fidence in the informations given by Helots as to run into ir regularities to punish him They adhered to the custom ever observed amongst them never to be hasty in forming a sentence never to be recalled against a citizen of Sparta without unquestionable evidence At length they obtained the fullest conviction as it is said by means of an Argyllian an old minion of his and the person most in his confidence who was to convey Artabazus the last letters he wrote to the king This man alarmed by the recollection that no person sent on these errands before him had ever returned again having already counterfeited the seal to the end that if he was deceived in his suspicions or Pausanias should demand them again to make any alteration he might avoid discovery breaks open the letters He found by them that he was go ing on the errand his fears foreboded and that his own mur der was expressly enjoined He carried upon this the pac ket to the Ephori who were now more than ever convinced but still were desirous to hear themselves from the mouth of Pausanias an acknowledgment of the truth They therefore contrived that this person should go to sanctuary at Tsena 100 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR rus as a suppliant and refuge in a cell built double by a par tition In the inner part of this cell he hid some of the Epho ri  And Pausanias coming to him and demanding the reason of his supplication they heard distinctly all that passed The man complained bitterly to him about the clause in the let ters relating to himself and expostulated with him about eve ry particularâ why he who had been so trusty to him dur  ing the whole course of his negotiations with the king  should now be so highly honoured as to be murdered up  on an equal rank with the meanest of his tools  Pausanias confessed the truth of all that he alleged  begged him  not  to be exasperated with what at present appeared assured him  he should not be hurt if he would leave his sanctuary and earnestly intreated him  with all possible speed to go  the journey and not to obstruct the schemes that were then  in agitation The Ephori having exactly heard him withdrew And now beyond a scruple convinced they de termined to apprehend him in the city But it is reported that at the instant fixed for his arrest as he was walking along and beheld the countenance of one of the Ephori ap proaching towards him he immediately discovered his bu siness  and another of them out of kindness intimating the matter by a nod he took to his heels and fled away faster than they could pursue him The Chalcitrcan happened to be near and into a little house within the verge of that temple he betook himself and sat quietly down to avoid the inclemency of the outward air They who had lost the start came too late in the pursuit But afterwards they stripped the house of its roof and doors  and watching their opportunity when he was within they encompassed him round about immured him within and placing a constant guard around kept him beset that he might perish with hun ger When he was ready to expire and they found in how bad a state he lay within the house they led him out of the â Alcithea the mother of Pausanias is said to have brought the first atone on th i9 occasion  Such was the spirit of the ladies at Lacedxmnn B I 101 INTRODUCTION verge yet breathing a little  and being thus brought out he immediately died They next intended to cast his body into the Caeada where they are used to throw their malefactors  but afterwards changed their minds and put him into the ground somewhere thereabouts But the God at Delphi warned the Lacedaemonians afterwards by an oracle  to remove his body  to the place where he died â And now it lies in the area before the temple as the inscription on the pillars shewethâ  and as in what they had done they had violated the laws of  sanctuary to restore two bodies to the Chalcicecan for that M one To this they so far conformed as to dedicate there two statues of brass as atonements for Pausanias The Athenians upon the principle that the God himself had judged this a pollution required of the Lacedaemonians by way of retaliation to clear themselves of it The Lacedaemonians at that time sent ambassadors to Athens to accuse Themistocles also of carrying on the same treasonable correspondence with the Mede as Pausanias which they had discovered from the papers which had been evidence against Pausanias and demanded that  he should be equally punished for it The Athenians complied with this demand But as he then happened to be under the ostracism and re â The Ostracism was a compliment of an extraordinary kind paid by the people of Athens to superior merit When a person had done them great services and they grew apprehensive they might possibly shew him too much gratitude to the prejudice of their own liberties they banished him for ten years On some particular day each citizen gave in the name of a person wrote upon an ostracum a shell or piece of tile whom he desired should be sent into retirement Six thousand of these votes carried the point and he who had thus a legal number of votes was obliged to quit Athena within ten days The most disinterested patriot and most successful commander received for the most part this public acknowledgment of their services At length a scoundrel fellow one Hyperbolus was thus honourably distinguished by the public voice The Athenians thought afterwards they had profaned the ostracism by treating him like a Themis tocles an Aristides or a Cimon and therefore abolished this strange inju rious privilege by which wanton libertv was enabled to triumph over its best friend public spirit Other republics in Greece had something of the same nature amongst them Authors vary much about the circumstances Vol I

orders to seize him wherever they could find him Themistocles ad vised in time flieth out of Peloponnesus into Corcyra to which people he had done a signal kindness The Corcy reans expressing their fear of giving him refuge lest it might expose them to the resentment both of Lacedaemonians and Athenians he is conveyed away by them to the opposite con tinent Now pursued by those who were appointed to do it and who had by enquiry discovered his route he is compelled by mere distress to turn in to Admetus king of the Molos siansf who was by no means his friend It happened that Admetus was not at home  and Themistocles the suppliant addressing himself to the wife is by her directed to take their child in his hand and sit himself down upon the hearth Ad metus returning soon after he tells him who he was and conjures himâ though he had formerly opposed him in a  suit he had preferred to the people of Athens not to take  revenge upon an exile To make him suffer now would  be taking

merely in a point  of interest and not where life was at stakeâ But if he now  gave him up telling him by whom and why he was perse cuted  he deprives him of the only resource he had left to  preserve

and from Argos and travelling upwards from thence in company with a Per sian of the maritime provinces he gets a letter to be delivered to king Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes who had lately mount ed the throne the purport of which was this 1 THEMISTOCLES am coming to you who of all  the Grecians have done the greatest mischiefs to your fa  mily so long as I was obliged by necessity to resist the  invasion of your father Yet the good services I did him  were much more numerous when my own preservation  was secured and his retreat became full of hazards My  former generosity calls for a requital

mere fiction   and now able to perform great services for you I am  near at hand having been persecuted by the Grecians  for my friendship to you I beg only a year s respite  that I may notify to you in person those points which are  the subject of my journey hither The king it is said was surprized at the spirit of the man and ordered him to act as he desired The time of respite he had thus obtained he spent in making all possible progress in the Persian language and in learning the man ners of the country When the year was elapsed appearing at court he became a favourite with the iing a greater than any Greek had ever been before as well on account of the former lustre of his life as the hope he suggested to him of enslaving Greece  but above all by the specimens he gave of his fine understanding â For in Themistocles the strength â The boldness and intrepidity of Themistocles hath been the subject of admiration in throwing himself on the protection of the Persian monarch who had fixed a price on bis head And yet be was so high in his esteem that the night after first giving him audience he cried aloud thrice in hia sleep 1 have got Themistocles the Athenian He afterwards acknow ledged himself 200 talents near 40 0001 sterling in his debt  For so much I promised the man that brought you to me Themistocles soon gave him a specimen of his fine understanding He was desired by the king to speak his mind freely in relation to the affairs of Greece  He an swered by his interpreter that  discourse like a Persian carpet had in it a variety of figures which never appeared to advantage unless it was quite unfolded but were not to be apprehended when wrapped up in the piece By this ingenious plea he obtained a year s respite to learn the Persian language that he might be enabled to deliver explicitly his own sentiments to the king in his own words and method He became afterwards so great a favourite that the most engaging promise in future times that the Per sian monarch could make to a Greek whom he had a mind to inveigle into his service was  that he should live with him as Themistocles did with  Artaxerxes And yet no attachment to his royal friend ever made him an enemy to his country nor did his disinterested patriotism of which never man had more ever render him ungrateful to his benefactor Through his bounty he lived the remainder of his life in

so highly distinguished above the bulk of mankind as to deserve the greatest admiration By the mere force of his natural genius without any improvement from study either in his youth or more advanced

him fifty talents yearly for his bread Lampsacus for his wine which place was in the greatest repute for wine and Myus for his meat His bones are said to have been conveyed home by his relations in pur suance of his own desire and to have been interred in Attica without the privity of the Athenians For it was against law to bury him there as he had been outlawed for treason â 9 687 10 Sterling t Some authors have related that his countrymen afterwards honoured him with a cenotaph in the Piraeus Plutarch however disbelieves the fact and thinks it merely a presumption formed on the following verses of Plato the comic poet To thee Themistocles a tomb is due Plac d in the most conspicuous point of view  Merchants from every port with just acclaim Should shout thy honour and confess thy fame  THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Such an end had the lives of Pausanias the Lacedaemonian and Themistocles the Athenian who in their own age made the greatest figure of any Grecians The Lacedaemonians by their first embassy had enjoined what was as amply in turn required of them to do as hath been above recited concerning the expulsion of the sacrilegi ous But coming a second time to the Athenians they com manded themâ to quit the blockade of Potidcea  andâ  to permit iEgina to govern itself at its own discretion  and above all other points insist upon this declaring most ex pressly that in this case war should not be made â If they would revoke their decree concerning the Megareans in which they had been prohibited from entering any harbour whatever in the dominion of Athens and from the Attic markets But the Athenians listened to none of these demands nor would revoke the decree but reproached the Megareans for tilling land that was sacred land not marked out for culture and for giving shelter to runaway slaves At last the final ambassadors arrived from Lacedaemon namely Ramphias and Melesippus and Agesander who waving all other points which they had formerly required said thusâ The Lacedaemonians are desirous of peace and Each fleet return d or setting out should join In owning all the naval glory thine  It should command high rais d yon wat ry plain And point that fight which gave us all the main I cannot end this note about Themistocles without begging the reader to accept a translation of an epigram in the Anthologia which appears to have been written with a spirit worthy of this illustrious Athenian Be Greece the monument and crown the height With all the trophies of the naval fight Let Persia s Mars and Xerxes swell the base  Such forms alone Themistocles can grace Next like a column of majestic size His acts inscrib d let Salamis arise Swell every part and give the hero room For nothing small should scandalize the tomb B I INTRODUCTION 107  peace there may be if you will permit the Grecians to go  vern themselves at their own discretion The Athenians summoned an assembly where every one was invited to deliver his opinion They determined after deliberate consultation on all the points in contest to return one definitive answer Several others spoke on this occasion and were divided in their sentiments  some insisting on the necessity of a war others that peace should not be obstructed by that decree which ought to be repealed At length Pe ricles the son of Xantippus standing forth who was at that time the leading man at Athens and a person of the greatest abilities both for action and debate advised them thus  I FIRMLY persevere Athenians in the same opinion  that I have ever avowed to make no concessions to the  Lacedaemoniansâ though at the same time sensible that  men never execute a war with that warmth of spirit through  which they are first impelled to undertake it but sink in  their ardour as difficulties increase I perceive it however  incumbent upon me to persist in the same uniform advice   And I require those amongst you who are influenced by it  as they concur in the measures either to unite their efforts M for redress if any sinister event should follow or else upon  a series of success to make no parade of their own discern  ment It is usual enough for accidents unforeseen to baffle  the best concerted schemes  since human intentions are by  nature fallible And hence it comes to pass that whatever  falls out contrary to our expectations we are accustomed to  throw all the blame upon fortune  The treacherous designs of the Lacedaemonians formerly  against us were visible to all nor are they this very mo  ment less clear than ever For notwithstanding that ex  press stipulationâ That upon controversies between us we  should reciprocally do and submit to justice each party re  maining in their present possessionsâ yet they have never  demanded justice nor accept the offer of it from us Their  allegations against us they are determined to support by  arms and not by evidence And here they come no longer 108 THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR  to remonstrate but actually to give us law They command  usâ to quit the blockade of Potidaea to permit iEgina to  govern itself by its own model and to repeal the decree  against the Megareans Nay this their last and peremp  tory embassy authoritatively enjoins usâ to restore the Gre  cians to their former independence But let not one of you  imagine that we excite a war for a trifling concern if we M refuse to repeal that decree against the Megareans The  stress they lay upon it that if it be repealed a war shall  not ensue is nothing but a colour Nor think there will be  any ground for self accusation though for so trifling a con  cern you have recourse to arms  since that concern trifling  as it is includes within it the full proof and demonstration  of Athenian spirit If for instance you condescend to this  demand you will immediately be enjoined some other con  descension of greater consequence as if this your compliance  was owing to the prevalence of your fear But if at once  you strenuously refuse to hearken to them you will convince  them in a manner clearly to be understood that they must  treat with you for the future as with men who are their equals  From the present crisis I exhort you therefore to form  a resolution either timely to make your submission before  you begin to suffer  or if we shall determine for war  which to me seemeth most expedient without regarding  the pretext of it be it important or be it trifling to refuse  every the least concession nor to render the tenure of what  we now possess precarious and uncertain For not only  the greatest but the most inconsiderable demand if au  thoritatively enjoined by equals upon their neighbours be  fore justice hath decided the point hath the very same  tendency to make them slaves But from the posture in  which the affairs of both parties are at present that we may  risk a war with a prospect of success as fine and as inviting  as our rivals can suffer me distinctly to set the reasons  before you and be Â onvinced of their weight  The Peloponnesians are a people who subsist by their fell I INTRODUCTION 109  bodily labour without wealth either in the purses of indivi  duals or in any public fund Again in wars of long con  tinuance or wars by sea they are quite unpractised since  the hostilities in which they have been embroiled with one  another have been short and transient in consequence of  their poverty Such people can neither compleatly man  out a fleet nor frequently march land armies abroad  abandoning the care of their domestic concerns even  whilst from these they must answer a large expence and  more than this are excluded the benefit of the sea Funds  of money are a much surer support of war than contribu  tions exacted by force And men who subsist by the la  bour of their hands are more ready to advance a service  with their bodies than with their money since the former  though exposed they strongly presume will survive the dan  ger but the latter they apprehend must be too speedily ex  hausted especially if the war run out into a greater length  than they expect which will probably be the case In a  single battle it is true the Peloponnesians and their con  federates are able to make head against united Greece   but they are not able to support a war of continuance  against an enemy in all respects provided better than  themselves since by one general council they are not guided but execute their momentary schemes in sudden  and hasty efforts since farther having all of them an  equality of suffrage and being of different descents each  of them is intent on the advancement of a separate inter  est In such circumstances no grand design can ever  be accomplished Some of them are eager to obtain a  speedy vengeance on a foe others are chiefly intent on  preserving their substance from unnecessary waste It is  long before they can meet together to consult and then  with great precipitancy they form their public determina  tions as the largest part of their time is devoted to domes  tic concerns Each thinks it impossible that the public  welfare can be prejudiced by his own particular negligence Vol I 2 E 110 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 44 but that others are intent on watching for himself to share  the benefit and whilst this error universally prevailed 44 amongst all the several members the general welfare insen  sibly drops to ruin But the greatest obstruction to them il will be a scarcity of money j which as they can but slowly 44 raise their steps must needs be dilatory and the urgent oc  casions of war can never tarry  As for any forts they can erect within our territory or  their application to a navy it is beneath us to form any  apprehensions from thence To effectuate the former  would be difficult for a people of equal strength in a sea  son of tranquillity Much more so must it be upon the  lands of an open enemy and when we are impowered to 44 put the same expedients in execution against them And  if they should fix a garrison in Attica they might by ex  cursions or desertions from us annoy some part of our ter  ritory but whatever works they can raise will be insuffi  cient to block us up to prevent our descents upon their coastSj and making reprisals upon them by our fleets  wherein we are superior For we are better qualified for 44 land service by the experience we have gained in that of  the sea than they for service at sea by their experience at 44 land To learn the naval skill they will find to be by no 44 means an easy task For even you who have been in con 44 stant exercise ever since the Persian invasion have not yet  attained to a mastery in the science How then shall men 44 brought up to tillage and strangers to the sea whose prac 44 tice farther will be ever interrurupted by us through the  continual annoyance which our larger number of shipping  will give them effect any point of eclat  Against small 44 squadrons they might indeed be sometimes adventurous em 44 boldening their want of skill by multiplying their num  bers  But when awed by superior force they will of neces  sity desist and so by practice interrupted the growth of  their skill will be checked and in consequence of it their 44 fears be increased The naval like other sciences is the  effect of art It cannot be learned by acccident nor use Â I Ill INTRODUCTION  fully exercised at starts  or rather there is nothing which  so much requireth an uninterrupted application  If farther they should secrete the funds laid up at Olym  pia and Delphi and endeavour by an increase of pay to se  duce from our service the foreigners who are on board our  fleets â in case we were not their equals in strength and  they themselves and such foreigners could entirely apply  themselves to the work â This then might be terrible in  deed But nought would it avail them now whilstâ what  is our peculiar advantageâ we have commanders Athenian  born and seamen to man our fleets in larger number and of  greater skill than all the rest of Greece together Besides  in so dangerous a crisis not one of these foreigners would  think of bartering an exile from his own settlement and a  desertion to that side where the prospect of victory is not 4 near so inviting for an enlargement of his pay of few days  continuance  The state of the Peloponnesians I judge to be such or  very nearly such as I have described it whereas our own  is exempt from those defects which I have pointed out in  them and enjoys other great advantages far beyond their  competition Grant that they may invade our territories  by land We too shall make descents upon theirs Andâ  whether is the greatest damage only some part of Pelopon  nesus or all Attica put to fire and swordâ will admit of no  comparison In the former case they will have no other  land to repair the damage but what they must earn by dint  of arms Whilst we have large tracts already in our power  both in the islands and on the main Of vast conse  quence indeed is the dominion of the sea Butâ consider  it with attention For were we seated upon an island  which of us would be subdued with greater difficulty   And now you ought to think that our present situation is  as nearly as possible the same  and so to evacuate your  lands and houses here to confine your defence to the  sea and to Athens itself and not exasperated against the  Peloponnesians for the sake of those to hazard a battle  112 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  against superior numbers Should we be thus victorious  we must fight it over again with another body not inferior  and should we be vanquished at that instant we lose all our  dependents the very essence of our strength For the mo  ment we cease to be able to awe them by our forces they  will be no longer obedient to our commands We ought  not to wail and lament for the loss of our houses or our  lands but for the lives of our people  Because lands and  houses can never acquire men but arc by men acquired  Durst I presume on a power to persuade I would ex  hort you to march out yourselves with your own hands to  execute the waste and let the Peloponnesians see that for  things of such value you will never think of compliance  I have many other inducements to hope for victory if in  tending this war alone you will forbear the ambition of en  larging your dominions and not plunge into voluntary su perfluous hazards For in truth I am more afraid of our  own indiscretions than the schemes of the enemy But the  explanation of what at present I only hint at shall be re  served till due occasions offer in the course of action Let  us now dismiss the ambassadors with the following an  swer  That we will open our market and harbours to the Me  gareans provided the Lacedaemonians in their prohibition  of foreigners except us and our confederates For neither  was that act in us nor will this act in them be contrary to  treaty  That we will suffer the states to govern themselves at  their own discretion if they were possessed of that right  when the treaty was made and so soon as ever they relax  the necessity they lay upon the states in their own league  of governing themselves by that model which suits best  the Lacedaemonian interest and allow them the choice of  their own polity  That farther we are willing to submit to a judicial de  termination according to treaty B I INTRODUCTION 113  That a war shall not begin but will retaliate upon those  that do  Such an answer is agreeable to justice and becomes  the dignity of the Athenian state But you ought to be  informed that a war unavoidably there will be that the  greater alacrity we shew for it the more shall we damp the  spirits of our enemies in their attacks and that the  greatest dangers are ever the resource of the greatest hon  ours to communities as well as individuals It was thus  that our fathers withstood the Medes and rushing to arms  with resources far inferior to ours nay abandoning all their  substance by resolution more than fortune by courage more  than real strength beat back the Barbarian and advanced  this state to its present summit of grandeur From them  we ought not to degenerate but by every effort within our  ability avenge it on our foes and deliver it down to posteri  ty unblemished and unimpaired In this manner Pericles spoke and the Athenians judging that what he advised was most for their interest decreed in conformity to his exhortation They returned a particular answer to the Lacedaemonians according to his directions nay in the very words of his motion  and in fine concludedâ that  they would do nothing upon command but were ready to submit the points in contest to a judicial determination ac cording to treaty upon a fair and equal footing Upon this the ambassadors departed and here all negotiations came to a conclusion Such were the pretexts and dissensions on both sides pre vious to the war and which took their first rise from the busi ness of Epidamnus and Corcyra These however never in terrupted their commercial dealings nor mutual intercourse which still were carried on without the intervention of heralds but not without suspicions For such incidents manifestly tended to a rupture and must infallibly end in war â As the Athenians were a free people they made use of their liberty on all occasions to asperse calumniate and ridicule the great men amongst them They were at this time exhibited on the stage by name  and At is THE PELOPONNESIAl WAR tophanes whose plays were acted during the Peloponnesian war hath ridi culed the cotemporary statesmen and commanders with the utmost petu lancy and virulence The Athenians afterwards thought proper to restrain this licentiousness of their comic poets i but it may not be amiss in the eourse of the notet to quote occasionally some passages from him to shew my countrymen how much writing libels differs from writing history  and that where liberty is abused no public merit nor private worth can defend its owners from the malice of faction or the petulance of buffoons Our historian hath laid open the true and pretended causes of the Pelo ponnesian war Let us now see how affairs were represented on the stage of Athens His comedy of The Acharnian was exhibited by Aris tophanes at Athens in the sixth year of this war after the death of Peri cles The decree against Megara is the ground work of it One Dian polis of the borough of Acharnae is the droll of the play and amply ridicules it to a set of his neighboursâ  Do not be angry says he if though a beggar I presume to talk to Athe  mans about affairs of state and for once play the tragedian It is the  province of tragedy lo give a just representation of things  and I am  going to speak in a just manner of very sad things indeed Cleon will  not be able to catch me this bout for traducing my countrymen in the  hearing of strangers We are here by ourselves and to day is the fes  tival of Bacchus The strangers are not yet come nor the tributes nor  the confederates from other states  We are here snug by ourselves all ofus true blooded Athenians Those odd creatures the sojourners I  look upon as the chaff of Athens And now to speak sincerely I hate  the Lacedaemonians from the bottom of my soul and I heartily wish  that Neptune the god adored at Taenarus would give them an earth  quake and tumble down all their houses upon their heads They have Â made sad work with me all my vineyards are quite destroyed by the  rogues But my dear friends and countrymen here present why do we blame the Lacedaemonians for this  And mind Sirs I cast no aspersions  on our own state I aim at nobody employed in the affairs of the adrain  istration but at a parcel of sad rascals scurvy low infamous scoundrels  who are eternally bringing informations against a Megarean pair of pa  niers If they once set eye but on a cucumber a leveret a sucking pig  a sprig of parsley or a grain of salt they swear at once they belonged to  Megareans and were sold that very day These things however though  the general practice are of small signification A parcel of jolly fellows deep in their cups had stole away from Megara that jade Simaetha The  Megareans exasperated at the loss of their wench made reprisals by  carrying off a brace of strumpets that belonged to Aspasia And thus â this cursed war which plagues all Greece took its rise from three strumpets Ay on account of three whores Olympian Pericles began to  storm he lightened he thundered roused all Greece to arms  he made  new laws as fast as so many ballads that the poor dogs of Megara must B I 115 INTRODUCTION be found neither in the fields nor the markets nor by sea nor by land 4 Upon this being just ready to starve away they go to Lacedaemon to  get the decree reversed which had been made on account of three  whores It would not do embassy after embassy had no avail and then  immediately rose all this clattering of shields Calumny hath a dart always left in her quiver and in another comedy of Aristophanes we find another let fly at Pericles This was his being an accomplice with Phidias in secreting some of the gold issued from the pub lit treasury for the statue of Minerva in the citadel the workmanship of that celebrated artist In his comedy called The Peace Mercury says  Ye wise husbandmen attend to my words if you have a mind to know how things came into this sad confusion Phidias was the first cause of it by cheating the public Then Pericles helped it forwards for fear he should share the fate of Phidias He stood in awe of your tempers  he  was afraid of falling under your censure  so to prevent his own personal  danger he set the whole continuity in a flame by lighting up first that  little spark of the decree against Megara He then blew up that spark  into this mighty war the smoke of which hath fetched tears from all the  eyes of Greece from Grecians on both sides Pericles had employed Phidias in adorning Athens The fine taste of the patron and fine execution of the artist have been universally acknow ledged An accusation however was preferred against Phidias by one of his workmen that he had secreted some gold By the advice of Pericles he had laid it on so artfully that it might be taken off without prejudicing the statue The trial accordingly was made and the gold found to answer weight It seems however that Phidias was banished because as the enemies of Pericles attacked him at the same time for impiety in the per sons of his beloved Aspasia and his preceptor in philosophy Anaxagoras and for a cheat in that of his favourite artist he had only influence enough to save the former by pleading earnestly for her and softening his plea with abundant tears Both Plutarch and Cornelius Ncpos have recorded a third story of Peri cles in relation to this war It is thisâ Alcibiades then a youth saw him in a very pensive and melancholy mood and demanded the reason of it Pericles told him  great sums of public money had passed through his  hands and he knew not how to make up his accounts  Contrive  then replied Alcibiades  to give no account at all And in pursuance of this advice he is said to have involved the state in the Pelopomesian war But is not Thucydides more to be depended upon than a whole host of writers of scandal memoirs private history and satire  If we listen to the latter there never was and never will he any truth in history  there never was nor is there this moment any true worth or merit in the world A buffoon can degrade a hero a spiteful satirist cloud every good quality in others and the ears and hearts of men will he filled with nothing but detraction and slander  THB PELOPONNESIAN WAR BOOK II YEAR I â BEFORE CHRIST 431 HENCE instantly commenceth the war between the Pe loponnesians and Athenians and the confederates on both sidesâ during which they had no kind of intercourse with one another without the herald and now once engaged carried it on without intermission The particular incidents of it are orderly related by the Summer and the Winter The Thirty years Peace which was made after the con quest of Euboea had now lasted fourteen But in the fifteenth year when Chrysis had been forty eight years Priestess at Argos when iEnesias was Ephorus at Sparta and Pythodorus ten months Archon at Athens in the sixth month after the battle at Potidaea and in the very begin ning of the spring a body of Thebans somewhat above three hundred under the command of Pythangelus the son of Phylidas and Diemporus the son of Onetoridas two of the rulers of Breotia about the first sleep got into Plataea of Bffiotia with their arms which place was then in alliance â Plataea was a city and petty state in Bccotia on the confines of Attica The inhabitants of it had ever been so fir mly attached to the liberties of Greece that it drew upon them the lasting rancour of the Thebans who had joined the Persians when they invaded Greece and persuaded them to burn down Plataea The Plataeans engaged with the Athenians on the side of Greece in the famous battle fought within their own territory The Athenians to shew their gratitude gave them a place in the fine battle piece painted in the Paecile in honour of the victory made them all citi zens of Athens and ever after concluded their religious solemnities with a prayer for the prosperity of the Plataeans B II 117 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 with the Athenians They were induced to this attempt and had the gates opened to them by Nauclides and associates citizens of Plataea who had formed a design for the sake of aggrandizing themselves to destroy all their fellow citizens averse to their schemes and to gain the city for the Thebans But the affair was managed by Eurymachus the son of Leon tiadas a person of the greatest authority among the Thebans For the Thebans foreseeing a war unavoidable had even now while peace was actually subsisting and the war not yet declared a strong desire to get possession of Plataea which had been at eternal enmity with them No regular watch was as yet kept in it which was a means of facilitating their en trance When they had gained admission they drew them selves up in order of battle on the public forum contrary to the scheme proposed by the conspirators of marching imme diately to the houses of their enemies and putting them to the sword Their own design was publicly to offer some fair proposals and gain the city by an amicable composition With this view their herald proclaimed aloud thatâ All  who were willing to enter into league according to the an  cieivt custom of all Boeotians should come and join their  arms with them By this method they thought the city would easily be brought to an accommodation The Plataeans when they found that the Thebans were already got in and had surpriszed the town being in great consternation and thinking the enemy more numerous than they really were for the night prevented a view of them came soon to a composition  and accepting what terms â Bocotia was one large republic formed by the union of several little states The sovereignty as Tlmcydides informs us book the fifth was lodged in four councils composed of deputies sent from every city in the union These were the states general and sat at Thebes the principal city of Bocotia The executive and military powers were lodged in eleven per sons chosen annually and stilcd Rulers of Bocotia in whose election each city had a share They rolled and at the battle of Delium Pagondas was in the chief command in right of Thebes PlaUea had no share in this union but was closely allied with and under the protection of Athens Vol I 2 F 118 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR they offered made no resistance  especially as they found that violence was offered to no man Yet by means of the parley they had discovered that the Thebans were few in number  and judged should they venture an attack they might easily overpower them â for the bulk of the Plateans had not the least inclination to revolt from the Athenians It was at length concluded that this point should be at tempted after having conferred together by digging through the partition walls of one another s houses to avoid the sus picion which going through the streets might have occa sioned Then along the streets they ranged carriages with out the oxen to serve them instead of a rampart and made a proper disposition for every thing necessary for immediate execution When they had got every thing ready in the best manner they were able watching till night began to vanish and the first dawn appear they marched from their houses towards the Thebans that they might fall upon ihem before the full light should embolden their resistance and give them equal advantages in the fight and that they might be more intimidated by being charged in the dark and sensible of disadvantage from their ignorance of the city The attack was immediately begun and both sides soon came to action The Thebans when they found themselves thus circumvented threw themselves into an oval and wherever assaulted prevented impression Twice or thrice they beat them back with success  but when the assaults were again with a loud noise repeated when the very women and menial servants were shouting and scream ing from the houses all around and throwing stones and tiles amongst them incommoded further by the rain which had fallen plentifully that night they were seized with fear and abandoning their defence fled in confusion about the city The greatest part of them running in the dark and the dirt knew not any of the passages by which they could get out for this affair happened upon the change of the moon and were pursued by men who knowing them all  B a 119 TEAR I â BEFORE CBRIST 431 prevented their escape so that many of them perished The gates by which they entered and which only had been opened one of the Plataeans had barred fast by thrusting the point of a spear into the staple instead of a bolt so that they could not possibly get out there Thus pursued about the city some of them got upon the walls and threw them selves over but most of these were killed by the fall Some of them found a gate unguarded and a woman supplying them with a hatchet they cut the bolt in pieces unperceived though few only escaped by this means for they were soon discovered Others were separately slain in the different quarters of the city But the greatest part and chiefly those who had kept in a body threw themselves into a great house contiguous to the walls the doors of which happened to be open imagining the doors of this house to be the city gates and a certain passage to a place of safety When the Pla taeans saw them thus shut up they consulted together whe ther they should fire the house and burn them all in their inclosure or reserve them for some other punishment But at last these and all the other Thebans yet surviving who were scattered about the city agreed to give up their arms and surrender themselves to the Plataeans prisoners at discre  tion Such was the issue of this attempt on Plataea The other Thebans who ought during night to have come up with all their strength to reinforce the first body in case they miscarried and were still upon the march when the news of this defeat met them advanced with all possible expedition Plataea is distant from Thebes about seventy stadia and the rain which fell that night had retarded their march  for the river Asopus was so much swelled by it that it was not easily fordable It was owing to the march in such a heavy rain and the difficulty of passing this river that they came not up till their men were either slain or made prisoners When the Thebans were convinced of that About seven English miles 120 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR event they cast their attention towards the Plataeans who were still without For the people of Plataea were scattered about the adjacent country with their implements of hus bandry because annoyance in time of peace was quite unÂ expected They were desirous to catch some of these as ex change for their own people within the city if any were yet living and prisoners there On this they were fully bent but in the midst of their project the Plataeans who suspected the probability of some such design and were anxious for their people yet without dispatched a herald to the The bans representing to themâ the injustice of the attempt already made  since treaties subsisting they had endea voured to surprize the city and then warned them  to desist from any violence to those without If not they po sitively declared they would put all the prisoners yet alive to the sword whereas in case they retired peaceably out of their territory they would deliver them up unhurt This account the Thebans give and say farther it was sworn to The Plataeans disown the promise of an immediate dis charge of the prisoners which was reserved for terms to be agreed on in a subsequent treaty and flatly deny that they swore The Thebans however retired out of their territory without committing any violence But the Plataeans when they had with expedition fetched into the city all their effects of value that were out in the fields immediately put all their prisoners to the sword The number of those that were taken was one hundred and eighty Eurymachus was amongst them with whom the traitors had concerted the surprize And this done they dispatched a messenger to Athens  and restored to the Thebans their dead under truce And then they regulated the affairs of the city in the manner most suit able to their present situation The news of the surprised of Plataea had soon reached the Athenians who immediately apprehended all the Boeo tians then in Attica and dispatched a herald to Plateea with ordersâ to proceed no farther against the Theban pri Â IJ TEAR Lâ BEFORE CHRIST 431 121 soners till they should send their determination about them  for they were not yet informed of their having been actually put to death The first messenger had been sent away immediately upon the irruption of the Thebansâ the second so soon as they were defeated and made prisonersâ as to what happened afterwards they were utterly in the dark Thus ignorant of what had since been done the Athe nians dispatched away their herald who upon his arrival found them all destroyed Yet after this the Athenians marching a body of troops to Plataea carried thither all ne cessary provisions left a garrison in the place and brought away all the hands that would be useless in a siege with the women and children After this business of Plataea and so manifest a breach of peace the Athenians made all necessary preparations for immediate war The Lacedaemonians also and their confe derates took the same measures Nay both sides were in tent on dispatching embassies to the king and to several other Barbarian powers wherever they had hope of forming some effectual interest for themselves and spared no pains to win those states over to their alliance which had hitherto been independent In the Lacedaemonian league besides the ships already furnished out for them in Italy and Sicily the confederates there were ordered to prepare a new quota proportioned to the abilities of the several states that the â By this means the intestine quarrels of Greece were going to throw a power into the hands of the Persian monarch which he could not obtain by force Each party could cringe to tlie common enemy in order to obtain subsidies from him to enable them to distress each other And thus the balance of power rested at last in his hands and he became for a time su preme arbiter of Greece Aristophanes in his comedy of The Acarmam hath described these embassies and the Persian monarch too with exces sive buffoonery but quite too low and ridiculous to quote He bears hard upon the Athenian ambassadors for lengthening out the time of their em ploy as much as possible for the lucre of the salary paid them by the state which is there mentioned at two drachmas a day Was it either avarice or public rapineâ this exorbitant salary of 15Jd a day to an imibassad jr from the republic of Athens to the great kiog of Persia   Artaxerxcs of Longin anits 122 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR whole number of their shipping might be mounted to five hundred â They were farther to get a certain sum of money in readiness  but in other respects to remain quiet and till their preparations could be compleated never to admit more than one Athenian vessel at a time within their ports â The Athenians made a careful survey of the strength of their own alliance and sent pressing embassies to the places round about Peloponnesus to Corcyra to Cephallene to the Acar nanians and to Zacynthus  plainly seeing that if these were in their interest they might securely attack Pelopon nesus on all sides â The minds of both parties were not a little elated but were eager after and big with war For it is natural to man in the commencement of every important enterprize to be more than usually alert The young men who were at this time numerous in Peloponnesus numerous also at Athens were for want of experience quite fond of the rupture And all the rest of Greece stood attentively at gaze on this contention between the two principal states Many oracles were tossed about the soothsayers sung abun dance of predictions amongst those who were upon the point to break and even in the cities that were yet neutral Nay Delos had been lately shook with an earthquake which it had never been before in the memory of the Greeks It was said and indeed believed that this was a prognostic of something extraordinary to happen and all other accidents of an uncommon nature whatever were sure to be wrested to the same meaning The generality of Greece was indeed at this time much the best affected to the Lacedaemonians who gave out the specious pretence that  they were going to recover the li berty of Greece Every one made it both his private pas sion and his public care to give them all possible succour both in word and act and every one thought that the busi ness certainly flagged in those places where he himself was not present to invigorate proceedings So general an aver sion was there at this time formed against the Athenians when some were passionately desirous to throw off their yoke B II YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 and others apprehensive of falling under their subjection â With such preparations and such dispositions did they run into the war The states in league with either party upon the breaking out of the war were these In confederacy with the Lace daemonians were all Peloponnesians within the Isthmus ex cept the Argives and Achaeans for these had treaties subsist ing with both parties But of the Achaeans the Pellenians singly were the first who went over though they were after wards joined by all the rest Without Peloponnesus were the Megareans Locrians Boeotians Phocians Ambraciots Leucadians Anactorians Of these they were supplied with shipping by the Corinthians Megareans Sicyonians Pel lenians Eleans Ambraciots Leucadians with horse by the Boeotians Phocians Locrians  and the other states fur nished them with foot This was the confederacy of the Lacedaemonians With the Athenians were the Chians Lesbians Plataeans the Messenians of Naupactus most of the Acarnanians the Corcyreans Zacynthians and other states tributary to them in so many nations Namely the maritime people of Caria the Dorians that border upon the Carians Ionia Hellespont the cities on the coast of Thrace all the islands situated to the east between Peloponnesus and Crete and all the Cyclades except Melos and Thera Of these they were supplied with shipping by the Chians Les bians Corcyreans  the rest supplied them with foot and with money This was the alliance on both sides and the ability for the war The Lacedaemonians immediately after the attempt on Plataea sent circular orders to the states both within and without Peloponnesus to draw their quotas of aid together and get every thing in readiness for a foreign expedition as intending to invade Attica When all was ready they as sembled on the day appointed with two thirds of the force â These were the Dorians who were seated in the islands of Rhodes Cqi and Cnidui according to the Schotintt 124 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR of every state at the Isthmus When the whole army was thus drawn together Archidamus king of the Lacedimo nians who commanded in the expedition convened the com manders from all the auxiliary states with all those that were in authority and most fitting to be present and addressed them as follows  PELOPONNESIANS and allies many are the expe  ditions in which our fathers have been engaged both with  in and without Peloponnesus Even some of us who are u more advanced in years are by no means unexperienced  in the business of war Yet never before did we take the  field with a force so great as the present But numerous  and formidable in arms as we may now appear we are how  ever marching against a most powerful state Thus is it in  cumbent upon us to shew ourselves not inferior in valour  to our fathers nor to sink below the expectations of the  world The eyes of all Greece are fixed attentively on  our motions Their good will to us their hatred of the  Athenians make them wish for our success in all our un  dertakings It is therefore our business without placing  too great confidence in superior numbers or trusting to the  presumption that our enemies dare not come out to fight  usâ for no reasons like these to relax our discipline or  break the regularity of our marchâ but the commander  of every confederate body and every private soldier ought  to keep within himself the constant expectation of being  engaged in action Uncertain are the turns of war  great  events start up from a small beginning and assaults are  given from indignation Nay frequently an inferior num  ber engaging with caution hath proved too hard for a more  numerous body whom contempt of their enemy exposeth  to attacks for which they are not prepared Upon hostile  ground it is always the duty of soldiers to be resolutely  bold and keep ready for action with proper circumspection â Plutarch informs us tbat the number amounted to sixty thousand B II TEAR I â BEFORE CHRIST 431 125  Thus will they be always ready to attack with spirit and  be most firmly secured against a surprise  We are not marching against a people who are unable  to defend themselves but excellently well qualified for it  in every respect so that we may certainly depend upon  their advancing against us to give us battle â not yet per  haps in motion so long as no enemy appears  but most  assuredly so when once they see us in their territory  wasting and destroying their substance All men must  kindle into wrath when uncommon injuries are unex  pectedly done them when manifest outrage glares before  them Reflection then may indeed have lost its power but resentment most strongly impels them to resistance Something like this may more reasonably be looked for M from Athenians than from other people They esteem  themselves worthy to command others and their spirit is  more turned to make than to suffer depredations Against  so formidable a people are we now to march  and by the  event whatever it be shall we acquire the greatest glory or  disgrace for our ancestors and ourselves â Let it therefore  be the business of every man to follow his commander ob  servant in every point of discipline and the rules of war  and obeying with expedition the orders you receive The  finest spectacle and the strongest defence is the uniform obÂ  servation of discipline by a numerous army When Archidamus had finished his oration and dismissed the assembly the first thing he did was sending to Athens Melesippus a Spartan the son of Diacritus to try whether the Athenians were grown any thing more pliant since they found an army upon the march against them But they would not allow him to come into the city nor grant him a public audience For the advice of Pericles had before this gained the general assent that  no herald or embassy should be received from the Lacedaemonians so long as they were in the field against them They send him back therefore unheard and ordered him  to quit their territories that very  Vol I 2 G 126 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR day that further the Lacedaemonians should retire within their own frontier and then if they had any thing to transact with them should send their ambassadors for the purpose They even commission some persons to guard Melesippus back that he might have no conference with any person whatever When he was brought to the borders and received his dismission he parted from them with these wordsâ  This day is the beginning of great woes to the Grecians Upon his return to the camp Archidamus was convinced that the Athenians were inflexible as ever so that he immediately dislodged and advanced withhis army into their territories â The Boeotians sent their quota of foot and their horse to join the Peloponnesians in this expedition but with the rest of their forces they marched towards Plataea and laid the coun try waste Whilst the Peloponnesians were yet assembling at the Isthmus or yet on the march before they had entered Atti ca Pericles the son of Xantippus who with nine others had been appointed to command the Athenian forces when he saw an irruption from the Peloponnesians unavoidable had conceived a suspicion that Archidamus whom the hospi table intercourse had made his friend from a principle of good nature willing to oblige him would leave his lands untouched or might be ordered to do so by the policy of the Lacedaemonians as they had already demanded an ex communication on his account by which means he must  The tie of hospitality was sacred and inviolable amongst the ancients It was a necessary exertion of humanity at first from the want of inns and lodging houses and was frequently improved into friendship and endear ment This between Pericles and Archidamus was merely of a private nature between the royal family of Sparta and a principal one in the re public of Athens The family of Alcibiades was the public host of the Spartan state and entertained their ambassadors and public ministers The state of Athens had likewise in all places a public host who lodged their ministers Yet amongst private persons it was a frank disinterested tie  when once they had eat salt together or sat at the same table they regarded themselves as under mutual obligations which small points ought not to abolish They who swerved from this laudable custom through caprice or ingratitude were looked upon as infamous execrable persons B II 127 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 certainly incur the public jealousy He declared therefore to the Athenians in a general assembly of the peopleâ That  though Archidamus was his friend he should not be so to  to the prejudice of the state and that if the enemy spared  his lands and houses in the general ravage he made a free  donation of them to the public  so that for any accident of  that nature he ought not to fall under their censure He then exhorted all who were present as he had done before  to  prepare vigorously for war and to withdraw all their ef  fects from out of the countryâ by no means to march out  against the enemy but keep within the walls and mind only  the defence of the city â to fit out their navy in which their  strength principally consisted and keep a tight rein over all  their dependants By the large tributes levied upon those  he said their power was chiefly to be supported since suc  cess in war was a constant result from prudent measures  and plentiful supplies â He exhorted them by no means to  let their spirits droop since besides their certain revenue  six hundred talents were annually paid them by their tri  butary states and they had still in the citadel six thou  sand talents of silver coined Their primary fund was nine thousand seven hundred talents out of which had been taken what defrayed the expence of refitting the gates of the citadel of other public works and the exigencies of Potidaea â That besides this they had gold and silver  uncoined both in public and private repositories many  valuable vases destined for religious uses and their public solemnities and the Persian spoils the whole value of â The account here given sheweth Athens at this time to be have been a very opulent state Heduced to English money it stands thus The tri bute paid them annually amounted to 116 250 sterling The fund yet re maining in the citadel was 1 162 500 sterling Tbey had expended lately on their public works 3 700 talents which is equal to 716 875 sterling The weight of the gold on the statue of Minerva was 40 talents which computing the talent only at 65 Troy to avoid fractions and the gold at 4 sterling an ounce amounts in value to 124 800 sterling 1 8 tHE I ELbPOKNEftlAN WAR  which would not amount to less than five hundred talents â He mentioned further  the great wealth that wa6 stored  up in other temples which they had a right to use  and if  this right should be denied them they might have re  course to the golden ornaments of the Goddess herself He declared  that her image had about it to the weight  of forty talents of gold without alloy all which might be  taken off from the statue â That for the preservation of  their country it might lawfully be employed  but added  that it ought afterwards to be amply replaced In this manner did he render them confident that their funds of money would suffice He told them further that they  had thirteen thousand men that wore heavy armour ex  elusive of those that were in garrisons and the sixteen  thousand on the guard of the city â for so large a num ber draughted from the youngest and oldest citizens and sojourners who wore the heavy armour was employed in this service upon the first invasion of their enemies For the length of the Phalerian wall to the place where it joined the circle of the city was thirty five stadia and that part of the circular wall which was guarded was forty threef in length but that which lay between the long wall and the Phalerian had no guard The long walls continued down to the Piraeus are forty stadia but the outermost of them only was guarded The whole compass of the Piraeus in cluding Munichia is sixty stadia but then only one half of this had a guard He then assured them that they  had including the archers that were mounted twelve  hundred horsemen sixteen hundred archers and three  hundred triremes fit for sea â So great in general and â About 3J English miles f Above 4 miles  About 4 English miles Â About 6 English miles  The whole compass of the walls of Athens was 178 stadia or above 22 Attic miles But according to Dr Arbuthnot the Attic mile consisted of but 805 paces whereas the English is 1056 Hence the compass of Athens appears to have been about 17 English miles B II YEAR I â BEFORE CHRIST 431 129 no less in any one article were the military provisions of the Athenians when the Peloponnesians had formed the de sign of invading them and both sides began the war â These and such like arguments was Pericles continually employing to convince them that they were well able to carry on a successful war The Athenians heard him with attention and followed his advice They withdrew from the country their chil dren their wives all tlie furniture of their houses there pulling down with their own hands the timber of which they were built Their flocks and their labouring cattle they sent over into Euboea and the adjacent islands But this re moval was a very grievous business to them since it had been the ancient custom of many of the Athenians to reside at large in the country This method of living had been more habitual to the Athenians than to any other Greeks from their first com mencement as a people From the time of Cecrops and their first series of kings down to Theseus Attica had been inhabited in several distinct towns each of which had its own Archons and its own Prytaneum and unless in times of danger had seldom recourse to the regal authority since justice was administered in every separate borough and each had a council of its own Sometimes they even warred against one another for instance the Eleusinians when they sided with Kumolpus against Erectheus But when the regal power devolved upon Theseus a man of an extensive understanding and who knew how to govern in several respects he improved the whole territory and be sides dissolving all the councils and magistracies of the petty boroughsf he removed them to the metropolis as it is at present and constituting one grand Senate and Pryta neum made it the point of union in which all concentred â That isâ Magistrates of its own and a common hall in which those magistrates performed the duties of their office in administering justice and offering sacrifices and where they had their diet at the puhlic expence t The number of the boroughs in Attica was one hundred seventy four 130 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR Their private properties he left to them entire but made them rest contented with Athens alone for their city which when all its subjects were now jointly contributing to its support was quickly enlarged and delivered so by Theseus to the succeeding kings In memory of this from the days of Theseus quite down to the present time the Athenians have held an anniversary solemnity to the Goddess which they call Synctcia or Cohabitation Before this that which is now the Citadel and that part which lies on the south side of the citadel was all the city The temples built either within the citadel or without sufficiently shew it For in the south part of the city particularly stand the temples of the Olympian Jove of the Pythian Apollo of Terra and of Bacchus in Linn in honour of whom the old Bacchanalian feasts are celebrated on the twelfth day of the month Anthesterion which custom is still retained to this day by the Ionians of Attic descent All the other ancient temples are seated in the same quarter Near it â The English reader may perhaps call this a hard word but I hope will not be frightened The names of other Attic months will occur in the sequel which I shall leave as I find ihem because no exact correspondence hath been found out between the Attic months which were lunar and those now in use Monsieur Tourreil the celebrated French translator of De mosthenes hath made it a very serious point  I have long doubted says  he whether in my translation I should give the months their old Greek  names or such as they have in our language The reason that made me  balance is the impossibility of computing the months so that they shall  answer exactly to our French My first determination was to date in  our own manner I chose to be less exact rather than frighten the â greatest part of my readers by words to which they are not accustomed  For what French ears would not be appalled at the words Thergolion  Boedroinion Etapheholion c  He then gives reasons for retaining Greek ones and adds  I declare then once for all that I am far from pe  dantically affecting the terms of an old calendar conceived in a language  barbarous to numbers of people who shocked at the sound would per  haps impute to me a taste which thank God I have not I protest that  to my ear no less than to theirs the French name of the word would be  more pleasing and would sound better But neither false delicacy nor  vicious complaisance hath been able to prevail with me to expose myself  to reproaches for knowingly leading others into mistake and using  words appropriated to Roman and solar months which hare no corres S II YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 also is the fountain now called the Enneakrounos or Nine pipe from the manner in which it was embellished by the Tyrants but formerly when all the springs were open called Callirrhat and which as near at hand they pre ferred on the most solemn occasions And that ancient custom is to this day preserved by making use of the same water in connubial and many other religious rites And further it is owing to such their ancient residence in the citadel that it is eminently called by the Athenians to this very day The City In the manner above mentioned were the Athenians for a long series of time scattered about the country in towns and communities at their own discretion And as not only the more ancient but even the latter Athenians quite down to the present war had still retained the custom of dwelling about the country with their families the general removals into the city after they were formed into one body were attended with no small embarrassment and particularly now when they had been refitting their houses and resettling themselves after the Persian invasion It gave them a very sensible grief and concern to think that they must forsake their habitations and temples which from long antiquity it had been their forefathers and their own religious care to frequent that they must quite alter their scene of life and each abandon as it were his native home When they were come into the city some few had houses ready for their reception or sheltered themselves with their friends and relations The greater part  pondence with the lunar or Attic He says a deal on the subject so little affecting his countrymen that since his death they have again thrown all the Greek terms into the margin and placed in the text the incongruous modern ones for the sake of familiar sounds If the English reader be as delicate he may read April or May at his option The ablest chronologcrs are unable to exchange them into currency with any tolerable exactness A great deal of learning might be also displayed about the days of the month and the Grecian method of counting them But as it is exceeding easy to translate these right learning may be excused in a point where no light is wanting â The Pisistratidi 132 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR were forced to settle in the less frequented quarters of the city in all the buildings sacred to the Gods and Heroes except those in the citadel the Eleusinian and any other from whence they were excluded by religious awe There was indeed u spot of ground below the citadel called the Pelasgic which to turn into a dwelling place had not only been thought pro faneness but was expressly forbid by the close of a line in a Pythian oracle which said hi Best is Pelasgic empty Yet this sudden urgent necessity constrained them to convert it to such a use To wrr I own that oracle seems to have carried a different meaning from what they gave it For the calamities of Athens did not flow from the profane habitation of this place but from the war which laid them under a ne cessity of employing it in such a manner The oracle makes no mention of the war but only hints that its being some time inhabited would be attended with public misfortune Many of them further were forced to lodge themselves within the turrets of the walls or wherever they could find a vacant cor ner The city was not able to receive so large a conflux of people But afterwards the Long walls and a great part of the Piraeus were portioned out to them for little dwellings At the same time they were busied in the military preparations gathering together the confederate forces and fitting out a fleet of one hundred ships to infest Peloponnesus In affairs of such great importance were the Athenians engaged The Peloponnesian army advancing forwards came up first to Oenoe through which they designed to break into Attica Encamping before it they made ready their engines and all other necessaries for battering the walls For Oenoe being a frontier town between Attica and Boeotia was walled about since the Athenians were used upon the breaking out of war to throw a garrison into it The enemy made great preparations for assaulting it and by this and other means spent no little time before it This delay was the occasion of drawing very heavy cen sures on Archidamus He had before this been thought 1 II 133 YEAR I â BEFORE CHRIST 431 too dilatory in gathering together the confederate army and too much attached to the Athenians because he never de clared warmly for the war But after the army was drawn together his long stay at the Isthmus and the slow marches he had made from thence exposed him to calumny which was still heightened by the length of the siege of Oenoe  For in this interval of delay the Athenians had without mo lestation withdrawn all their effects from the country though it was the general opinion that had the Peloponnesians ad vanced with expedition they might undoubtedly have seized them were it not for these dilatory proceedings of Archi damus Under such a weight of resentment did Archida mus still lie with his army before Oenoe His remissness was said to be owing to his presumption that the Athenians if their territory was spared would make some concessions and that they dreaded nothing more than to see it destroyed But after their assault on Oenoe and the successive mis carriage of all the methods employed to take it the Athe nians still resolutely refraining from the least shew of sub mission they broke up the siege and marched into Attica in the height of summer when the harvest was ripe about eighty days after the Thebans had miscarried in the surprize of Plataea They were still commanded by Archidamus son of Zeuxidamus king of the Lacedaemonians and having formed their camp began their devastations They first of all ravaged Eleusis and the plain of Thriasia Near Rheiti they encountered and put to flight a party of Athenian horse Then they advanced farther into the country through Ce cropia leaving mount iEgaleon on their right till they came to Acharnae the greatest of all those which are called The Boroughs of Athens They sat down before it and having fortified their camp continued a long time there laying all the adjacent country waste The design of Archidamus in stopping thus before Achar nae keeping there his army ready for battle and not march ing down there this first campaign into the plains is said to Vol I 3 H 134 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR be this He presumed that the Athenians who flourished at that time in a numerous youth and who never before had been so well prepared for war would probably march out against him and would not sit quiet whilst their lands were ravaged before their eyes But when he had advanced to Eleusis and the plain of Thriasia without any resistance he had a mind to try whether laying siege to Acharnae would provoke them to come out This place seemed further to him a convenient spot for a long encampment Besides he could not persuade himself that the Acharnians so consi derable a body amongst the citizens of Athens for three thousand of them now wore the heavy armour could see with patience their own properties ruined by hostile devasta tion without inciting all their fellow citizens to rush out to battle And if the Athenians would not come out against them this campaign he might another campaign with greater security extend his devastation even to the very walls of Athens He thought it not likely that the Acharnians when all their lands had been ruined in this manner would chear fully run into hazards to prevent the losses of others and that hence much dissention might be kindled up amongst â Aristophanes wrote his comedy of The Acharnians upon this plan and abundantly ridiculed the public conduct as injurious to the citizens of Athens Though it was not brought upon the stage till the sixth year of the war it amply shews us how the Acharnians resented their being thus exposed to the ravage of the enemy and how the wits that lived upon the public passions helped still more to exasperate them and misrepresented the measures of the ablest politicians and who perfectly well understood and aimed at the general welfare of the whole community as weak corrupt and mischievous No care to redress and no commiseration for the Acharnians as Dicmopolia hints who was one of that borough  And 4 what it will be said Can this possibly be helped  Be helped do you say why not  Tell me if you can Suppose only that a Lacedxmo nian had stood across in his skiff to Seriphus and after killing a favour ite lap dog got off again safe  Would ye now in this case sit still  Quite the contrary You would immediately be putting out to sea with  three hundred sail of ships Athens would roar with the tumult of  soldiers  the captains of vessels would be shouting pay delivering and our gold Bying about What a bustle would there be in the long portico   what distributing of provisions skins thongs casks full of olives onions in B II 135 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 them Of these imaginary schemes was Archidamus full whilst he lay before Acharnae The Athenians so long as the enemy remained about Eleu sis and the plain of Thriasia conceived some hopes that they would advance no farther They put one another in mind that Pleistoanax son of Pausanias king of the Lacedaemonians when fourteen years before this war he invaded Attica with an army of Peloponnesians came only as far as to Eleusis and Thrias and then retreated without penetrating any farther that upon this account he had been banished Sparta because it looked as if he had been bribed to such an unseasonable re treat But when they saw the enemy advanced to Acharnae which was distant but sixty stadia from Athens they thought their incursions were no longer to be endured It appeared as it reasonably might a heavy grievance to have all their inlands thus ravaged within their sight a scene like this the young er sort never had beheld nor the elder but onceâ in the Persian war The bulk of the people but especially the younger part were for sallying out and fighting and not to stand tamely looking upon the insult Numbers of them assembled toge ther in a tumultuous manner which was the rise of great con fusion some loudly demanding to march out against the ene my and others restraining them from it The soothsayers gave out all manner of predictions which every hearer inter preted by the key of his own passions The Acharnians re garding themselves as no contemptible part of the Athenian body because their lands had been wasted in a most earnest manner insisted upon a sally The whole city was in a fer ment and all their resentment centered on Pericles They quite forgot the prudent conduct he had formerly planned out for them â They reproached him as a general that durst not head them against their enemies and regarded him as author of all the miseries which their city endured  nets ifc t3V Isfc all the decks would be crowded with seamen What a dashing of oars music sounding boatswains bawling nothing but  hurry and confusion Such I am well assured would then be the case â About six English miles 136 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Pericles seeing their minds thus chagrined by the present state of their affairs and in consequence of this intent upon unadviseable measures but assured within himself of the prudence of his own conduct in thus restraining them from action called no general assembly of the people nor held any public consultation lest passion which was more alive than judgment should throw them into indiscretions He kept strict guard in the city and endeavoured as much as possible to preserve the public quiet Yet he was always sending out small parties of horse to prevent any damage that might be done near the city by adventurous stragglers from the army By this means there happened once at Phrygii a skirmish between one troop of the Athenian horse accompanied by some Thessalians and the horsemen of Boe otia in which the Athenians and Thessalians maintained their ground till some heavy armed foot reinforced the Ba otian horse Then they were forced to turn about and some few both Thessalians and Athenians were slain However they fetched off their bodies the same day without the enemy s Leave and the next day the Peloponnesians erected a trophy The aid sent now by the Thessalians was in consequence of an ancient alliance between them and the Athenians These auxiliaries consisted of Larisseans Pharsalians Parasians Cranonians Peirasians Gyrtonians Pheraeans Those from Larissa were commanded by Polymedes and Aristonus each heading those of his own faction those from Pharsalus by Menon  and those from the rest of the cities had their res pective commanders The Peloponnesians when the Athenians made no shew of coming out against them broke up from Acharnae and laid waste some other of the Athenian boroughs which lay between the mountains Parnethus and Brilissus During the time of these incursions the Athenians sent out the hundred ships they had already equipped and which had on board a thousand heavy armed soldiers and four hun dred archers to infest the coast of Peloponnesus The com B II 137 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 manders in the expedition were Carcinus son of Xenotimus Proteas son of Epicles and Socrates son of Antigenes Un der their orders the fleet so furnished out weighed anchor and sailed away The Peloponnesians continuing in Attica till provisions began to fail them retired not by the same route they camt in but marched away through Boeotia And passing by Oropus they wasted the tract of ground called Piraice which was occupied by the Oropians who were subject to Athens On their return into Peloponnesus the army was dispersed into their several cities After their departure the Athenians settled the proper stations for their guards both by land and sea in the same disposition as they were to continue to the end of the war They also made a decree that  a thousand talents should be taken from the fund of treasure in the citadel and laid up by itself that this sum should not be touched but the ex pense of the war be defrayed from the remainderâ and that if any one moved or voted for converting this money to any other use than the necessary defence of the city in case the enemy attacked it by sea he should suffer the penalty of death Beside this they selected constantly every year a hundred of their best triremes with the due number of able commanders These also they made it capital to use upon any other occasion than that extremity for which the reserve of money was destined The Athenians on board the fleet of one hundred sail on the coasts of Peloponnesus being joined by the Corcyreans in fifty ships and by some other of their confederates in those parts hovered for a time and infested the coast and at length made a descent and assaulted Methone a town of Laconia whose walls were but weak and poorly manned It happened that Brasidas the son of Tellis a Spartan had â Here the name of BrcuiJas first occurs and I must beg tlic reader to note him as one who is to make no ordinary figure in the sequel Trained up through the regular and severe discipline ot Sparta he was brave vigi lant and active lie was second to none of his countrymen in those ga A 138 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR then the command of a garrison somewhere near Methone He was sensible of the danger it was in and set forwards with one hundred heavy armed to its relief The Athenian army was then scattered about the country and their attention di rected only to the walls  by which means making a quick march through the midst of their quarters he threw himself into Methone and with the loss of but a few who were inter cepted in the passage effectually secured the town For this bold exploit he was the first man of all who signalized them selves in this war that received the public commendation at Sparta Upon this the Athenians re embarked and sailed away and coming up to Pheia a town of Elis they ravaged the country for two days together A body of picked men of the lower Elis with some other Eleans that were got together from the adjacent country endeavoured to stop their devas tations but coming to a skirmish were defeated by them But a storm arising and their ships being exposed to danger on the open coast they went immediately on board and sail ing round the cape of Icthys got into the harbour of Pheia The Messenians in the mean time and some others who had not been able to gain their ships had marched over land and got possession of the place Soon after the ships being now come about stood into the harbour took them on board and quitting the place put out again to sea By this time a great army of Eleans was drawn together to succour it but the Athenians were sailed away to other parts of the coast where they carried on their depredations About the same time the Athenians had sent a fleet of thirty sail to infes the coast about Locris and at the same time to guard Euboea This fleet was commanded by Cleo qualities which did honour to the Spartans  and was free from all the blemishes which their peculiarity of education was apt to throw upon them such as haughtiness of carriage ferocity of temper and an arrogance which studied no deference or condescension to others He serves his country much by his valour and military conduct and more by his gentle humane and engaging behaviour In a word the distinguishing excellencies both of the Spartan and Athenian characters seem to have been united in this Brasidas â l II YEAR I â BEFORE CHRIST 431 pompus the son of Clinias who making several descents plundered many maritime places and took Thronium He carried from thence some hostages and at Alope defeated a body of Locrians who were marching to its relief The same summer the Athenians transported from iEgina all the inhabitants not only the men but the children and the women reproaching them as the principal authors of the pre sent war And judging they might securely keep possession of iEgina which lay so near to Peloponnesus if they peopled it with a colony of their ownâ with this view not long after they fixed some of their own people in possession of it The Lacedaemonians received the iEgineta e on their expulsion and assigned them Thyraa for their place of residence and the country about it for their subsistence not only on account of their own enmity to the Athenians but the particular obliga tions they lay under to the Eginet for the succour they had given them in the time of the earthquake and the insurrec tion of the Helots The district of Thyraa lies between Ar gia and Laconia declining quite down to the sea Here some of them fixed their residence but the rest were dispersed in to other parts of Greece The same summer on the first day of the lunar month at which time alone it can possibly fall out there was an eclipse of the sun in the afternoon The sun looked for a time like the orescent of the moon and some stars appeared but the full orb shone out afterwards in all its lustre The same summer also the Athenians who had hitherto regarded as their enemy Nymphodorus the son of Pythes of Abdera whose sister was married to Sitalces and who had a great influence over him made him their public friend and in vited him to Athens They hoped by this to gain over Sital ces the son of Teres king of Thrace to their alliance This Teres father of Sitalces was the first who made the kingdom of Odrysa the largest in all Thrace For the greater part of the Thracians are free and governed by their own laws But this Teres was not in the least related to Tereus who marri 140 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR ed from Athens Procne the daughter of Pandion nor did they both belong to the same part of

many poets who make mention of the nightingale do it by the name of the Daulian bird And it is more probable that Pandion matched his daughter to a person at this lesser dis tance from him from the view of mutual advantage than to one seated at Odrysa which is many days journey further off But Teres whose name is not the same with Tereus was the first king of Odrysae and compassed the regal power by violence This man s son Sitalces the Athenians admitted into their alliance hoping he might gain over to their side the cities of Thrace and Perdiccas Nymphodorus arriving at Athens finished the alliance with Sitalces and made his son Sadocus an Athenian He also undertook to bring the war how in Thrace to an end and to persuade Sitalces to send to the Athenians a body of Thracian horsemen and targeteers He also reconciled Perdiccas to the Athenians by procuring for him the restitution of Therme  Immediately after which Perdiccas joined the Athenians and Phormio in the expedi tion against the Chalcideans Thus was Sitalces the son of Teres a Thracian king and Perdiccas the son of Alexander a Macedonian king brought into the Athenian league The Athenians in the fleet of one hundred sail still con tinuing their cruize on the coast of Peloponnesus took So lium a fort belonging to the Corinthians and delivered the place with the district of land belonging to it to the Paliren â Macedonia at this time was not reckoned a part of Greece and both king and people were regarded as Barbarians Alexander father of this Perdiccas was obliged to plead an Argive pedigree in order to assist at the Olympic games And Perdiccas now himself whose successor Alex ander the Great not many years af4er was leader of Greece and conqueror of Asia was at this time balancing between the Lucedxmonians and Athe nians important to either merely as a neighbour to their colonies in Thrice The Greek generals will be sometimes seen in this history to use the monarch of Macedonia very cavalierty B II 141 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 sians exclusively of other Acarnanians They took also by storm Astacus of which Evarchus was tyrant whom they forced to fly away and added the town to their own associa tion Sailing from hence to the island Cephallene they re duced it without a battle Cephallene lies towards Acarna nia and Leucas and hath four cities the Pallensians Cra nians Sampans Pronaeans Not long after this the fleet sailed back to Athens In the autumn of this summer the Athenians with all their forces citizens and sojourners made an incursion into the territories of Megara under the command of Pericles the son of Xantippus Those also who had been cruizing about Peloponnesus in the fleet of one hundred sail for they were now at iEgina finding upon their return that all their fellow citizens were marched in the general expe dition against Megara followed them with the fleet and came up to them By this means the army of the Athe nians became the largest they had ever at any time got to gether the city being now in its most flourishing state and as yet uninfected with the plague For there were of Athenian citizens only no less than ten thousand heavy armed exclu sive of the three thousand who were now at Potidaea The sojourners of Athens who marched out along with them were not fewer than three thousand heavy armed They had besides a very large number of light armed soldiers They laid waste the greatest part of the country and then returned to Athens Every succeeding year of the war the Athenians constantly repeated these incursions into the territory of Megara sometimes with their cavalry and sometimes with all their united force till at last they made themselves mas ters of Nisaea In the close also of the Summer Atalante an island lying near the Locrians of Opus till now uninhabited was forti fied and garrisoned by the Athenians to prevent the pirates of Opus and other parts of Locris from annoying Eubcra Vol I 2 I 142 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR These were the transactions of the Summer after the departure of the Peloponnesians out of Attica The Winter following Evarchus the Acarnanian who had a great desire to recover Astacus prevailed with the Co rinthians to carry him thither with a fleet of forty ships and a force of fifteen hundred heavy armed and endeavour to re establish him He himself also hired some auxiliaries for the same purpose This armament was commanded by Euphymadas son of Aristonymus Timoxenus son of Timo crates and Eumachus son of Chrysis  who sailing thither executed their business They had a mind to endeavour the reduction of some others of the maritime towns of Acarna nia but miscarrying in every attempt they made they re turned home But in their passage touching at Cephallene and debarking upon the lands of the Cranians they were treacherously inveigled into a conference where the Cra nians falling suddenly upon them kill some of their men It was not without difficulty that they drew the others safely off and gained their own ports But the same Winter the Athenians in conformity to the established custom of their country solemnized a public funeral for those who had been first killed in this war in the manner as follows The bones of the slain are brought to a tabernacle erected for the purpose three days before and all are at liberty to deck out the remains of their friends at their own discretion But when the grand procession is made the cypress coffins are drawn on carriages one for every tribe in each of which are separately contained the bones of all who belonged to that tribe One sumptuous bier is carried along empty for those that are lost whose bodies could not be found amongst the slain All who are willing both citizens and strangers attend the solemnity  and the women who were related to the deceased stand near the sepulchre groaning and la menting They deposit the remains in the public sepulchre B II TEAR I BEFOR E CHRIST 431 143 which stands in the finest suburb of the city   for it hath been the constant custom here to bury all who fell in war except those at Marathon whose extraordinary valour they judged proper to honour with a sepulchre on the field of battle As soon as they are interred some one selected for the office by the publice voice and ever a person in great esteem for his understanding and of high dignity amongst them pronounces over them the decent panegyric and this done they depart Through all the war as the occasions recurred this method was constantly observed But over these the first victims of it Pericles son of Xantippus was ap pointed to speak So when the proper time was come walk ing from the sepulchre and mounting a lofty pulpit erected for the purpose from whence he might be heard more dis tinctly by the company he thus began  MANY of those who have spoken before me on these  occasions have commended the author of that law which  we are now obeying for having instituted an oration to the  honour of those who sacrifice their lives in fighting for their  country For my part I think it sufficient for men who  have approved their virtue in action by action to be ho  noured for itâ by such as you see the public gratitude now M performing about this funeral andâ that the virtues of M many ought not to be endangered by the management of  any one person when their credit must precariously de  pend on his oration which may be good and may be bad  Difficult indeed it is judiciously to handle a subject where  even probable truth will hardly gain assent The hearer  enlightened by a long acquaintance and warm in his af  fection may quickly pronounce every thing unfavourably  expressed in respect to what he wishes and what he knows â whilst the stranger pronounceth all exaggerated through  envy of those deeds which he is conscious are above his  own achievement For the praises bestowed upon others 44 are then only to be endured when men imagine they can  do those feats they hear to have been done  They envy 144 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAU  what they cannot equal and immediately pronounce it  false Yet as this solemnity hath received its sanction  from the authority of our ancestors it is my duty also to  obey the law and to endeavour to procure as far as I am  able the good will and approbation of all my audience  I shall therefore begin first with our forefathers since  both justice and decency require we should on this occasion  bestow on them an honourable remembrance In this our  country they kept themselves always firmly settled and  through their valour handed it down free to every since  succeeding generation Worthy indeed of praise are they  and yet more worthy are our immediate fathers  since en  larging their own inheritance into the extensive empire  which we now possess they bequeathed that their work of  toil to us their sons Yet even these successes we ourselves  here present we who are yet in the strength and vigour of  our days have nobly improved and have made such pro  visions for this our Athens that now it is all sufficient in  itself to answer every exigence of war and of peace I  mean not here to recite those martial exploits by which  these ends were accomplished or the resolute defences we  ourselves and our fathers have made against the formidable  invasions of Barbarians and Greeksâ your own knowledge  of these will excuse the long detail Butâ by what methods  we have rose to this height of glory and power  by what  polity and by what conduct we are thus aggrandized I  shall first endeavour to shew and then proceed to the  praise of the deceased These in my opinion can be no  impertinent topics on this occasion  the discussion of them 4 must be beneficial to this numerous company of Athenians  and of strangers  We are happy in a form of government which cannot  envy the laws of our neighbours â for it hath served as a  model to others but is original at Athens And this our  form as committed not to the few but to the whole body  of the people is called a democracy How different soever B II 145 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431  in a private capacity we all enjoy the same general equali  ty our laws are fitted to preserve and superior honours  just as we excel The public administration is not confined  to a particular family but is attainable only by merit â  Poverty is not a hindrance since whoever is able to serve  his country meets with no obstacle to preferment from his first obscurity The offices of the state we go through with  out obstructions from one another  and live together in the  mutual endearments of private life without suspicions  not  angry with a neighbour for following the bent of his own  humour nor putting on that countenance of discontent  which pains though it cannot punishâ so that in private life  we converse without diffidence or damage whilst we dare  not on any account offend against the Public through the  reverence we bear to the magistrates and tlje laws chiefly  to those enacted for redress of the injured and to those un  written a breach of which is allowed disgrace Our laws  have further provided for the mind most frequent intermis  sions of care by the appointment of public recreations and  sacrifices throughout the year elegantly performed with a  peculiar pomp the daily delight of which is a charm that  puts melancholy to flight The grandeur of this our Athens  causeth the produce of the whole earth to be imported  here by which we reap a familiar enjoyment not more of  the delicacies of our own growth than of those of other na  tions  In the affairs of war we excel those of our enemies  who adhere to methods opposite to our own For we lay  open Athens to general resort nor ever drive any stranger  from us whom either improvement or curiosity hath  brought amongst us lest any enemy should hurt us by â Beside the vast number of festivals which were celebrated at Athens with pompous processions costly sacrifices and sometimes public games the presidents in course offered up sacrifices every morning constancy fur the public welfare 146 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  seeing what is never concealed We place not so great a  confidence in the preparatives and artifices of war as in the  native warmth of our souls impelling us to action In point of education the youth of some people are inured by a course  of laborious exercise to support toil and exercise like men  but we notwithstanding our easy and elegant way of life  face all the dangers of war as intrepidly as they This  may be proved by facts since the Lacedaemonians never in  vade our territories barely with their own but with the uni  ted strength of all their confederates But when we in  vade the dominions of our neighbours for the most part we  conquer without difficulty in an enemy s country those who  fight in defence of their own habitations The strength of  our whole force no enemy yet hath ever experienced be  cause it is divided by our naval expeditions or engaged in  the different quarters of our service by land But if any  where they engage and defeat a small party of our forces  they boastjngly give it out a total defeat and if they are  beat they were certainly overpowered by our united strength  What though from a state of inactivity rather than laborious  exercise or with a natural rather than an acquired valour  we learn to encounter danger â this good at least we re  ceive from it that we never droop under the apprehension  of possible misfortunes and when we hazard the danger  are found no less courageous than those who are continu  ally inured to it In these respects our whole community  deserves justly to be admired and in many we have yet to  mention  In our manner of living we shew an elegance tem  pered with frugality and we cultivate philosophy without  enervating the mind We display our wealth in the sea  son of beneficence and not in the vanity of discourse A  confession of poverty is disgrace to no man no effort  to avoid it is disgrace indeed There is visibly in the same  persons an attention to their own private concerns and  those of the public  and in others engaged in the labours  It 147 TEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431  of life there is a competent skill in the affairs of govern  ment For we are the only people who think him that  does not meddle in state affairsâ not indolent but good for nothing And yet we pass the soundest judgments and  are quick at catching tbe right apprehensions of things not  thinking that words are prejudicial to actions but rather  the not being duly prepared by previous debate before we  are obliged to proceed to execution Herein consists our  distinguishing excellence that in the hour of action we shew  the greatest courage and yet debate beforehand the expe  diency of our measures The courage of others is the re  suit of ignorance  deliberation makes them cowards And  those undoubtedly must be owned to have the greatest souls  who most acutely sensible of the miseries of war and the  sweets of peace are not hence in the least deterred from  facing danger  In acts of beneficence further we differ from the man  We preserve friends not by receiving but by conferring  obligations For he who does a kindness hath the advan  tage over him who by the law of gratitude becomes a debtor  to his benefactor The person obliged is compelled to act 44 the more insipid part conscious that a return of kindness is  merely a payment and not an obligation And we alone  are splendidly beneficent to others not so much from inte  rested motives as for the credit of pure liberality I shall  sum up what yet remains by only adding that our Athens  in general is the school of Greece  and that every single  Athenian amongst us is excellently formed by his personal  qualifications for all the various scenes of active life acting 44 with a most graceful demeanor and a most ready habit of  dispatch  That I have not on this occasion made use of a pomp 44 of words but the truth of facts that height to which by 44 such a conduct this State hath rose is an undeniable  proof For we are now the only people of the world whÂ 44 are found by experience to be greater than in reportâ the 148 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  only people who repelling the attacks of an invading  enemy exempts their defeat from the blush of indigna  tion and to their tributaries yields no discontent as if  subject to men unworthy to command That we deserve  our power we need no evidence to manifest We have  great and signal proofs of this which entitle us to the ad  miration of the present and of future ages We want no  Homer to be the herald of our praise no poet to deck  off a history with the charms of verse where the opinion  of exploits must suffer by a strict relation Every sea hath  been opened by our fleets and every land hath been pe  netrated by our armies which have everywhere left bc  hind them eternal monuments of our enmity and our  friendship  In the just defence of such a State these victims of 4 their own valour scorning the ruin threatened to it have M valiantly fought and bravely died And every one of  those who survive is ready I am persuaded to sacrifice  life in such a cause And for this reason have I enlarged  so much on national points to give the clearest proof  that in the present war we have more at stake than men  whose public advantages are not so valuable and to il  lustrate by actual evidence how great a commendation is  due to them who are now my subjects and the greatest w part of which they have already received For the enco  miums with which I have celebrated the State have been  earned for it by the bravery of these and of men like  these And such compliments might be thought too high  and exaggerated if passed on any Grecians but them  alone The fatal period to which these gallant souls are  now reduced is the surest evidence of their meritâ an  evidence begun in their lives and compleated in their  deaths For it is a debt of justice to pay superior honours u to men who have devoted their lives in fighting for their  country though inferior to others in every virtue but that of valour Their last service effaceth all former demerits B II TEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431 149  it extends to the public  their private demeanors reached  only to a few Yet not one of these was at all induced to  shrink from danger through fondness of those delights  which the peaceful affluent life bestows â not one was the  less lavish of his life through that flattering hope attend  ant upon want that poverty at length might be ex  changed for affluence One passion there was in their  minds much stronger than these the desire of venge ance on their enemies Regarding this as the most ho  nourable prize of dangers they boldly rushed towards the  mark to glut revenge and then to satisfy those secon  dary passions The uncertain event they had already se  cured in hope  what their eyes shewed plainly must be  done they trusted their own valour to accomplish think  ing it more glorious to defend themselves and die in the  attempt than to yield and live From the reproach of  cowardice indeed they fled but presented their bodies to  the shock of battle  when insensible of fear but tri  umphing in hope in the doubtful charge they instantly  droptâ and thus discharged the duty which brave men owe  to their country  As for you who now survive themâ it is your business  to pray for a better fateâ but to think it your duty also to  preserve the same spirit and warmth of courage against your enemies  not judging of the expediency of this from  a mere harangueâ where any man indulging a flow of  words may tell you what you yourselves know as well as  he how many advantages there are in fighting valiantly  against your enemiesâ but rather making the daily in  creasing grandeur of this community the object of your  thoughts and growing quite enamoured of it And when  it really appears great to your apprehensions think again  that this grandeur was acquired by brave and valiant  men  by men who knew their duty and in the moments  of action were sensible of shame  who whenever their  attempts were unsuccessful thought it dishonour their Vol I  2 K 150 THE JMXOPONNESIAN WAR country could stand in need of any thing their valour  could do for it and so made it the most glorious present  Bestowing thus their lives on the public they have every  one received a praise that will never decay a sepulchre  that will always be most illustriousâ not that in which  their bones lie mouldering but that in which their fame  is preserved to be on every occasion when honour is the  employ of either word or act eternally remembered  This whole earth is the sepulchre of illustrious men  nor  is it the inscriptions on the columns in their native soil  alone that shews their merit but the memorial of them  better than all inscriptions in every foreign nation repo  sited more durably in universal remembrance than on  their own tomb From this very moment emulating these noble patterns placing your happiness in liberty  and liberty in valour be prepared to encounter all the  dangers of war For to be lavish of life is not so noble  in those whom misfortunes have reduced to misery and  despair as in men who hazard the loss of a comfortable  subsistence and the enjoyment of all the blessings this  world affords by an unsuccessful enterprize Adversity  after a series of ease and affluence sinks deeper into the  heart of a man of spirit than the stroke of death insensibly  received in the vigour of life and public hope  For this reason the parents of those who are now gone  whoever of them may be attending here I do not bewail  1 shall rather comfort It is well known to what un  happy accidents they were liable from the moment of their  birth  and that happiness belongs to men who have reach  the most glorious period of life as these now have who  are to you the source of sorrow â these whose life hath  received its ample measure happy in its continuance and  equally happy in its conclusion I know it in truth a diffi  cult task to fix comfort in those breasts which will have  frequent remembrances in seeing the happiness of others  of what they once themselves enjoyed And sorrow 8 II 151 YEAR I BEFORE CHRIST 431  flows not from the absence of those good things we have  never yet experienced but from the loss of those to which  we have been accustomed They who are not yet by age  exempted from issue should be comforted in the hope of  having more The children yet to be born will be a private  benefit to some in causing them to forget such as no  longer are and will be a double benefit to their country  in prerenting its desolation and providing for its security  For those persons cannot in common justice be regarded  as members of equal value to the public who have no  childnn to expose to danger for its safety But you  whose age is already far advanced compute the greater  share Â f happiness your longer time hath afforded for so  much jain persuaded in yourselves the remainder will be  but short and enlighten that space by the glory gained by  these It is greatness of soul alone that never grows old  nor is t wealth that delights in the latter stage of life as  some give out so much as honour  To jou the sons and brothers of the deceased whatev  er number of you are here a field of hardy contention  is opened For him who no longer is every one is ready  to commend so that to whatever height you push your de  serts jou will scarce ever be thought to equal but to be  somewhat inferior to these Envy will exert itself against  a competitor whilst life remains but when death stops the  competition affection will applaud without restraint  If af er this it be expected from me to say any thing to  you wto are now reduced to a state of widowhood about female virtue I shall express it all in one short admonition  It is your greatest glory not to be deficient in the  virtue peculiar to your sex and to give the men as little handle aapossible to talk of your behaviour whether well  or ill  I have now discharged the province allotted me by the laws and said what I thought most pertinent to this as  sembly Our departed friends have by facts been already 152 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR  honoured Their children from this day till they arrive at  manhood shall be educated at the public expence of the  State which hath appointed so beneficial a need for  these and all future relicts of the public contests For  wherever the greatest rewards are proposed fo virtue  there the best of patriots are ever to be found â jâ Now  let every one respectively indulge the decent grief for his M departed friends and then retire Such was the manner of the public funeral solemnized this winter and with the end of which the first year of this war was also ended  YEAR II J IN the very beginning of summer the Pelopoinesians and allies with two thirds of their forces made an incursion as before into Attica under the command of Arciidamus son of Zeuxidamus king of the Lacedaemonians anl having formed their camp ravaged the country They had not been many days in Attica before af sick â The law was that they should be instructed at the public ejoence and when come to age presented with a compleat suit of armour aid honour ed with the first seats in all public ptaces t The historian in the funeral oration hath given us a very exaled idea of the Athenian state and the distinguishing excellencies of that himune and polite people The plague which now broke out enables him O contrast his pieces and give his history a most agreeable variety It is iow going to be exceeding solemn serious and pathetic It is as a historian and not as a phytician that he gives us the relation of it A relation whiih in gene ral hath been esteemed an elaborate and complete performance He pro fesseth to give an accurate detail of it The accuracy hath gentrally been allowed but it hath been blamed as too minute Lucretius hovever hath transferred all the circumstances mentioned by Thucydides into his own poem 1 6 enlarging still more minutely upon them  and yet this is tbe greatest ornament and certainly the least exceptionable part of sis poen Lucretius an excellent poet affected to write with the precisionof a pli losopher  and Thucydides the historian always composed with the spirt of a poet Hippocrates hath left some cases of the plague which he hati recited as a physician  but not one of them is dated at Athens Thuc dides hath mentioned nothing of his practising there much less of hs practising with success He says on the contrary that all human at was totally unavailing  and bis follower Lucretius that  Mussabat taci B II YEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430  153 ness began first to appear amongst the Athenians such as was reported to have raged before this in other parts as about Lemnos and other places Yet a plague so great as this and so dreadful a calamity in human memory could not be paral lelled The physicians at first coidd administer no relief through utter ignorance  nay they died the fastest the closer their attendance on the sick and all human art was totally unavailing Whatever supplications were offered in the tem ples whatever recourse to oracles and religious rites all were insignificant at last expedients of this nature they totally re linquished overpowered by calamity It broke out first as it is said in that part of Ethiopia which borders upon Egypt it afterwards spread into Egypt and Lybia and into great part of the king s dominions and from thence it on a sudden fell on the city of the Athenians The contagion shewed itself first in the Piraeus which occasioned a report that the Peloponne sians had caused poison to be thrown into the wells for as yet there were no fountains there After this it spread into the upper city and then the mortality very much increased Let every one physician or not freely declare his own sentiments about it let him assign any credible account of its rise or the causes strong enough in his opinion to introduce so terri ble a scene 1 shall only relate what it actually was and as from an information in all its symptoms none may be quite at a loss about it if ever it should happen again I shall give to medicina timore The letters of Hippocrates which mention this af fair are certainly spurious The facts they would establish are without any grounds as Le Clerc hath proved to conviction in his Histoirc de la nude cine 1 3 They make the plague to have broke out first in Europe and to have spread from thence into the dominions of the king of Persia This is quite contrary to the account of Thucydides and to the experience of eve ry age All plagues and infectious distempers have had their rise in Africa Need I say more than that Dr Mead hath proved it  But whe ther his account of this plague at Athens be duly succinct not too minute serious affecting  and whether Thucydides hath well managed the op portunity it gave him to moralize like a man of virtue and good sense every reader will judge for himself The transtator hath chiefly endeavoured to preserve that solemn air which he thought the prime distinction of the original V 154 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR an exact detail of them  having been sick of it myself and seen many others afflicted with it This very year as is universally allowed had been more than any other remarkably free from common disorders or whatever diseases had seized the body they ended at length in this But those who enjoyed the most perfect health were sud denly without any apparent cause seized at first with head achs extremely violent with inflammations and fiery redness in the eyes Withinâ the throat and tongue began instantly to be red as blood the breath was drawn with difficulty and had a noisome smell The symptoms that succeeded these were sneezing and hoarseness  and not long after the malady de scended to the breast with a violent cough But when once settled in the stomach it excited vomitings in which was thrown up all that matter physicians call discharges of bile at tended with excessive torture A great part of the infected were subject to such violent hiccups without any discharge as brought upon them a strong convulsion to some but of a short to others of a very long continuance The body to the out ward touch was neither exceeding hot nor of a pallid hue but reddish livid marked all over with little pustules and sores Yet inwardly it was scorched with such excessive heat that it could not bear the lightest covering or the finest linen upon it but must be left quite naked They longed for nothing so much as to be plunging into cold water and many of those who were not properly attended threw themselves into wells hur ried by a thirst not to be extinguished and whether they drank much or little their torment still continued the same The restlessness of their bodies and an utter inability of com posing themselves by sleep never abated for a moment And the body so long as the distemper continued in its height had no visible waste but withstood its rage to a miracle so that most of them perished within nine or seven days by the heat that scorched their vitals though their strength was not ex hausted  or if they continued longer the distemper fell in to the belly causing violent ulcerations in the bowels ac companied with an incessant flux by which many reduced Â II YEAR II BEEORE CHRIST 430 155 to an excessive weakness were carried off For the malady beginning in the head and settling first there sunk afterwards gradually down the whole body And whoever got safe through all its most dangerous stages yet the extremities of their bodies still retained the marks of its violence For it shot down into their privy members into their fingers and toes by losing which they escaped with life Some there were who lost their eyes  and some who being quite recover ed had at once totally lost all memory and quite forgot not only their most intimate friends but even their own selves For as this distemper was in general virulent beyond expres sion and its every part more grievous than yet had fallen to the lot of human nature so in one particular instance it ap peared to be none of the natural infirmities of man since the birds and beasts that prey on human flesh either never ap proached the dead bodies of which many lay about uninter red  or certainly perished if they ever tasted One proof of this is the total disappearance then of such birds for not one was to be seen either in any other place or about any one â This passage is translated close to the letter of the original It was in tended by the author to shew the excessive malignancy of the plague as the very Beth of the dead bodies was so fatally pestilential to carnivorous animals â Either they never tasted  or if they tasted died One proof of this is presumptive arising from the disappearance of all birds of prey The second was certain and an object of sensible observation Every body could see that dogs those familiar animals who live with and accompany men abroad either never tasted or if hunger at any time forced them to it they certainly lost their lives Lucretius literally translates the circum stance itself but hath enlarged in the proofs and intimates that the distem per raged amongst those animals even without eating the flesh of the dead and was general to every living species Multaque hum cum inhumata jacerent corpora supra Corporibus tamen alituum genus atque ferarum Autprocul absiliebat ut acrem exiret odorem  Aut ubi gustarat languebat morte propinqua Nec tamen omnino tcmere illis solibus ulla Comparebat avis nec noctibu ssecla ferarum Exibant sylvis  languebant pleraque morbo Et moriebantur  cum primis fida canum vis  Strata viis animam ponebat in omnibus aegram  Extorquebat enim vitam vis morbida membrit 156 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR of the carcases But the dogs because of their familiarity with man afforded a more notorious proof of the event The nature of this pestilential disorder was in generalâ for I have purposely omitted its many varied appearances or the circumstances particular to some of the infected in contradiction to othersâ such as hath been described None of the common maladies incident to human nature prevailed at that time  or whatever disorder any where appeared it ended in this Some died merely for want of care and some with all the care that could possibly be taken nor was any one medicine discovered from whence could be promised any certain relief since that which gave ease to one was prejudicial to another Whatever difference there was in bodies in point of strength or in point of weakness it availed nothing  all were equally swept away before it in spite of regular diet and studied prescriptions Yet the most affecting circumstances of this calamity wereâ that dejec tion of mind which constantly attended the first attack  for the mind sinking at once into despair they the sooner gave themselves up without a struggleâ and that mutual tenderness in taking care of one another which commu nicated the infection and made them drop like sheep This latter case caused the mortality to be so great For if fear withheld them from going near one another they died for want of help so that many houses became quite desolate for want of needful attendance  And if they ventured they were gone This was most frequently the case of the kind â This passage is thus translated upon the authority of Dr Mead in his treatise on the Plague which convinced me that the comma should be omit ted in the original after x and be governed of Â Lucretius hath given it a different turn as if the resemblance to sheep was not in their dying fast but to the forlorn and solitary manner in which those creatures die  and lie

abandon their friends when their menial servants no longer able to en dure the groans and lamentations of the dying had been compelled to fly from such a weight of calamity But those especially who had safely gone through it took pity on the dying and the sick because they knew by experience what it really was and were now secure in themselves for it never seized any one a second time so as to be mortal Such were looked upon as quite happy by others and were them selves at first overjoyed in their late escape and the ground less hope that hereafter no distemper would prove fatal to them Beside this reigning calamity the general removal from the country into the city was a heavy grievance more particularly to those who had been necessitated to come thi ther For as they had no houses but dwelled all the sum mer season in booths where there was scarce room to breathe the pestilence destroyed with the utmost disorder so that they lay together in heaps the dying upon the dead and the dead upon the dying Some were tumbling one over another in the public streets or lay expiring round about every fountain whither they had crept to assuage their immoderate thirst The temples in which they had erected tents for their reception were full of the bodies of those who had expired there For in a calamity so outra geously violent and universal despair things sacred and holy had quite lost their distinction Nay all regulations observed before in matters of sepulture were quite con founded since every one buried wherever he could find a place Some whose sepulchres were already filled by the numbers which had perished in their own families were shamefully compelled to seize those of others They sur prised on a sudden the piles which others had built for their own friends and burned their dead upon them  and some whilst one body was burning on a pile tossed another bodv they had dragged thither upon it and went their way Vol I 2 L 158 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Thus did the pestilence give their first rise to those ini quitous acts which prevailed more and more in Athens For every one was now more easily induced openly to do what for decency they did only covertly before They saw ie strange mutability of outward condition the rich un timely cut off and their wealth pouring suddenlv on the in digent and necessitous  so that they thought it prudent to catch hold of speedy enjoyments and quick gusts of plea sure  persuaded that their bodies and their wealth might ba their own merely for the day Not any one continued reso lute enough to form any honest or generous design when so uncertain whether he should live to effect it Whatever he knew could improve the pleasure or satisfaction of the present moment that he determined to be honour and in terest Reverence of the Gods or the laws of society laid no restraints upon them  either judging that piety and impiety were things quite indifferent since they saw that all men perished alike or throwing away every apprehension of being called to account for their enormities since justice might be prevented by death  or rather as the heaviest of judgments to which man could be doomed was already hanging over their heads snatching this interval of life for pleasure before it fell With such a weight of calamity were the Athenians at this time on all sides oppressed Their city was one scene of death and the adjacent country of ruin and devastation In this their affliction they called to mind as was likely they should the following predict ion which persons of the greatest age informed them had been formerly made Two heavy judgments will at once befall A Doric war without a plague within your wall There had indeed been a dispute before whether their ancestors in this prediction read Am Â a plague or Auw3 a famine Yet in their present circumstances all with proba bility agreed that aÂ 7 Â Â a plague was the right For they B II 159 YEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430 adapted the interpretation to what they now suffered â But in my sentiments should they ever again be engaged in a Doric war and a famine happen at the same time they will have re course with equal probability to the other interpretation It was further remembered by those who knew of the oracle given to the Lacedaemonians that when they inquired of the God  whether they should engage in this war his answer was thatâ if they carried it on with all their strength they should  be victorious and he himself would fight on their side â and therefore they concluded that what now befel was the com pletion of the oracle The pestilence broke out immediately upon the irruption of the Peloponnesians and never extended itself to Peloponnesus a circumstance which ought to be re lated It raged the most and for the longest time in Athens but afterwards spread into the other towns especially the most populous â And this is an exact account of the plague The Peloponnesians after they had ravaged the inland parts extended their devastations to those which are called The Coast as far as Mount Laurium where the Athenians had silver mines And here they first ravaged the part which looks towards Peloponnesus and afterwards that which lies towards Euboea and Andros But Pericles who was then in the command persisted in the same opinion as before in the former incursion that  the Athenians ought not to march out against them Yet whilst the enemy was up in the country before they had advanced as far as the coast he had equipped a fleet of a hundred ships to invade Peloponnesus  and when every thing was ready he put to seaf On board these ships â The silver mines at Laurium originally belonged to private persons but were united to the public domain by Themistocles A great number of slaves were employed in working them and the produce paid amply for all the labour bestowed upon them Whether the state was much enriched by them is a question  the undertakers and proprietors of the slaves who wrought them drew great wealth from them as we are told by Xenophon in his treatise of revenue t Plutarch relates in the life of Pericles that on this occasion when all wus ready  when the f rces were shipped and Pericles himself was jus 160 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR he had embarked four thousand heavy armed Athenians and in vessels for transporting horse now first fitted up for this ser vice out of old ships three hundred horsemen The Chians and the Lesbians joined in the expedition with fifty sail At the very time this fleet went to sea from Athens they left the Peloponnesians on the coast of Attica When they were ar rived before Epidaurus a city of Peloponnesus they ravaged great part of the country about it and making an assault on the city itself had some hopes of taking it but did not succeed Leaving Epidaurus they ravaged the country about Troexene Halias and Hermione  all these places are situated on the seacoast of Peloponnesus But sailing hence they came be fore Prasiae a fort of Laconia situated upon the sea around which they laid the country waste  and having taken the fort by assault demolished it After these performances they re turned home and found the Peloponnesians no longer in At tica but retired within their own dominions The whole space of time that the Peloponnesians were upon the lands of the Athenians and the Athenians employ ed in their sea expedition the plague was making havoc both in the troops of the Athenians and within the city This occasioned a report that the Peloponnesians for fear of the infection as having been informed by deserters that it raged in the city and been witnesses themselves of their frequent interments retired out of their territory with some precipitation Yet they persevered in this incursion longer than they had ever done before and had made the whole  got on board hi trireme the sun was eclipsed It soon grew so dark  that all men were astonished at so dreadful a prodigy Pericles seeing  his own pilot quite terrified and confounded threw a cloak over his face  and wrapping him up in it asked Whether he saw any thing dreadful 4 or any thing that portended danger  The pilot answering in the nega  tive What difference then he went on between this affair and that  unless that what hath darkened the sun is bigger than a cloak Pericles had easily learned of his preceptor Anaxagoras how to account for eclipses But whether Plutarch hath placed this incident in right time is a ques tion  For Tbucydides who is exact in these things mentions no eclipse of the sun this summer B II TEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430 161 country one continued devastation  for the time of their con tinuance in Attica was about forty days The same summer Agnon the son of Nicias and Cleo pompus the son of Clinius joined in the command with Pe ricles setting themselves at the head of the force which he had employed before carried them without loss of time against the Chalcideans of Thrace But when they were come up to Potideea which was still besieged they played their engines of battery against and left no method unat tempted to take it But the success in this attempt did not answer expectation nor indeed was the event in any respect the least proportioned to their great preparations  For the plague followed them even hither and making grievous havoc among the Athenians destroyed the army  so that even those soldiers that had been there before and had from the begin ning of the siege been in perfect health caught the infection from the troops brought thither by Agnon Phormio and the body of sixteen hundred men under his command had be fore this quitted Chalcidico so that Agnon sailed back with the ships to Athens of his four thousand men the plague having swept away one thousand and fifty in about forty days  But the soldiers who were there before were left to carry on the siege of Potidaea After the second incursion of the Peloponnesians the Athenians whose lands were now a second time laid waste who felt the double affliction of pestilence and war had en tirely changed their sentiments of things The blame was universally thrown on Pericles as if at his instigatiou they had engaged in this war and by him had been plunged in all these calamities They desired with impatience to make up die breach with the Lacedaemonians but though they dis patched an embassy for this purpose no terms could be agreed on Thus grievously distressed and no method of resource occurring to their minds their resentments fell still heavier on Pericles He seeing them quite dispirited with their pre sent misfortunes and intent on such projects as he had reason 162 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR to expect they would called a general assembly of the people which by still continuing in the command of the army he was authorised to do He had a mind to encourage them to soothe the hot resentments fermenting in their breasts and bring them into a more calm and confident temper He pre sented himself before them and spoke as follows  I FULLY expected I freely own it to become the  object of your resentments I am not ignorant of the  causes of it and for this purpose have convened this as  sembly to expostulate with nay even to reprimand you  if without any reason you make me the mark of your dis  pleasure or cowardly sink under the weight of your mis  fortunes For it is my firm opinion that by the full health  and vigour of a state the happiness of its constituents is  better secured than when each separate member is thriv  ing whilst the public welfare totters Be the situation of  any private person prosperous and fine as his heart can  wishâ if his country be ruined he himself must neces  sarily be involved in that ruin But he that is unfortunate  in a flourishing community may soon catch hold of expe a dients of redress When therefore your country is able  to support the misfortunes of its every member and yet  each of those members must needs be inveloped in the  ruin of his country why will you not join and unite  your efforts to prevent that ruinâ and not as you are  now going to do because confounded with your do  mestic misfortunes basely desert the public safety and  cast the most unjust of censures upon me who advised  this war upon your own selves also who approved this H advice Whatâ I am the man that must singly stand the  storm of your anger  1 am indeed the man who I  am confident is not inferior to any one amongst you in  knowing what ought to be known and in speaking what  ought to be spoke who sincerely loves his country and is t superior to all the sordid views of interest For he wh B II YEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430  thinks aright and yet cannot communicate his own thoughts  is just as insignificant as if he could not think at all He  that enjoys both these faculties in perfection and yet is an  enemy to his country will in like manner never say any  thing for his country s good  Or though he love his coun  try and be not proof against corruption he may prostitute every thing to his own avarice If therefore you judged  my qualifications in all these respects to be in some mode  rate degree superior to those of other men and were thus  drawn into a war by my advice there can certainly be no  reason why I should be acccused of having done you wrong  Those indeed who are already in the fast possession of all  the ends attainable by war must make a foolish choice if  they run to arms  But if once under a necessity either  through tame submission to be enslaved by a neighbour  power or by a brave resistance to get the mastery over  themâ he who flies danger in such a case is much more  worthy of reproach than he who meets it with bold defiance  I indeed am the man I was and of the mind I was  It is you whose resolutions have wavered â you who  whilst unhurt through my persuasion resolved on war and  repent so soon as you feel its strokesâ who measure the  soundness of my advice by the weakness of your own judg  ments and therefore condemn it because the present disasters  have so entirely engaged the whole of your attention that  you have none left to perceive the high importance of it to  the public Cruel indeed is that reverse of fortune which  hath so suddenly afflicted you dejecting your minds and  dispiriting your former resolutions  Accidents sudden and  unforeseen and so opposite to that event you might reasona  bly have expected enslave the mind â which hath been your  case in all the late contingencies and more particularly so  in this grievous pestilence Yet men who are the constitu   ents of such a mighty State and whose manners have been  by education formed for its support ought never to want  that inward fortitude which can stem the greatest of afflic THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  tions nor by self desertion utterly to efface their native dig  nity The world will always have equal reason to condemn  the person who sinks from a height of glory by his own  pusillanimity and to hate the person who impudently pre  tends to what he never can deserve It must be therefore  your duty to suppress this too keen a sensibility of your own  private losses and with united fortitude to act in the de  fence of the public safety Let us therefore bravely un  dergo the toils of this war  and if the toil increaseth let  our resolution increase with it And let these added to all  those other proofs of my integrity I have exhibited on other  occasions suffice to convince you that your present censures  and suspicions of me are rash and groundless  I shall now lay before you a point which so far as I  can judge you have as yet never properly considered nor  have I in any former discourse insisted uponâ the  means within your reach of rising to supreme dominion  Nor should I meddle even now with a point pompous be  yond poetic visions did I not see you beyond measure fear  ful and dejected You think you are only masters of your  own dependents but I loudly aver that you are greater  masters now both at land and sea those necessary spheres  for carrying on the services of life than any other power   and may be greater yet if so inclined There is not now  a king there is not any nation in the universal world able to withstand that navy which at this juncture you can â Pericles here is about to convince the Athenians that they may rise to supreme dominion in consequence of their naval superiority It was his ambi tion to execute the grand extensive plan which was formed originally by Themistocles And the words in which he introduceth this topic are so full of energy that they bear hard upon a translator He calls it a point KtnTrHfartpaet ix l4 r m ir oiraeitiTii My first attempts at them were very faint and imperfect I was soon convinced of it by the greatest genius of the age who did me the honour to read over this speech in manuscript and who as he thinks and speaks like Pericles could not endure that any of his words should be depreciated I hope now I have expressed all the ideas

the loss of your houses and lands  those intolerable damages which you think you have suf  fered â It is not so reasonable to grieve and despond un  der such petty losses as to despise from the thought that they are merely the trappings and embellishments of  wealth to fix the firm remembrance within us that liber  ty in defence of which we are ready to hazard our all  will easily give us those trifles again and that by tamely  submitting to our enemies the possession of all we have  will be taken from us We ought not in either of these  respects to degenerate from our fathers By toil and toil  alone they gained these valuable acquisitions defended  themselves in the possession and bequeathed the precious  inheritance to us And to lose the advantages we have  possessed will be much more disgraceful than to have mis  carried in their pursuit But we ought to encounter our  enemies not with valour only but with confidence of suc  cess Valour starts up even in a coward if he once prevails  through lucky ignorance  but such a confidence must be  in every mind which is seriously convinced of its own  superiority as is now our case Nay even when the match  is equal the certainty of what must be done arising from  an inward braver adds the greater security to courage  Confidence then is not built on hope which acts only in  uncertainty but on the sedate determination of what it is  able to perform an assurance of which is more guarded  against disappointments  It is further your duty to support the public character  as in it to a man you pride yourselves with which its ex  tensive rule invests our community and either not to fly  from toils or never to aim at glory Think not you have  only one point at stake the alternative of slavery instead of  freedom but think also of the utter loss of sovereignty  and the danger of vengeance for all the offences you have  given in the practice of it To resign it is not in your Vol I 2 M 166 THK PELOPONNESIAN WAR  power and of this let him be assured who refines  through fear and hopes to earn indemnity by exerting it  no longer In your hands it hath run out into a kind of  tyranny To take it up seems indeed unjust but to lay it 41 down is exceeding dangerous And if such dastardly  souls could persuade others they would soon bring this  state to utter ruin or indeed any other where they were  members and enjoyed the chief administration of affairs  For the undisturbed and quiet life will be of short continu  ance without the interposition of a vigilant activity Sla  very is never to be endured by a state that once hath go  vernedâ such a situation can be tolerable only to that which  hath ever been dependent  Suffer not yourselves therefore to be seduced by men  of such mean and groveling tempers nor level your re  sentments at meâ since though I advised the war it was  not begun without your approbationâ if the enemy hath invaded in such a manner as you could not but expect  from your own resolutions never to be dependent What  though beyond our apprehensions we have suffered the Â sad visitation of pestilence Such misfortunes no hu  man foresight will be able to preventâ though I know  that even this hath in some measure served to sharpen  your aversion to me But if this be just I claim as my lawful right the glory of all those happy contingencies  which may ever befal you beyond your expectation The  evils inflicted by heaven must be borne with patient resig nation and the evils by enemies with manly fortitude  Such rational behaviour hath hitherto been habitual in  Athens let it not now be reversed by you  by you  who know to what a pitch of excellence this State hath  rose in the esteem of the world by not yielding to adver  sity but by braving all the horrors of war and pouring forth its blood in the glorious cause hath reached the  highest summit of power and ever since retained it The  memory of this time itself will never be able to efface B II YEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430 167  even though we may suffer it to droop and perish in our  handsâ as what is human must declineâ Our memory I say  who though Grecians ourselves gave laws to all other Gre  cians stood the shock of most formidable wars resisted  them all when combined against us conquered them all when  separately engaged and maintained ourselves in possession  of the most flourishing and most powerful State in the world  These things let the indolent and sluggish soul condemn but  these let the active and industrious strive to emulate for  these they who cannot attain will envy  To be censured and maligned for a time hath been the  fate of all those whose merit hath raised them above the  common level â but wise and judicious is the man who en  joying the superiority despiseth the envy An aversion so  conceived will never last His merit soon breaks forth in all  its splendour and his glory is afterwards handed down to  posterity never to be forgot You who have so clear a pros  pect before you both of what will be some time glorious and  of what at present is not disgraceful recollect your own  worth and secure both Sink not so low as to petition terms  from the Lacedaemonians nor let them imagine that you feel  the weight of your present misfortunes The man whose re  solution never sinks before it but strives by a brave opposi  tion to repel calamity suchâ whether in a public or private  capacityâ must be acknowledged to be the worthiest man By arguments like these did Pericles endeavour to mollify the resentments of the Athenians against himself and to divert their minds from their public calamities In regard to the public they seemed to be satisfied with all that he had urged  they desisted from soliciting an accommodation with the La cedaemonians  and were more hearty than ever for continuing the war Yet in their own private concerns they were griev ously dejected under their present misfortunes The poor citizens who had but little could not bear with patience the loss of that little The rich and the great regretted the loss of their estates with their country seats and splendid furniture â but 168 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR worst of all that instead of peace they had the sad alternative of war However neither poor nor rich abated their displea sure to Pericles till they had laid upon him a pecuniary fine And yet no long time afterâ so unsteady are the humours of the peopleâ they elected him general again and intrusted him with the administration of affairs The keen sense they had at first of their own private losses soon grew blunt and unaffect ing and they could not but allow him the most capable per son to provide for all the urgent necessities of the public For the supreme authority he enjoyed in times of peace he had exercised with great moderation  he was vigilant and active for the good of the community which never made so great a figure as under his administration  and after war broke out it is plain he best knew the reach of its ability to carry it on He lived two years and six months from its commencement and after his deathf his judicious foresight in regard to this â Plutarch in the life of Pericles says authors are not agreed about the quantity of the fine al this time laid upon Pericles Some lower it to fif teen talents others mount it up to fifty The demagogue who incited the people to fine him is also said by some to have been Clean with whose ge nius and character the reader will soon become acquainted t As the historian is here going to take his leave of Pericles he adjoins a true representation of his patriot spirit his great abilities his judicious foresight and successful administration And here the reader may be in formed of some points which Thucydides either thought needless when he wrote or foreign to his subject Pericles had two sons by his former wife The eldest of them proved a great vexation to his father who was unable to support him in his expensive way of living Pericles had no large estate and he was not rjcher for fingering the public money He Uid it all out in adorning his Athens and was rewarded for it by giving so many magnificent and lasting proofs of his fine taste in painting sculpture and building For the city of Rome received not so much decoration from her foundation till the time of the Caesars as Athens did from Pericles alone Yet economy was his passion at home as that of his son Xantippus was luxury This son however was taken off by the plague as was after wards a sister of Pericles most of his intimates and relations and his other son Paralus This last was the heaviest blow  he fell it deeply  And all Athens did all that lny in their power to comfort him since contrary to a Uw of Pericles own making the enrolled his son Pericles whom he had by Aspasia an Athenian of the full blood At length he was seized him self by the plague  and after languishing a long lime in a manner differ B II 169 YEAR II BET0RE CHRIST 430 war was more and more acknowledged For he had assured them the 7 could not fail of success provided they would not meddle by land but apply themselves solely to their navy without being solicitous to enlarge their territories in this war or exposing Athens itself to danger But they had re course to schemes quite opposite to these nay even to some that had no connexion at all with this Avar wherein private ambition or private interest pushed them to such management as was highly prejudicial to themselves and their allies When ever these politic schemes succeeded private persons carried off all the honour and advantage â whenever they miscar ried the hardships of the war fell more severely on the State The reason was this Pericles a man of acknowledged worth and ability and whose integrity was undoubtedly proof against corruption kept the people in order by a gentle ma nagement and was not so much directed by them as their prin cipal director He had not worked himself into power by indirect methods and therefore was not obliged to sooth and ent to most others died of it In his last moments lie shewed to â friend who was visiting him a charm which the women had hung about his neck as if he was sick indeed when he could submit to such foolery When several of them were sitting round his bed anil thinking he did not hear them were enumerating the great exploits of his life the shining incident of his administration his victories and the nine trophies he had erected he interrupted them with these words  I wonder you lay stress upon such  actions in which fortune claims a share along wilh me and which many  others have performed as well as myself and yet pass over the highest glory and most valuable part of my character that no citizen of Athens ever put on mourning through me The wonderful man though en gaged flirty years in business and constantly attacked by every furious se ditious and turbulent Athenian had never amidst all his power given way to the spirit of revenge For this as Plutarch finely observes he in some measure deserved the lofty title of 0 mpian too arrogant in any other light for man to wear since gentleness of manners and the hahils of mercy and forgiveness raise men to the nearest resemblance of the Gods Plutarch adds that the Athenians never regretted any man so much and with so much reason â If the reader be willing to hear any more of Astasia the same writer tells us that afier the death of Pericles she married one Lysicles u low and obscure man and a dealer in cattle whom bowevei s te improved into an Athenian of the first class 170 THE PEL0P0NNESIAN WAR Â honour their caprices but could contradict and disregard their anger with peculiar dignity Whenever he saw them bent on projects injurious or unreasonable he terrified them so by the force of his eloquence that he made them tremble and desist and when they were disquieted by groundless apprehensions he animated them afresh into brave resolution The State under him though stiled a democracy was in fact a monarchy His successors more on a level with one ano ther and yet every one affecting to be chief were forced to cajole the people and so to neglect the concerns of the pub lic This was the source of many grievous errors as must unavoidably be the case in a great community and possessed of large dominion â but in particular of the expedition to Sicily  the ill conduct of which did not appear so flagrantly in relation to those against whom it was undertaken as to the authors and movers of it who knew not how to make the pro per provision for those who were employed in it For en gaged in their own private contests for power with the people they had not sufficient attention to the army abroad and at home were embroiled in mutual altercations Yet notwith standing the miscarriage in Sicily in which they lost their army with the greater part of their fleet and the sedition which instantly broke out in Athens they bravely resisted for three years together not only their first enemies in the war but the Sicilians also in conjunction with them the greater part of their dependents revolted from them and at length Cyrus the king s son who favouring the Peloponnesi ins supplied them with money for the service of their fleet â nor would at last be conquered till by their own intestine feuds they were utterly disabled from resisting longer So much better than any other person was Pericles acquainted with their strength when he marked out such a conduct to them as would infallibly have enabled the Athenian State to have continued the war longer than the Peloponnesians could possibly have done The Lacedaemonians in junction with their allies the same summer fitted out a fleet oi one hundred ships against fc II  YEAR II BEFORE DCHRIST 430 in the island Zacynthus which lies over against Elis They are a colony of the Achaeans of Peloponnesus and were then in league with the Athenians On board this fleet were a thousand heavy anryed Lacedaemonians and Cne mus the Spartan commanded in the expedition Making a descent upon the island they ravaged great part of the coun try â but finding the entire reduction of it impracticable they re embarked and returned home In the close of the same summer Aristeus the Corinthian Aneristus Nicolaus Protodemus and Timagoras of Tegea ambassadors from the Lacedaemonians and Polis the Ar give without any public character travelling into Asia to engage the Persian king to supply them with men and money for carrying on the war on their journey stop first in Thrace and address themselves to Sitalces the son of Teres They had a mind to try if they could prevail upon him to quit the Athenian alliance to march to the relief of Potidaea now besieged by the Athenians to desist for the future from giving the latter any assistance and to obtain from him a safe conduct through his territory for the con tinuance of their journey beyond the Hellespont to Phar naces son of Pharnabazus who would afterwards conduct them in safety to the royal court Learchus the son of Callimachus and Ameiniadas the son of Philemon happen ing at that time to be with Sitalces on an embassy from Athens persuade the son of Sitalces who had been made a citizen of Athens to seize and deliver them up to them that they might not go fonvard to the king to the prejudice of that community of which he was a member He hearken ing to their advice arrests them just as they were going on shipboard to cross the Hellespont after they had travelled through Thrace to the spot marked for their embarkation He executed this by means of some trusty persons dispatched purposely after them along with Learchus and Ameiniades and expressly ordered to deliver them up to the latter They so soon as they had got them in their power carried them to Athens Upon their arrival there the Athenians 172 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR standing in great fear of Aristeus lest upon escape he might do them further mischief since before this he had been the author of all the projects to their prejudice both at Potidaea and in Thrace put them to death on the very day of their arrival unjudged and suing in vain to be heard and cast them into pits This cruel usage of them they justified from the example of the Lacedaemonians who had in the same manner put to death and cast into pits the Athenian mer chants and those of their allies whom they had seized in the trading vessels upon the coasts of Peloponnesus For in the beginning of the war the Lacedaemonians had put to death as enemies all those whom they could take at seaâ not those only who belonged to the States in alliance with the Athenians but even such as were of the yet neutral com munities About the same time in the end of summer the Ambra ciots in conjunction with many of the Barbarians whom they had excited to take up arms invaded Argos of Amphi lochia and made excursions over all its dependent territory Their enmity against the Argives took its original from hence This Argos was first built and this province of Amphilochia first planted by Amphilochus the son of Am phiaraus immediately after the Trojan war who on his re turn home being dissatisfied with the state of affairs in that ether Argos founded this city in the gulf of Ambracia and gave it the same name with the place of his nativity It soon became the largest city of Amphilochia and the inha bitants were most powerful of any thereabouts Yet many generations after being sunk by misfortunes they pre vailed upon the Ambraciots bordering upon Amphilochia to unite with them This community of residence brought them to their present use of one common language the Greek But the rest of the Amphilochians are still Barba rians Yet in process of time the Ambraciots drive the Argives from amongst them and keep possession of the city for themselves Upon this event the Amphilochians threw II YEAR II BEFORE CHRIST 430 173 themselves under the protection of the Acarnanians and both together implored the succour of the Athenians who sent thirty ships to their assistance under the command of Phor mio Upon Phormio s arrival they take Argos by storm make all the Ambraciots slaves and then both the Amphilo chians and Acarnanians settle themselves together in the city To these incidents was first owing the league offensive and defensive between the Athenians and Acarnanians The chief cause of the inveteracy which the Ambraciots bore to the Argives was their having made them in this manner slaves  and which afterwards impelled them in the confusion of this war to form this invasion with the junction of the Chaonians and some other neighbouring Barbarians Ad vancing up to Argos they were entire masters of the whole territory but in vain endeavoured to take the town by as sault  upon which they again returned home and dispersed to their respective nations â Such were the transactions of the summer On the first approach of winter the Athenians sent out twenty ships to cruize on the coasts of Peloponnesus under the command of Phormio  who fixing his station before Naupactus kept so strict a guard that nothing durst pass in nor out from Corinth and the gulf of Crissa â Six other ships they send to Caria and Lycia under the command of Mele sander to levy contributions there and to stop the excursions of the Peloponnesian privateers harbouring in those parts from molesting the course of their trading vessels from Pha celis Phoenicia and the adjacent continent MeUsander with the Athenian and confederate force he had on board his ships landed in Lycia and was defeated in the first battle in which he lost part of his army and his own life The same winter the Potidaeans as they were no longer able to hold out the siege  and as besides the irruptions of the Peloponnesians into Attica had not induced the Athenians to raise it their provisions being quite spent and amongst other calamities to which their extremities had reduced them Vol I 2 N 174 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR having been forced to feed upon one another they held a parley about their surrender with the Athenian officers who commanded in the siege Xenophon the son of Euripides Hestiodorus the son of Aristoclides and Phanomachus the son of Callimachus They sensible of the hardships their troops suffered by long lying abroad in the winter season and that the carrying on of the siege had already cost Athens two thousand talentsf granted them a composition The terms agreed on were these  That they should quit the place  with their wives their children and auxiliaries every man  with one suit of clothing but the women with two  and with  a certain sum of money to defray the expence of their de  parture By virtue of this composition they went away to Chalcis where every one shifted for himself But the Athe nians called their r wc s to account for their conduct because they had signed this composition without their privity for they thought it in their power to have made them surrender at discretion and afterwards sent to Potidaea some of their peo ple whom they settled in a colony there â These things were done this winter and so ended the second year of this war the history of which hath been compiled by Thucydides â In this siege of Potidaca two persons served amongst the heavy armed as private soldiers one of whom was the glory of human nature  and the other the glory and bane of his country I mean the divine Socrates and at this time young Alcibiades Plutarch in the life of Alcibiades says they lay in the same tent and fought always side by side Once in a sharp skirmish both of them distinguished themselves above all their fellow sol diers Alcibiades at length was wounded and dropped Socrates stood over and defended him and saved both

CHRIST 429 175 YEAR III EARLY the next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies omitting the incursion as before into Attica marched their forces against Plateea Archidamus son of Zeuxida mus king of the Lacedaemonians commanded  who having encamped his army was preparing to ravage the adjacent country He was interrupted by an embassy from the Pla taeans who addressed themselves to him in the following manner  The war O Archidamus and Lacedaemonians you are  now levying on Plataea is a flagrant breach of common justice a blemish on your honour and that of your fathers  Pausanias the Lacedaemonian son of Cleombrotus when  â aided by those Grecians who cheerfully exposed them  selves with him to the dangers of that battle which was  fought on our landâ he had delivered Greece from Per  sian slavery at a public sacrifice to Jupiter the deliverer  solemnized by him on that occasion in the public forum  of Plataea called all the confederates together and there  conferred these privileges on the Plataeansâ That they M should have free possession of the city and territory be  longing to it to be governed at their own discretion â  that no one should ever unjustly make war upon them or  endeavour to enslave them and in case of such attempts  all the confederates then present should avenge it to the  utmost of their power Such grateful returns did your  fathers make us in recompence of our valour and the zeal  we excited in the common dangers Yet their generosity  you are now reversingâ you with the Thebans our inve  terate foes are come hither to enslave us But by the  Gods who were then witnesses to the oath they swore by  all the tutelary Deities both of your own and of our com  munity we adjure you to do no damage to Plataean  ground nor to violate your oaths but to retire and leave 176 THE KLOPONNESIAN WAR  us in that state of independence which Pausanias justly  established for us To these words of the Plateans Archidamus made this replyâ  What you have urged ye men of Plateea is just and rea  sonable if it be found agreeable to your actions Let the  declarations of Pausanias be observed be free and inde  pendent yourselves and at the same time vindicate their  own freedom to others to those who after participation of  the same common dangers made that oath in your favour  and yet are now enslaved by the Athenians To rescue  them and others from that slavery have our preparations  been made this war hath been undertook You who know  what liberty is and are such advocates for it do you abide  firmly by your oaths at least as we heretofore advised you  keep at quiet enjoying only what is properly your own   side with neither party  receive both in the way of friend  ship in the way of enmity neither â To a conduct like this  we never shall object When the Plataean ambassadors had heard this reply of Archidamus they returned into the city and communicating what had passed to the body of the citizens they carried back in answer to himâ That they could not possibly cora  ply with his proposals without the consent of the Athe  nians because their wives and children were in their  power that they were apprehensive a compliance might  endanger their whole community since in such a case ei  ther the Athenians might not confirm the neutrality or  the Thcbans who were comprehended in the same neutral  oath to the two principal powers might again attempt to  seize their city â Archidamus to remove their apprehen sions spoke as follows  Deliver up your city and your  houses to us Lacedaemonians let us know the bounds of  your territory and the exact number of your trees and  make as true a calculation as you possibly can of all that a belongs to you Depart yourselves and reside wherever  you please so long as the war continues  at the end of it B II YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 177  we will restore every thing again In the mean time we  will make the best use of every thing intrusted to us and  pay you an annual equivalent for your subsistence Upon hearing this they again returned into the city and the whole body of the people assisting at a general consultation they returned for answerâ That they desired only to communi  cate the proposals to the Athenians and then with their  approbation would accept them In the mean time they  begged a suspension of arms and to have their lands spared  from depredation He granted them a truce for the time requisite to receive an answer and forbore ravaging the country The ambassadors of Plntaea having been at Athens and consulted with the Athenians return again with this answer to their city  The Athenians say that in no preceding  lime ever since we entered into confederacy with them  did they ever suffer us in any respect to be injured  that  neither will they neglect us now but send us a powerful  aid And you they solemnly adjure by the oaths which  your fathers have sworn to admit no change or innovation  in the league subsisting between you and them â When the ambassadors had thus delivered the answer of the Athe nians after some consultation the Plateeans resolved  never  to desert them to bear any devastation of their lands nay  if such must be the case to behold it with patience and to  suffer any extremities to which their enemies might reduce  them  that further no person should stir out of the city  but an answer be given from the wallsâ That it was im  possible for them to accept the terms proposed by the Lace  daemonians This was no sooner heard than Archidamus the king made this solemn appeal to all their tutelary Heroes and Gods â Ye Gods and Heroes said he who protect this  region of Plataea bear witness to us that it was not till  after a violation of oaths already sworn that we have  marched into this country where our fathers through the 178 THE HELOPONNESIAN WAS  blessings you sent down upon their prayers overcame the  Medes and which you then made that fortunate field  whereon the arms of Greece were crowned with victoryâ  and that whatever we shall here undertake our every step  shall be agreeable to justice We have offered many ho  nourable conditions to them which are all rejected  Grant therefore our supplications that the first trans  gressors of justice may receive their punishment and that  those who fight with equity may obtain revenge After this solemn address to the Gods he roused up his army into action He first of all formed an inclosure round about them with the trees they had felled so that no one could get out of the city In the next place they raised a mount of earth before the place hoping that it could not long hold out a siege against the efforts of so large an army Having felled a quantity of timber on mount Cithaeron with it they framed the mount on either side that thus cased it might perform the service of a wall and that the earth might be kept from mouldering away too fast Upon it they heaped a quantity of matter both stones and earth and whatever else would cement together and increase the bulk This work employed them for seventy days and nights without intermission all being alternately employed in it so that one part of the army was carrying it on whilst the other took the necessary refreshments of food and sleep Those Lace daemonians who had the command over the hired troops of the other States had the care of the work and obliged them all to assist in carrying it on The Plataeans seeing this mount raised to a great height built a counterwork of wood close to that part of the city wall against which this mount of earth was thrown up and strengthened the inside of it with bricks which they got for this use by pulling down the adjacent houses The wooden case was designed to keep it firm together and prevent the whole pile from being weak ened by its height They farther covered it over with B II YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 179 sheep skins and hides of beasts to defend the workmen from missive weapons and to preserve the wood from being fired by the enemy This work within was raised to a great height and the mount was raised with equal expedition â without Upon this the Plataeans had recourse to another device They broke a hole through the wall close to which the mount was raised and drew the earth away from under it into the city But this being discovered by the Pelopon nesians they threw into the hole hurdles made of reeds and stuffed with clay which being of a firm consistence could not be dug away like earth By this they were excluded and so desisted for a while from their former practice Yet digging a subterranean passage from out of the city which they so luckily continued that it undermined the mount they again withdrew the earth from under it This prac tice long escaped the discovery of the besiegers who still heaping on matter yet the work grew rather less as the earth was drawn away from the bottom and that above fell in to fill up the void However still apprehensive that as they were few in number they should not be able long to hold out against such numerous besiegers they had recourse to another project Thev desisted from carrying on the great pile which was to counterwork the mount and beginning at each end of it where the wall was low they run another wall in the form of a crescent along the inside of the city that if the great wall should be taken this might afterwards hold out might lay the enemy under a necessity of throwing up a fresh mount against it and that thus the further they advanced the difficulties of the siege might be doubled and be carried on with increase of danger When their mount was compleated the Peloponnesiaus played away their battering engines against the wall  and one of them they worked so dextrously from the mount against the great pile within that they shook it very much and threw the Platreans into consternation Others they applied in different parts against the wall the force of which was 180 THE PELOPONNES AJi WAR broke by the Plataeans who threw ropes around them  they also tied large beams together with long chains of iron at both ends of the beams by which they hung downwards from two other transverse beams inclined and extended be yond the wall â these they drew along obliquely and against whatever part they saw the engine of battery to be aimed they let go the beams with a full swing of the chains and so dropped them down directly upon it which by the weight of the stroke broke off the beak of the battering ma chine Upon this the Peloponnesians finding all their en gines useless and their mount effectually counterworked by the fortification within concluded it a business of no little hazard to take the place amidst so many obstacles and pre pared to draw a circumvallation about it But first they were willing to try whether it were not pos sible to set the town on fire and burn it down as it was not large by help of a brisk gale of wind for they cast their thoughts towards every expedient of taking it without a large expence and a tedious blockade Procuring for this purpose a quantity of faggots they tossed them from their own mount into the void space between the wall and the inner fortification As many hands were employed in this busi ness they had soon filled it up and then proceeded to toss more of them into the other parts of the city lying beyond as far as they could by the advantage which the eminence gave them Upon these they threw fiery balls made of sul phur and pitch which caught the faggots and soon kindled such a flame as before this time no one had ever seen kindled by the art of man It hath indeed sometimes hap pened that wood growing upon mountains hath been so heated by the attrition of the winds that without any other cause it hath broke out into fire and flame But this was exceeding fierce  and the Plataeans who had baffled all other efforts were very narrowly delivered from perishing by its fury  for it cleared the city to a great distance round Kbout so that no Plataean durst approach it And if the B II 181 YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 wind had happened to have blown along with it as the ene my hoped they must all unavoidably have perished It is now reported that a heavy rain falling on a sudden attended with claps of thunder extinguished the flames and put an end to this imminent danger The Peloponnesians upon the failure of this project marched away part of their army  but continuing the re mainder there raised a wall of circumvallation quite round the city the troops of every confederate state executing a determinate part of the work Both inside and outside of this wall was a ditch and by first digging these they had got materials for brick This work being compleated about â the rising of Arcturus they left some of their own men to guard half of the wall the other half being left to the care of the Boeotians  then marched away with the main army and dismissed the auxiliary forces to their respective cities The Plataeans had already sent away to Athens their wives their children their old people and all the useless crowd of inhabitants There were only left in the town during this siege four hundred Plataeans eighty Athenians and one hundred and ten vomen to prepare their food This was the whole number of them when the siege was first formed  nor was there any other person within the wall either slave or free â And in this manner was the city of Plataea besieged in form The same summer and about the time that the army ap peared before Plataea the Athenians with a body of their own people consisting of two thousand heavy armed and two hundred horsemen invaded the Chalcideans of Thrace and the Bottiaeans The corn was in the ear when this army was led against them under the command of Xeno phon the son of Euripides and two colleagues Coming up to Spartolus a town in Bottiaea they destroyed the corn and hoped to get possession of the place by the management of â Beginning of September Vol I 2 O 182 THE PELOPOVNESIAN WAR a faction they had within But a contrary party having sent in good time to Olynthus had procured from thence an aid of heavy armed and other force for their protection These even made a sally out of Spartolus and forced the Athenians to a battle under the walls of the town The heavy armed Chalcideans with some of their auxiliaries are defeated by the Athenians and retire into Spartolus The horse and light armed Chalcideans get the better of the horse and light armed Athenians but they had with them a small number of targeteers from the province called Cru sis On the first joining of battle other targeteers came to their assistance from Olynthus The light armed of Spar tolus seeing this reinforcement just come up and reflecting that they had received no loss before with reanimated cou rage again charge the Athenians in conjunction with the Ghalcidean horse and the fresh reinforcement The Athe nians retire to the two companies which they had left to guard the baggage Here they drew up again and when ever they thought proper to charge the enemy fell back  when they retreated from the charge the enemy pressed upon and infested them with missive weapons The Ghal cidean horse rode up where they thought they could break them and falling in without fear of a repulse put the Athe nians to flight and pursued them to a great distance The Athenians fly for refuge to Potidaea  and afterwards obtain ing a truce to fetch off their dead return with their shattered army to Athens In this action they lost four hundred and thirty men and all their commanders The Chalcideans and Bottiaeans erected a trophy and having taken proper care of their dead separated to their own cities Not long after this in the same summer the Ambraciots and Chaonians who aimed at the total reduction of Acar nania and to compass a general defection there from the Athenians prevailed upon the Lacedaemonians to supply them with shipping from their confederate cities and to send a thousand heavy armed into Acarnania They told B II 183 YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 them thatâ if they would join them with a land and a  naval force at the same time it would be impossible for  the Acarnanians to succour one another by sea that  hence they might easily get all Acarnania into their power  from whence they might become masters of Zacynthus  and Cephallene and a stop would then be made to the  Athenian cruizes on the coasts of Peloponnesus nay  that there was even a hope of reducing Naupactus This scheme was pleasing to the Lacedaemonians who or dered Cnemus yet their admiral to sail thither with a few ships having on board the heavy armed  and circulated or ders to their confederates to fit out their ships and repair with all expedition to Leucas The Corinthians were those who shewed most zeal for the Ambraciots a colony of their own and the shipping of Corinth Sicyon and the adjacent places was prepared with all possible expedition but that of Leucas Anactorium and Ambracia was already at Leu cas and waiting for the rest Cnemus and the thousand heavy armed performed their voyage undiscovered by Phor mio who commanded the Athenian fleet of twenty sail stationed round Naupactus and immediately landed his men for the destined service Besides the thousand Peloponne sians he brought with him he was now joined by the Am braciots Leucadians Anactorians of the Grecians of the Barbarians by a thousand Chaonians not subject to a regal government but commanded by Photius and Nicanor men of those families which had a right to command by an nual election With the Chaonians came the Thesprotians who also had no king Sabylinthus guardian of their king Tharyps yet a minor led the Melossians and Antitanians The Paravaeans were headed by their own king Ordoeus who had also the command of a thousand Orestians subjects of Antiochus which served with his troops by the permission of Antiochus Perdiccas sent also a thousand Macedonians of which the Athenians were ignorant but these were not yet come up 184 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR With these forces Cnemus began his march without waiting the arrival of the ships from Corinth and passing through Argia they destroyed Limnaea a village unfortified They march next for Stratus the capital city of Acarnania judging that if they first took this all other places would readily submit The Acarnanians finding a large army broke in amongst them by land and more enemies coming to attack them by sea gave up all view of succouring one another and stood separately on their own defence They sent information to Phormio and requested him to come up to their relief He sent them word  he could not possibly  leave Naupactus without a guard when a fleet was ready  to sail from Corinth The Peloponnesians and their allies dividing themselves into three bodies advanced to wards the city of the Stratians with a design to appear before it and if it did not surrender at once to storm it without loss of time The Chaonians and the rest of the Barbarians marched in the middle to the right were the Leucadians Anactorians and their auxiliaries to the left Cnemus with his Peloponnesians and the Ambraciots  each body at so great a distance from the rest that sometimes they were out of one another s sight The Grecians in their march kept firm within ranks and guarded all their motions till they came up to the spot fit for their encampment But the Cha onians confident of their own bravery and valuing them selves as the most martial people in that part of the world could not bear the delay of encamping but with the rest of the Barbarians rushing eagerly forwards thought to take the town at a shout and carry all the honour The Stratians finding them thus advanced thought that could they master them thus detached the Grecians would become more averse to attack them With this view they place ambuscades in the approaches of the city and when the enemy was near rush up at once from the places of ambush and out of the city charging them on all sides The Chaonians are thrown into consternation and many of them are slain The rest B II YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 185 of the Barbarians when they saw them give way durst not keep their ground but fled immediately Neither of the Grecian bodies knew anything of this engagement so hastily had those advanced and were supposed to have done it only to encamp with greater expedition But when the Barbari ans came running back to them in disorderly rout they re ceived them into shelter and all closing firm together stood quiet the rest of the day The Stratians durst not directly assault them because the other Acarnanians were not yet come up to their assistance but were continually slinging at them from a distance thus harassing them abundantly but unable without better weapons to make them dislodge  The Acarnanians only could have attacked them with effectual vigour By the favour of a dark night Cnemus withdrew his army by a quick march to the river Anapus which is eighty stadia distant from Stratus The next day he obtains a truce to fetch off the dead And the Oeniadae coming up in a friend ly manner to his relief he went to take refuge amongst them before the Acarnanians could draw their succours together and from thence the forces which composed his army march ed to their own homes But the Stratians erected a trophy on account of their victory over the Barbarians The fleet of Corinth and the other confederate states that was to sail from the gulf of Crissa to attend the orders of Cnemus and prevent the Acarnanians on the coast from suc couring those within the land never arrives  For about the time of the action at Stratus they had been compelled to fight the Athenian squadron of twenty ships stationed at Naupactus under the command of Phormio Phormio had watched their coming out of the gulf intending to attack so soon as ever they got out to sea The Corinthians and their allies sailed out indeed yet not so well prepared to fight by sea as to forward the land expedition on Acaniania They never â About eight miles 186 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR imagined that the Athenians with their twenty ships durst pre sume to attack them who had forty seven Yet when they saw them steering the same course on the opposite shore they kept first along their own coast and afterwards from Patrae of Achaia stretched over to the opposite side in order to make for Acarnania Butnow again they descried them standing direct ly against them from Chalcis and the river Evenus and found they had observed their anchoring the night before Thus are they compelled to come to an engagement in the midst of the open sea The ships of every state were under the com mand of those who had been appointed by their principals  Over the Corinthians were Machon Isocrates and Agathar chidas The Peloponnesians drew up their ships in form of a circle as large as they possibly could without leaving open a passage for the ships of the enemy The heads of the ships stood to sea the sterns were turned inwards Within were ranged the small vessels that attended the fleet and five ships that were prime sailers which were to start out at narrow passages wherever the enemy should begin the attack The Athenians drawing up their ships in a line and sailing quite round them brushed along by them in their passage and making successive feints of engaging forced them to draw into a smaller compass Phormio had beforehand given strict orders not to engage without the signal for he hoped the enemy could not long preserve that order of battle like â Phormio was watching to catch them in the open sea it tv ti f u af Â as Thucydidea words it above They were now out of the gulf stretching across the sea in the midst of which Phormio came up to them and en gaged ara aurti r x oftftit The sea without the capes that form the mouth of the gulf of Crissa is indeed a narrow sea or ttiptfiiir but then it was open sea in regard to the gulf within the capes and gave Phormio all the advantages which more expert seamen knew how to use As the Peloponnesian Heet stood out from Petra in Achaia and the Athenian from Chalcis in ittolia the situation of those two places easily guides to the place of the engagement Phormio got a deal of honour by this action which Plutarch in his piece about the glory of the Athenians reckons up amongst the most remarkable exploits related by our historian B II TEAK III BEFORE CHRIST 429 187 a land army but that the ships must fall foul upon one ano ther and the small vessels within give them no little embar rassment  that further the wind would blow out of the gulf as was usual every morning  in expectation of which he con tinued to sail round about them and then they could not pos sibly keep firm in their stations for any time He thought farther that the time of engagement was entirely in his own power as his ships were best sailers and that it was most ad viseable to begin at such a juncture As soon as that wind be gan to rise and the greater ships now contracted into a nar row circle were disordered both by the wind and the smaller vessels within one falling foul upon another the poles ap plied to push them off again  amidst the noise caused by this confusion calling out to take care and cursing one another they could no longer hear the orders of their commanders or their masters  and the sea beginning to run so high as to ren der useless the oars of unexperienced mariners as they were they left the unmanageable ships to the pilots art Exactly at this juncture Phormio gives the signal The Athenians engage and at the first shock sink one of the admiral ships and several more afterwards in the different parts of the en gagement They pursued their success with so much fury that amidst the general disorder not one durst think of resist ing but all with the greatest precipitation fled towards Pa tra e and Dyme of Achaia The Athenians pursuing and taking twelve of their ships and having slaughtered most of the crews draw off to Molychrium  and having erected a trophy on the promontory and consecrated a ship to Nep tune returned to their station at Naupactus The Peloponnesians without loss of time crept along the coast with the remnant of their fleet saved at Patra and Dyme to Cyllene a dock belonging to the Eleans  whither after the battle of Stratus arrived also from Leucas Cnemus and the ships of that station which ought to have been joined by these other The Lacedaemonians send thither Timocrates Brasidas and Lycophron to assist Cnemus in 188 THE PELOPONKESTAN WAR his naval conduct ordering him to get ready for a more suc cessful engagement and not to leave the dominion of the sea to such a small number of ships For their late defeat ap peared to them quite unaccountable especially as this was the first trial they had of an engagement at sea nor could they think it so much owing to a want of skill in naval affairs as to a want of courage never balancing the long experience of the Athenians with their own short application to these matters These persons therefore they sent away in anger who coming to Cnemus issued their circular orders to the states for new quotas of shipping and refitted what was al ready there for another engagement Phormio also sends messengers to Athens with an account of these preparations and to report the victory they had already gained  request ing a further reinforcement of as many ships as they could expeditiously dispatch since he was in daily expectation of another fight Twenty ships were the number they agfee to send him but they ordered him who was to carry them to touch by the way at Crete For Nicias a Cretan of Gortys a public friend of the Athenians had persuaded them to appear be fore Cydonia assuring them that this place which had been an enemy to them should soon be their own This he in sinuated merely to gratify the Polychnitae who bordered upon the Cydonians The commander therefore with these ships went to Crete and joining the Polvchnita ravaged the territory of the Cydonians  by which together with adverse winds and weather unfit for sea no little time was unseasona bly wasted away The Peloponnesians at Cyllene lining the time that the Athenians lay weather bound in Crete having got every thing in readiness for another engagement sailed along the coast of Panormus of Achaia where the land forces of the Peloponnesians were come to forward their attempts Phor mio likewise with the twenty ships which had fought the former battle sailed up to cape Molychrium and lay at an Â II 189 YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 chor just without it This cape belonged to the Athenian alliance but the other cape over against it belonged to the Peloponnesians The arm of sea which divides them is about seven stadiaf over and this is the mouth of the gulf of Crissa The Peloponnesians with a fleet of seventy seven ships rode also at anchor under the cape of Achaia which is not far distance from Panormus where their land forces lay When they had here a sight of the Athenians both parties lay for six or seven days over against each other in tent on the needful preparations for engaging The scheme on each side was this The Peloponnesians struck with their former defeat would not sail from without their capes into the open sea The Athenians would not enter into the straits judging it would be an advantage to the enemy to fight in a narrow compass At length Cnemus Brasidas and the other Peloponnesian commanders desirous to come soon to an engagement before the Athenian squadron should receive a reinforcement called first their soldiers together and seeing some of them not yet recovered from the terror occasioned by the former defeat and by no means eager to fight again endeavoured to animate and rouse up their cou rage by the following harangue  If the former engagement ye men of Peloponnesus  affects any of you with sad apprehensions about the event  of another know that it by no means affords you any rea  sonable ground for such desponding thoughts That was  owing as you well know to a deficiency in all needful  preparations  for you were not then fitted out for service  of sea but for the service of land We then were dis  tressed in several respects by the adverse turns of fortune  and in some we who fought for the first time at sea run  into errors through want of skill It thus happened that  we were defeated but not through any cowardice of our â The cape on the Peloponnesian side was called Rhium or the Rhium of Achaia the opposite cape Antirrhiuni or Molychrium t About three quarters of a mile Vol I 2 P 190 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  own There can be no reason for men who were not con  quered by superior courage but wh6 can explicitly account  for the means of their defeat to let their spirits be sunk by  a calamity merely accidental but they ought to reflect  that though fortune may disconcert the human enterprizes  yet that men can never be deserted by their own valour   and where true valour is they ought not to catch a plea  from want of experience to palliate what signs of cowardice  they betray Inferior skill in you is by no means a balance  for your superior valour The expertness of your enemies  which you so much dread if it be accompanied with va  lour will indeed direct them in a performance of their  duty amidst all the hazards of war but if it wants true  valour those hazards will be too hard for all human art  For fear banisheth the remembrance of what ought to be  done  and art without strength is quite unavailing Place  therefore your own superior valour in the balance against  their superior skill and remove the apprehensions flowing from your defeat by the recollection that you were not pre â 4 pared to fight You have now the advantage of a larger  number of ships and an opportunity of fighting on your  own coasts in sight of a land army of your own Victory  is generally obtained by those who are most in number  and best provided So that upon close examination no  reason appears why we should dread the event Our for  mer miscarriages make not against us  nay the past com  mission of them will instruct us now Let every mas  ter therefore and every mariner act his part with manly  resolution let each take care to perform his duty nor quit  the post to which he is appointed We shall take care to  order the engagement in no worse a manner than our pre  decessors have done  and shall leave no man any reason to  excuse his cowardice Yet if any one will be a coward he  shall certainly receive the punishment he deserves  but the  valiant shall be honoured with rewards proportioned to their â merit B II 191 TEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 In such terms did their commanders animate the Pelo ponnesians But Phormio â who began to apprehend a de pression of spirits in his own men since he plainly saw that by keeping their ships close together they were afraid of the numerous ships of the enemyâ had a mind by calling them together to reinspire them with courage and give them an exhortation suitable to their present condition He had hitherto in all his discourses insisted and induced them to give him credit thatâ no number of ships could be got together large enough to make head against them And his seamen had long since been elated with this presumption that  as they were Athenians they ought not to avoid any fleet of the Peloponnesians however numerous But when he saw them intimidated by the formidable object before their eyes he thought it high time to endeavour to revive their sinking courage The Athenians being gathered round him he harangued them thus  I HAVE observed my fellow soldiers that the num  ber of your enemies hath struck you with fear â I have  therefore called you together as I cannot bear to see you  terrified with what is by no means dreadful These ene  mies of yours whom you have already conquered who in  no wise think themselves a match for you have got  together a great number of ships and a superior force In  the next place they come confidently to attack you with  the vain presumption that valour is only peculiar to  themselves Their confidence is occasioned by their skill  in the service of the land Their frequent successes there  induce them to suppose that they must also for certainty  be victorious at sea If they have any reason to presume  so far upon their excellence at land you have more to  form presumptions in your own favour since in natural  courage they are not in the least superior to us and  if larger degrees of skill give either side an advantage  we have hence an argument to be more confident of suc  cess The Lacedaemonians now at the head of their 192 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  league merely to preserve their own reputation have  dragged numbers hither to fight against their will other  wise they durst never have attempted to engage us a  second time after receiving so signal a defeat Frighten  not yourselves with extravagant suspicions of their courage  â but rather strike a panic into them  a panic for which  they have more ample reason as you have already gained  a victory over them and as they are certain you would not 44 give them another opportunity to fight unless you had  some grand design to execute An enemy that like them   exceeds in number in action depends more on their   strength than on their conduct They who are far inferior  in strength of numbers and dare though uncompelled 4 to fight must do it through the prevalence of some exten sive views This they cannot but know and hence dread jnore this our diminutive than they would an equal force  Large armies defeated through defect of skill or some  times through defect of courage by an inferior force are  cases that have often happened Yet neither of these de  fects can be imputed to us For my own part I shall not  willingly hazard the event within the gulf nor will I sail  into it For I am not ignorant that want of sea room is  very improper for a few ships that sail best and are best  managed against a number which those on board them  know not how to govern In such a situation no one can  pour down to an attack in the proper manner for want of  having a clear view of the enemy nor if he is forced to  sheer off can he do it with safety There is no room to  break through or to tack at pleasure which is the business  of ships that are better sailers  but the fight must of ne  cessity be the same with a battle at land and in this case  the greater number of ships must have the advantage I  shall take the greatest care I am able to prevent these in  conveniences And you I expect to stand regularly

the rules of dis  cipline without hurry and noise For these are matters of  great importance in every scene of war and of not the least  in a naval engagement â and charge your enemies with a  spirit worthy of your former achievements Great indeed  are the points you are now to decide the hopes of the Pelo  ponnesians of making a figure at sea are now either to be  totally demolished or the power of the sea must become  precarious to the Athenians even near their own homes  Once more I call to your remembrance that great part of  these enemies you have already conqueredâ and the courage  of enemies once conquered is seldom equal to what it was  when unconscious of defeat In this manner Phormio encouraged his men â But the Peloponnesians when they found that the Athenians would not sail into the gulf and straits had a mind to compel them to it against their inclinations At break of day they began to move their ships being ranged in lines consisting of four and stood along their own coasts within the gulf the right wing leading the course in the same order as they had lain at anchor In this wing they had ranged twenty of their best sailers with a view that if Phormio should imagine they had a design upon Naupactus and he himself should hasten to its succour the Athenians might not be able to outsail them and escape their outermost squadron which composed the right wing but be surrounded on all sides He just as they ex pected being alarmed for that place which he knew was de fenceless no sooner saw them under sail than against his will and in no little hurry he got on board and sailed along his own coastâ the land forces of the Messenians marching along the adjacent shore to be ready with their assistance The Peloponnesians seeing them move along in a line ship after ship and that they were now within the gulf and near the shore which was what they chiefly wantedâ on a signal given at once altered their course pouring down directly up on the Athenians all as fast as their ships could advance in 194 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR full expectation of intercepting the whole fleet Eleven of the Athenian ships which were a head of the rest being too quick for the wing of the Peloponnesians and the shifting of their course towards the open sea ran safely off Yet in tercepting all the rest they run them aground and so disabled them The Athenians on board who could not escape by swimming were slaughtered to a man Some of these empty ships they got off again and carried away in tow  and one they had already took with the whole crew on board The Messenians got down to the succour of some of them They waded with their arms through the water and climbing on board and fighting from the decks saved some which were already in tow â In this manner did the Peloponnesians de feat and destroy the Athenian ships Their twenty ships which were of the right wing gave chace to the eleven Athenians which on the shifting of the course had ran off amain But all these excepting one ship outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus Having gained their harbour they tacked about under the temple of Apollo and stood ready to defend themselves in case the enemy should make an attempt upon them so near the shore Soon after they appeared sailing along and sing ing their paean as having gained a victory One ship be longing to Leucas was shot far a head of the rest giving chace to that only ship of the Athenians which was left be hind It happened that a trading vessel was then lying out at anchor before the harbour The Athenian ship came up â The Latin translators whose chief aim is a grammatical construction have made a slip here in point of chorography  they say  Suhtcrfugerunt orfugerunt in apenum mare But it is surprizing that Mr Hobbet should be guilty of so much inadvertence as to make eleven Athenian ships  get out into open sea The Peloponnesians made their tack toward the open sea on purpose to prevent them from getting out of the gulf which gave opportunity to the foremost ships in the Athenian line to run away up the gulf towards Naupactus for the sake of securing which they had thought themselves obliged though contrary to their judgment and inclination to come within the capes Had they run oÂ it to sea they never could have reached Naupactus but would have run directly from it B II TEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 195 first with this vessel and fetching a compass round her runs directly against the Leucadian that was chasing and instantly sinks her By this accident so sudden and unexpected the Peloponnesians are thrown into consternation and having besides followed the chace without any regular order as se cure of victory some of the ships now dropping their oars stopped further motion This was an unlucky expedient when so near the enemy but their design was to wait for the greater number of ships that were yet behind Some of them being ignorant of the coast ran upon the shelves and were stranded When the Athenians saw them suffer these distresses their courage began to revive Shouting out aloud with one voice they encouraged one another to attack The miscarriages of which they were this moment sensible and their irrecoverable disorder prevented the others from mak ing any long resistance And they soon were forced to run back again towards the station of Panormus from whence they came The Athenians chasing them thither took the six ships that were most behind and recovered their own which were in the enemy s hands by having been run ashore and afterwards brought off in tow Some met besides they killed and made some prisoners On board the Leucadian which was sunk near the trading vessel was Timocrates the Lacedaemonian who when the ship received the stroke that sunk her immediately slew him self and floated afterwards into the harbour of Naupactus The Athenians returning thither again erected a trophy â We have here a notable proof of the peculiar spirit and genius of the Spartans They regarded the land aa their own element in which they were superior to the rest of the world And yet now they were convinced that without practice at sea they should never be able to pull down the power of Athens Their first attempts are awkward and unsuccessful  The art shewn by the Athenians in tacking round darting out again and sinking a ship at one stroke put them all to a stand and it seems made so sudden and strong an impression on Timocrates whose passion it was to die fighting and with wounds all before that he could not endure the thought of perishing in a whole skin and therefore snatched the mument and killed himself for fear he should be drown d 196 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR near the place from whence they had pursued this victory They took up their dead and the shattered pieces of their ships whatever they found on their own coasts and by a truce gave permission to the Peloponnesians to fetch off theirs The Peloponnesians also erected a trophy in token of a victory gained by forcing ashore and damaging some of the enemy s ships The ship they took they consecrated on the Rhium of Achaia near their trophy Yet after this being in some dread of the reinforcement expected from Athens all of them except the Leucadians sailed away by favour of the night into the gulf of Crissa and Corinth The Athe nians in the twenty ships from Crete that ought to have been up with Phormio before the engagement not long after the above retreat of the other ships arrived at Naupactus And here this summer ended Before the separation of the fleet that withdrew into Corinth and the gulf of Crissa Cnemus Brasidas and the other commanders of the Peloponnesians by the advice of the Megareans formed a design in the beginning of this winter to make an attempt on the Piraeus the haven of the Athenians It was not guarded or secured in the usual manner nor was this judged requisite as the naval power of Athens was become so extensive Their project was that every mariner carrying with him an oar a cushion and a leathern thong should march over land from Corinth to the sea on which Athens is situated and that making the best of their way to Megara and drawing out the forty ships that lay there in the Nisaean dock they should immediately stand into the Piraeus For there was not so much as one ship appointed to its guard  nor was there the least suspicion at Athens that the enemy would attempt in this manner to surprise them  For openly and in a regular train they durst not attempt it nor could a project which required deliberate procedure have escaped discovery But no sooner bad they resolved upon than they set out to execute the present scheme Arriving in the night they drew the ships  II YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 19 out of the Nisaean dock  but instead of making directly for the Piraeus as they at first intended dismayed with the danger of the attempt and as it is said forced by a con trary wind to steer another course they went over to that promontory of Salamis which faceth Megara Upon this promontory was a fort and three ships were stationed below to prevent all importation and exportation at Megara This fort they assaulted and carried the three ships though empty away with them Other parts of Salamis they plun dered as the inhabitants never dreamed of this invasion The lights that signify the approach of enemies were however held up and waved towards Athens which caused as great a consternation there as was known during all the series of the war Those in the city imagined the enemy to be already within the Piraeus Those in the Piraeus con cluded the city of the Salamanians to be taken and that the enemy was only not within their port which indeed they might easily have been had they not been hindered by their own fears and a contrary wind At break of day the Athe nians ran down in general concourse to the Piraeus They got their ships afloat and leaping on board with the utmost expedition and uncommon tumult sailed away for Salamis but left what land forces they had to guard the Piraeus When the Peloponnesians had notice of the approach of this succour having now over run great part of Salamis and got many prisoners and a large booty beside the three ships stationed at Budorus they made the best of their way back to Nisaea They were afraid of trusting too much to their ships which having been long laid up were become leaky After thus getting back to Megara they returned â These according to the Scholiast were lighted torches which persons on the walls reared aloft in the air to notify to neighbouring and confederate places that they discerned the approach of enemies in order to put then on their guard The same thing was also done at the approach of friends to notify what succour was at hand In the latter case they held the lights steady and unmoved in the former they waved them to and fro as an in dicalion of fear Vol I 2 q 198 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR again over land to Corinth The Athenians finding they were gone from Salamis sailed home again But ever after this they guarded the Piraeus in a stricter manner barring up the mouth of the haven and omitting no method of se curing it effectually for the future About the same time in the beginning of this winter Shakes the Odrysian son of Teres a Thracian king marched an army against Perdiccas the son of Alexander king of Macedonia and the Chalcideans bordering on Thrace to enforce the execution of two engagements one made to and the other by himself For Perdiccas who had entered into some engagement to him for reconciling him to the Athenians when he was formerly pressed hard with war and for not restoring his brother Philip then at enmity with him to his throne had not yet performed that en gagement And he himself was under an engagement to the Athenians since the late alliance offensive and defen sive made between them that he would finish the war for them against the Chalcideans of Thrace On both these accounts he undertook the present expedition carrying along with him Amyntas the son of Philip to restore to him the kingdom of Macedonia with the Athenian ambassadors commissioned to attend him on this occasion and Agnon an Athenian general Though the Athenians had obliged themselves by treaty to accompany the expedition with a fleet by sea and a numerous land army Beginning the march himself from Odrysae he sum mons to attend him first all his Thracian subjects that live within the mountains Haemus and Rhodope quite down to the Hellespont and Euxine sea next the Getae beyond mount Haemus and as many other nations as lay between the river Ister and along quite down to the Euxine The Getae and the nations so situated border upon the Scy thians wearing the same habiliments of war and all like them drawing the bow on horseback He procured also to join him many of the free Thracians that live upon the B II 199 YEAR III â BEFORE CHRIST 429 mountains and make use of scimetars who are distinguished by the name of Dians and dwell most of them about Rho dope Some of these he took into pay but some of them voluntarily attended He had levies also from amongst the Agrianians Leaeans and the other nations of Paeonia sub ject to himself These were the furthest people in his domin ions reaching up to the Graaeans and Leaeans of Paeonia and the river Strymon which deriving its source from mount Scomius waters the Graaeans and Leaeans and is the boun dary of his empire from those Paeonians who still are free Towards the Triballians who are also a free people the boundary is formed by the Trerians and TilatÂ ans These live to the north of mount Scomius and reach westerly as far as the river Oscius which riseth out of the same moun tain with the Nestus and the Heber a great but barren mountain adjoining to the Rhodope The kingdom of Odrysa is of this large extent along the coast reaching from the city of Abdera to the mouth of the river Ister in the Euxine sea The shortest cut round its coast requireth four days and as many nights for a trad ing vessel of the round built sailing directly before the wind A good walker will also be eleven days in going the nearest way by land from Abdera to the Ister So large was its extent along the coast But towards the continent to go along it from Byzantium to the Leaeans and the Stry mon for so far does it run upwards from the sea would cost an expeditious walker thirteen days continued journey The yearly tribute exacted from this tract of Barbaric land and his cities in Greece by Seuthes who succeeding Sital ces in these dominions very much improved the revenue amounted to four hundred talents of silver though it might be paid either in silver or gold The presents constantly made to him either of gold or silver were not less in value besides gifts of vestments both figured and plain and all kinds of furniture which were not only made to him but â 78 940 sterling 200 THE PELOPONNEBIAN VAlt to all his officers and the noble Odryssians The custom observed by them and general to all the Thracians  of receiving rather than bestowing was contrary to that which prevails in the Persian court where it was a greater shame to be asked and to deny than to ask and be denied Yet as their power was great this practice continued long in vogue amongst them for nothing could be obtained by him who brought no present And this afforded a large in crease of power to his kingdom It had the greatest reve nue and was in other respects the most flourishing of all the kingdoms in Europe between the gulf of Ionia and the Euxine sea But in military strength and numerous armies it was the second though at a great distance from the Scy thians For there is no one nation in Europe nor even in Asia that in these points can in any degree be a match for them or when standing singly nation against nation is able to make head against the Scythians united and in good harmony with one another Yet at the same time in every point of conduct and management of all the necessary af fairs of life they fall vastly short of other people Sitalces therefore who was king of so large a country got his army together and when every thing was ready marched against Macedonia He first of all passed through his own dominions then over Cercine a desert mountain the boundary between the Sintians and Paeonians He went over it by a passage he had by cutting down the wood made formerly himself in an expedition against the Paeo nians In their march from Odrysae over this mountain they left the Paeonians on their right but on their left the Sintians and Mcedians On their descent from it they ar rived at Doberus a city of Paeonia He lost none of his army in the march but by sickness notwithstanding which it was very much increased  For many of the free Thra cians came daily in without invitation and followed for the sake of plunder  so that the whole number is said at last to have amounted to a hundred and fifty thousand Of these ft M TEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 201 the greater part were foot but about a third of them were horse The greatest share of the horse was provided by the Odrysians and next to them by the Getae Of the foot the free Thracians that came from about mount Rhodope and used scimetars were the most valiant All the rest that followed were a mixt crowd formidable only in their num ber All these therefore were got together at Doberus and preparing to break in to the lower Macedonia subject to Perdiccas under the ridge of the mountains For in the general name of Macedonians are comprised the Lynces tians and Helimiotians and other nations lying upwards allied to and dependent upon the rest yet governed as dis tinct kingdoms The dominion over the maritime Mace donia was first obtained by Alexander father of Perdiccas and his ancestors the Temenidae who derived their original from Argos These by a successful war had driven the Pierians out of Pieria who afterwards fixed their residence at Phagres under mount Pangaeus on the other side the Strymon and at other places  for which reason the tract of ground lying under Pangaeus towards the sea is still called the gulf of Pieria From the region called Bottia they also expelled the Bottiaeans who now live upon the confines of the Chalcideans And further they seized in Paeonia near the river Axius a narrow tract of land running along from the mountains down to Pella and the sea and got posses sion of that which is called Mygdonia lying between the Axius and the Strymon by driving away the Edonians They expelled the Eordians out of what is now called Eordia of whom the greatest part were destroyed but a small number dwell now about Physca and out of Almopia the Almopians These Macedonians also conquered other na tions of which they are still in possession as Anthemus Grestonia and Bisaltia and a large part of the territories belonging to the other Macedonians But this whole tract of country hath the general name of Macedonia and Per diccas son of Alexander reigned over them when Sitalce formed this invasion 202 THE PELOPONNÂ SIAN WAR The Macedonians unable to make head against the nu merous army by which they were invaded retired within the walled and fortified places of the country which at this time were not many But Archelaus son of Perdiccas succeed ing his father in the kingdom built those fortresses which are now there opened the roads and made many other regu lations both in the military way about horses and arms and in other public matters more than all the eight preceding kings put together The Thracian army from Doberua broke first into that part of the country which was formerly in the possession of Philip They took Eidomene by storm and got Gortynia Atalante and some other places by com position which were readily brought to capitulate out of their regard for Amyntas whose son Philip now appeared amongst them They also laid siege to Europus but were not able to reduce it They afterwards advanced into the other Macedonia lying to the left of Pella and Cyrrhus Within these they did not advance into Bottiaea and Pieria but ravaged Mygdonia Grestonia and Anthemus The Macedonians never once thought of being able to make head against them with their foot but sending for horse from their allies in the upper Macedonia wherever by the advantage of ground a few could encounter with many they made frequent attacks upon the Thracian army They made so strong an impression that nothing could resist such excellent horsemen and so completely armed For this reason the enemy enclosed them about with their numerous forces and thus made it exceeding hazardous for them to fight against such manifold odds of numbers  so that at last they were forced to give over these skirmishes judging it imprudent to run any hazards against so large an inequality of strength Sitalces at a parley held with Perdiccas imparted to him the motives of the war And as the Athenians were not yet come up with their fleet because diffident of his punc tuality to the engagement between them and had only sent him presents and embassadors he detached part of his army B II 203 YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 against the Chalcideans and Bottiaeans  where by driving them into their fortresses he ravaged the country During his stay in these parts the southern Thessalians Magnetians and other people subject to the Thessalians and the Grecians as far as Thermopylae grew apprehensive that his army might be turned against them and prepared for their defence Un der the same apprehensions were the northern Thracians be yond the Strymon that inhabit the plains the Panaeans the Odomantians the Droans and the Dersaeans who are all of them free and independent He farther gave occasion for a rumour that spread amongst the Grecians enemies to Athens that his army brought into Greece by virtue of an alliance with them would invade them all in their turns Yet with out advancing any further he was at one and the same time continuing his ravage upon Chalcidica and Bottitea and Ma cedonia But unable to execute any of those points for which he formed this invasion when his army began to want provisions and to suffer by the rigor of the winter s cold he is persuaded by Seuthes the son of Sparadoxus and his own cousin german who had a greater influence over him than any other person to march back again with the utmost expedition This Seuthes had been secretly gained by Perdiccas who promised to give him his sister and a large dower with her Thus persuaded after a stay upon the whole of but thirty days and eight of these in Chalcidica he retired precipitately into his own dominions Perdiccas according to promise soon after gives his sister Stratonice in marriage to Seuthes And to this end came this grand expedition of Sitalces The same winter the Athenians at Naupactus after the se â Sitalces and his son Sadocus who as Thucydides relates above was made a citizen of Athens have

command of Phormio appeared before Astacus Making there a descent they pierced into the midland parts of Acarna nia with four hundred heavy armed Athenians from on board the fleet and four hundred Messenians  and expelled from Stratus Coronta and other places the disaffected part of the in habitants  and having re established at Coronta Cynes the son of Theolytus embarked again on board their ships They judged it not adviseable in the winter season to undertake any thing against the Oeniadae the only people of Acarnania who had persisted in continual hostilities against them For the river Achelous that takes its rise from mount Pindus and runs through Dolopia the provinces of the Agraans and the Amphilochians and all the plains of Acarnania passing above by the city of Stratus and discharging itself into the sea near the Oeniadae renders all the adjacent country one conti nued morass and by a stagnation of water makes it impracti cable for an army in the winter season Most of the isles of the Echinades lie over against the Oeniade not greatly distant from the mouth of the Achelous insomuch that the river being great causeth a continual afflux of sand and by it some of these islands are already joined to the main land and it is expected that all the rest in a short time will be so too  For the current is large and rapid and brings down with it great quantities of sand The isles stand thick  and stopping bind fast together from farther dissipation the sands brought down by the current They lie not in a line but in an al ternate situation one from another preventing the strait course of the waters forwards into the sea They are further uncultivated and of no large extent The tradition isâ that  all the time with Sitalces He is an honest heart and loves Athenians dearly In good truth he is doatingly fond of you all He is for ever  writing upon the walls O rare Athenians J And his son whom we made an Athenian longs mightily for some of your dainty sausages and hath pressed his father to succour his dear countrymen He at a solemn sa  crifice swore he would and hath got such a numerous army at his  heels that the Athenians cry out What a vast swarm of gnats is  coming along here  B II 205 YEAR III BEFORE CHRIST 429 Apollo by an oracle made a grant of this land to Alcmaeon the son of Amphiaraus when a vagabond after the murder of his mother telling him that  he never should be freed  from the terrors that haunted him till he found a place for  his residence which at the time he slew his mother had  never been seen by the sun and then was not land  be cause every other part of the earth was polluted by the par ricide After great perplexities he at length as it is said discovered these rising heaps of sand at the mouth of the Achelous and thought enough cast up to suffice for his sup port after the long course of wandering about to which he had been necessitated ever since he murdered his mother Fixing therefore his residence in the parts about the Oeniadae he grew powerful and left to the whole country the name of Acarnania from his son Acarnas This account of Alcmaeon we have given exactly as we have received it from tradition The Athenians and Phormio weighing from Acarnania and touching again at Naupactus very early in the spring returned to Athens Thither they brought all the freemen whom they had made prisoners in the late naval engage ments these were afterwards exchanged man for man and the ships taken from the enemy And thus the winter ended and with it the third year of the war the history of which hath been compiled by Thucy dides Vol 1 2 R THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR BOOK III YEAR IVâ BEFORE CHRIST 428 IN the succeeding Summer the Peloponnesians and allies when the corn was full grown made incursion into Attica under the command of Archidamus son of Zeuxidamus king of the Lacedaemonians and having fixed their camp ravaged the country The Athenian cavalry at all convenient places skirmished with them as usual and checked the greater num ber of the light armed from advancing before the heavy arm ed and infesting the parts adjacent to the city Having con tinued here till provisions began to fail they retired and were disbanded to their respective cities Upon this irruption of the Peloponnesians Lesbos im mediately revolted from the Athenians excepting Methimne They were well inclined to such a step before the war broke out but were discountenanced by the Lacedaemonians and now were necessitated to make their revolt sooner than they intended They would have been glad to have deferred it till they had compleated the works they were about for secur ing their harbour perfecting their walls and the ships then upon the stocksâ till they had received what they wanted from Pontus both archers and corn and whatever they had already sent for thither The reason was the people of Tenedos then at enmity with them those of Methymne and even some persons of Mitylene underhand who in a civil broil had received the B III 207 YEAR IV â BEFORE CHRIST 428 hospitable protection at Athens had sent the Athenians ad viceâ That they are compelling all Lesbos to go into Mi  tylene and are getting every thing in readiness for a re  volt by the aid of the Lacedaemonians and their kindred  Boeotians  and if timely prevention be not given Lesbos  will be lost The Athenians at present miserably distressed by the plague and a war now grown very brisk and vigorous knew that the accession of Lesbos to their enemies possessed as it was of a naval force and fresh in strength must be a terrible blow and would not listen at first to the accusations sent chiefly from the earnestness of their own wishes that they might be groundless But when they had in vain dispatched an embassy to the Mityleneans to put a stop to the forced resort of the Lesbians thither and their other preparations their fears were increased and they became intent on some expedient of timely preventionâ and order thither on a sudden forty sail that lay ready fitted out for a cruize on Pe loponnesus Cleippides son of Deinias with two colleagues had the command of this fleet Information had been given them that the festival of Apollo Maloeis was soon to be ce lebrated without the city at which solemnity the whole peo ple of Mitylene are obliged to assist â It was therefore hoped that they might surprize them on this occasion and by one sudden assault complete the work Should it so fall out it would be a happy turn â But if this miscarried they were to order the Mityleneans to deliver up their shipping and demolish their works and in case they refused to make in stant war With these instructions the fleet went to sea And the Athenians seized ten Triremes belonging to the Mityle neans which happened at that time to be lying in their port as an auxiliary quota in pursuance of treaty and cast into prison all their crews But a certain person passing over from Athens to Euboea and hastening by land to Ge reestus finds a vessel there ready to put off on board of 208 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR which he gets a quick passage to Mitylene and on the third day after his setting out from Athens gives notice to the Mityleneans that such a fleet was coming to surprize them Upon this they adjourned their festival and patching up their half finished walls and harbours as well as they could stood ready on their guard Not long after the Athenian fleet arrived and finding the alarm had been given the com manders notified to them the injunctions they brought with which as the Mityleneans refused to comply they ranged themselves for action The Mityleneans unprepared as they were and thus sud denly necessitated to make some resistance advanced on board their ships a little beyond the mouth of their harbour us willing to engage But being forced to retreat upon the approach of the Athenian fleet they begged a parley with the commanders from a view if it were possible upon easy conditions to rid themselves of that fleet for the present And the Athenian commanders readily accorded from the apprehension they had not sufficient strength to support the war against all Lesbos Hostilities having thus ceased for a time the Mityle neans dispatched their agents to Athens and amongst the number one of those persons who had sent intelligence of their motions but had now repented of the stepâ to pro cure if possible the recalment of the fleet by assurances that they were not bent on any innovations But in the mean time undiscovered by the Athenian fleet which lay at anchor in the road of Malea to the north of the city they send away a trireme to carry an embassy to Laccd mon  for they had no room to believe they should succeed in their negociation at Athens This embassy after a la borious and dangerous voyage arriving at Lacedaemon be gan to solicit a speedy succour And when their agents returned from Athens totally unsuccessful the Mityleneans and all the rest of Lesbos excepting Methymne prepare for war This last place sent in aid to the Athenians as B III 209 YEAR IV BETORE CHRIST 428 did also the Imbrians and Lemnians and some few other of their allies The Mityleneans once indeed made a general sally with all their people against the station of the Athenians Here upon a battle ensued after which the Mityleneans though by no means worsted yet durst not continue all night in the field but diffident of their own strength retreated behind their walls After this they kept themselves quiet unwill ing to run any more hazards till they had got some addi tional strength from Peloponnesus and were in other re spects better provided By this time Meleas a Lacedaemo nian and Hermaeondas a Theban are arrived among them who had been dispatched on some business before the re volt and unable to compass the return before the Athenian fleet came up had now in a trireme got in undiscovered since the battle It was the advice of these to dispatch ano ther trireme and embassy in company with them which is accordingly done But the Athenians as the Mityleneans remained in so quiet a posture became more full of spirits than before and sent summons of aid to their confederates who came in with more than ordinary alacrity as they saw such an appearance of weakness on the side of the Lesbians Having now formed a station on the south side of the city they fortified by a wall two camps which invested the place on both sides whilst their shipping was so stationed as to shut up both the harbours By this means the communica tion by sea was quite cut off from the Mityleneans Of the land indeed the Mityleneans and other Lesbians who had now flocked to their aid were for the most part masters The quantity which the Athenians had occupied by their camps was but inconsiderable as the station of their shipping and their market was held chiefly at Malea And in this posture stood the war against Mitylene About the same time this summer the Athenians send out thirty sail of ships against Peloponnesus under the command of Asopius the son of Phormio in pursuance of 210 THE PELOPONNKSIAN WAR some solicitations they had received from the Acarnanians to send them either a son or some relation of Phormio to command in those parts These ships sailing along the coasts of Laconia ravaged all the maritime places After this Asopius sends back the greatest part of his ships to Athens but with a reserve of twelve proceeds himself to Naupactus And raising afterwards the whole force of the Acarnanians he leads them against the Oeniadae With his ships he sailed up the Achelous and the army marching by land laid the country waste But when this was found ineffectual he dismisseth the land force and stretching over himself to Leucas and having made a descent upon Neri cum was intercepted in his retreatâ by those of the adja cent country who ran together for mutual aid supported by a small party that lay there for guards â with the loss of his own life and a part of his army After this the Atheni ans stayed only to take up their dead by favour of a truce ob tained from the Leucadians and then steered homewards The ambassadors of Mitylene who were sent in the first ship having been ordered by the Lacedaemonians to repair to Olympia that their applications might be addressed and resolutions formed about them in the grand resort of their whole alliance arrive at that place It was that Olym piad in which Doricus the Rhodian was a second time victor So when the solemnity was ended and an audi ence was granted them they spoke as follows  YE men of Lacedaemon and you their Confederates â Olympiad 88 f In this manner for private ends and through party feuds was a most noble and sacred institution abused All Grecians in general paid their attendance at the Olympic Games and were obliged by all the ties of honour and religion to suspend their animosities and quarrels and meet to gether as countrymen and brethren with frank and open ingenuity And yet in the present instance they are going to contrive the means of an noying one another so soon as that solemnity is o er which was calculated to teach them union and concord and a steady attachment to the interests of Greece their common mother The policy however of the present pro ceeding is remarkable The Athenians who assisted at the games could B III TEAK IV â BEFORE CHRIST 428 211  we are sensible of that method of procedure which hath  hitherto prevailed amongst the Greciansâ Revolters whilst  a war is on foot and deserters from a former alliance they  readily receive and so long as their own interest is further  edby it abundantly caress them Yet judging them trai  tors to their former friends they regard them as persons  who ought not to be trusted To judge in this manner is certainly right and proper where those who revolt and those M from whom they break asunder happen to be equal to one  another in turn of principle in benevolent affection and  well matched together in expedients of redress and military  strength and no just reason of revolt subsists â But the  case is quite different between us and the Athenians And  we ought not to be treated with censure and reproach from  the appearance of having deserted them in extremities af  ter having been honourably regarded by them in the season  of tranquillity This our conduct to justify and approve  especially as we come to request your alliance our words  shall first be employed as we know that friendship can be  of no long continuance in private life nor public associa  tions have any stability unless both sides engage with an  opinion of reciprocal good faith and are uniform in princi  pie and manners For out of dissonancy of temper diver  sities of conduct continually result  An alliance it is true was formerly made between us  and the Athenians when you withdrew yourselves from  the Median war and they stayed behind you to compleat  what was yet to be done We grant itâ we made an alli suspect nothing from the presence of the Mityleneans who were equally bound in duty to attend The Lacedaemonians and allies had thus an op port unity of assembling together to receive complaints and to encourage revolts from Athens without danger of suspicions or a detection of their counsels till they were ripe for execution  The Lacedaenlonians it is a remark which will afterwards occur in this history amongst one ano  ther and in paying all due regard to the laws of their country gave am  pie proofs of honour and virtue But in regard to the rest of mankind  they reputed as honourable the things which pleased them and as just  the things which promoted their interest 212 THE PELOPO fcESIAN WAR  ance with the Atheniansâ not to enslave the rest of Greece  to Athenians but to deliver Greece from the Barbarian  yoke And whilst they led us on in just equality so long  with alacrity we followed their guidance But when once we perceived that they relaxed in their zeal against the  Mede and were in earnest in rivetting slavery upon allies  we then began to be alarmed It was impossible where  so many parties were to be consulted to unite together  in one body of defence and thus all the allies fell into  slavery except ourselves and the Chians We indeed  left in the enjoyment of our own laws and of nominal  freedom continued still to follow them to war But from  the specimens we had hitherto seen of their behaviour  we could no longer regard these Athenians as trusty and  faithful leaders For it was not in the least probable that  after enslaving those who were comprehended in the same  treaty with ourselves they would refrain from treating  such as yet were free in the same tyrannic manner when  ever opportunity served Had we all indeed been left in  the free exercise of our own laws we should then have  had the strongest proof that the Athenians acted upon ho  nest uninnovating principles But now when they have  laid their yoke upon the greater number though they  still continue to treat us as their equals yet undoubtedly  it highly grates them and they cannot long endure  when such numbers couch beneath their power that our  State alone should stand up and claim equality No it  cannot be For the more their power hath swelled in  bulk and strength by so much are we become more deso  late The only secure pledge of a lasting alliance is that  mutual awe which keeps the contracting parties in proper  balance For then if any be disposed to make incroach  ments he finds he cannot act upon advantage and is ef  feetuallv deterred Our preservation hitherto hath not been owing to their honesty but their cunning Their  scheme hath been gradually to advance their empire by B tit YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 21 3  all the specious colourings of justice by the road of po  licy rather than of strength And thus we have been re  served to justify their violence and to be quoted as a  proof that unless those whom they have enslaved had de  served their fate a State upon an equal footing with them  selves would never have marched in conjunction with them  to execute their vengeance By the same strain of policy  their first step was to lead out those that were strongest  against the weaker parties designing to finish with them  when left destitute of any outward resource by the prior  reduction of the rest Whereas if they had begun with  us the confederate body remaining yet possessed of its  strength and able to make a stand their enslaving project  could not have equally succeeded They were besides  under some apprehension of our naval force lest uniting  with yours or any other State such an accession might  have endangered the whole of their plan Some respite  also was gained from the respect we have ever shewn to  their whole community and to the series of magistrates  who have presided amongst them We knew however  that we could not long hold out had not this war come  timely to our relief We saw our own fate in the examples  which had been made of others  What friendship therefore what assurance of liberty  could subsist when receiving each other with the open  countenance suspicion lay lurking within â when in war  apprehensive of our power to us they paid their court and  we from the same principle paid our court to them in the  season of tranquillity  The bond of union which mutual 4 good will cements in others was in us kept fast by fear  For through the prevalence of fear and not of friendship  we have thus long persisted in alliance And whichever  side security had first emboldened that side would fkst  have began encroachments upon the other WhoAver  therefore chargeth us with injustice for revolting whilst  they were only meditating our ruin and before we actually Vol I 2 S 214 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  felt the miseries designed us â that person chargeth us  without a reason For had our situation been such that  we could have formed equal schemes to their prejudice and  disconcerted all their projects what necessity did we lie  under to resign our equality and receive their law  But  as the power of attempting was ever within their reach we  ought certainly to lay hold of every proper expedient to  ward off the blow  Such are the reasons ye men of Lacedaemon and you  their confederates such the grievances which induced our  revolt reasons so clear that all that hear them must justify our conductâ grievances so heavy that it was time  to be alarmed and to look for some expedient of safety  We long since shewed our inclination to find this expedient  when during the peace we sent you to negotiate a revolt  but by you rejected were obstructed in our scheme And  now no sooner did the Boeotians invite than we without  a pause obeyed the call Now we have determined to  make a double revolt â one from the Grecians no longer  in concert with the Athenians to force the load of oppres  sion upon them but with you to vindicate their freedom u another from the Athenians that we may not in the  train of affairs be undone by them but timely vindicate our  own safety  Our revolt we grant it hath been too precipitate and  unpreparedâ But this lays the stronger obligation upon  you to admit us to alliance with the utmost expedition to  send us succours that you may shew your readiness te  redress the oppressed and at the same instant annoy your  foes Such a juncture for this was never known before  What with the plague and the exorbitant expence of the  war the Athenians are quite exhausted Their fleet is  divided some to cruize upon your coast others to make  head against us It is not probable they can have now  the competent reserve of shipping should you invade  them a second time this summer both by land and sea B III YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 215  so that either they must be unable thus divided to make  head against you if you singly attack them or the union  of us both they will not be able to face  Let no one amongst you imagine that this will be en  dangering your own domestic welfare for the sake of fo  reigners with whom you have no connexion For though  Lesbos lies apparently at a great distance from you yet the  conveniences of it will lie near at hand for your service  For the war will not be made in Attica as such a one  supposeth but in those parts whence Attica deriveth its sup  port Their revenue ariseth from the tribute paid by their  dependents And that revenue will be increased if they  can compass the reduction of us For then not a soul will  dare to revolt and their own will be enlarged by the addi  tion of our strength and more grievous burdens will be  laid upon us as being the last who have put on their yoke  On the other hand if with proper alacrity you undertake  our support you will gain over a State possessed of a con  siderable navy that acquisition you so greatly want and  you will more easily be enabled to demolish the Athenians  by withdrawing their dependents from them For then  every one of that number will with assurance and confi  dence revoltâ and you yourselves be cleared of the bad im  putation you at present lie under of rejecting those who  fly to you for protection If added to this you manifest  your views to re establish the general freedom you will so  considerably strengthen the sinews of war that all resist  ance will be unavailing  Reverencing therefore as you ought these hopes which  Greece hath conceived of you â Reverencing further Olym  pian Jove in whose temple we now stand like supplicants  distressed and suing for redress Grant to the Mitylene  ans the honour of your alliance and undertake their pro  tection Reject not the intreaties of men who have now  indeed their lives and properties exposed to dangers merely  their own but whose deliverance from their present plunge 216 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  will reflect security and advantage upon all and who if  you now continue to be deaf to their intreaties must drop  into such a ruin as will at length involve you all At this  crisis shew yourselves to be the men which the voice of  Greece united in your praise and our dreadful situation re  quire you to be In this manner the Mityleneans urged their plea  and the Lacedaemonians and confederates having listened with atten tion and owned themselves convinced admitted the Lesbians into their alliance and decreed an incursion into Attica To_ put this in execution orders were issued to the confederates then present expeditiously to march with two thirds of their forces to the Isthmus The Lacedaemonians themselves ar rived there first and got machines ready at the Isthmus to convey their ships over land from Corinth to the sea of Athens that they might invade them at the same time both by land and sea They indeed were eager and intent on the en terprize Bnt the other confederates were very slow in as sembling together as they were busy in getting in their har vest and began to be sadly tired of the war When the Athenians found that such preparations were made against them as an avowed insult on their ima gined weakness they had a mind to convince their foes that such imaginations were erroneous and that they were well able without countermanding their fleet from before Lesbos to make head against any force that could come from Pe loponnesus Accordingly they manned out a hundred ships obliging all as well sojourners as citizens those excepted of the first and second class to go on board Shewing themselves â The original is  except those who were worth five hundred medimns and the Horaetnen or Knights The Athenians were ranged into classes by Solon Plutarch hath described the manner in the life of Solon as thus translated in Potter s

III YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 217 first before the Isthmus in great parade they displayed their force and then made descents at pleasure all along the coast The Lacedaemonians seeing them thus strong beyond what they had imagined concluded that the Lesbians had pur posely amused them with fictions  and being perplexed how to act as their confederates were not yet come up to join them and as information was brought them that the first Athenian squadron consisting of thirty sail was laying waste the territory round about their city they retired to their own homes Afterwards they set about the equipment of a fleet to be sent to Lesbos  and ordered the confederate cities to send in their contingents the whole amounting to forty sail and further appointed Alcidas to be admiral in chief who was ready to put himself at the head of the expedition The Athenians departed off the coast with their hundred sail when they saw their enemies had retreated cution of this design he divided the Athenians into four ranks according to every man s estate those who were worth five hundred medimns of liquid and dry commodities he placed in the first rank calling them Pen tacotiomedimni The next were the horsemen or Ifipeii being such as were of ability to furnish out a horse or were worth three hundred medinuu The third class consisted of those that had two hundred medimns who were called Zeugita In the last he placed all the rest called them Thetet and allowed them not to be capable of bearing any office in the government only gave them a liberty to give their votes in all public assemblies  which though at the first it appeared inconsiderable was afterwards found to be a very important privilege  for it being permitted every man after the de termination of the magistrates to make an appeal to the people assembled in convocation hereby it came to pass that causes of the greatest weight and moment were brought before them And thus he continued the power and magistracy in the hands of the rich men and yet neither exposed the inferior people to their cruelty and oppression nor wholly deprived them of having a share in the government And of this equality he himself makes mention in this manner  What power was fit I did on all bestow Nor rais d the poor too high nor press d too low i The rich that rul d and every office bore Confin d by laws they could not press the

commencement of the war had as large if not a larger number of ships yet they never had their whole navy so completely fitted out for service and with so much pomp as now One hundred of their ships were stationed for guards round Attica and Euboea and Salamis  and ano ther hundred were coasting all along Peloponnesus beside those that were at Potidaea and in other parts insomuch that the whole number employed this summer amounted to two hundred and fifty sail The expence of this with that of Potidaea quite exhausted their treasure For the pay of the heavy armed who were stationed at Potidaea was two drachmas a day each of them receiving a drachma for himself and another for his servant The number of the first body sent thither was three thousand and not fewer than those were employed during the whole siege â but the sixteen hundred who came with Phormio were ordered away before its conclusion The whole fleet also had the same pay In this manner was their public treasure now for the first time exhaustedâ and such a navy the largest they ever had compleatly manned The Mityleneans during the time the Lacedaemonians lay at the Isthmus with a body of their own and auxiliaries marched by land against Methymne expecting to have it betrayed to them Having assaulted the place and being disappointed in their expectations they marched back by way of Antissa and Pyra and Eressus In each of these places they halted for a while to settle affairs in as firm or der as possible and to strengthen their walls and then with out loss of time returned to Mitylene Upon their departure the Methymneans marched out against Antissa The Antisseans with a party of auxiliaries sallying out to meet them gave them a terrible blow so that many of them were left dead upon the spot and those who escaped made the best of their way back The Atheniansâ advised of these incidents and that fur â Seven pence three farthings B III 219 YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 ther the Mityleneans were quite masters of the country and that their own soldiers were not numerous enough to bridle their excursionsâ about the beginning of autumn send a re inforcement of a thousand heavy armed of their own people commanded by Pachus the son of Epicurus These having rowed themselves the transports which brought them arrive and build a single wall in circle quite round Mitylene and on the proper spots of ground strengthened it by erecting forts Thus was Mitylene strongly besieged on all sides both by sea and land And by this time it began to be winter But the Athenians wanting money to carry on the siege determined now to tax themselves and by their first contri bution raised two hundred talentsf for the present service  and at the same time dispatched twelve ships under the com mand of Lysicles and four colleagues to levy money abroad He intent on raising contributions made a visit for this pur pose to several places  and having landed at Myus in Caria intending to pierce through the plain of Maeander as far as the hill of Sandius he was attacked on his route by the Ca rians and Anaeitans where himself and a great part of his ar my perished This winter the Plataeansâ for they were still blocked up by the Peloponnesians and Boeotians finding themselves much distressed by the failure of their provisions giving up all hope of succour from the Athenians and quite destitute of all other

as was observed in succeeding times when the necessities of the state called for an extraordinary supply On such oc casions the president of the assembly laid before the Athenians the present want of money and exhorted them with chearfulness and generosity to contribute towards the national support Such as were willing rose up in turn saying  I contribute so much and naming the sum Such as though

all to march out of the town in com pany and to compass their escape if possible over the works of the enemy The authors of this project were Thaeanetus the son of Timedes a soothsayer and F umolpidas the son of Daimachus who was one of their commanders But after wards half of the number affrighted by the greatness of the danger refused to have a share in the attempt Yet the re mainder to the number of about two hundred and twenty resolutely adhered to attempt an escape in the following man ner They made ladders equal in height to the enemy s wall The measure of this they learned from the rows of brick where the side of the wall facing them was not covered over with plaster Several persons were appointed to count the rows at the same time some of them might probably be wrong but the greater part would agree in the just compu tation  especially as they counted them several times over and were besides at no great distance since the part marked out for the design was plainly within their view In this me thod having guessed the measure of a brick from its thick ness they found out what must be the total height for the ladders The work of the Peloponnesians was of the following structure â It was composed of two circular walls  one to wards Plateea and the other outward to prevent any attack from Athens These walls were at the distance of sixteen feet one from the other  and this intermediate space of six teen feet was built into distinct lodgments for the guards These however standing thick together gave to the whole work the appearance of one thick entire wall with battle ments on both sides At every ten battlements were lofty turrets of the same breadth with the whole work reaching from the face of the inward wall to that of the outward so that there was no passage by the sides of a turret but the communication lay open through the middle of them all By night when the weather was rainy they quitted the B III YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 battlements and sheltering themselves in the turrets as near at hand and covered over head there they continued their watch Such was the form of the work by which the Plataeans were inclosed on every side The enterprising body when every thing was ready laying hold of the opportunity of a night tempestuous with wind and rain and further at a dark moon marched out of the place The persons who had been authors of the project were now the conductors And first they passed the ditch which surrounded the town  then they approached quite up to the wall of the enemy undiscovered by the guards The darkness of the night prevented their being seen and the noise they made in approaching was quite drowned in the loudness of the storm They advanced also at a great dis tance from one another to prevent any discovery from the mutual clashing of their arms They were further armed in the most compact manner and wore a covering only on the left foot for the sake of treading firmly in the mud Atone of the intermediate spaces between the turrets they got under the battlements knowing they were not manned The bear ers of the ladders went first and applied them to the wall Then twelve light armed with only a dagger and a breast plate scaled led by Ammeas the son of Choraebus who was the first that mounted His followers in two parties of six each mounted next on each side of the turrets Then other light armed with javelins succeeded them Behind came others holding the bucklers of those above them thus to faci litate their ascent and to be ready to deliver them into their hands should they be obliged to charge When the greater part of the number was mounted the watchmen within the turrets perceived it For one of the Plataeans in fastening his hold had thrown down a tile from off the battlements which made a noise in the fall and immediately was shouted an alarm The whole camp came running towards the wall yet unable to discover the reason of this alarm so dark was Vol I 2 T 222 THE PELOPONNESIAK WAR the night and violent the storm At this crisis the Plataeans who were left behind in the city sallied forth and assaulted the work of the Peloponnesians in the part opposite to that where their friends were attempting to pass from them to divert as much as possible the attention of the enemy Great was the confusion of the enemy yet abiding in their posts for not one durst leave his station to run to the place of alarm but all were greatly perplexed to guess at its meaning At last the body of three hundred appointed for a reserve of succour upon any emergency marched without the work to the place of alarm Now the lighted torches denoting ene mies were held up towards Thebes On the other side the Plataeans in the city held up at the same time from the wall many of these torches already prepared for this very purpose that the signals given of the approach of foes might be mistaken by their enemies the Thebans who judging the affair to be quite otherwise than it really was might refrain from sending any succour till their friends who had sallied might have effectuated their escape and gained a place of security In the mean time those of the Plataeans who having mounted first and by killing the guards had got possession of the turrets on either hand posted themselves there to se cure the passage and to prevent any manner of obstruction from thence Applying further their ladder to these turrets from the top of the wall and causing many of their num ber to mount those now upon the turrets kept off the ene mies running to obstruct them both above and below by discharging their darts  whilst the majority rearing many ladders at the same time and throwing down the battle ments got clean over at the intermediate space between the turrets Every one in the order he got over to the outward side drew up upon the inner brink of the ditch and from thence with their darts and javelins kept off those who were flocking towards the work to hinder their passage When all the rest were landed upon the outside of the work 1 III 223 YEAR IV BEFORE CHRIST 428 those upon the turrets coming down last of all and with dif ficulty got also to the ditch By this time the reserve of three hundred was come up to oppose them by the light of torches The Plataeans by this means being in the dark had a clear view of them and from their stand upon the brink of the ditch aimed a shower of darts and javelins at those parts of their bodies which had no armour The Plataeans were all obscured as the glimmering of lights made them less easy to be distinguished  so that the last of their body got over the ditch though not without great difficulty and toil For the water in it was froze not into ice hard enough to bear but into a watery congelation the effect not of the northern but eastern blasts The wind blowing hard had caused so much snow to fall that night that the water was swelled to a height not to be forded without some difficulty However the violence of the storm was the greatest furtherance of their escape The pass over the ditch being thus completed the Pla taeans went forwards in a body and took the road to Thebes leaving on their right the temple of Juno built by Andro crates They judged it would never be supposed that they had taken a route which led directly towards their enemies And they saw at the same time the Peloponnesians pursuing with torches along the road to Athens by Cythaeron and the Heads of the Oak For six or seven stadiaf they continued their route towards Thebes but then turning short they took the road to the mountains by Erythrae and Hysiae  and having gained the mountains two hundred and twelve of the number completed their escape to Athens Some of them indeed turned back into the city without once attempting to get over and one archer was taken prisoner at the outward ditch The Peloponnesians desisted from the fruitless pursuit and returned to their posts But the Plataeans within the city ignorant of the real event and giving ear to the assu â Drvoscephalac t Above half a mile 224 fat peloponnesiAn WAR ranees of those who turned back that  they are all to a man cut off dispatch a herald as soon as it was day to demand a truce for fetching off the dead  but learning hence the true state of the affair they remained well satisfied And in this manner the9e men of Plataea by thus forcing a passage wrought their own preservation About the end of this winter Salaethus the Lacedaemoni an Was dispatched in a trireme from Lacedaemon to Mity ferte  who being landed at Pyrrha went from thence by land and having passed the Athenian circuhivallation by favour of a breach made in it by a torrent of water gets undiscovered into Mitylene His commission was to tell the governors of the place that  at the same time an incursion will be made  into Attica and a fleet of forty sail be sent to their relief  according to promise  that he himself was dispatched be  forehand to assure them of these and to take all proper  care of other points Upon this the Mityleneans resumed their spirits and grew more averse to any composition with the Athenians The winter was now past and in this manner ended the fourth year of the war of which Thucydides hath compiled the history YEAR V IN the beginning of the ensuing summerâ after that the Peloponnesians had dispatched Alcidas admiral appointed and the forty two ships under his command to the relief of Mitylene with the most pressing ordersâ they and their con federates invaded Attica Their design was by this diver sion to give the Athenians so much employ on all sides that they might be unable to give any obstruction to their squadron bound for Mitylene This present invasion was led by Cleomenes who was his father s brother in the right of Pausanias son of Pleistionax the king but yet in his minority They now utterly destroyed those parts of Attica that had been ravaged already Whatever again be B III 225 YEAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427 gan to flourish and whatever had been spared in former in cursions now fell before their fury And this incursion next to the second was the sharpest they ever made upon the Athenians For having continued their stay so long as to give time to their squadron to arrive at Lesbos and send them news of their success they had leisure to extend their devastations over almost all the country But when all their expectations ended in disappointment and forage began to fail they withdrew and were disbanded to their respective cities In the mean time the Mityleneans when they saw nothing of the squadron from Peloponnesus which was loitering in the course and their provisions began to fail are neces sitated to capitulate with the Athenians upon this occasionâ Salaethus who had also himself given up all hopes of relief causeth the populace who before were light armed to put on heavy armour with a design to make a sally on the Athe nians But they so soon as they had received their armour would no longer obey their governors but assembling together in bodies ordered those in authority either publicly to pro duce what provisions they had and divide equally among them or otherwise they would immediately make their own terms with the Athenians and give up the city Those in command being sensible that they had not force sufficient to hinder this and that their own danger would be extreme should they by standing out be excluded the capitulation join with them in procuring the following terms from Paches and the Atheniansâ  That it should be submitted to the people of Athens to 44 determine as they please in relation to the Mityleneans  That the Mityleneans should immediately receive their  army into the cityâ and dispatch an embassy to them to  know their pleasure  That sufficient respite should be indulged for this  during which Paches should put no one Mitylenean in 226 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  chains should make none a slave should put none t0  death These were the terms of the surrender â But those of the Mityleneans who had been most active in all the nego ciations with the Lacedaemonians were thrown into the ut most consternation and being quite in despair when the army took possession of the place seat themselves down at the altars for refuge Paches having ordered them to arise with a promise of protecting them from insults sends them over to Tenedos till he could know the pleasure of the Athenians Having further dispatched some triremes to Antissa he took it in and made all other dispositions he judged expedient in regard to his army The Peloponnesians on board the squadron of forty ships who ought to have made the utmost expedition but instead of that had loitered upon the coast of Peloponnesus and made the rest of the voyage in a leisurely manner had pro ceeded so far as Delos before their motions were known at Athens Being advanced from Delos to Icarus and Myco nus they receive the first intelligence that Mitylene was taken But being desirous of certain information they sailed forwards to Embatus of Erythraea Mitylene had been taken about seven days before they came up to Em batus Here assured of the truth they consulted what was now to be done  and Teutiaplus an Elean gave his opinion thus  To you O Alcidas and as many other Peloponnesians  as are joined with me in the present command I freely  declare it to be my own opinion that we should sail to Mi  tylcne as we are before the enemy is apprized of our arri  val It is probable as they are so lately possessed of the  city we shall find it very remissly and imperfectly guarded  and towards the sea entirely neglected as on that side  they cannot in the least expect the approach of an enemy  and our strength in that element is superior It is proba B HI 7EAR V BEFORE CHRI8T 427 227  ble also that their land force is dispersed in that negligent  manner which victory indulgeth into the scattered houses  of refreshment If therefore we can come upon them by  surprize and by night I hope by the assistance of our  friends within if really within we have a friend remaining  to give a new turn to our affairs Let us not be staggered  at the danger of the attempt but remember that all the  turns of war are owing to some such reverse as this  which  that commander who is most on his guard against and who  can discern and seize such critical moments for assaulting  his enemies must be most frequently successful He gave his opinion thus but it had no effect upon Al cidas Some other persons exiles from Ionia and some Lesbians who were also on board advised him further  That since he seemed to be discouraged by the apparent  danger of that attempt he should seize some city in Ionia  or Cyme in iEtolia that by favour of such a hold for war  they might bring about the revolt of Ionia That in such  a step success might justly be hoped as his presence would  be highly acceptable there That if they could cut off the  very great revenue which accrued thence to the Athenians  the loss added to the expence of endeavouring a recovery  must drain their treasure â That they further thought they  could prevail on Pissuthness to join with them in the war But Alcidas would not listen to these proposals and got a majority to support his own opinionâ â That since it was  too late to succour Mitylene they should without loss of  time return to Peloponnesus Weighing therefore from Embatus he put again to sea and touching at Myonesus of the Teians he there butchered in cold blood a number of prisoners whom he had taken in the voyage Putting af terwards into Ephesus he was attended there by an embassy from the Samians of Anaea representing to himâ That it  was no honourable method of vindicating the liberty of  Greece to butcher men who had not so much as lift up  the hand against him who were not enemies in heart but 23ft THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  of mere necessity dependent on the Athenians that uh  less he changed his conduct he would bring over but few  of his enemies into friendship but turn a far greater num  ber of friends into enemies He was wrought upon by this remonstrance and set all the Chians and others whom he had yet reserved at liberty For those who had at any time descried this squadron had never thought of flying but boldly approached it as certainly Athenian They really had no ground to imagine that whilst the Athenians were mas ters of the sea a Peloponnesian fleet should dare to put over to Ionia From Ephesus Alcidas made the best of his way or ra ther fled outright for he had been discovered by the Sa laminian and the Paralus whilst he lay at anchor near Claros These vessels happened at that time to be on a course from Athens He was now apprehensive of a chace and so stretched out to sea determining if possible not to make any land again till he had reached Peloponnesus Notice of him came first to Paches and the Athenians from Erythraea it was then repeated from all parts For as the country of Ionia is quite unfortified the sight of the Pelo ponnesians on that coast had struck a panic lest though their intention was not to continue there they should at once assault and destroy their cities The Salatninian also and Paralus after they had descried him at Claros came voluntarily to notify the tidings Paches set upon the chace with warmth and pursued it as far as the isle of Latmos But there giving up all hope of reaching him he turned back again for his post and since he had not been able to  â These two vessels seem to have been the packets or yachts of the

in which at this time the Colophonians resided the upper city having been taken by Itamenes and the Barba rians who had broke in by favour of an intestine sedition It was taken about the time that the Peloponnesians made their second incursion into Attica But in Notium a second sedition broke out between those who resorted thither for refuge and the old inhabitants The latter having ob tained an aid of Arcadinns and Barbarians from Pissuthness kept within a part separated by a traverse wall and the management of affairs was in the hands of some Colophoni ans of the upper city who were in the Medish interest and had been received amongst them as an aid But the former who had resorted hither for refuge and were a body of exiles apply to Paches for protection He invited Hippias the commander of the Arcadians within the transverse wall to come out to a conference assuring him  if they came  to no agreement he would replace him within both safe  and sound Upon this Hippias came out And Paches immediately put him under an arrest but laid no bonds upon him This done he on a sudden assaults the wall by favour of the surprize carries it and puts all the Arcadians and Barbarians within to the sword After this he replaceth Hippias within in the same state he had promised but when he had him there immediately apprehends him again and shoots him to death with arrows Notium he delivers into the hands of the Colophonians excluding those only who were in the interest of the Mede In process of time the Athenians having sent leaders thither on purpose and declared Notium an Athenian colony settled in it the Colo phonians that were any where to be found under the accus tomed regulations Vol I 2 V 230 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Paches being returned to Mitylene compleated the re duction of Pyrra and Eressus  and having aprehended Sa laethus the Lacedaemonian who had been concealed in the city sends him to Athens along with those citizens of Mity lene from Tenedos whom he had kept in safe custody there and all others who appeared to have been concerned in the re volt As an escort to these he sends away also the greater part of his army With the remainder he himself stayed be hind to regulate the affairs of Mitylene and the rest of Les bos to the best of his discretion When the authors of the revolt and Salitthus were ar rived at Athens the Athenians instantly put Salaethus to death He made them many fruitless proposals to save his life and amongst the rest that the siege of Plabea should be raised which was still besieged by the Peloponnesians They next entered into consultation what should be done with the revolters and in the warmth of anger decreedâ  That not only those who were now at Athens should be  put to death but the same sentence should extend to all  the men of Mitylene who were adult and the women and  children be sold for slaves They were exasperated against them not only because they had revolted but be cause they had done it without the provocation which others had received in the rigour of their government The Pelo ponnesian fleet added the greater impetuosity to this their resentment as they had dared to venture so far as Ionia iÂ aid of the Rebels For it plainly appeared to them that the revolt had not been made without much previous delibera tion In short they dispatch a trireme to notify their de cree to Paches with orders to see it put in immediate exe cution upon the Mityleneans  The day following repentance on a sudden touched their hearts moved by the reflection that they had passed a savage and monstrous decree in dooming a whole city to that destruction which was only due to the authors of the guilt This was no sooner perceived by the Mitylenean ft III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 231 ambassadors then residing at Athens and such of the Athe nians as inclining to mercy had a mind to save them than they addressed themselves to the magistrates begging the decree might be again debated Their request was the more easily granted as the magistrates had discovered that the bulk of the city were desirous to have a second opportunity of declaring their sentiments An assembly of the people is again convened and various opinions were offered by different persons till Cleon the son of Cleanetus who in the former assembly had proposed and carried the murdering sentence who in all other respects was the most violent of all the citizens and at this time had by far the greatest in fluence over the people stood forth again and spoke as fol lows  UPON many other occasions my own experience hath  convinced me that a democracy is incapable of ruling  over others  but I see it with the highest certainty now in  this your present repentance concerning the Mityleneans  In security so void of terror in safety so exempt from  treachery you pass your days within the walls of Athens  that you are grown quite safe and secure about your de  pendents Whenever soothed by their specious intrea  ties you betray your judgment or relent in pity not a soul  amongst you reflects that you are acting the dastardly  part not in truth to confer obligations upon those depen  dents but to endanger your own welfare and safety It  is then quite remote from your thoughts that your rule  over them is in fact a tyranny that they are ever intent  on prospects to shake off your yoke that yoke to  which they ever reluctantly submitted It is not forgive  ness on your part after injuries received that can keep  them fast in their obedience since this must be ever the  consequence of your own superior power and not of grati  tude in them  Above all I dread that extremity of danger to which  we are exposed if not one of your decrees must ever be 232 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  carried into act and we remain for ever ignorantâ that  the community which uniformly abides by a worse set of  laws hath the advantage over another which is finely mo  delled in every respect except in practice â that modest  ignorance is a much surer support than genius which  scorns to be controled â and that the duller part of man  kind in general administer public affairs much better than  your men of vivacity and wit The last assume a pride in  appearing wiser than the laws  in every debate about the  public good they aim merely at victory as if there were  no other points sufficiently important wherein to display  their superior talents  and by this their conduct they ge  nerally subvert the public welfare  The former who are  diffident of their own abilities who regard themselves as  less wise than the laws of their countryâ though unable to  detect the specious orator yet being better judges of equity  than champions in debate for the most part enforce the  rational conduct This beyond denial is our duty at pre  sent we should scorn competitions in eloquence and wit  nor wilfully and contrary to our own opinion mislead the judgment of this full assembly  For my part I persist in my former declarations and  I am surprized at the men who proposed to have the affair  of Mitylene again debated who endeavour to protract the  execution of justice in the interest of the guilty more than  of the injured For by this means the sufferer proceeds  to take vengeance on the criminal with the edge of his  resentment blunted  when revenge the opposite of wrong  the more nearly it treads upon the heels of injury gene  rally inflicts the most condign punishment But I am  more surprized at him whoever he be that shall dare to  contradict and pretend to demonstrate that the injuries  done by the Mytelcneans are really for our service and  that our calamities are hardships on our dependents He  certainly must either presume upon his own eloquence if  he contends to prove that what was plainly decreed was ne B III 233 YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427  ver decreed or instigated by lucre will endeavour to  seduce you by the elaborate and plausible artifice of  words In such contentions the State indeed awards the  victory to whom she pleaseth but she sustains all the da  mage herself You are answerable for this Athenians   You who fondly doat on these wordy competitions   You  who accustomed to be spectators of speeches and  hearers of actions You measure the possibility of future M effects by the present eloquence of your orators  you judge of actions already past not by the certain conviction  of your own eyes but the fallible suggestions of your  ears when soothed by the inveigling insinuating flow of  words You are the best in the world to be deceived by  novelty of wit and to refuse to follow the dictates of the 44 approved judicious speaker â slaves as you are to whatever  trifles happen always to be in vogue and looking down  with contempt on tried and experienced methods The  most earnest wish that the heart of any of your body ever  conceived is to become a speaker if that be unattaina  ble you range yourselves in opposition against all who  are so for fear you should seem in judgment their infe  riors When any thing is acutely uttered you are ready  even to go before it with applause and intimate your own  preconception of the point at the same time dull at dis  cerning whither it will tend Your whole passion in a  word is for things that are not in reality and common  life but of what passeth directly before your eyes you  have no proper perception And frankly you are quite  infatuated by the lust of hearing and resemble more the  idle spectators of contending sophists than men who meet  to deliberate upon public affairs From such vain amuse  ments endeavouring to divert you I boldly affirm that  no one city in the world hath injured you so much as Mi 44 tylene  Those who unable to support the rigour of your go 44 vernment or who compelled to do it by hostile force 234 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  have revolted from you I readily absolve But for a  people who inhabit an island a fortified island  who had  no reason to dread the violence of our enemies except by  sea who even at sea by the strength of their own ship  ping were able to guard themselves against all attacks  who enjoyed their own model of government and were  ever treated by us with the highest honour and regardâ  for such a people to revolt in this manner is never to be  forgiven Is not their whole procedure one series of treachery Have they not rather made war upon than  revolted against us  for revolt can only be ascribed to  those who have suffered violence and outrage Have they  not further sought out our implacable foes and begged to  participate with them in our destruction  This certainly  is a much greater aggravation of guilt than if merely on  their own domestic strength they had rebelled against us  They would not be deterred by the calamities of their  neighbours who have frequently before this revolted and  been punished for it by a total reduction  nor would they  so far acquiesce in present felicity as not to hazard the  dangerous reverse of misery Audacious in regard to the  future presumptuous above their strength but below their  intention they made war their choice and in preferring  violence to the just observance of duty have placed their  glory For though uninjured and unprovoked the first  moment they saw a probability of prevailing they seized  it and rebelled  It is the usual effect of prosperity especially when felt  on a sudden and beyond their hope to puff up a people  into insolence of manners The successes of mankind when attained by the rational course are generally of  much longer continuance than when they anticipate pur  suit And in a word men are much more expert at re  pelling adversity than preserving prosperity By this  ought we long ago to have adjusted our conduct towards  the Mityleneans never distinguishing them above others S III VJBAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427 235  with peculiar regard and then they never would have  been that insolent people we have found them now For  so remarkably perverse is the temper of man as ever to  contemn whoever courts him and admire whoever will not  bend before him  Let condign punishment therefore be awarded to their  demerits Let not the guilty be avenged upon the heads of the _ Â and the bulk of offenders escape unpunished  The whole people to a man have rebelled against us when  it was in their power to have been sheltered here and now  again to be reinstated in their former seats But they judged the danger would be lessened by the general concur  rence with the few and so all revolted in concert  Extend further your regards to the whole body of your  dependents  for if you inflict the same punishments on  those who revolt by compulsion of enemies and who revolt a on pure deliberate malice which of them do you think  will not seize the least pretext to throw off your yoke   when if he succeeds his liberty is recovered and though  he fails the hurt is so easy to be cured  Besides this our  lives and fortunes will be endangered upon every single at  tempt which shall be made Suppose we succeed we only  recover an exhausted ruinated city but shall for the future  be deprived of the revenue arising from it the essence of  our strength  But if we cannot prevail we shall enlarge  the number of enemies we already have And at a time  when we ought to be employed in resisting our present ad  versaries we shall be intangled in wars against our own de  pendents We ought not therefore to encourage the hope  whether raised by the force of intreaty or purchased by the  force of corruption that their errors are but the errors of  men and shall therefore be forgiven The damage they  have done was not involuntary but they have been delibe  rate determined villains Forgiveness is only for those who  erred not by design  Moved by the ardency and zeal of my former plea you 236 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR  made the decree  and now I earnestly conjure you not to  repent of your own determinations not to plunge yourselves  in inextricable difficulties through pity through delight of  hearing and soft forbearance the three most prejudicial ob  stacles of power It is just to shew pity to those who  are its proper objects and not to men who would never  have felt compassion for us nor to foes who must of neces  sity be implacable The orators those delights of your  ears will have room in debates of lesser moment to catch  at your applause but should be silenced here where they  only can give the public a short lived pleasure whilst they  embroil it with perplexities not easy to be surmounted and  themselves alone in requital of speaking well will be well re  warded for it Forbearance further may be shewn to  those who are willing to be and will for the future prove  themselves our friends  but not to such inveterate souls as  these who if suffered to live will live only to wreak their  malice against you  I shall wave enlargements and give you only one  short assurance that if you hearken to my admonitions  you will at the same time do justice to the Mityleneans  and service to yourselves  but if you resolve in any other  manner you will receive no thanks from them and will establish the clearest evidence for your own condemnation  For if these men had reason to revolt it follows that you  have tyrannically ruled them Grant the injustice of such  a rule but yet that you have presumed to be guilty of  it â why then upon the mere motive of interest you  ought now to chastise them beyond what is right or im  mediately to forego your power and dropping yourselves  down into impotent security to set about the practice of  humanity and virtue But adieu to this vain expedient  and at once resolve to make them feel that weight of  misery they designed for us Convince them that those  who have escaped it can feel as strong resentments as  those who projected the fatal blow Determine now by B III 237 YEAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427  recollecting with yourselves what kind of usage you would  have received from them had they succeeded in their plots  they the uninjured unprovoked aggressors It is an al  lowed truth that men who without the least provocation  have recourse to acts of malice will be sated with nothing  less than complete destruction as they must ever be terri  fied at the sight of a surviving foe For he who suffers from  a quarter whence he never deserved it will not so easily  lay down his resentments as when mutual enmity hath kin  died the contention Be not therefore traitors to your own  selves Figure to yourselves as strongly as you can the  miseries they designed you remember how you wished  for nothing in this world so much as to have them in your  power and now retaliate upon them Relent not at the  scene of horror imagination may present to your fancy but  fix your remembrance fast on that weight of misery which  was just now suspended over your own heads Punish these  wretches according to their deserts  make them a notable  example to the rest of your dependents that death must be  the portion of whoever dares revolt For when once they  are certain of this your arms will no more be recalled from  your foreign enemies to be employed in the chastisement of  your own dependents In this manner Cleon supported the decree and when he â From the short sketch of Cleon s character given before by Tliucydi des and the speech lie hath now made it is likely he can be no favourite with the reader Cicero hath styled him  a turbulent but eloquent Atlie man By means of his eloquence and an impudence that never could be dashed he was now a prime favourite with the people but the scorn and terror of all good men at Athens He had ever been a snarler at Pericles but so long as he lived could obtain no share in the public administration He had now got the ascendant by cajoling the people and by his loud and daily invectives against their ministers and commanders He will make a very splendid and very despicable figure in the sequel Aristophanes who had a particular grudge against him hath exhibited him in the most dis tasteful light His comedy of the Hnrtemen or Knights is entirely employed to shew him off He calls him throughout the Paphlagotdan to brand his low and brutal disposition who quitting his original trade of selling lea Vol I 2 X 238 THE PEtOPONNESIAN WAR had concluded Diodotus the son of Eucrates who in the for mer assembly had most strenuously opposed the bloody sen tence against the Mityleneans stood forth and thus replied  I NEITHER blame those who proposed the resumption  of the decree against Mitylene nor do I praise the men  who inveigh against repeated consultations on points of the  greatest importance But I lay it down for certain that  there are no two greater impediments of sound mature coun  sel than precipitation and anger  of which the one is closely  connected with madness the other with raw inexperience  and short limitary judgment  It may indeed be warmly asserted that words are not the  proper guides to actions But the author of such an asser  tion is either wanting in discernment or confines it only to  his own selfish views He is wanting in discernment if he  imagines there is any other possible method of putting light  into things that are future or unseen  or confines it only to  himself if willing to recommend a scandalous measure and  conscious he hath not eloquence enough to support it openly  he launcheth out into plausible calumnies to intimidate his  opponents as well as his audience  But odious beyond all support is their procedure who  prematurely condemn the advice of others as purchased  and corrupt For would they only acquiesce in the charge  of ignorance the defeated opponent goes off with the  ther vile leather since people rather swam than walked in the shoes  made of it was now become the leading politician the scourge and pest  of the republic The chorus of the play salutes him with the most vil lainous titles And an oracle is cooked up which prophesieth that they shall never get rid of Cleon till he is overpowered by a greater scoundrel than himself A dealer in black puddings is at last procured to be his competitor The contest is carried on with all the ribaldry and scurrility that unbridled wit could forge for such characters and Cleon is at length defeated This is the event upon the stage but was by no means so in the State of Athens The wit of Aristophanes seldom hurt knaves and scoun drels i it wounded and was mischievous only to the ablest ministers and the warmest patriots B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 44 bare character of a man less enlightened indeed but quite  as honest If he be charged with corruption his point  he may carry but his honesty will ever be suspected  and  if his point be lost he must pass for knave and blockhead  both Such methods can never be conducive to the pub  lie good The men best able to advise are by this means  intimidated  Though the public welfare would then be  best secured if every person of so disingenuous a temper  was not able to open his mouth  for then by his seduce  ments the public could never be misled But it is the  duty of every true patriot to despise the slanders of oppo  nents and on fair and impartial views to get his own  advice accepted It is the duty of every well regulated  public not indeed to load a man with honours for having 44 given the best advice but never to abridge him of his  present portion and if he cannot prevail by no means  to disgrace much less to punish him For then neither  would the successful debater from a view of inhancing 44 his own personal honours ever speak against conscience  or aim merely at applause  nor would he who hath been 44 unsuccessful in his motions be greedy of proposing what  ever may cajole and so earn popularity for himself But  the method in vogue with us is the reverse of this  and  what is worse if a person be suspected of corruption  though he advise the most prudent expedients yet the  odium raised against him upon the weak suggestion of  lucre quite weighs him down and we are deprived of  the manifest service he could do to the State Nay such  is our method that even the best advice if readily of  fered can escape suspicion no more than the worst And  hence it is necessarily incumbent as well upon him who 44 would persuade the public into the most prejudicial mea 44 sures to seduce the people with art as upon him who u would advise the best to disguise the truth in order to  prevail Amidst these jugglings the public alone is de 44 barred the service of its most able counsellors since in a 240 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  plain and open method they cannot possibly act and artifice  must clear the way before them For the man who openly  bestows any benefit upon it is constantly suspected of doing  underhand a greater to himself  When affairs therefore of so high concern are before  you when the general temper is so over run with jealousy  we who presume to advise must enlarge our prospect  farther than you who only assist at a transient consulta  tion because we are accountable for what we propose  and you are not accountable for the prejudices with which  you hear For if not only he who proposed but he who  complied were equally answerable for events your deter  minations would be better framed than they are at present  But now hurried along as you are by your hasty resent  ments on any sinister event you wreak your fury only upon  the single opinion of the person who advised and not upon  your own joint opinions by concurrence of which the mis  carriage was incurred  For my part I neither stand up to deny certain facts  in favour of the Mityleneans nor to waste the time in  fruitless accusations We are not debating now what  wrongs they have done us since that would be a reproach  to sense  but what determination about them is best  For though I can prove beyond a scruple that they have  injured us in the most outrageous manner yet I shall not  for that reason advise you to butcher them unless it be  expedient nor were they objects of forgiveness should  I advise forgiveness unless I judged it for the interest of  the public I apprehend that our consultations turn  more upon a future than a present view And Cleon  here most confidently asserts that the surest expedient of  your future welfare is to prevent all other revolts by in  flicting death in doom of this but equally confident of  the just expedient of future security I declare quite on  the other side And I intreat you by no means to reject  the real advantage of mine for tbe specious colourings of B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 241  his advice Strict justice I grant may be with him  and  enraged as you are against the Mityleneans may have a  sudden influence upon you But we meet not here in judg  ment upon them and justly to decide is not now our em  ployment we are only to consult how to dispose of them  best for our own advantage  In the public communities of men death is the pe  nalty awarded to several crimes to such as are not enor  mous like this but of a less guilty nature Yet puffed up  with hope men run all hazards and no one ever yet hath  boldly incurred the danger if self convinced beforehand  that he could not survive the attempt Where was the  city so bent on revolt that when its own domestic  strength or the aid of others were judged unequal to the  work durst ever attempt it  The whole of mankind  whether individuals or communities are by nature liable  to sin  and a law of infallible prevention will never be  enacted Men by repeated trials have inforced all kinds  of punishment attentive if possible to restrain the out  rages of the wicked And in the early age it is probable  that milder penalties were assigned for the most enormous  wrongs  but being found by experience ineffectual they  were afterwards extended generally to loss of life This  however is not yet effective Some terror therefore must  be invented even more alarming than this or this will  never sufficiently restrain But then there is a poverty  which renders necessity daring there is a power which  renders pride and insolence rapacious There are other  contingencies which in the fervour of passions as every  human mind is possessed by some too stubborn to admit a cure drive them on boldly to confront extremities  But the greatest incentives of all are hope and love  This  points out a path and that moves along according to  direction This thoughtlessly proposeth the scheme and  that immediately suggesteth a certainty of success Thesr 242 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  are the sources of all our evils and these invisible princi  pies within us are too strong for all the terrors that are  seen without To these add fortune who contributes her  ample share to divest the mind of its balance She shews  herself by unexpected starts and encourageth even the in  competent to venture dangers and hath a greater influence  over communities as the ends proposed by them are of  the greatest concern such as liberty or dominion where  every individual amidst the universal ardour unaccount  ably plumes himself up and acts with a spirit above him  self But in truth it is quite impossible it is a proof of  egregious folly to imagine when human nature is impelled  by its own impetuous passions towards such objects that  the force of laws or any intervening terror is strong enough  to divert them from the mark Hence therefore ariseth  the strongest dissuasive to us from confiding in the penal  ty of death as the only pledge of our future safety which must betray us into weak prejudicial measures which  must drive all revolters into utter despair by shewing  them plainly that we shall never accept repentance 44 shall not give them one moment s indulgence to palliate  their offences  Consider with yourselves in the merciful light that a  revolted city when for certainty assured that it cannot  hold out may submit upon our own conditions whilst yet  in a capacity to reimburse our expences and to advance M the future tribute But in the opposite case can you ima gine there is any city which will not better prepare itself  for revolt than M itylene hath done  and hold out a siege  to the last extremity  Is there no difference between a  quick and a slow submission  Shall not we be hurt if  forced through their despair to continue a tedious and ex  pensive siege  and when the place is taken to be masters  only of one heap of desolation unable for the future  to squeeze the least pittance of revenue from it  It is re  venue alone which renders us a terror to our foes We Â i B III TEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 243  ought not therefore with the rigour of judges to inflict the  exactest punishments upon these offenders We ought  rather to provide for futurity and by moderate correction  still to preserve those cities in a full capacity of paying us  the needful tribute To keep men firm in their duty we 44 should scorn the expedient of severe and sanguinary laws  since mild discretionary caution would better answer the  purpose This prudent conduct we are now reversing if  when re possessed of a city stripped of its former liberty  and ruled with violence sufficient motives of revolt that it  may again become independent if now we judge that  this ought to be avenged with a weight of severity Men  who have known what liberty is ought not to be too se  verely chastised if they have dared to revolt but we  ought to observe them with timely vigilance before they  revolt to prevent their taking the least step towards it or  even once entertaining a thought about it at least when  we have quelled the insurrection the guilt should be fas  tened upon as few as possible  Consider I beseech you with yourselves how greatly  you will err in this and in another respect if Cleon s ad  vice be approved For now the populace of all the cities  are generally well affected towards us They either refuse  to concur with the few in their revolts or if their con currence be forced they instantly turn enemies to those  who forced them â and you proceed to determine the  contest assured that the populace of the adverse city will  be active in your favour But if you doom to general  excision the people of Mitylene those who had no share  in the revolt who when once they had got arms into  their hands spontaneously delivered up the place   you will be guilty first of base ingratitude for murdering  your own benefactors â and you will next establish such  a precedent as the factious great above all things wish to  see For then whenever the latter effect the revolt of  cities they will instantly have the people attached to their 244 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  party since you yourselves have inforced the precedent  that punishment must fall upon the heads not only of the  guilty but even of the innocent Whereas indeed though  they had been guilty we ought to have dissembled our  knowledge of it that we might not force the only party  which ever takes our side into utter enmity and aversion  And I esteem it much more conducive to the firm support  of empire rather to connive at the wrongs we may have felt than in all the severity of justice to destroy those per  sons whom in interest we ought to spare And thus that  union of justice to others and duty to yourselves in this in  stance of punishing the Mitylencans as alleged by Cleon  is plainly found to be grossly inconsistent to be utterly im  possible  Own yourselves therefore convinced that the greatest  advantages will result from the conduct which I have re  commended  and without giving too wide a scope to  mercy or forbearance by which I could never suffer you  to be seduced follow my advice and in pursuance of it re solve  To judge and condemn at your own discretion those guilty Mityleneans whom Paches hath sent hither  to attend your decisions and to let the others continue as  they are These are expedients of your future welfare  and of immediate terror to your foes For they who can  form the soundest deliberations stand stronger up against  hostile opposition than the men who rush to action with  indiscreet unpremeditating strength Diodotus ended here And when these two opinions diametrically opposite to one another had been thus deliv ered the Athenians had a stiff contest in support of each and upon holding up of hands there seemed near an equality j but the majority proved at last to be along with Diodotus Upon this they immediately sent away another trireme enjoining all possible dispatch lest this second not coming in time might find the city already destroyed as the other u B III 245 YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 had got the start of a day and a night The Mitylene an am bassadors amply furnished them with wine and barley cakes and promised them great rewards if they arrived in time By this means they were so eager to accelerate the passage that even whilst plying the oar they eat their cakes dipped in wine and oil and whilst one half of the number refreshed themselves with sleep the other kept rowing amain So for tunate were they that not one adverse blast retarded their course The former vessel as sent on a monstrous errand had not hastened its passage in the least and the latter was most intently bent on expedition That indeed got before to Mitylene but only long enough for Paches to read over the decree and give orders for its immediate execution At that crisis the latter arriveth and prevented the massacre To such an extremity of danger was Mitylene reduced The other Mityleneans whom Paches had sent to Athens as deepest concerned in the revolt were there put to death according to the advice of Cleon And the number of these amounted to somewhat above a thousand The Athenians further demolished the walls of Mitylene and took away their shipping They did not for the future enjoin an annual tribute upon the Lesbians but dividing the whole island into shares except what belonged to Methymne three thousand in the whole they set apart three hundred of these as sacred to the Gods and sent some of their own peo ple who were appointed by lot to take possession of the rest as full proprietors The Lesbians as tenants of these were obliged to pay them two Mynve yearly for every share in consideration of which they had still the use of the soil â The â We hear no more in this history of Paches who certainly in the re duction of Lesbos had done a great service to his country and had behaved through the whole affair with great discretion and humanity And jet Plutarch tells us in two passages in the live of Aristides and Nicias that at his return he was called to account for his conduct during his command and fmding he was going to be condemned his resentment and indignation rose so high that he instantly slew himself in court t 6 9s 2f sterling Vol I 2 Y 246 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Athenians also took from them several towns upon the conti nent which had belonged to the Mityleneans and which continued afterwards in subjection to the Athenians Thus ended the commotions of Lesbos The same summer after the reduction of Lesbosâ the Athenians commanded by Nicias the son of Niceratus executed a design upon Minoa the island which lies before Megara The Megareans having built a fort upon it â Nicias is now for the first time in the chief command who is to act parts of very great importance in the sequel of the war We should there fore take some notice of him on his first appearance Plutarch who hath wrote his life gives light into several circumstances which fall not within the cognizance of a general historian He was born of a noble family in Athens and was one of the most wealthy citizens Beside his estates he had a large annual income from the silver mines at Laurium Not that those mines belonged to him as one would infer from Plutarch  for they were the patrimony of the State annexed to it by Themistoclcs for the support of the navy  But as Xenophon relates in his treatise of revenue Nicias had a thousand slaves constantly employed in working these mines He hired them out to Sosias the Thracian who was undertaker of the work on con dition to receive a clear obole a day for every one of them  and he always kept up the number His income from hence was therefore near 2000 sterling a year He acted under Pericles so long as he lived and after his death was set up by the more sober and sensible Athenians as a balance to Cleon who was the idol of the people Nicias was a true lover of his country of unblemished integrity and very gentle and complacent in his manners His good qualities were numerous and shining His foibles were a great diffidence of himself and a dread of the people which made him court them by laying out his wealth in public games and shows for their entertainment He had an inward fund of real piety i but was supersti tiously attached to the ceremonial of the religion of his country His great wealth drew a great number of followers and parasites about him  and his benevolent disposition was always seeking occasions of doing good In short says Plutarch  bad men had a sure fund in his pusillanimity and good men in his humanity No body could either hate or fear him at Athens and therefore his interest there was great He was always cau tious and always diffident and under such an awe of the people in the ge neral assemblies that they would shout out to him by way of encourage inent as his modesty was amiable and engaging when opposed to the im pudence of Cleon â Thus much may suffice at present since his military expeditions and the whole of his political conduct will be related by Tint cydides B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 5247 used it as a garrison But it was the scheme of Nicias to fix the post of observation for the Athenians there as being much nearer situated and to remove it from Budorus and Salamis This would prevent the sudden courses of the Peloponnesians frequent from thence would curb the pi ratical cruizers  and at the same time stop all importations into Megara Beginning therefore with the two forts de tached from Nisaea he took them by means of the engines he played against them from the sea and having thus opened the channel between them and the island he took in by a wall of fortification that part of the main land from whence only by crossing the morass and the help of a bridge a succour could be thrown into the island which lay at a very small distance from the continent This work was compleated in a few days after which Nicias leaving behind in the island a sufficient garrison to defend the works drew off the rest of his army About the same time this summer the Plataeans whose provisions were quite spent and who could not possibly hold out any longer were brought to a surrender in the following manner The enemy made an assault upon their wall which they had not sufficient strength to repel The Lace demonian general being thus convinced of their languid condition was determined not to take the place by storm In this he acted pursuant to orders sent him from Lacedae mon with a view that whenever a peace should be conclu ded with the Lacedaemonians one certain condition of which must be reciprocally to restore the places taken in the war Plataea might not be included in the restitution as having freely and without compulsion gone over to them A herald is accordingly dispatched with this demandâ Whether they  are willing voluntarily to give up the city to the Lacedae  monians and accept them for their judges who would pun  ish only the guilty and contrary to forms of justice not  even one of those â The herald made this demand aloud And the Plataeans who were now reduced to excessive weak ness delivered up the city 248 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR The Peloponnesians supplied the Plataeans with necessary sustenance for the space of a few days till the five delegates arrived from Lacedaemon to preside at their trial And yet when these were actually come no judicial process was form ed against them They only called them out and put this short question to themâ Whether they had done any ser  vice to the Lacedaemonians and their allies in the present  war â Their answer was that they begged permission to urge their plea at large  which being granted they pitched upon Astymachus the son of Asopalaus and Laco the son of Aeimnestus who had formerly enjoyed the public hospitality of the Lacedaemonians to be their speakers who stood forth and pleaded thus  PLACING in you O Lacedaemonians an entire con  fidence we have delivered up our city  but never imagined  we should be forced to such a process as this when we ex  pected only to be tried by justice and lawsâ when we yield  ed to plead not before other judges as is now our fate   but only before yourselves Then indeed we thought that justice might be obtained â But now we have terrible  grounds for apprehending that we have at once been doubly  over reached Strong motives occur to alarm our suspi  cions that the point most in view is to deprive us of our  lives and that you will not prove impartial judges We  cannot but be too certain of this when no manner of crime  is formally objected against which we might form our de  fence  when barely at our own intreaty we are heard and  your concise demand is such that if we answer it with  truth we condemn ourselves  if with falsehood must be  instantly refuted  Thus on all sides beset with perplexities something of  necessity must be said in our own behalf nay where the  danger is so urgent the only small glimpse of security ap â 4 pears in hazarding a plea For persons like us distressed u in silence to abandon their own defenceâ this may with  sad compunction torture them at last as if their safety  might have been earned by speaking for themselvesâ B III 249 YEAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427  though never was persuasion so much to be despaired of  as at present Were we indeed who are the persecuted  party entirely unknown to our judges we might then al  lege such evidence as through ignorance you could not  overturn and so further our defence But now we must  speak before men who are informed of every point Nor  do our fears result from the prior knowledge you have had  of us as if you were now proceeding against us for having  in valour been inferior to yourselves  but from our own  sad forebodings that we are cited to a tribunal which hath  already condemned us to gratify others Yet what we  can justly say for ourselves in regard to all our differences  with the Thebans we shall boldly allege  the good ser  vices we have done to you and the rest of Greece we shall  fairly recite and strive if possible to persuade  To your concise demandâ Whether we have done any  good service in this war to the Lacedaemonians and their  allies â we answer thus   If you interrogate us as ene  mies though we have done you no good yet we have  done you no harm  If you regard us as friends you have  offended more than we in making war upon us â In re  gard to the peace and against the Mede we have ever  honestly performed our duty The peace was not violated  first by us against him we alone of all the Breotians at  tended you in the field to maintain the liberty of Greece  For though an inland people we boldly engaged in the  sea fight at Artemisium  and in the battle fought upon  this our native ground we assisted you and Pausanias and  whatever the danger to which Greece in that trouble  some period of time was exposed in all we bore a share  beyond our strength To you in particular O ye Lace  daemonians in that greatest consternation Sparta ever felt  when after the earthquake your rebellious Helots had  seized upon Ithome we immediately dispatched the third  part of our force for succour These things you are bound  in honour never to forget For thus upon former and  those most critical occasions we with honour shewed our 250 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  selves your friends But at length we became your  enemies  For that blame only yourselves  Because â 4 when we stood in great want of support against the vio  lence and oppression of the Thebans to you we applied  and by you were rejected You commanded us then to  address ourselves to Athens Athens you said was near  but Sparta lay too remote to serve us Yet notwithstand  ing this in the present war we have committed no one  dishonourable act in regard to you nor should ever have  committed You injoined us indeed to revolt from the  Athenians and we refused to comply  but in this we have  done no injustice For they marched chearfully to our 44 succour against the Thebans when you shrunk back  and 44 to betray them afterwards had been base in us in us  who were highly indebted to them who at our own re 44 quest were received into their friendship and honoured 44 by them with the freedom of Athens No it was rather  our duty boldly to advance wherever they pleased to or 44 der And whenever either you or the Athenians lead out 44 your allies into the field not such as merely follow you 44 are to be censured for any wrong you may respectively  commit but those who lead them out to its commission  Manifold and notorious are the instances in which the 44 Thebans have injured us But outrageous above all is the  last about which you need no information since by it we are plunged into this depth of distress A right un  doubtedly we had to turn our avenging arms upon men  who in the midst of peace and what is more upon the sa  cred monthly solemnity feloniously seized upon our city  We obeyed herein that great universal law which justi 44 fieth self defence against a hostile invader  and there 44 fore cannot with any appearance of equity be now doom 44 ed to punishment at their instigation For if your own  immediate interest and their present concurrence with you  in war is to prescribe and regulate your sentence you  will shew yourselves by no means fair judges of equity Â 4 but partially attached to private interest What  though B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 251  these incendiaries seem now a people well worth your gain  ing  There was a season a most dangerous and critical sea  son when you yourselves and the other Grecians were  in different sentiments Now indeed incited by ambition  you aim the fatal blow at others  but at that season when  the Barbarian struck at inslaving us all these Thebans  were then that Barbarian s coadjutors And equitable cer  tainly it is that our alacrity at that season should be set in  the balance against our present transgressions if transgres  sors at present we have been You then would find our  greater merits quite outweighing our petty offences  and  our merits to be dated at a time when it was exceeding  rare to see Grecian braver ranged in opposition to the  power of Xerxes  when praise was ascribed not to those  who intent on self preservation dropped all the means of  withstanding his invasion but who chose through a series  of danger courageously to execute the most glorious acts  Of this number are we and as such have been pre emi nently most honourably distinguished And yet from  this original we fear our ruin now may have taken its rise  as we chose to follow the Athenians from a regard to jus  tice rather than you from the views of interest But so  long as the nature of things continues to be the same you 4 also ought to convince the world that your sentiments  about them are not changed that your principles still sug  gest it to you as your greatest interest that whenever your  gallant compatriots have laid upon you an obligation strong  enough to be eternally in force something on every pre  sent occurrence should be done for us by way of just ac  knowledgement  Reflect further within yourselves that you are now  distinguished by the body of Greece as examples for the  upright disinterested conduct Should you therefore de  termine in regard to us what in justice cannot be support  edâ for the eyes of the world are now intent on your pro  ceedings and as judges applauded for their worth you sit 252 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR   upon us whose reputation is yet unblemished take care  that you do not incur the general abhorrence by an inde  cent sentence against valuable men though you yourselves  are more to be valued  nor reposit in her common tem  pies those spoils you have taken from us the benefactors  of Greece How horrible will it seem for Plataea to be de  stroyed by Lacedaemonians  that your fathers inscribed the  city upon the tripod of Delphos in justice to its merit and  that you expunged its very being from the community of  Greece to gratify the Thebans  To such excess of misery  have we been ever exposed that if the Medes had prevail u ed we must have been utterly undone  and now must be  compleatly ruined by the Thebans in the presence of you  who were formerly our most cordial friends Two of the 4 sharpest most painful trials we are to undergo who but  latelv had we not surrendered our city must have gradu  allv perished by famine  and now stand before a tribunal  to be sentenced to death Wretched Plataeans by all man  kind abandoned  We who beyond our strength were once  the supports of Greece are now quite destitute bereft of  all redress Not one of our old allies to appear in our behalf  and even you O ye Lacedaemonians you our only hope as  we have too much reason to apprehend determined to give  us up  But by the Gods who witnessed once the social oaths  we mutually exchanged  by that virtue we exerted for the  general welfare of Greece  by those we abjure you to be  moved with compassion and to relent if with the Thebans  you are combined against us In gratitude to us beg the favour of them that they would not butcher whom you  ought to spare  demand such a modest requital from them  for your base concurrence and intail not infamy upon  yourselves to give others a cruel satisfaction To take  away our lives will be a short and easy task  but then to  efface the infamy of it will be a work of toil You have  no colour to wreak your vengeance upon us as enemies B III 253 fYEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427  who have ever wished you well and bore arms against you  in mere self defence Your decisions can in no wise be  righteous unless you exempt us from the dread of death  Retollect in time that you received us by free surrender  that to you we held forth our hands  the law forbids Gre  cians to put such to death  and that we have been from  time immemorial benefactors to you For cast your eyes  there upon the sepulchres of your fathers who fell by the  swords of the Medes and were interred in this our earth  These we have annually honoured with vestments and all  solemn decorations at our public expence Whatever hath  been the produce of our soil to them we have ever offered  the first fruits of the whole  as friends out of earth that  was dear to them as companions to those who once  fought together in the same field and lest all this by a  wrong determination you instantly disannul maturely re  fleet For Pausanias interred them here judging he had  laid them in a friendly soil and in the care of men with  friendly dispositions If therefore you put us to death  and turn this Plataan into Theban soil what is this but to  leave your fathers and relations in a hostile land and in the  power of those who murdered them never again to receive  the sepulchral honours  Will you further inslave the spot  on which the Grecians earned their liberty  Will you lay  desolate the temples of those Gods to whom they address  ed their vows before that battle against the Medes and  so were victorious  And will you abolish the solemn  sacrifices which those gallant patriots have founded and  appointed   It cannot O Lacedaemonians be consistent with your  glory to violate the solemn institutions of Greece the  memory of your own forefathers and your duty to us your  benefactors thus merely to gratify the malice of a hos  tile party to put men to death who have never wronged  you No  butâ to spare to relent to feel the just emo  tions of compassion to recal the idea not only what mise Vol I 2 Z 254 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  ries we are designed to suffer but what persons they are for  whom they are designed and to remember the uncertain  attack of calamity upon whom and how undeservedly  it may fall To you as in honour and necessity too ob  liged we address our intreaties  invoking aloud the Gods  whom Greece at her common altars and with joint devo  tion adores â to accept our plea  alleging those oaths  which your fathers have sworn â to pay them reverence  We are suppliants now at the sepulchres of your fathers  we call upon the dead reposited there to be saved from  Thebans that the kindest of friends as we have been  may not be sacrificed to the most deadly foes Again  we recal to memory that day in which having performed  the most splendid achievements in company with them  we are yet this day in danger of the most deplorable fate  Conclude we mustâ though tis hard for men in our dis  tress to conclude  when the very moment their words are  ended their very lives are most imminently endangered  yet still we insist that we surrendered not our city to the  Thebans  rather than that we should have chose the most  miserable end by famine but confiding in you into your  hands we gave it And highly fitting it is that if we  cannot prevail you should reinstate us in it and leave us  there at our own option to take our fate But once more  we conjure you that we who are citizens of PlatÂ a  who have shewed ourselves the most steady patriots of 44 Greece and now O Lacedaemonians your suppliants â  may not be turned over out of your hands out of your â 4 protection to the Thebans our unrelenting enemies â that  you would become our saviours and not doom to utter de  structionâ the men to whom all Greece is indebted for her  freedom In this manner the Plataeans spoke  and the Thebans fearing lest their words might work so far upon the Lace daemonians as to cause them to relent stood forth and de clared a desire to be also heard  since the Plataeans as B III 255 YEAR V BZrORE CHRIST 42  they conceived had been indulged in a much longer dis  course than was requisite to answer the question Leave accordingly was given and they proceeded thusâ  WE should not have requested your attention to any  thing we had to offer if these Plataeans had replied in  brief to the question and had not run out into slander and  invective against us â if they had not defended themselves  in points quite foreign to the purpose and not at all charged  against them as crimes  and launched forth into their own  praise uncensured and unprovoked But now it is incum  bent upon us in some points to contradict and in some to  refute to prevent the bad effects which might result either  from the criminations uttered against us or the pompous  praise they have bestowed upon themselves  that you un  der proper information with whom the greater truth re  mains may fairly decide between us  Our enmity against them we openly avow as it proceed  ed from just and honourable motives since to us who  were the founders of Plataea after we had gained possession  of Baeotia and of other towns as well as Plataea which after  being purged from extraneous mixtures remained in our jurisdiction â these men disdained to pay submission and  scorned original and fundamental laws They wilfully di  vided from the other Boeotians transgressing the laws of  their country and when likely to be forced back into their  duty they went over to the Athenians and in concert with  them accumulated wrongs upon us which have since been justly retaliated upon them  But when the Barbarian invaded Greece they were the  only Boeotians who did not join the Mede This they  allege and hence they arrogate applause to themselves  and lavish their calumnies upon us We grant indeed  they did not join the Mede and the reason was because  the Athenians did not join him Yet afterwards when  with the same all grasping ambition the Athenians invaded â 4 Greece they were the only Boeotians then who joined those 256 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  Athenians But consider further the respective situations  from which such conduct ensued in both Our city at that  time was not administered by the few who presided with  an equal and steady rule nor directed by the general voice  of the people Its state was such as with laws and sound  policy is quite incompatible  it bordered close upon a ty  ranny  the incroaching ambition of a handful of men held  fast possession of it These with no other view than the  strong establishment of their own private authority in the  success of the Mede by force overawed the people and  opened their gates to the invader This was not the act of  a whole city of a city master of its own conduct nor ought  she to be reproached for offences committed in despite of  her laws But on the other hand when the Mede was once  repulsed and the city repossessed of her ancient polity you  ought then to considerâ fresh invasions being formed by  the Athenians projects attempted to bring the rest of Greece  and our dominions also into their subjection sedition fo  mented amongst us by favour of which they seized the  greater partâ whether in the field of Coronea we fought  them and prevailed recovered the liberty of Boeotia pro  ceed even now with all alacrity to regain their liberty for  others supplying them with horse and all other military  provision far beyond any other confederate Such is the  apology we make for all the charge against us in having  joined the Mede Butâ that you have been the most out  rageous foes to Greece and are most deserving of whatever  punishment can be inflicted upon you we shall next endea  vour to demonstrate  In order to procure some revenge on us it is your  own plea  you became confederates and citizens of  Athens â Be it so You ought then to have marched in  their company only against us  you ought not to have  followed them in their expeditions against others Had  your own wills been averse to attend them on these occa B III 257 YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427  sions it was always in your power to have recourse to that  Lacedaemonian league in which you concurred against the  Mede and about which you make at present the greatest  parade That would have been amply sufficient to turn  aside our enmity from you  and what is above all had se  curely enabled you to rectify your measures But it was  not against your will neither was it upon compulsion that  you have solely adhered to the Athenians  But then you rejoinâ It was base to betray your bene  factors â Yet it was much more base and more enormous  to betray at once the whole body of Grecians with whom  you had sworn a mutual defence than the single Atheni  ans  the Athenians truly have inslaved your country  and  the others would regain its freedom You have not made  your benefactors the requital which gratitude injoined or  which is exempted from reproach â Injured and oppres  sed you applied it is pretended to them for redress â and  then you co operated with them in oppressing others But it  is not more dishonourable to be wanting in any act of grati  tude how justly soever it may be due than to make the re  turn in a manner in itself unjust You yourselves by act  ing thus have afforded undeniable proofs that you alone  did not join the Mede from a zeal for the Grecians but  merely because the Athenians did not join him You were  desirous to act in concert with the latter but in opposition  to the former  and now modestly claim to be recompensed  by your country for all the iniquitous services you have  done to a party But justice will never suffer this To  Athenians you gave the preference strive therefore from  them to obtain redress Cease vainly to allege the mutual  oaths you once exchanged as if they were obliged at pre sent to preserve you â You renounced you violated first  those oaths who rather concurred to inslave the iERinet  and some other people of the same association than endea  voured to prevent it and all without compulsion  still hap 258 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  py in the uninterrupted possession of your own rights and  not compelled to receive law from others as was our fate  Nay to the very last moment before this blockade was  formed against you when we calmly invited vou to be quiet  and neutral you insolently refused Which therefore is  the people on whom all Greece may fasten her hatred more  deservedly than on you who have made it a point to exert  your bravery in ruining your country  Those former good  dispositions you have so largely boasted you have now  shewn plainly to be repugnant to your genius What  your natural turn hath ever been the event hath with  truth ascertained The Athenians took the road of vio  lence and you attended them through all the journey â  And thus ample proof hath been exhibited by us that  against our wills we served the Persian and that you with  most chearful disposition have promoted the Athenian  tyranny  But in regard to your finishing charge against us as  guilty of excessive outrage and injustice that con  trary to every law in the midst of peace on a day of  sacred solemnity we seized upon your city â This great  offence in our opinion is less to be imputed to us than to  yourselves Had we marched indeed against your city in  a hostile manner had we scaled your walls and put your  property to fire and sword the charge had then been just  But if men of the first rank amongst you both for wealth  and birth desirous to put a stop to your foreign combina  tions and recal you to the common institutions of all  Boeotians  if such at their own free motion invited our  presence wherein are we unjust  For the leaders in all  cases are greater transgressors than the followers Though  in the present neither are they in our judgments nor are  we transgressors They were citizens as well as you  they had larger concerns at stake  and therefore opening  their gate and receiving us within their walls as friends ft III TEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 259  and not as foes they intended to prevent the corrupted  part of your body from growing worse and protect the  worthy and good according to their merit They calmly  studied the welfare of your minds and your bodies not  suffering your city to become an alien but recovering it  again to its duty and relations exempting it from being  the foe of any honest Grecian and re uniting it in the  bonds of amity with them all â There are proofs besides  that we did not intermeddle in a hostile manner We did  no manner of violence to any one we proclaimed aloud  that  whoever was desirous to conform to the primitive  institutions of all Boeotians should come and join us â â  You heard our voice with pleasure  you came in and en  tered into articles with us  you remained for a time with  out disturbance but at length having discovered the  smallness of our number and then perhaps we were judged  to have proceeded inhumanly in presuming to enter with  out the consent of your populace you then returned us  not such treatment as you had received from us you made  no remonstrances against innovations nor persuaded us  to depart but in open breach of articles you rushed upon  us We lament not here so much the death of those whom  you slew in this base attack upon us  some colour of law  might be alleged for their destruction but when con  trary to every law in cold blood you murdered men who  had spread their arms for mercy and had surrendered  themselves prisoners on promise of their lives â was not  that a monstrous act  In one short interval of time you  were guilty of three outrageous enormities an infraction  of articles the succeeding butchery of our people and a  breach of the solemn promise made to us that you would  not kill them provided we refrained from plundering your  lands Yet still you cry aloud that ive are the breakers of  law  you still remonstrate that you arc not debtors to jus  tice It is false The point we presume will soon be dc 260 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  termined right And for these for all offences you shall  have your reward  We have thus distinctly run over this affair for your  sakes O ye Lacedaemonians as well for our own  that you  may be convinced with how much equity you are going to  condemn them and that we have pursued the offenders  upon yet stronger obligations of justice Let not the reci  tal of their former virtues if virtues truly they ever had  mollify your hearts Virtue should be pleaded by men  who have suffered but on those who have committed base  ness it should redouble their punishment because they sin  in foul contrariety to their former selves Let them not  save themselves by lamentations and pathetic complaints  though they cried out so movingly upon the sepulchres of  your fathers and their own destitute forlorn condition For  to stop their cries we have proved against them that our  youths when butchered by them met with a more cruel  and unjust fate those youths some of whose fathers re  conciling Boeotia with you died in the field of Coronea the  rest now advanced in years bereft of their children their  houses desolate prefer a supplication far more just to you  to avenge them upon these Plataeans Those are most de  serving of pity who have suffered some great indignity  but when vengeance is duly inflicted on such men as these  Plataeans the world hath cause to triumph Their present  destitute forlorn condition is the work of themselves They  wilfully rejected a better alliance  and though uninjured  broke every law against us executioners of hatred more  than justice though now about to suffer less than the prece  dent they set requireth For they shall be executed by  lawful sentence  not like men who with stretched out hands  obtained fair quarter as they describe themselves but who  surrendered on this conditionâ to submit to justice  Avenge therefore O Lacedaemonians the law of  Greece so grossly violated by them Retaliate all the in B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 261 juries wc have suffered requiting so that chearful friend  ship we have ever shewn you  and let not their flow of  words overturn our just demands Make now a precedent  for Greece hereafter to follow Shew them that deci  sions must be formed not according to what men may say  but according to what they have done If their actions  have been right that a short simple narration may at any  time suffice But if those actions have been wrong that  all studied ornamental periods are intended to disguise the  truth If those who preside at judgments as you at pre  sent would proceed in a summary way to a general de  termination against the guilty little room would be left to  disguise unjustifiable actions by plausible speeches In this manner the Thebans replied  and the Lacedae monian judges agreed in the resolution that the question â  Whether they had received any good service from them  in the war â was properly and fairly conceived They grounded this upon the former proposal made to them to remain neutral according to the old treaty of Pausanias after the Medish invasion and upon another more lately which they had offered before they had blocked them up to be common friends to both sides in conformity to the same treaty But after this double refusal looking upon them selves as no longer bound to observe those articles which others had deliberately infringed to traverse their interest â they now proceed again to bring them forwards man by man and put the questionâ Whether they had done good  service to the Lacedaemonians and allies in the present  war â and upon their answering iVo led them aside and slew them Not one of the number did they exempt so that in this massacre there perished of Plataeans not fewer than two hundred and twenty five Athenians who had been besieged in their company  and all the women were sold for slaves The Thebans assigned the city for the space of a year to be the residence of certain Megarfeans who had been driven from home in the rage of a sedition and to Vol I 3 A 262 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR those surviving Plataeans who had been friends to the The ban interest But afterwards they levelled it with the earth rooted up its whole foundation and near to Juno s temple erected a spacious inn two hundred feet square partitioned within both above and below into a range of apartments In this structure they made use of the roofs and doors that had belonged to the Plataeans  and of the other moveables found within their houses of the brass and iron they made beds which they consecrated to Juno in whose honour they also erected a fane of stone one hundred feet in diameter The land being confiscated to public use was farmed out for ten years and occupied by Thebans So much nay so totally averse to the Plataeans were the Lacedaemonians be come  and this merely to gratify the Thebans whom they regarded as well able to serve them in the war which was now on foot And thus was the destruction of Plataea compleated in the ninety third year of its alliance with Athens The forty sail of Peloponnesians which had been sent to the relief of Lesbos after flying through the open sea to avoid the pursuit from Athens were driven by a tempest on the coast of Crete  and from thence they separately dropped into Cyllene a Peloponnesian harbour where they find thirteen triremes of Leucadians and Ambraciots with Brasi das the son of Tellis sent thither purposely to assist Alcidas with his counsel It was now the project of the Lacedae â Thucydides hath here been very sparing of his censure Nothing bad enough can be said of the Lacedaemonian behaviour on this occasion To put brave men to death coolly and deliberately who had most gallantly de fended themselves and merely for their steady attachment to liberty and the Athenians were hated by the Thebans shews the public spirit of Spar tans at this time to have been none at all The city of Plataea thus bar barously demolished was rebuilt after the peace of Antalcidas which put an end to the Peloponnesian war But not long after it was again demo lished by the Thebans for a refusal to join them against the Lacedaemoni ans However Alexander the Great once more re established it in a generous acknowledgment of the services that little State had rendered to Greece  and the Hataeans continued even in the time of Plutarch to celebrate the annual festival in honour of those who at the famous battle of Platae had died for the liberties of Greece B III YEAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427 263 monians since they had miscarried at Lesbos to augment their fleet and sail immediately for Corcyra now embroiled in sedition as there were no Athenians in those parts except ing only twelve ships which were stationed at Naupactusâ and thus their design might be effectuated before a fleet large enough to obstruct them could be sent from Athens This was their plan and Brasidas and Alcidas prepared for its execution The Corcyreans were now embroiled in a sedition ex cited by the return of the prisoners whom the Corinthians had taken in the naval engagements of Epidamnus They had obtained their release as was publicly given out for the sum of eighty talents for the payment of which their former friends at Corinth had joined in a security  but in fact for a secret promise they had made the Corinthians to put Corcyra into their hands To fulfil their engagements they tampered with every single Corcyrcan in order to bring about a revolt from the Athenians An Athenian and Co rinthian ship arrived at the same time with ambassadors on board These were admitted together to an audience at which the Corcyreans decreed  to maintain their alliance  with the Athenians according to treaty â but to be friends  to the Peloponnesians as in preceding times Pythias who at that time was at the head of the people entertained and lodged the Athenians without the public warrant And therefore against him the accomplices prefer an accusation as plotting how to subject Corcyra to Athenian slavery Pythias being acquitted in his turn exhibits a charge against five of the most considerable of their number for having cut pales in the sacred grove of Jupiter and Alcinus The fine for every pale was by law a staterj Being con demned to pay the whole they fled into the temples and sat down as supplicants in hope to obtain a mitigation of their line which was quite exorbitant Pythias who was also â 15 5001 terlinfc f H 0s 94 264 THE 1 ELOP0NNES1AN WAR strong in the senate gets a fresh order to have it levied in all the rigour of the law Thus debarred of any legal re dress and conscious further that Pythias so long as he con tinued in the senate would prevail upon the people to declare those their friends and those their foes who were so to Athens â they rise up from the sanctuary and seizing dag gers rush suddenly into the senate house where they stab Pythias and others both senators and private persons to the number of sixty Some few indeed who were the adherents of Pythias saved themselves on board the Athenian vessel which yet lay in the harbour After this bold assassination they summoned the Corcy reans to assemble immediately where they justified their proceedings  as most highly for the public good and the  only expedient of preventing Athenian slavery â advis ing them  for the future to receive neither of the rival parties  unless they came peacefully in a single vessel  if in more  to declare them enemies  and in conclusion they forced the ratification of whatever they had proposed They also instantly dispatch ambassadors to Athens representing the necessity they lay under to act as they had done  and to per suade those who had fled for refuge thither not to rush into such measures as might hurt the welfare of their country from a dread of the miseries which might thence ensue When these ambassadors were arrived at Athens the Athenians laid them and all their adherents under an arrest as enemies to the State and sent them prisoners to vEgina In the mean time those of the Corcyreans who had thus seized the government animated by the arrival of a Corin thian trireme and a Lacedaemonian embassy attack the people and overpower them in battle The people by fa vour of the night which approached fly to the citadel and more elevated parts of the city where they drew up toge ther and secured their posts  they also got possession of the Hyllaic harbour But their opponents seized the forum B III YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 265 where most of their own houses were situated and the har bour which points towards the forum and the continent The day following they skirmished a little with their mis sive weapons and both parties sent out detachments into the fields to invite the concurrence of the slaves upon a promise of their freedom A majority of slaves came in to the assist ance of the people and the other party got eight hundred auxiliaries from the continent After one day s respite they come again to blows The people get the better now by the advantage of their strong posts and their numbers The women with notable bold ness assisted in the combat by throwing tiles from the tops â f the houses and sustaining the tumult beyond their sex About the close of the evening the few were forced to fly and then apprehensive lest the people should rush down up on and so at a shout seize the dock and put them to the sword in order to stop their passage they set fire to the houses all round the forum and to such as were adjacent sparing neither their own nor those of their enemies The large effects of the merchants were consumed in the flames and the whole city was in danger of being reduced to ashes had a gale of wind arose to drive the flame that way â This put a stop to the contest and brought on a cessation when both sides applied themselves to strict guard for the night The Corinthian vessel after this victory on the side of the people stole privately away and many of the auxiliaries who crept off unperceived repassed to the oppo site shore The day following Nicostratus the son of Diotrephes who commanded the Athenian squadron comes up to their assistance with his twelve sail from Naupactus and five hun dred heavy armed Messenians He forthwith negotiated an accommodation and persuades them to make up the affair with one another by instantly condemning the ten princi pal authors of the sedition who immediately fled and per mitting all others to continue in the city upon articles 266 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR signed between both parties and the Atheniansâ to have  the same friends and the same foes Having so far carried his point he was intent on immediate departure But the managers for the people made him a proposal to leave five ships of his squadron with them to deter the enemy from any fresh commotion which should be replaced by five of the in own which they would instantly man to attend him on his station With this proposal he complied  and they named distinctly the mariners who to a man were of the opposite party Affrighted at this as a pretext to convey them to Athens they sit down in the temple of the Dioscuri Nicostratus endeavoured to raise them up and chear their despondency Yet all he could say was unavailing and the people run again to arms pretending that such a refusal to put to sea was a plain proof that their intentions were in sincere throughout Then they rifled their houses of all the arms they could find  and some of them who fell into their hands had immediately been butchered if Nicostratus had not interposed A second party terrified at these proceedings take their seats also as suppliants in the temple of Juno The num ber of these was not less than four hundred The people grown now apprehensive of some fatal turn persuade them to leave their sanctuary  and having prevailed transport them into that island which faceth the temple of Juno whither every thing needful for their sustenance was care fully sent them The sedition continuing in this posture about the fourth or fifth day after the transportation of the latter body into the island the Peloponnesian ships which had assembled at Cyl lene after the voyage of Ionia appear in sight to the number of fifty three Alcidas was commander in chief as before and Brasidas attended as his council They came to anchor in the harbour of Sybota on the main  and next morning at break of day steered directly for Corcyra Great was the tumult now at Corcvra  Thev were afraid B III 267 TEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 of the malccontents within and the hostile fleet approach ing the city They got sixty ships immediately on float and each so fast as it was manned advanced to meet the foe The Athenians indeed proposed to put out first to sea them selves  and that the Corcyreans should afterwards come out and join them when they had got all their ships toge ther But as they advanced in a straggling manner to wards the enemy two ships went directly over to them  and on board others the mariners were at blows with one another In short there was no manner of order in any of their mo tions The Lacedaemonians perceiving how it was with twenty of their ships drew up to engage the Corcyrdans and opposed the remainder to the twelve Athenian two of which were only the Salaminian and the Paralus The Corcyrians who charged in this disorderly manner and with few ships in a line were on their side terribly dis tressed  whilst the Athenians fearing lest the other vastly superior in number might quite surround their little squa dron would not venture to attack them when altogether nor to break upon the middle of the enemy s line  but assault ing them towards one of the extremities sink one of their ships Upon this the Peloponnesians having formed a cir cle the Athenians sailed round and round and endeavoured to break their order Those who pursued the Corcyreans perceiving this and fearing what had happened formerly at Naupactus steered away from thence to support their own squadron And now with their whole embodied strength they designed to pour upon the Athenians They having already shifted the helm fell gradually away They were desirous to favour the flight of the Corcyrtans beyond the possibility of a chace and so they fell off entirely at their own leisure keeping the enemy in their front still ranged in order Such was this engagement which at the setting of the sun was quite ended The Corcyreans were afraid lest the enemy in prosecu tion of their victory shoidd immediately assault the city or 268 THE PELOPO1TNESIAN WAR take up the persons in the island or by some other method attempt to distress them For this reason they removed the prisoners again from the island into the temple of Juno and applied themselves to guard the city But the enemy though victorious at sea durst not think of proceeding to attack the city but satisfied with taking thirteen ships be longing to the Corcyreans they returned to the main from whence they had sallied to the engagement The next day also they refrained from making any attempt upon the city where the disorder and consternation were as great as ever Brasidas is reported urgently to have pressed it upon Alci das but in the council of war was quite over ruled They landed however at cape Leucymne and plundered the country The Corcyrean people whose fears were still suggesting that they should be attacked by the enemy s fleet had con ferred with the suppliants and others about the only means to preserve the city And some of them they persuaded to join in navigating their ships  for by some means or other they had again manned thirty expecting every moment the enemy s approach But the Peloponncsians continued the ravage of their fields only till noon and then repassed to their former stations Yet before the dawn of the succeed ing day they saw sixty lights held up to denote an equal number of Athenian ships advancing from Leucas The Athenians advertised of the sedition and the course of the fleet under Alcydas against Corcyra had sent away this re inforcement under the command of Eurymedon the son of Thucles Upon this the Peloponncsians whilst yet it was night crept homewards along the shore and carrying their vessels over the isthmus of Leucas lest they should be dis covered in going round it are safely retreated within their own confines When the Corcyreans had discovered the approach of the Athenian reinforcement and the departure of the enemy they received the Messenians within their walls who till now B III YEAR V Â BEFORE CHRIST 427 269 had lodged without  and having ordered the ships which they had manned to come about into the Hyllaic harbour whilst they were going about in pursuance of this order they put all the adverse faction whom they found to the sword Those further who had took on in the ships at their persuasion they threw into the sea and then retired They afterwards went to Juno s temple and persuaded a party of suppliants there to the amount of fifty to undergo a judicial trial in which they were all condemned to die The majo rity of suppliants who refused to hear such persuasion no sooner saw the fate of their brethren than they either slew one another within the temple or hung themselves up upon the trees within its verge each finding some expedient for his own dispatch During those seven days that Euryme don with his reinforcement continued at Corcyra the peo ple of that city extended the massacre to all whom they judged their enemies The crime oh which they justified their proceedings was their attempt to overturn the demo cracy Some perished merely through private enmity some for the sums they had lent by the hands of the borrowers Every kind of death was here exhibited Every dreadful act usual in a sedition and more than usual was perpetrated now For fathers slew their children some Were dragged from altars and some were butchered at them And a number of persons immured in the temple of Bacchus were starved to death So cruel was the progress of this sedition and so excessively cruel did it appear because the first of so black a nature that ever happened But afterwards the con tagion spread one may say through the whole extent of Greece when factions raged in every city the popular de magogues contending for the Athenians the aspiring fen for the Lacedaemonians In peace it is true they were void of all pretext of all opportunity to invite these rivals But now amidst declared hostilities and the quest of al liance to afflict their enemies and add an increase of strength Vol I 3 B 270 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR to themselves opportunities were easily found by such as were fond of innovations to introduce the side they favoured The consequence of this was sedition in cities with all its numerous and tragical incidents Such were now and such things ever will be so long as human nature continues the same  but under greater or less aggravations and diversified in circumstances according to the several vicissitudes of con junctures which shall happen to occur In the seasons of peace and affluence communities as well as individuals have their tempers under better regulation because not liable to that violence which flows from necessity But war which snatcheth from them their daily subsistence is the teacher of violence and assimilates the passions of men to their present condition By these means were cities harassed with seditions And those to whose fate the later commotions fell through en quiry what had happened in such instances before grew enormously ambitious to suppress the machinations of others both in policy of attempts and extravagance of revenge Even words lost now their former significance since to pal liate actions they were quite distorted For truly what be fore was a brutal courage began to be esteemed that forti tude which becomes a human and sociable creature pru dent consideration to be specious cowardice modesty the disguise of effeminacy  and being wise in every thing to be good for nothing The hot fiery temper was adjudged the exertion of true manlv valour cautious and calm deli beration to be a plausible pretext for intended knavery He who boiled with indignation was undoubtedly trusty who presumed to contradict was ever suspected He who succeeded in a roguish scheme was wise and he who sus pected such practices in others was still a more able genius But was he provident enough so as never to be in need of such base expedients he was one that would not stand to his engagements and most shamefully awed by his foes fn short he who could prewnt another in executing vil B III  YEAR V BEFORE CHRIST 427 271 lany or could persuade a well designing person to it was sure to be applauded Men now who were allied in blood were less valued or caressed than such as were connected by voluntary combim  tion since the latter unscrupulous and uninquisitive were more ready to embark in any scheme whatever For now as sociations were not formed for such mutual advantage as is consistent with but for the execution of such rapines as are contrary to human laws In mutual trust they persisted not out of any regard to religious obligation but from the bond of communicated guilt To the fair and honest propo sals of adversaries they hearkened indeed when such by ac tive strength could controul them but never through candid ingenuity Revenge upon another was a more valued pos session than never to have suffered injury Oaths if ever made for present reconciliation had a temporary force so long as neither knew how to break them  but never when either party had power to abet their violation He who at inviting opportunity durst first incur the perjury if the ad versary was off his guard executed his rancour with higher spirit than from enmity open and avowed Such a step was thought most secure  and because he had thus surpassed in guile it was certainly extolled as a master piece of cunning Large is the number of villains and such obtain more easily the reputation of dexterity than their dupes can that of good ness  The latter are apt to blush  the former most impudent ly triumph The source of all these evils is a thirst of power in con sequence either of rapacious or ambitious passions The mind when actuated by such is ever ready to engage in party feuds For the men of large influence in communi ties avowing on both sides a specious cause some standing up for the just equality of the popular others for the fair decorum of the aristocratical government by artful sounds embarrassed those communities for their own private lucre Both sides intent on victory carried on the contention with THE PELOPOSNESIA WAR the keenest spirit They most daringly projected and then regularly executed the most dreadful machinations Their revenge was not limited by justice or the public welfare  it aimed at more ample satisfaction Either side constantly measured it by such retaliation as was judged the sweetest either by a capital condemnation through an iniquitous sen tence or by earning the victory with their own hands in which they were always ready to glut the present rancour of their hearts And hence it was that the pious and upright conduct was on both sides disregarded And when any point of great importance was before them to carry it by specious collusive oratory was the greatest enhancement of their credit Yet all this while the moderate members of such communities either hated because they would not meddle or envied for such obnoxious conduct fell victims to both Seditions in this manner introduced every species of out rageous wickedness into the Grecian manners Sincerity which is most frequently to be found in generous tempers was laughed out of countenance and for ever vanished It was become the universal practice to keep up a constant enmity of intention against one another and never to be lieve No promise was strong enough no oath sufficiently solemn to banish such mutual diffidence Those who ex celled in shrewd consideration resigned all hope of any last ing security and stood ever on their guard against whom it was impossible for them to trust But persons of meaner understandings took more effectual means for their preser vation Living in constant apprehensions from their own inferiority and the craft of their opponents lest by words they should be over reached or that such subtle heads might execute their treacheries upon them unawares they boldly seized the present moment and at once dispatched the men they dreaded  who presuming too much on their own penetration and that it was superfluous to aim a blow at those whom they could at any time supplant by cunning B III 273 YEA V â BETORE CHRIST 427 despised them so far as to neglect a proper guard and so contributed to their own destruction Many such daring outrages were now by way of prece dent committed at Corcyra nay all whatever that men who are wreaking revenge upon such as before were their masters and had exerted their superiority with savageness more than humanity can in turn retaliate upon them were executed there â Some joined in these acts of violence to procure a discharge from their former poverty  but the great er number through a passionate desire to seize the property of their neighbours Or though they were not lured by the lust of rapine but engaged in the contest upon fair and open views yet hurried to wild extravagance through mad and undisciplined anger they proceeded to cruel acts anc with inexorable fury The whole order of human life was for a season confounded in this city The human temper too apt to transgress in spite of laws and now having gained the ascendant over law seemed pleased with exhibiting this public manifestation that it was too weak for anger too strong for justice and an enemy to all superiority Men could not otherwise have awarded the preference to revenge over righ teous duty and to lucre over that habit of justice in which envy never yet had power to annoy them But more than this when the point in view is revenge upon others men haughtily make precedents against themselves by infringing those laws which are binding by the ties of nature and from which alone any hope of safety can be extracted for themselves in a plunge of misery precluding thus all possibility of re dress should they be reduced in some future extremity to make the same appeal And thus the Corcyreans continued to execute the rage of such cruel passions upon the heads of one another within the precincts of their own city of which this was the first ex ample in Greece till Eurymedon with the Athenian fleet under his command put out again to sea But after his departure they who by flight hr d preserved 274 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR their lives to the number of about five hundred having seized their forts upon the opposite shore got possession of their own land on that side the water Putting out hence they plundered the Corcyreans in the island and made such havoc that a violent famine ensued in the city They further sent a deputation to Lacedaemon and Corinth to negociate the means of their restoration But nothing of this kind suc ceeding they got together afterwards a body of auxiliaries and transports and so passed over to the island of Corcyra to the amount of six hundred men Having now set fire to their transports to preclude every other expedient but gain ing firm footing where now they were they marched up to the mountain Istone and having fortified themselves there made cruel work with those in the city and were masters of the country round about About the end of the same summer the Athenians sent out twenty sail for Sicily under the command of Laches the son of Melanopus and Charoeadas the son of Euphile tus A war was now on foot between the Syracusans and Leontines Confederate with the Syracusans were except ing Camarina all the Doric cities which had formerly en tered into alliance with the Lacedaemonians before this war broke out but had yet no where effectually joined them With the Leontines were the Chalcidic cities and Cama rina Of Italy the Locrians sided with the Syracusans and the Rhegians from the motive of consanguinity with the Leontines The allies therefore of the Leontines sent to Athens petitioning the Athenians in respect of their â One of the persons or the chief employed on this occasion is said to be Gorgias of Leontium the first rhetorician of that or of any age When he had his audience from the Athenians to deliver the reasons of his em bassy he made a speech so smooth and flowing so new in the manner of its turns so pretty in the expression and so nicely diversified by a change and opposition of figures that he won their hearts and succeeded in his negociation Our historian indeed who takes no notice of Gorgias gives two political reasons just after the ready compliance of the Athenians on B III YEAR V â BEFORE CHRIST 427 275 old alliance and their Ionic descent to send them a succour of shipping For the Syracusans had now blocked them up both by land and sea The Athenians immediately sent one giving out that they were bound in duty to take this step  but their real motive was to prevent the exportation of corn from thence to Peloponnesus and also to sound the possibility of bringing Sicily into their own subjection Their squad ron therefore arriving at Rhegium on the Italian shore sup ported their allies in the present war and in this the sum mer ended In the beginning of the winter the plague broke out a se cond time at Athens not that during this whole interval of time it had wholly ceased though its rage had very much abated But now the mortality began again and continued not less than a year but the former had raged for the space of two There was nothing which lay upon the Athenians so hard as this or so much impaired their strength It appear ed from the muster rolls that there perished four thousand and four hundred of those citizens who wore the heavy ar mour and three hundred of the horsemen The number of the lower people that died was not to be computed There happened at the same time many earthquakes  at Athens  in Eubcca amongst the Boeotians and especially at the Boeotian Orchomenus The same winter the Athenians and Rhegians on the coast of Sicily form an expedition with thirty sail against those which are called the isles of iEolus This was not feasible in the summer season for want of water These isles are inhabited by the Lipareans who were a colony from Cni dus Their residence is chiefly in one of them called Lipare though by no means large They go from hence to the til lage of the others Didyme and Strongyle and Hiera It this occasion It is a step which draws great consequences after it â Thucydides in the sequel will open all the plan and give an exact detail of the operations of this new war into which the Athenians are beginning to embark 276 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR is believed by those people that Vulcan keeps his forge in Hiera because in the night it visibly throws forth a great quantity of fire and in the day of smoke These isles are situated over against the shore of the Siculi and the Messe nians and were allied with Syracuse The Athenians hav ing plundered the soil and finding the inhabitants would not come in put back again to Rhegium â And here the win ter ended and the fifth year of this war the history of which Thucydides hath compiled YEAR VI THE following summer the Peloponnesians and confede rates assembled at the Isthmus in order to make the usual inroad into Attica  and Agis son of Archidamus king of the Lacedaemonians was there ready for the command But the frequent earthquakes which happened about this time caused them to return back and entirely put a stop to the designed incursion About the same space of time shocks of earthquakes were felt in Euboea where at Orobi the sea breaking over what was then land with impetuous swells laid a part of that city under water Some of which stagnated there though some washed its way back however a tract now continues sea which before was land All those who could not reach the higher grounds in time by running before the surge were drowned â A similar inundation happened at the isle of Atalanta amongst the Locrians of Opus where it washed away the Athenian fort and of two ves sels that lay dry upon the beach staved one to pieces

the sea rose very high but did not overflow An earthquake however demolished part of the fortification the town house and some few dwel ling houses My solution of such effects is this  Where the shock of the earthquake was most violent it forcibly drove away the sea before it which suddenly returning again occasioned these more violent swells And without an earth quake I deem all such accidents impossible The same summer many of other nations as they hap pened to be drawn into the quarrel were engaged in the war of Sicily as well as the Sicilians themselves who took up arms one against another and the Athenians together with their allies Yet the most memorable actions alone either of the allies thus aided by the Athenians or of the common enemy against the Athenians shall I now relate â Charoea das the Athenian commander having lost his life in the Sy racusan war Laches who had now the sole command of the fleet injunction with the allies appeared before Myla of the Messenians The garrison of Mylae consisted of two companies of Messenians  and these had formed an am buscade to cut off the enemy when landed But the Athe nians and allies drive them from the place of ambush with great slaughter Then they proceeded to assault the works which necessitated the defendants to give up their citadel by capitulation and even to attend them against Messene But after this the Athenians and allies were no sooner ap proached than the Messenians also compounded giving hostages and all other securities required for their future be haviour The same summer the Athenians with thirty sail of ships commanded by Demosthenesf the son of Alcisthenes â Prytaneum t This Demosthenes will make a considerable figure in the course of this war The most celebrated orator of the same name hath ranked him amongst the greatest of his countrymen with Aristides Pericles and Ni cias He stiles him also an orator and Thucydides will give us hereaf ter a specimen of his manner of haranguing His name tah indeed hath Vol I 3 C 278 THE PEL0PONNESIAK WAR and Procles the son of Theodoras appeared upon the coast of Peloponnesus  whilst a larger armament of sixty and two thousand heavy armed was employed against Melos under the command of Nicias son of Niceratus Melos is an island and as the inhabitants of it were averse to the Athenian subjection and had refused to accede to their al liance they were now bent on its reduction Having laid the island waste and the Melians still refusing to submit the Athenians put again to sea and crossed over to Oropus on the opposite shore  where arriving at night the heavy armed were detached to march with all expedition by land towards Tanagra of Boeotia Notice being given of their arrival there they were instantly joined by the whole force of Athens which had marched out of the city under the orders of Hipponicus the son of Callias and Eurymedon the son of Thucles A camp they formed  and having for the space of a day laid the territory waste they reposed them selves there the succeeding night But the next morning having gained a victory over the Tanagreans who aided by a party of Thebans sallied out upon them they only staid to gather up the arms and erect a trophy and then marched awayâ these back again to the city and those to the fleet Nicias upon this putting out again with his sixty sail plun dered all the sea coast of Locris and then returned into the harbour of Athens It was about this time that the Lacedaemonians founded the colony of Heraclea in Trachinia Their view in doing it was this Those who in general are stiled Melien sians are divided into three bodies  Paralians Hierensians and Trachinians The last of these the Trachinians who had been terribly distressed by a war made upon them by the bordering Oeteeans had first of all intended to throw carried off all the glory of eloquence  But the Dcmotthenca who is the subject of this note was an able general Tory enterprizing and very brave always vigilant in the service of bis country though more as a sol dier than a statesman  and provided hi country was served not too anx ious about who carried off the honour In short he was an open hearted disinterested worthy Athenian B III TEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 279 themselves under the Athenian protection but afterwards apprehending they might not be hearty in their support they made application to Lacedsrmbn by Tisamenus the de legate appointed by them on this occasion The Dorians too from whom the Lacedaemonians are descended sent their embassadors also to accompany and join with him in the negociation for they likewise were infested by these Oetfeans The Lacedaemonians after an audience resolved to send out this colony as a sure expedient not only to pro tect the Trachinians and Dorians from insult but to annoy the Athenians more sensibly in the course of the war from a city so commodiously seated For thence they could at any time make an attack upon Euboea as the passage was but short and further it lay most conveniently upon the road to Thrace In a word they were very eager about building this city In the first place therefore they begged the advice of the God at Delphi His answer being favour able they sent out a colony composed of their own and the neighbouring people  encouraging farther all Grecian adven turers whatever to join in this settlement except Ionians and Achaeans and some of foreign nations Three Lace daemonians are appointed to be the leaders of this colony  Leon and Alcidas and Damagon These arriving at the spot erect upon a new foundation and wall round the city which is now called Heraclea distant about forty stadia from Thermopyl and twenty from the sea They proceed ed next to build the naval docks  and these they began at Thermopylae close under the straits since there the were capable of the strongest defence The Athenians when they saw the large resort to this co lony were at first under great apprehensions They sus pected it to be chiefly intended for the annoyance of Eu boea as the passage from it was short to Cenaeum in Eu bcea  though in the sequel their apprehensions proved en tirely groundless Not the least damage accrued to them  About four miles 280 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR from this colony and the reason was this  The Thessalians who were masters of all the country round about it and up on whose very land it was built fearing lest this new settle ment might prove too powerful a neighbour at last gave it all possible annoyance and harassed the new inhabitants with continual war till from the large number they were at first they mouldered into nothing When the Lacedaemo nians first declared the colony the whole world was eager to get a settlement in the city which they thought would want no support Not but that its sudden decay was owing also in great measure to the Lacedaemonian leaders From the first moment of their arrival they had spoiled every thing wherein they meddled  they reduced their numbers to a handful of men because their fears had driven away the rest as the government was always severe and not always just The neighbouring people surprising them in such a state prevailed against them with the utmost ease The same summer and even during that interval of time the Athenians were employed at Melos the Athenians of the fleet of thirty sail who were upon the Peloponnesian coast in the first place having placed an ambush at Elo menus of Leucadia intercepted and cut off a part of the garrison In the next place with an augmented force they came up to Leucas being attended now by the whole strength of the Acarnanians except the Oeniadae by the Za cynthians and Cephallenians and fifteen sail of Corcyreans The Leucadians though their territory was laid waste both without and within the Isthmus where the city of Leucas and the temple of Apollo are seated yet durst not venture out against such superior numbers Upon this the Acarnani ans vehemently pressed it upon Demosthenes the Athenian general to block them up by a wall of circumvallation  imagining they might easily reduce them and rid them selves of a city which had been their eternal foe But De mosthenes chose rather to hearken at this time to the sug gestions of the Messenians   how glorious it would be as he B III 281 YEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426  was now at the head of so large a force to invade the ALto  lians who were such plagues to Naupactus  and if their  reduction could be compleated the rest of that continent  might easily be brought into the Athenian subjection For  though the iEtolians were a great and warlike people yet  as they dwelled in open villages remote from one another  as light armour only was in use amongst them they pre  sumed he might easily complete their reduction before any  succour could reach them They advised him further  to begin with the Apodoti to take the Ophionians next then  to proceed to the Eurytanians which is the most numerous  people of iEtolia reported also to speak in a most barbarous  dialect and to feed upon raw flesh that if these could be  surprised the rest of Etolia would submit of course He thereforeâ willing to oblige the Messenians and incited above all by the thought that without exposing the Athenian forces after he had done with the Etolians he might march with the allied strength of the continent and penetrate by land as far as Boeotia through the Locrians of Ozoli to Cytinium in Doris keeping Parnassus on his right till he got down amongst the Phocians who he reckoned from their constant friendship with the Athenians would readily join him or however might ea sily be compelled to do it and then that Boeotia borders next on the Phocians â Demosthenes I say weighing from Leu cas with his whole force to the great regret of the Acarnani ans coasted along to Solium He there communicated his plan to the Acarnanians in which they refused to join beause he had refused the blockade of Leucas Demosthenes with hi3 other force the Cephallenians and Messenians and Zacyn thians and three hundred soldiers draughted from on board the Athenian ships the fifteen Corcyrean were already de parted set about this expedition against the iEtolians He began it from Oeneon in Locris For the Locrians called Ozoke were allies and had notice to meet the Athenians with all their force in the midland parts These being not only borderers but using also the same kind of arms with the iEto lians were judged most proper to accompany the expedition 282 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR as they knew so well their method of battle and their country Having reposed his army one night within the verge of the temple of the Nemean Jove in which the inhabitants have a tradition that Hesiod the poet expired in pursuance of an oracle which had fixed Nemea for the place of his death he marched again at break of day and entered iEtolia On the first day he taketh Potidania on the second Crocylium and on the third Tichium There he halted and sent away the booty to Eupolium of Locris It was now his resolution after he had subdued the rest to march last of all against the Ophionians if they did not voluntarily submit beforehand in his retreat back to Naupactus This preparation against them did by no means escape the iEtolians The scheme was no sooner formed than they had gained intelligence of it and by that time the army â The story of Hesiod s death is related by Plutarch in the The banquet of the seven viite nun Solon interposing here said  Such things Diodes  must be referred immediately to the Gods they are above human condi  t ion But the case of Hesiod is within the lot of humanity and concerns  us all But perhaps you know the story 1 do not he replied  It is  then well worth your hearing A certain Milesian it seems in whose  company Hesiod was hospitably lodged and entertained in Locris had se  cretly debauched the daughter of their host When the affair came to  light it was suspected that Hesiod had all along been privy to the in  trigue and concealed such base behaviour and though he was entirely  innocent he fell a victim to hasty resentment and foul calumniation The  brothers of the damsel laid wait for and slew him at the Nemean temple  in Locris and with him his servant whose name was Troilus Their bo  dies being thrown into the sea that of Troilus indeed floating up into  the river Daphnus was stopped at a rock quite surrounded with water a  small distance from the sea But the moment Hesiod s body was thrown  into the sea a shoal of dolphins caught it and carried it to Rhium and  Molycrium The Locrians that very day were assembled at Khium for  a solemn festival and sacrifice which they still continue to celebrate at 4 the same place The dead body was no sooner beheld in its approach  than full of wonder as was likely they hurried down to the beach and  knowing it to be the body of Hesiod and very fresh they postponed  every other care to the discovery of this murder from their high regard  for Hesiod This was soon done  the assassins were found out whom  they threw headlong into the sea and demolished their houses But  Hesiod was buried by them in the temple of the Nemean Jove B III TEAR VI â BETORE CHRIST 426 283 was within their borders they were all drawn together in a numerous body for their mutual defence Nay even the most distant Ophionians who are seated upon the Meliac bay the Bomiensians and Calliensians were already come up The Messenians continued to amuse Demosthenes with the same suggestions as at first They still insisted that the conquest of the iEtolians would be an easy performance and advised him to advance immediately against their villages nor give them time to gather together in a body to oppose him but to attack every place he came to and take it This advice being quite to his own taste and relying upon his own good fortune which hitherto had never been checked with out waiting for the Locrians who were very much wanted and were to have joined him for he stood most in need of light armed darters he advanced to iEgitium and assault ing takes it by storm The inhabitants made their escape and posted themselves upon the hills which overlook the town It was situated amongst lofty eminences and distant from the sea about eighty stadia But now the iEtolians who were come up for the pre servation of iEgitium running down in separate bodies from different eminences made an attack upon the Athenians and allies and poured in their javelins amongst them  And when ever the Athenian army approached to charge they plied be fore them when they again fell back these again returned to the charge This kind of engagement continued for a long time a series of alternate pursuits and retreats in both which the Athenians suffered most So long however as their archers had darts and opportunity to use them they lost no ground  for the light armed iEtolians fell back to avoid the darts But when the chief of the archers dropped his pajrty was soon dispersed and the whole army began to incline Their strength was quite exhausted by so many repeated rharges  and now the iEtolians pressing hard upon them â About eight miles 2 84 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR and pouring in whole showers of missive weapons they turn ed about and fled Now tumbling into caverns from whence they could not recover themselves or bewildered in places of which they had no knowledge they were miserably de stroyed For Cromon the Messenian who laid out all the routes had been killed in the battle The iEtolians pursued with their darts and being not only swift of foot but also lightly armed easily overtook many of them in their flight and did great execution A large party who had lost their way threw themselves into a wood which was quite impas sable The iEtolians set the wood on fire in the flames of which they were all consumed Every affecting species of flight and destruction was now the fate of the Athenian army Those who had the good fortune to escape effected it by reaching the sea and Oeneon of Locris from whence they first began the expedition The number of the allies who thus perished was large  that of heavy armed Athenians was about a hundred and twenty  so considerable was the loss and all of them in the very flower of their youth In the whole course of this war the State of Athens never lost at any one time so many of her most gallant citizens as now Procles also the other commander in this expedition perished They afterwards fetched off their dead by a truce obtained from the Etolians This being done they retired to Nau pactus and there shipped themselves for Athens Demos thenes however was left behind at Naupactus and the parts adjacent After such a miscarriage he durst not presume to face the people of Athens About the same time the Athenians on the Sicilian station having sailed towards Locris landed upon that coast They destroyed a party of Locrians who endeavoured to make head against them  and then take Peripolium a town situ ated on the river Hal ex The same summer the iEtolians who had some time be fore dispatched an embassy to Corinth and Lacedwmon B III YEAR VI â BEFORE CHRIST 426 983 composed of Tolophus the Ophionian Bofiades the Euryst hanian and Tisander the Apodotian prevail there in their suit for a diversion against Naupactus because the Athe nians had invaded their territories It was about autumn when the Lacedaemonians marched away three thousand heavy armed of their allies of which number five hundred belonged to Heraclea the city so lately founded in Trachi nia Eurylochus a Spartan was appointed to command in the expedition and was accompanied by two other Spartans Macarius and Menedaeus The army being drawn into a body at Delphi Eurylochus dispatched a herald to the Ozolian Locri His route to Naupactus lay through their territory He was also desirous to detach them from the Athenian alliance The Amphissensians were the readiest of all the Locri to give their concurrence as standing in perpetual awe of the hatred bore them by the Phocians These therefore were the first who sent in hostages and who persuaded others to follow their example from a dread of this army which was now approaching Accordingly the Myonensians their own borderers were the first who complied  for their part of Locris is most difficult of access1 These were followed by the Ippensians and Messapians and Tritaeensians and Challaeans Tolophonians Hessians and Oeanthians and all these gave a personal attendance in the expedition The Olpeans indeed sent in their hos tages but would not attend The Hyasans refused their hostages till one of their villages called Polis was seized When all things were ready and the hostages placed securely at Cytinium of Doris Eurylochus with his army taking the route of Locris advanced against Naupactus He seized upon Oeneon and Eupolium as he marched for refusing to concur When they had entered the territory of Naupactus and were joined by the Etolian aid they wasted the country to the very suburb of which also be cause unfortified they took possession Turning thence to Molycrium a Corinthian colony but now subject to the Athenians they reduce it Vol I 3D 286 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR But Demosthenes the Athenian for he had continued at Naupactus ever since the vEtolian miscarriage having received intelligence of this army and dreading the loss of this place had addressed himself to the Acarnanians and with some difficulty owing to his departure from Leucas persuades them to send a succour to Naupactus Accord ingly they put a thousand of their heavy armed under his orders whom he threw into the town by sea which effec tually preserved it For the danger before was manifest as the wall was very large in compass and the number of de fendants inconsiderable When Eurylochus and his council had discovered that such a succour had been received into the town and that its reduction was now impracticable they marched away their forces not towards Peloponnesus but to that iEtolia which is now called Calydon to Pleuron to the neighbour ing towns and to Proschion of iEtolia The Ambraciots had now been with and prevailed upon them to join in some attempts upon Argos in Amphilochia upon the rest of that province and Acarnania  assuring them that could these be reduced the whole continent there would instantly go over to the Lacedaemonian league Eurylochus having assured them of his concurrence and given the iEtolians their dismission halted thereabouts with his army till the Ambraciots had entered upon the expedition against Argos and it was time for him to join them And here the sum mer ended The Athenians in Sicily the beginning of the winter putting themselves at the head of their Grecian allies and as many of their Sicilian as unable to support the Syracusan yoke had revolted from Syracuse to join them began fresh operations of war in concert and assaulted Nessa a town of Sicily the citadel of which was in the hands of the Syra cusans But the attempt was unsuccessful and they again determined to draw off During the retreat the Syracusans sallying forth fell upon those allies of the Athenians who marched in the rear and with such force that they put b in 287 TEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 a part of the army to flight and slew a considerable num ber After this Laches and the Athenians having made some attempts and landed on the coast of Locris near the mouth of the river Caicinus were engaged by a party of Locrians con sisting of about three hundred under Proxenus the son of Capaton These the Athenians defeated and having strip ped them of their arms went off the coast The same winter also the Athenians purified Delos in obedience to an oracle Pisistratus the tyrant had purified it formerly not indeed the whole but so much of the island as lies within the prospect of the temple The purifi cation now was universal and performed in the following manner They broke up all the sepulchres of the dead without ex ception and prohibited for the future any death or birth in the island both which were to be confined to Rheiuea For Rhenaea lies at so small a distance from Delos that Poly crates the tyrant of Samos who was formerly of great power by sea amongst other isles he reduced to his dominions took Rhenaea also which he consecrated to Delian Apollo and fastened it to Delos by a chain And after this purification the Athenians made the first institution of the Delian games to be solemnized every fifth returning year Not but that in the earlier times there was used to be a great conflux of Io nians and neighbouring islanders to Delos They resorted to the solemn festivals there with their wives and children in the same manner as the Ionians do now to Ephesus Games of bodily exercise and of music were actually celebrated and cities exhibited their respective chorusses For this we have the testimony of Homer in the following verses of his hymn to Apollo To thee O Phoebus most the Delian isle Gives cordial joy excites the pleasing smile  When gay Ionians flock around thy fane  Men women children a resplendent train 388 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAS Whole flowing garments sweep the sacred pile Whose grateful concourse gladdens all the isle Where champions fight where dancers beat the ground Where cheerful music echoes all around Thy feast to honour and thy praise to sound That there was also a musical game to which artists resorted to make trials of the skill he fully eheweth in other verses to be found in the same hymn For having sung the Delian chorus of females he closeth their praise with these lines in which further he hath made mention of himself Hail great Apollo radiant god of day  Hail Cynthia goddess of the lunar sway  Henceforth on me propitious smile  and you Ye blooming beauties of the isle adieu  When future guests shall reach your happy shore And refug d here from toils lament no more  When social chat the mind unbending chears And this demand shall greet your friendly earsâ  Who waa the Bard e er landed on your coast  Who sung the sweetest and who pleas d you most i With voice united all ye blooming fair Join in your answer and fur me declare  Sayâ The blind bard the sweetest notes may boast  He lives at Chios and he pleas d us most Such an evidence hath Homer left us that in early times there was a great concourse and festival at Delos But after wards the people of the islands and the Athenians sent in their parties for the chorus with victims But the usual games and most of the solemn rites had been disused through some sinister events till the Athenians now made a fresh in stitution of this solemnity with the addition of a chariot race which had not formerly been a part of it The same winter the Ambraciots in pursuance of their engagements with Eurylochus who waited their motions march away with three thousand heavy armed against the Amphilochian Argos Accordingly breaking into Argia they seize Olpae a strong place situated on an eminence on B III YEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 289 the sea side This place had been formerly fortified by the Acarnanians who used it for the public tribunal of justice It is distant from the city of Argos which is also a maritime town about twenty five stadia The Acarnanians were now in motion some running to the defence of Argos others to encamp at the important post of Crena in Amphilochia to observe the motions of the Peloponnesians commanded by Eurylochus that they might not perfect their junction with the Ambraciots without some molestation on their route They also send to Demosthenes the Athenian general in the iEtolian expedition to come and put himself at their head  and to the Athenian squadron of twenty sail which was then upon the coast of Peloponnesus under the command of Aris totle son of Timocrates and Hierophon son of Antimnestus The Ambraciots at Olpae sent also a messenger to their own city ordering them to a man to come out into the field They were afraid lest Eurylochus might not be able to pass the Acarnanians and so they should be compelled either to fight alone  or should they attempt a retreat to find it full of danger But the Peloponnesians commanded by Eurylochus had no sooner heard that the Ambraciots were at Olpae than dislodging from Proschium they marched with all expedi tion to their support After passing the Achelous they took the route of Acarnania desolate at present as the inhabi tants were fled to the defence of Argos having on their right the city and garrison of the Stratians and the rest of Acar nania on their left When they had passed through the ter ritory of the Stratians they crossed Phytia and again through the extremity of Medeon and then marched across Lim naea They now entered the kingdom of the Agraans which had deserted the Acarnanian to favour the Pelopon nesian interest Securing then the mountain Thyamus a wild uncultivated spot they crossed it and descended thence About two miles and a half 290 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR by night into Argia They afterwards passed undiscovered betwixt the city of the Argians and the post of the Acarna nians at Crenae and so perfected their junction with the Am braciots at Olpae After this junction their numbers being large they take possession next morn at break of day of a post called Metropolis and there fix their encampment Not long after this the Athenian squadron of twenty sail comes into the bay of Ambracia to succour the Argians Demosthenes also arrived with two hundred heavy armed Messenians and sixty Athenian archers The station of the fleet was fixed under the fort of Olpae But the Acar nanians and some few of the Amphilochians who had al ready gathered into a body at Argos for the majority of them was obstructed by the Ambraciots got every thing in readiness to engage the enemy They elect Demosthenes to be the commander of the whole associated force with the assistance of their own generals He caused them to ad vance near Olpae and there encamped them A great hol low lay between the armies For five days they remained m a state of inaction but on the sixth both sides drew up in order of battle The Peloponnesians were more numerous and their line of course was further extended Demos thenes therefore that he might not be inclosed placeth an ambuscade of the heavy and light armed to the number in all of about four hundred in a hollow way overgrown with shrubs and bushes with orders that in the heat of the charge they should rise up and attack the over extended line of the enemy in their rear When all things were ready on both aides they came to blows Demosthenes led the right wing composed of the Messenians and his few Athenians The other consisted of the Acarnanians drawn up in the order they happened to fall into as they came up and the Am philochian darters who were at hand But the Peloponne sians and Ambraciots were drawn up promiscuously except the Mantineans The Mantineans stood embodied rather to the left but not in the extremity  For Eurylochus with a B III YEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 291 select party was posted there over against the Messenians and Demosthenes No sooner was the battle joined and the Peloponnesians on that wing were moving forward their superior numbers to surround the right of their adversaries than the Acarna nians starting up from their ambuscade falling upon them in the rear assault and put them to flight They gave way before the very first shock and struck such a consternation into the bulk of the army that they also began to run For they no sooner saw the party with Eurylochus and which was the flower of their strength intirely broke than they felt a panic for themselves And the Messenians who fought at the same post with Demosthenes behaved so very well that they finished the rout The Ambraciots in the mean time and those in the right had got the better of their oppo nents and were pursuing them towards Argos  for beyond a doubt they are the most warlike people of any in those parts But when they were returned from the pursuit they perceived the bulk of their army was defeated and the rest of the Acarnanians beginning to charge them with much dif ficulty they threw themselves into Olpae The number of the slain was great as they had made their attacks without any order and with the utmost confusion We must except the Mantineans who kept most firmly together and retreated in the best order of the whole enemy The battle was ended only with the night The next morning as Eurylochus was killed and Maca rius also the command devolved upon Menedaeus The de feat was irrevocably great and he was highly perplexedâ whether he should abide a siege in which he must not only be shut up by land but by the Athenian ships be blocked up also by seaâ or whether he should ei deavour to secure his retreat At lengthâ he treats with Demosthenes and the Acarnanians for a suspension of arms both for his own departure and the fetching off the dtad The dead they at once delivered and set up atrophy themselves and took 292 THE PELOPONNEStAN WAR up their own dead to the number of about three hundred But a truce for their departure was not openly granted to them all Demosthenes in concert with the Acarnanian generals agreed to a secret article with the Mantineans and Menedaeus and the other Peloponnesian officers and as many Others as were of any considerationâ that  they should de part immediately His policy was to have the Ambraciots and the promiscuous body of mercenaries left quite destitute wishing above all things for such a pretext to calumniate the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians amongst the Grecians of those parts  as men who wilfully abandon their friendsj  from a mere selfish treacherous regard to their own safe  ty Having leave therefore to fetch off their dead they interred them all so well as their hurry would admit And those in the secret were busy in concerting the means of their departure But now intelligence is brought to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians that the Ambraciots of the city with their whole collected force had in pursuance of the former summons be gan their march for Olpae through Amphilochi designing to join their countrymen at Olpae and quite ignorant of the late defeat Upcn this he immediately detacheth a part of his army to beset all the passes and to seize all the advantageous posts upon their route and got ready at the same time to march against them with the remainder of his force In the mean time the Mantineans and those compre hended in the secret article going out of the town upon the pretext of gathering herbs and fuel went gradually off in small parties gathering what they pretended to come out for as they passed along But when they had thus straggled to a considerable distance from Olpae they moved away in a more nimble pace The Ambraciots and others who in great numbers came out in their company when they per ceived them thus stealing off felt an inclination to follow and so taking to their heels ran speedily after them The Acarnanians imagined at first that they vere all equally t III 293 YEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 endeavouring to escape without permission and therefore set out in the pursuit of the Peloponnesians Their officers en deavoured to stop them crying out that leave was given  for their escape â Upon which a soldier concluding their officers had been guilty of treachery darted his javelin amongst them But afterwards they connived at the escape of the Mantineans and Peloponnesians but made slaughter of the Ambraciots Great indeed was the tumult and the perplexity also to distinguish which was an Ambraciot and which was a Peloponnesian  and amidst the confusion about two hundred were slain The rest made their escape into the bordering kingdom of Agraeis where Salythius king of the Agraeans who was their friend took them under his pro tection The Ambraciots of the city were now advanced as far as Idomene They are two lofty eminences which are called by this name The higher of the two by favour of the dark the detachment sent before by Demosthenes from the camp had seized without being discovered and had posted them selves upon it The Ambraciots had possessed themselves already of the lower and halted there for the night De mosthenes after his evening repast and the remainder of the army about shut of evening began to march He him self took half of them to attack the enemy in front whilst the other was fetching a compass round the mountains of Am philochia The next morning was no sooner in its dawn than he comes upon the Ambraciots yet in their beds still ignorant of all that had passed and rather supposing these new comers to be their friends For Demosthenes had poKtkly placed the Messeni ans in the van and ordered them to discourse as they moved along in the Doric dialect thus to prevent any alarm from their advanced guards who further so long as the dark continued could not possibly distinguish their faces By this means he no sooner assaulted the camp than the rout began Numbers of them were slain upon the spot The remainder Vol I 3 E 294 THE PJELOPONNESIAN WAR fled amain towards the mountains But the passes were all beset and more than this the Amphilochians who were well acquainted with their own country were pursuing in the light enemies who were encumbered with the heavy armour Quite ignorant of the country nor knowing whither they were flying they rushed headlong into hollow ways into all the ambus cades laid ready by the enemy to their own destruction Yet as no possible method of escape was unattempted some of them turned towards the sea which was not greatly dis tant And when they beheld the Athenian ships moving along the shore in so fatal a concurrence for their ruin they plunged into the water and swam up to them choosing ra ther in the present consternation to be destroyed by the Athenians on board those ships than by Barbarians and their most inveterate foes the Amphilochians Through such a series of misfortunes but few out of the numerous body of Ambraciots were so happy as to escape to their own home The Acarnanians having stripped the dead and erected the trophies marched back to Argos On the following day they were addressed by a herald sent from those Ambraciots who had escaped from Olpae and were now in the Agrei s His commission was to obtain the bodies of the dead who had been killed since the first engagement as they were attempting without permission to escape along with the Mantineans and others who were going off by agreement This herald casting his eyes upon the arms of the Ambraciots from the city was astonished at the number He knew nothing of that fresh calamity but concluded they all belonged to the party for whom he was now employed Somebody asked him the reason of his surprise and what he judged to be the number of the dead  Now he who asked the question supposed the herald to have been sent by those of Idomene  Not more than two hun  dred says the herald The demandant then replied  It  should seem otherwise by the arms for these are the arms  of more than a thousand men The herald rejoined B III TEAR VI â BEFORE CHRIST 426  Then they cannot belong to those of our party The other replied  They must if you fought yesterday at Idomene  We fought no where yesterday we suffered the day before  in our retreat from Olpae  But we fought yesterday  against those Ambraciots who were advancing from the  city to relieve you When the herald heard this and found that the army of relief from the city was thus destroy ed he burst into a groan  and quite overpowered with the weight of the present calamities he went off abruptly and without renewing his demand about the dead During the whole course of this war no other Grecian city suffered so great a loss in so short a time I have not pre sumed to mention the number of the slain because it is said to have been incredibly great when compared with the size of their city But I am well convinced that if in compliance with the advice of the Athenians and Demosthenes the Acar nanians and Amphilochians would have proceeded to the excision of Ambracia they might have done it with a bare shout of their voice But they dreaded its falling into the hands of the Athenians who might prove worse neighbours to them than the old But to return A third part of the spoils was bestowed upon the Athenians the rest was divided amongst the confe derate cities Those allotted the Athenians were lost at sea For the three hundred suits of armour which are reposited in the Temples of Athens were selected for Demosthenes who now returned thither and brought them with him The dread he had been under ever since his miscarriage in iEto lia was quite dispelled by the good service he had now per formed The Athenians with their squadron of twenty sail were now returned to Naupactus  and since the departure of the Athenians and Demosthenes the Acarnanians and Amphilo chians had granted by treaty to those Ambraciots and Pelo ponnesians who had refuged with Salynthius and the Agrae ans a safe retreat from amongst the Oeniadae who had also 298 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR gone over to Salynthius and the Agraeans And afterwards the Acarnanians and Amphilochians concluded a peace and an alliance for a hundred years with the Ambraciots upon these conditions   That neither the Ambraciots should be obliged to join  the Acarnanians in any attempts against the Peloponnesians   nor the Acarnanians to act with the Ambraciots against the  Athenians  That if either were attacked the others should march to  their defence  That the Ambraciots should restore all the places and  frontier belonging to the Amphilochians which were at pre  sent in their hands And  That they should in no shape support Anactorium which  was then in hostility with the Acarnanians These articles being mutually agreed to the war came to a conclusion But after this the Corinthians sent a party of their own people consisting of three hundred heavy armed commanded by Xenoclides the son of Euthycles for the guard of Ambracia who arrived after great difficulties as they marched all the way over land And this is the account of transactions in Ambracia The Athenians in Sicily the same winter made a de scent against Himeraea from their ships whilst the Sicilians pouring down from the upper country were ravaging its frontier They steered their course also against the isles of iEblus But when they were returned to their old station at Rhegium they found there Pythodorus the son of Isolo chus who was commissioned to take upon him the command of the fleet in the room of Laches For the confederates of Sicily had sent a deputation to Athens to solicit a more ample succour of shipping Because as m fact the Syra cusans were masters of all their lands and they were also awed at sea by a few Syracusan vessels they were now in tent on gathering together such a naval force as might strike an effectual terror The Athenians equipped out forty sail B III 297 TEAR VI BEFORE CHRIST 426 as a reinforcement for Sicily Their motive was not only to bring the war in those parts to a speedy determination but also to keep their own mariners in constant practice Pytho dorus one of the admirals appointed for this service they sent immediately off with a few ships  Sophocles son of Sos tradites and Eurymedon son of Thucles were soon to fol low with the main body of the fleet But Pythodorus who had now took the command from Laches steered about the close of the winter against that fortress of the Locrians which Laches had taken before But being defeated at his land ing by the Locrians he returned again to his station About the spring of the year a torrent of fire overflowed from mount Etna in the same manner as formerly which destroyed part of the lands of the Cataneans who are situ ated at the foot of that mountain which is the largest in all Sicily It is said that fifty years intervened between this flow and the last which preceded  and that in the whole the fire hath thus issued thrice since Sicily was inhabited by the Grecians Such were the occurrences of this winter at the end of which the sixth year also of this war the history of which Thucydides hath compiled expired THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR BOOK IV YEAR VIIâ BEFORE CHRIST 425 THE ensuing summer when the corn was beginning to ear ten sail of Syracusan joined by an equal number of Lo erian vessels at the invitation of the inhabitants stood away for Messenein Sicily and took possession of the place And thus Messene revolted from the Athenians But this event was chiefly owing to the practices of the Syracusans  who foreseeing that this town might open the way for the re duction of Sicily were greatly afraid lest the Athenians should get established there and with augmented forces pour out from thence upon them The Locrians assisted out of enmity to the Rhegians whom they were desirous to have it in their power to attack both by land and sea At the same time also these Locrians broke in upon the territory of the Rhegians with their intire force to deter them from any attempt to save Messene and to gratify also those fugitives from Rhegium who acted now in combination with them For Rhegium had for a long time been embroiled in sedition and so was unable to take the field against these invaders who for the same reason were more eager to distress them When the ravage was compleated the Locrians marched their land forces back but their ships were stationed on the guard of Messene They also were very busy in the equip ment of an additional number which were to repair to that station and be ready to move from thence to any future operations of war B IV YEAR VII â BETORE CHRIST 425 299 About the same season of the spring before the corn was fully grown the Peloponnesians and allies made their inroad into Attica Agis the son of Archidamus king of the Lacedaemonians commanded They fixed their camp and ravaged the country The Athenians now sent out to sea the forty ships already prepared for the Sicilian voyage under the command of Eurymedon and Sophocles who stayed behind to bring up this reinforcement since Pythodorus the third in the com mission was already in his post at Sicily They had orders also in the course of the voyage to touch at Corcyra and provide effectually for the preservation of those in the city who were sadly infested by the outlaws posted on the moun tain Sixty sail of the Peloponnesians were now upon that coast to act in support of those on the mountain who as the city was sorely oppressed with famine presumed they should with ease carry all before them Demosthenes fur ther who had been in no public employ since his return from Acarnania procured leave to go on board this fleet with authority to employ it on the coast of Peloponnesus if he judged it for the service When they were got to the height of Laconia intelli gence is brought them that  the Peloponnesian fleet is now  in Corcyra Eurymedon and Sophocles were for making the best of their way thither But it was the advice of De mosthenes to go first to Pylus and after they had secured that place to proceed in their voyage This was positively refused but it so happened that a storm arose which drove the whole fleet to Pylus Demosthenes insisted that they should immediately fortify the place since this was the motive of his attendance in the fleet He shewed them that  there was at hand plenty of timber and stone for the  work  that beside the strength of its natural situation the  place itself was barren as was also the greatest part of the  adjacent country For Pylus lies at the distance of about four hundred stadia from Sparta in the district which was â About forty English miles 300 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR formerly called Messenia but the name given it by the Lacedaemonians is Coryphasium The others replied There  are many barren capes in Peloponnesus which those may  secure who have a mind to plunge the commonwealth into  needless expenses This place however seemed to him to be better marked out for this purpose than any other as being possessed of a harbour  and as the Messenians who formerly bore some relation to it and still used the same dia lect with the Lacedaemonians might from hence give them great annoyance and at the same time effectually keep pos session of it But when neither the commanders nor sol diers nor the inferior officers to whom he afterwards com municated his project would be brought to a compliance he quietly let it drop till the mere love of employment during the idleness of their suspended voyage seditiously inclined the private soldiers to compass it with a wall They took the work in hand and plied it briskly Tools they had none for hewing and fitting the stones  but picked out and carried such as they judged most proper for the work and laid them one upon another as compactly as they could The mud that was any where requisite for want of vessels they carried on their shoulders bending forwards as much as possible that it might have room to stick on and holding it up with both hands clasped fast behind that it might not slide down They spared no pains to prevent the Lacedaemonians and to put the place in a proper posture of defence before they could come to their disturbance For the largest part of it was so well fortified by nature that it stood in no need of the de fence of art â The word in the original is Taxiarchi They seem to be nearly the same with Captains of a Company in the modern stile as their command was over aboutlone hundred men Taxiarcht were also officers of a higher class in number ten every Athenian tribe appointing one whose business it was to marshal the armies to order the inarches and encampments to take care of provisions and to punish military offences But the former seem to be the ajji ers to whom Demosthenes applied himself in the pre â  sent instance B IV TEAR VII â BEFORE CHRIST 425 301 The news of this arrived at Sparta during the celebration of some public festival They set light by it assured that so soon as they appeared in sight the enemy would either abandon it or the place be recovered by an easy effort And they were something more dilatory because their army was yet in Attica The Athenians having completed their works on the side towards the land and on the other necessary spots in the space of six days leave Demosthenes with five ships to guard it and with the larger number resumed their voyage for Cotcyra and Sicily But the Peloponnesians in Attica were no sooner adver tised of this seizure of Pylus than they marched back with all expedition The Lacedaemonians and Agis their king regarded this affair of Pylus as their own domestic concern And besides as they had made the inroad early in the year and whilst the corn was yet green many of them laboured un der a scarcity of provisions The weather also which proved tempestuous beyond what was usual in that season had very much incommoded the army In this manner many acci dents concurred to accelerate their retreat and to render this the shortest of all their invasions For the whole of their stay in Attica was but fifteen days About the same time Simonides an Athenian command er having gathered together a small party of Athenians from the neighbouring garrisons and a body of the circumjacent dependents took possession of Ei on in Thrace a colony of the Mendeans It had declared against the Athenians but was now put into their hands by treachery Yet the Chal i cideans and Bottiaeans coming immediately to its relief he was beat out of it again and lost a great number of his men After the retreat of the Peloponnesians out of Attica the Spartans in conjunction with those of their allies marched â The reader will be pleased to take notice that the word Spartam is here emphatical It means those of the first class the noblest persons id the community as is plain from the sequel Vol I 3 F 302 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR without loss of time to the recovery of Pylus The rest of the Lacedaemonians were longer in their approach as but just returned from another expedition Yet a summons had been sent all round Peloponnesus to inarch directly for Pylus Their fleet of sixty sail was also remanded from Corcyra which being transported by land over the isthmus of Leucas arrive before Pylus undescried by the Athenians who lay at Zacynthus And by this time the land army had also ap proached Demosthenes before the coming up of the Peloponne sian fleet had timely dispatched two vessels to Eurymedon and the Athenians on board that fleet now lying at Zacyn thus pressing them to return as the place was in danger of being lost which vessels made the best of their way in pursuance of the earnest commands of Demosthenes But the Lacedaemonians were now preparing to attack the for tress both by land and sea presuming it would easily be destroyed as the work had been raised with so much preci pitation and was defended by so small a number of hands But as they also expected the return of the Athenian ships from Zacynthus they designed in case they took not the place before to bar up the mouths of the harbour so as to render the entrance impracticable to the Athenians For an isle which is called Sphacteria lying before and at a small distance locks it up and rendereth the mouths of the harbour narrow  that near the fortress of the Athenians and Pylus a passage for two ships only a breast and that be tween the other points of land for eight or nine The whole of it as desart was overgrown with wood and quite untrod and the compass of it at most is about fifteen stadia They were therefore intent on shutting up these entrances with ships moored close together and their heads towards the sea And to prevent the molestation apprehended should the enemy take possession of this island they threw into it a body of their heavy armed and posted another body on  â One mile and a half ft IV 30G YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 the opposite shore  for by these dispositions the Athe nians would be incommoded from the island and excluded from landing on the main land And as on the opposite coast of Pylus without the harbour there is no road where ships can lie they would be deprived of a station from whence to succour the besieged And thus without the hazard of a naval engagement it was probable they should get possession of the place as the quantity of provisions in it could be but small since the seizure had been executed with slender preparation â Acting upon these motives they threw the body of heavy armed into the island who were draughted by lot out of all the bands These for a time were succes sively relieved by others But the last body who guarded that post and were forced to continue in it consisted of about four hundred and twenty exclusive of the Helots who attended them and these were commanded by Epitadas the son of Molobrus Demosthenes perceiving by these dispositions that the Lacedaemonians would attack him by land and sea provided for his own defence The triremes yet remaining with him he drew ashore and ranged them by way of palisade be fore the fortress The mariners he armed with bucklers sorry ones indeed as most of them were only twigs of osier plaited Better arms were not to be procured in so desart a place And even these they had taken out of a cruizer of thirty oars and a light packet belonging to Messenians who happened accidentally to put in The Messenians on board were about forty heavy armed whom he ranged amongst his own body The greater part therefore of the unarmed as well as some who had armour he placed on the strongest parts of the fortress towards the continent with orders to beat off the land army whenever they approached And having selected from his whole number sixty heavy armed and a few archers he marched out of the fortress to that part of the beach where he supposed the enemy would endeavour to land The shore indeed was rough and rocky and bor J04 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR dered on the main sea yet as the wall was weakest in this quarter he judged it would soonest tempt and animate an assault For never imagining they should be outnumbered in shipping they had left the wall on this side but weak  and should the enemy now force a landing the place would un doubtedly be lost Sensible of this and determined if possible to prevent their landing Demosthenes posted himself with his chosen band on the very edge of the water and endeavoured to animate them by the following harangue MY fellow soldiers here posted with me in this dan  gerous situation I conjure you in so urgent an extremity u to throw away all superfluous wisdom Let not a soul  amongst you compute the perils which now inviron us  but regardless of the issue and inspirited by hope let him  charge the foe and be confident of success A situation  desperate like this alloweth no room for calm considera  tion but demands the most precipitate venture Superior  advantages however are along with us â of this I am con  vinced provided we only stand firm together and scorn  ing to be terrified at the number of our foes do not wil  fully betray those advantages which are now in our fa  vour The shore is most difficult of access â This in my judgment makes abundantly for us â This will support us  if we keep our ground But if we give way difficult as  it is now their landing will be easyâ when there are none  to obstruct it Nay what is worse we shall make the  enemy more furious when if we may afterwards press  hard upon him it is no longer in his power to re em  bark with ease For so long as they continue on board they  may most easily be encountered  whilst they are busy in  landing they cannot so far overmatch us as that we  ought to shrink before their numbers Large though they be the spot of action will be small for want of ground to  draw up in order What though their force be superior  for the land that advantage will be lost in their present B IV 305 YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425  service when they must act from their vessels and on the  water where many lucky contingencies are requisite  And thus am I satisfied that with these disadvantages they  are but merely a balance for our smallness of number  As for you O Athenians who are now present and who 4 by the long experience of frequent descents are perfectly  convinced that men who stand firm and scorn to give way  before the dash of the surge or the menacing approach of a  vessel can never be beat offâ from you I insist that firmly  embodied together and charging the enemy on the very  margin of the water you preserve all us who are here and  preserve this fortress In this manner Demosthenes having encouraged his men the Athenians became more animated than ever  and march ing forwards to the very margin of the sea posted themselves there in order of battle The Lacedaemonians were also in motion  their land force was marching to assault the fortress and their fleet was approaching the shore It consisted of forty three vessels and a Spartan Thrasymelidas the son of Cratesicles was on board as admiral He steered directly for the spot on which Demosthenes expected his coming In this manner were the Athenians assaulted on both sides by land and sea The ships of the enemy came on in small divisions be cause there was not room for larger They slackened by in tervals and endeavoured by turns to force their landing They were brave to a man and mutually animated one ano ther to beat off the Athenians and seize the fortress But Brasidas signalized himself above them all He com manded a trireme  and observing that the other comman ders and pilots though they knew they could run aground yet kept aloof because the shore was craggy and shunned every hazard of staving their vessels he shouted aloud  that it was shameful for the saving of timber to suffer ene  mies to raise fortifications within their territory He en 306 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR couraged them on the contrary  to force their landing  though they dashed their vessels to pieces  begging the confederates  in this juncture not to refuse bestowing their  ships on the Lacedaemonians in lieu of the great services  they had done them but to run them ashore and landing at  all adventures to seize the enemy and the fortress In this manner he Animated others and having compelled his own pilot to run the vessel ashore he was at once upon the stairs and endeavouring to get down was beat back by the Athenians After many wounds received he fainted with loss of blood  and falling down upon the gunnel his shield tumbled over into the water It was brought ashore and taken up by the Athenians who afterwards made it a part of the trophy which they erected for this attack The others indeed with equal spirit endeavoured but yet could not possibly land as the ground was difficult of access and the Athenians stood firm and no where at all gave way Such now was the strange reverse of fortune that the Athe nians upon land upon Laconic land beat off the Lacedaemo nians who were fighting from the water and the Lacedaemo nians from ships were endeavouring a descent upon their own now hostile territory against Athenians For at this period of time it was the general opinion that those were landmen and excelled most in land engagements but that these were seamen and made the best figure at sea The attack was continued the whole day and part of the n xt before it was given up On the third day they de tached some vessels to Asine to fetch timber for engines hoping by them to accomplish the taking of the wall adja cent to the harbour which though of a greater height yet might easier be approached by sea During this pause forty sail of Athenians came up from Zacynthus This fleet had been enlarged by the accession of some guard ships from off the station of Naupactus and four sail of Chians These no sooner discovered the main land about Pylus and the island Sphacteria to be full of B IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 307 armed soldiers the harbour also to be occupied by the ships of the enemy which lay quiet in their posts than perplexed how to act they sailed back for the present to the isle of Prone not far distant and desart and there spent the night The day following being formed into the order of bat tle they shewed themselves again as ready for engagement should the enemy venture to stand out against them into the open sea  and if not were determined to force their way into the harbour The enemy still kept in the same quiet posture nor set about executing their former design of bar ring the entrances They continued in their usual position along the shore when they had manned their vessels and got every thing ready to engage the assailants should they break into the harbour where there was no danger of being straitened for room The Athenians perceiving their in tent broke into the harbour at both entrances Falling there upon the greater number of vessels now advanced into deep water to obstruct the passage they put them to flight and following the chace which could be but short they shattered several and took five one of which had her whole crew on board They proceeded to attack the rest which had fled amain towards the shore Some moreover which had just been manned were disabled before they could launch into the deep Others deserted by the mari ners who had fled along the shore they fastened to their own and towed away empty The Lacedaemonians seeing these things and prodigiously alarmed at the sad event lest now the communication should be cut off with the body in the island rushed down with all their force to prevent it Armed as they were they plunged into the water and catching hold of the vessels in tow pulled them back to wards the shore It was now the apprehension of every soul amongst them that the business flagged wherever he himself was not present Great was the tumult in this con test for the ships inverting the general custom of both con tending parties For the Lacedaemonians inflamed and 308 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR terrified fought a sea fight if it may be so expressed from the shore The Athenians already victorious and eager to give their good fortune its utmost completion fought a land battle from on board The struggle on both sides was long and laborious and blood was abundantly shed before the dispute could be ended But at length the Lacedaemonians recovered all their empty vessels excepting such as had been taken on the first onset Each party being retired to their respective posts the Athenians erected a trophy and delivered up the dead and were masters of all the wreck and shatters of the action Then without loss of time they ranged their vessels in circuit quite round the island and kept a strict watch as hnving intercepted the body of men which was posted there But the Peloponnesians on the main land with the accession of their auxiliaries who had now joined them remained upon the opposite shore near Pylus When the news of this action at Pylus was brought to Sparta it was resolved as the great calamity was so urgent that the magistrates in person should repair to the camp and consult upon the very spot what resource they had left And when their own eyes had shewed them the impossi bility of relieving their men and they were loth to leave them in the wretched extremity either of perishing by fa mine or overpowered by superior numbers of being shame fully made prisoners it was concluded  to send to the  Athenian commanders to ask a suspension of arms at Pylus  whilst they dispatched an embassy to Athens to procure  an accommodation and to obtain leave as soon as possible  to fetch off their Spartans These commanders accepting the proposal the suspension was agreed upon on the follow ing conditions  THAT the Lacedaemonians should immediately deliver up the ships in which they had fought and all the ships  of war in general which they had any where in Laconia  they should bring to Pylus and deliver up to the Athe 1 IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 309  nians That they should refrain from making any attempt  whatever upon the fortress either by sea or land  That the Athenians should permit the Lacedaemonians  on the main land to carry over a stated quantity of provi  sions to those in the island two Attic chanixes of meal  with two cotyls of wine and a piece of flesh for every  Spartan and a moiety of each for every servant These  provisions to be carried thither under the inspection of the  Athenians  and no vessels whatever to cross over without  permission  That the Athenians notwithstanding be at liberty  to continue their guard round the island but not to  land upon it and should refrain from giving any annoy  ance to the army of the Peloponnesians either by sea or  land  That if either party should violate these conditions either  in the whole or any part whatever the truce to be immedi  ately void  otherwise to continue in force till the return of  the Lacedaemonian embassy from Athens  That the Athenians should convoy that embassy thither  and back again in a trireme  That upon their return the truce should be ended  when the Athenians should restore the ships now delivered  to them in the same number and condition as they were  in before On these conditions a suspension of arms took place in pursuance of which the ships were delivered up to the num ber of sixty and the ambassadors dispatched away who ar riving at Athens addressed themselves as followeth  HITHER O Athenians we are sent on the part of the  Lacedaemonians to negotiate with you in behalf of their  citizens in the island and to propose an expedient which  will tend very much to your advantage and will at the same  time preserve as much as possible our own honour in the  great calamity with which we are at present beset It is â More than two pints of meal and one pint of wine Engtish niea iirÂ Vol I 3 G 310 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR  not our purpose to run out into a long unaccustomed flow  of words We shall adhere to the rule of our country to  spare many words where few may suffice  and then only to  enlarge when the important occasion requireth an exact de  tail for the more judicious regulation of necessary acts  Receive therefore our discourse with an attention cleared of  enmity Be informed as men of understanding ought   and conclude that you are only to be put in mind of that judicious method of procedure of which yourselves are such competent judges  You have now an opportunity at hand to improve a pre  sent success to your own interest and credit to secure the  possession of what you have hitherto acquired and to adorn  it with the accession of honour and glory You are only  to avoid that insolence of mind so frequent to men who  have been till the present strangers to success Such men  are ever apt to presume too much on larger acquisitions  though merely because their present prosperity was beyond  their expectation Whilst they who have experienced the  frequent vicissitudes of fortune have gained a more judi  cious turn and presume the least upon continuance of suc  cess And there is the highest reason to conclude that ex  perience hath improved the commonwealth of Athens and  us Lacedaemonians in this piece of wisdom much more  than any other people  But be assured of it now when you behold the calami  ties with which we are at present environed we who are  invested with the highest honours and dignities of Greece  are this moment addressing ourselves to you begging such  favours as we formerly thought were more peculiarly  lodged in our own dispensation Not that we are thus re  duced through failure of our strength or through former  strength too haughtily exerted but merely through the  weight of such unforeseen disasters as continually happen  and to which the whole of mankind alike are ever subject  And from hence it is right that you should learn amidst B IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 3U  the present strength of your State and its late acquisitions  that fortune may not always declare upon your side Wise  indeed are they who in their estimates of success make  judicious allowances for chance Such are best able to bear  the alternatives of calamity with prudence and temper  Such will form their judgments of war not as the infallible  means of accomplishing whatever scheme they please to  undertake but as deriving its effects from the guidance of  fortune Such are the persons who are most of all exempt  ed from fatal miscarriages  because hey are not puffed up  by presuming too far on present prosperity and would  gladly acquiesce in the peaceable enjoyment of what they  now possess  It concerns your honour Athenians to deal in this  manner with us lest in case you now reject our propo  sals when you yourselves in future times miscarry many  such events must happen your present good fortune may  then be perversely ascribed to chance even though you  are now able to deliver down to posterity the fame of your  power and moderation beyond a possibility of blemish  The Lacedaemonians invite you to agreement and a con  elusion of the war They offer you peace and alliance  nay friendship in its whole extent and the exchange of  good offices mutually revived demanding nothing in re  turn but their citizens out of the island To this step they  have condescended rather than be exposed to the dangers  incidental on either side should they either seize some fa  vourable opportunity to force their escape by arms or  holding out to the last against your blockade be reduced  with all the aggravations of defeat Great enmities in  our opinion may the soonest be brought to a firm deter  minationâ not when either party having exerted all their  strength and gained the far greater superiority in war dis  dains the fair accommodation and relieth on that forced  acquiescence which necessitated oaths impose  but rather  when though victory be within their reach they recollect 312 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  humanity and having succeeded by valour quite beyond  their expectations determine the contest with temper and  moderation Then the foe who hath not felt the extremity  of force is henceforth disarmed by the strength of grati  tude and is more securely bound by the affections of his  own mind to abide for the future by all his compacts  Such ready deference mankind are more apt to shew to  wards those who have been with a remarkable superiority  their enemies than to such as they have opposed in more  equal competition It is natural when men take the me  thod of voluntary submission for the pleasing contest of  generosity to be kindled between them  but to hazard the  last extremities and even grow desperate against that  haughtiness which will not relent  Now if ever is the crisis come to effect such a pleasing  reconciliation between us both before the intervention of  some incurable event to ulcerate our passions which may  lay us under the sad necessity of maintaining an eternal  enmity both public and private in regard to you and you  lose the benefit of those advantageous offers we now lay  within your option Whilst the event is yet undetermined  whilst the acquisition of glory and of our friendship is  within your reach whilst yet we only feel the weight of a  supportable calamity and are clear from foul disgrace let  us now be mutually reconciled  let us give the preference  to peace over war and effectuate a cessation of miseries to  the other Grecians The honour of such an event will by  them be more abundantly ascribed to you At present  they are engaged in a perplexing warfare unable yet to  pronounce its authors But in case a reconciliation now  take place a point for the most part within your decision  they will gratefully acknowledge you for generous bene  factors  If then you thus determine you gain an opportunity  to render the Lacedaemonians your firm and lasting  friends since now they request your friendship and choose B IV TEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 313  to be obliged rather than compelled Reflect within  yourselves how many benefits must in all probability re  suit from such a lucky coincidence For you cannot but  know that when we and you shall act with unanimity the  rest of Greece conscious of inferiority will pay us the utÂ  most honour and regard The Lacedaemonians talked in this strain upon the pre sumption that the Athenians had formerly been desirous of peace and had been obstructed merely through their oppo sition  but now thus freely tendered they would accept it with joy and give up the men The Athenians on the con trary reckoning the Spartans in the island already in their power imagined that a peace would be at any time in their own option and were now very eager to improve their pre sent success But such a measure Was insisted upon most of all by Cleon the son of Cleaenetus the greatest demagogue at this time and most in credit with the people It was he who persuaded them to return the following answer  THAT previous to all accommodation the Spartans  shut up in the island must deliver up their arms and their  persons and be brought prisoners to Athens When this  was done and the Lacedaemonians had surrendered Nisaea  and Pegae and Troezene and Chalcis of which places  they had not possessed themselves by arms but in pursu  ance of a former treaty when distress exacted compliance  from the Athenians and they had been obliged upon any  terms to purchase peace then they might fetch away  their countrymen and conclude a peace for whatever term  both parties should agree To this answer the Lacedaemonians made no direct re ply they only requested that a committee might be appoint â Diodorus Siculus 1 12 says further That the Lacedsmonian ambas sadors offered to set at liberty an equal number of Athenians who were now their prisoners And when this offer was rejected the ambassadors replied freely It was plain they set a higher value on Spartans than on â their own citizens since they judged an equal number of the latter not  to be an equivalent â  314 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR ed with whom after the arguments on each side should be freely offered and discussed they might agree upon some expedient to mutual satisfaction Cleon upon this broke out into loud invectives against them affirming  he knew  beforehand that they intended nothing just or fair  but  now their view was manifest to all as they had absolutely  refused to have any transactions with the body of the  people and had thus expressed a desire to negotiate with  a small committee If their views were fair and upright  he called upon them to explain themselves in the pre  sence of all But the Lacedaemonians perceiving that nothing they could urge would have any influence on the people and in case to ward off the distress they feared they should make too large proposals these offered and unac cepted would expose them to the censure of their confede rates and that further the Athenians would not comply with their demand on any reasonable terms  they broke ofF all further conference and quitted Athens The very mo ment they return to Pylus the truce was at an end The Lacedaemonians re demanded their ships according to the article for that purpose agreed on But the Athenians ob jecting some infractions to them such as an incursion to wards the fortress expressly prohibited by the articles and some other matters of little consequence absolutely refused a restitution They justified the refusal upon this express stipulation between them that  if the conditions were in  any degree violated the truce should immediately be  void The Lacedaemonians protested against these pro ceedings and charging the detention of their ships with the highest injustice broke off all further debate and prepared for war Pylus was now the scene in which both these warring parties exerted their utmost efforts The Athenians sailed the whole day round the island with two ships in an oppo site course  in the night their whole fleet was stationed round it upon guard except on that side towards the main Â IV YEAR VII â BEFORE CHRIST 425 315 sea when the weather was tempestuous And to strengthen their guard they had now received a reinforcement of twenty sail from Athens so that the number of their shipping amounted in the whole to seventy The Peloponnesians maintained their post on the continent and made frequent as saults upon the fort intent all along to seize the first favour able opportunity and to accomplish the preservation of their countrymen In Sicily this while the Syracusans and confederates augmenting the number of their guard ships on the station of Messene with another squadron they had since equipped from Messene renewed the war The Locrians spared no pains to spur them on from the great aversion they bore to the Rhegians They had now broke into the territories of the latter with their whole force They had even a mind to hazard a naval engagement against them as they saw the number of Athenian ships at hand to be very inconsiderable and had received intelligence that the larger numbers design ed for this service were stopped for the present to block up the isle of Sphacteria For should they once get the better at sea they hoped as they then might attack Rhegium both by sea and land to find it an easy conquest and so the pos ture of their own affairs would be considerably strengthened For as Rhegium which is a promontory of Italy lies at a very small distance from Messene in Sicily they could then prevent the approach of the Athenians and be entirely mas ters of the strait This strait is that part of the sea which runs between Rhegium and Messene and over which lies the shortest cut from Sicily to the continent It is the place which was formerly called Charybdis and through which Ulysses is said to have sailed As the current here sets in strongly from two great seas the Tyrrhene and Sicilian and runs with great rapidity it is not at all strange that it should have been esteemed a dangerous passage Yet in the very middle of this strait the Syracusans and 316 THE JELOPONNES1AN WAR confederates with a number of ships little more than thirty were forced to engage in the evening of the day the dispute beginning about a vessel that was passing through They stood away to oppose sixteen sail of Athenians and eight of Rhegians They were worsted by the Athenians  but each side separated in hurry and confusion just as they could to their several stations at Messene and Rhegium They lost one ship in this action which was stopped by the sudden ap proach of night But after this the Locrians evacuated the territory of Rhegium and the whole collected fleet of the Syracusans and confederates took a new station at Peloris of Messene and their whole land force attended The Athenians and Rhegians sailing up to their station and finding none at present on board the ships rushed in amongst them Yet they lost one of their own vessels by the force of a grappling iron fastened upon it the crew of which was saved by swimming Immediately after this the Syracusans got on board and being towed along the shore towards Messene the Athenians came up again to attack them  but the enemy running oft into the deep and giving the first charge they lose another of their ships Though continuing to be towed along the shore and to charge in this manner yet the Syra cusans without suffering any loss got safe into the harbour of Messene And now the Athenians having received intel ligence that Camarina was betrayed to the Syracusans by Ar chias and his accomplices stood away for that place In the mean while the Messenians with their whole force by land and accompanied by their ships marched away against Chalcidic Naxus which bordered upon their own territory The first day they force the Naxians to shelter themselves behind their walls and then they plundered the country The day following sailing up the river Acesine they plundered along the shore and with their land force made an assault upon the city The Siculi who live upon the mountains were now pouring down in numbers to repel B IV TEAR Til â BEFORE CHRIST 425 317 the Messenians This the Naxians perceiving became more courageous and animating one another with the thought that the Leontines and their other Greek allies were now march ing to their relief they suddenly sally out of the city and fall upon the Messenians whom they put to flight and slaughtered more than a thousand of them the remainder with difEculty escaped to their own homes for the Barbarians attacked them upon their road and made great havoc of them The ships upon the station of Messene brake up soon after with drawing respectively to their own harbours Immediately the Leontines and allies in concert with the Athenians appeared before Messene as now reduced to a very low ebb They assaulted it on all sides  the Athenians making their attempt from their ships on the side of the har bour whilst the land forces did the same on the body of the place But the Messenians and a party of Locrians commanded by Demoteles who after their late blow had been left there for the security of the place made a sudden sally from the city and falling unexpectedly on the army of the Leontines put the greater part to flight and did great execution upon them This was no sooner perceived by the Athenians than they threw themselves ashore to succour their confederates and falling in with the Messenians who had lost the order of their battle drove them again behind their walls This done having erected a trophy they put over to Rhegium And after this the Grecians of Sicily continued a land war against one another in which the Athe nians had no participation At Pylus the Athenians still kept the Lacedaemonians blocked up in the island and the army of the Peloponne sians remained in their old posts upon the continent in a state of inactivity Their constant guard subjected the Athenians to excessive hardships since provisions and fresh water were equally scarce There was but one single foun tain for their use which lay within the fortress of Pylus and yielded but a slender quantity of water The majority Vol I 3 H 318 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR of them were forced to dig into the gravel upon the beach of the sea and take up with such water as could thus be got They were further very much straitened in their sta tion for want of room They had not road enough for their ships to ride in with tolerable convenience so that alternately one division lay ashore to take their necessary repasts whilst the other launched more to sea But what discouraged them most was the length of the blockade so contrary to what they had expected They had imagined a few days siege would have worn out a body of men shut up in a barren island and having only salt water for their drink But this had been redressed by the Lacedaemonians who had by a public edict encouraged all who were willing to carry over into the island meal and wine and cheese and any other eatable which might enable them to hold out assigning a large pecuniary reward for any successful attempt of this nature and promising freedom to every Helot who carried them provisions This was performed through a series of dangers by several but the Helots were most active of all who putting off from Peloponnesus wherever they chanced to be landed by favour of the dark on the side of the island which lies upon the main sea Their chief precaution was to run over in a hard gale of wind For whenever the wind blew from the sea they were in less danger of being disco vered by the guard of triremes which then could not safely lie quite round the island In executing this service they put every thing to hazard As a prior valuation had been given in they run their vessels on shore at all adventures and the heavy armed soldiers were ready to receive them at every place most convenient for landing Those however who ventured out when the weather was calm were cer tainly intercepted Such further as were expert at diving swam over through the harbour dragging after them by a string bottles filled with poppies mixed up with honey and the powder of linseed These for a time escaped discovery hut were afterwards closelv watched No artifice was left B IV 319 YEAR VII BErORE CHRIST 425 unpractised on either side  some being ever intent to carry provisions over and others to intercept them At Athens in the mean time the people being informed of the hardships to which their own forces are reduced and that those in the island receive supplies of provision were perplexed how to act They were full of apprehensions lest the winter should put a stop to their siege being conscious of the impossibility of procuring them subsistence from any part of Peloponnesus  and more so as the soil about them was barren and that even in summer they were not able to furnish them with necessary supplies that further as no harbours were in the parts adjacent there would be no commodious road for their shipping so that in case they relaxed their guard the besieged would go securely away or otherwise they might get off by the favour of stormy weather in those vessels which brought over provisions But they were most of all alarmed at the conduct of the La cedaemonians who because they had now a safe resource in prospect had discontinued all manner of negotiation â In a word they highly repented the refusal of their for mer offers Cleon conscious to himself that the blame of baffling that accommodation would be thrown upon him taxed them who brought the last advices as broachers of falsehoods But those who had been sent to make the report demanded  since they could not be credited that a deputation might  be sent to know its truth For which office Cleon him self was nominated by the Athenians in conjunction with Theogenes But now he plainly saw that he must either be necessi tated to make the same report as those had done whom he had charged with falsehood  or should he report differently must soon be convicted of a lie He perceived also that the inclinations of the people were mostly bent on an am ple reinforcement upon which he ventured to give them this further adviceâ That  sending a deputation on sÂ eh 32Q THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  an errand was quite superfluous since opportunities might  be lost by so dilatory a measure if they were really  convinced of the truth of the report they should at once  put to sea against their enemies He then proceeded to a malicious glance against Nicias son of Niceratus who at that time presided over the military affairs He hated him and sneered him thusâ That  if their generals were really  men it would be any easy matter to sail thither with an  additional strength and make a seizure of those in the 44 island for his own part was he in command he would  do it in a trice The Athenians began immediately to clamour and rail at Cleon for not instantly setting about that enterprise himself which to him appeared so easy This Nicias laying hold of chagrined at the same time by the sneer upon himself called upon him aloudâ To take  what force he pleased and to perform the service in his  stead Cleon imagining this to be a mere verbal offer declared himself ready But when he found that Nicias was earnest in the point of resignation he drew back al leging that  it could not be since not he but Nicias was  general He trembled now since he never suspected that the other would venture to give up his office to him â Nicias however called a second time upon him and for mally surrendered his office to him so far as related to Pylus desiring the Athenians to be his witnesses The people now for such is the temper of the multitude the more pains Cleon took to decline the voyage and disentangle himself from his own bravados called out so much the more vehe mently upon Nicias to give up the command and roared aloud at the other to go on board Unable now to extricate himself he intimates his acceptance of the employ and standing forth averred that  he was not under the least  dread of the Lacedaemonians would not be accompanied  by so much as one Athenian but would take only what  Lemnians and Imbrians were at hand and those targeteers  who were come to their aid from iEnus and the four hun B IV 321 YEAR VII â BEFORE CHRIST 425  dred archers from other places With these he said add  ed to the military force already at Pylus he would either  in the space of twenty days bring off all the Lacedaemonians  alive or put them all to death upon the spot This big way of talking raised a laugh among the people all men of sense however were not a little delighted They concluded they should compass by it one of these two desi rable ends  either to rid themselves effectually of Cleon which they chiefly expected or should they be disappointed of this to get those Lacedaemonians into their power Having thus transacted the requisite points in the public assembly where the Athenians had awarded the expedition to him by a formal decree and Demosthenes at Cleon s own request was joined in the commission of commanders at Py lus he hastened to his post with the utmost speed His rea son for associating Demosthenes in the command was owing â The honour of Athens was very deeply concerned in the point which had been the subject of this day s debate in the assembly of the people and yet it hath turned out a mere comic scene The dignity of the republic had never been well supported on thesÂ occasions since the death of Peri cles Cleon had introduced all kinds of drollery and scurrility into the de bates  and it was now become quite the same thing to the people whether they laughed with or laughed at him He hath now railed Nicias though none but a person of so diffident and fearful a temper as Nicias could so have been railed out of an honourable command  and then is laughed him self into it and though an arrant poltroon is metamorphosed into a general of the first class and soon after swells into a very hero However the Athenian good sense whatever turn Thucydides gives it can hardly be justified on this occasion in thrusting so important a commission upon Cleon purely for a joke Plutarch says they always bore his impertinent and mad way of talking because it was humorous and diverting Once when the assembly had been met some time and the people had sat long expect ing his coming at length he made his appearance with a garland on his head and begged the favour of them to adjourn till the morrow  For at  present said he 1 am not at leisure since I have sacrificed to day and â must entertain my friends A loud laugh ensued at his impudence and then they rose and adjourned This affair of Pylus was however far from a jocular point and the Athenians might have paid very dear for their mirth had not Cleon been wise enough to associate Demosthenes with him in the command 322 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR to some notice received that he was bent on landing upon the island  as the soldiers terribly incommoded by the straitness of their stations and resembling besieged more than besiegers were eager for this bold adventure Demosthenes was ani mated more to the attempt because the island had lately been set on fire Before this accident as it had been quite covered over with wood and was pathless because ever uninhabited he durst not think of such a step and judged all these cir cumstances to be for the enemy s advantage For though a more numerous army should have landed against them they were enabled terribly to annoy them from posts undescried What errors might be committed or how large their strength might be more easily concealed on that side by the covert of the woods  whereas all the errors of his own army would lie clear and open to observation when the enemy might sudden ly attack and in what quarter they pleased since battle must be entirely in their own option On the other side should he force them to a close engagement on rough and woody ground the smaller number by being skilled in the passes he imagined must prove too hard for a superior number without such experience  that by this means his own force merely on account of its numbers might be imperceptibly destroyed as it could not be discerned which part of it was hardest pressed and stood most in need of support These inward suggestions were more prevalent in the mind of Demosthenes from the remembrance of his iEtolian defeat which was partly owing to the woods amongst which he engaged But as the narrowness of their station had necessitated his soldiers to land sometimes upon the skirts of the island and under the cover of an advanced guard to dress their repast a soldier though entirely without design set t i5 wood on fire which spread but slowly till a brisk gale happening to arise the greatest part of it was unex pectedly destroyed by the flames Demosthenes having gained by this means a clearer view of the Lacedaemonians found them more numerous than from the quantity of vie ft IV 323 YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 tuals sent in by stipulation he was used to compute them He then judged it highly to concern the Athenians to exert their utmost efforts and as the island was now become more opportune for a descent he got every thing in readi ness for its execution having sent for a supply of men from the adjacent confederates and busied himself about all the dispositions needful for success He had further received an express from Cleon notifying his approach who now at the head of the supply he himself had demanded ar riveth at Pylus No sooner were they joined than they dispatched a herald to the camp on the continent demand ingâ Whether they were willing to order their people in  the island to surrrender their arms and persons without  risking extremities on condition to be kept under an easy  confinement till the whole dispute could be properly ac commodated â This being positively refused they re mained quiet one day longer but on the succeeding day having embarked their whole strength of heavy armed on board a few vessels they put out by night and a little before the ensuing dawn landed on each side of the island both from the main sea and the harbour amounting in the whole to eight hundred men in heavy armour They advanced with their utmost speed towards the first guard on the island This was done in pursuance of a previous disposition For this first guard consisted of about thirty heavy armed The main body under Epitadas was posted about the centre where the ground was most level and watery  And another party guarded the extremity of the island facing Pylus which towards the sea was a rocky cliff and by land altoge ther impregnable On the top further of this cliff was seated a fort built some ages before of stones picked care fully for the purpose This they judged might be service able to them should they be forced to shelter themselve from superior violence In this manner was the enemy posted The Athenians immediately in their first carrer put the 324 The peloponnesian war whole advanced guard to the sword having surprised then yet in their huts and but seeking to lay hold of their arms Their landing was yet undiscovered since the enemy judged their vessels to be only the usual guard which was every night in motion No sooner also was the dawn completely broke than the remainder of the Athenian force was landed from a number of vessels somewhat more than seventy All the mariners came ashore in their respective distinctions of arms excepting the rowers of the lowest bench They were eight hundred archers and a body no less numerous of targeteers The Messenian auxiliaries attended and all in general who had been employed at Pylus except such as were necessarily detained for the guard of the fortress According to a disposition formed by Demosthenes they advanced in separate bodies consisting of near two hundred more or less and took possession of all the eminences The design was thus to reduce the enemy to a plunge of distress by surrounding them on all sides and puzzling them in their choice which party first to make head against that at the sight of numbers on all sides they might be quite confound ed and should they then attack the body in their front they might be harassed by others in their rear or should they wheel towards those on either flank they might be ex posed to the bodies both in front and rear Which way soever the enemy might turn they were sure to have behind them the light armed and less martial of their opponents â It is in the original excepting the Thalamii The rowers on the differ ent benches were distinguished by a peculiar name Those of the upper most were called Thramue  those of the middle Zeugita and those of the lowest Thalamii The labour of the Thalamii was the least though most constant because of ttieir nearness to the water and the shortness of their OBrs Much more strength and skill were required on the upper benches and most of all on the uppermost who for that reason had better pay Those on the lowest bench seem to have been mere drudges at the oar and quahfied for nothing better the others were more complete sea men and ready on all occasions for the duty both of rowing and fighting B IV YEAH VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 infesting them with their bows and darts and stones These would do execution from a distance an enemy could not pos sibly engage with them since even flying they would pre vail and when the enemy retreated would return briskly to their work With so much address had Demosthenes previ ously planned the order of landing and in close adherence to it brought them now to action The body commanded by Epitadas and which was the bulk of the whole force in the island when they saw their advanced guard entirely cut off and the enemy advancing to attack them next drew up in order and marched towards the heavy armed of the Athenians designing to engage them For the latter was so placed as to oppose them in front the light armed were posted on either of their flanks and in the rear But against those heavy armed they could not possibly come to action nor gain an opportunity to exert their own distinguishing skill For the light armed pouring in their darts on either of their flanks compelled them to halt and their opposites would not move forwards to meet them but stood quiet in their posts Such indeed of the light armed as adventured in any quarter to run up near their ranks were instantly put to flight however they soon faced about and continued their annoyance They were not incumbered with any weight of armour their agility easily conveyed them beyond the reach of danger as the ground was rough and ever left desart had never been level led by culture In such spots the Lacedaemonians under the load of their arms could not possibly pursue In this kind of skirmish therefore they were for a small space of time engaged When the Lacedaemonians had no longer sufficient agility to check the attacks of these skirmishing parties the light armed soon took notice that they slackened in their endeavours to beat them off It was then that their own appearance many times more large than that of their foes and the very sight of themselves began to animate them Vol I 3 I 326 THE PELOPONKESIAN WAR with excess of courage Experience had now lessened that terror in which they had been used to regard this foe They now had met with no rough reception from them which fell out quite contrary to what they firmly expected at their first landing when their spirits had sunk very low at the thought that it was against Lacedaemonians Contempt ensued  and embodying with a loud shout they rushed up on them  pouring in stones and arrows and darts whatever came first to hand At such a shout accompanied with so impetuous a charge astonishment seized their foes quite un practised in such a form of engagement at the same time the ashes of the wood which had been burnt were mounting largely into the air So that now each lost the sight of what was close before him under the showers of darts and stones thrown by such numbers and whirling along in a cloud of dust Amidst so many difficulties the Lacedaemonians now were solely distressed The safe guards on their heads and breasts were no longer proof against the arrows and their javelins were broke to pieces when poised for throwing They were quite at a loss for some means of defence  they were debarred the prospect of what was passing just before them  and the shouts of the enemy were so loud that they could no longer hear any orders Danger thus surrounding them on all sides they quite despaired of the possibility of such resistance as might earn their safety At last a great part of that body being wounded because obliged to adhere firmly to the spot on which they stood embodying close they retreated towards the fort on the skirt of the island which lay at no great distance and to their guard which was posted there But when once they began to move off the light armed growing more resolute and shouting louder than ever pressed hard upon their retreat and whatever Lacedaemonian fell within their reach in the whole course of the retreat was instantly slaughtered The bulk of them with difficulty recovered the fort and in concert with the B IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 327 guard posted there drew up in order to defend it in what ever quarter it might possibly be assaulted The Athenians speedily coming up were hindered by the natural site of the place from forming a circle and besetting it on all sides â Advancing therefore directly forwards they endeavoured to beat the defendants off Thus for a long time for the greatest part of the day both sides persisted in the contest under the painful pressures of battle and thirst and a burn ing sun No efforts were spared by the assailants to drive them from the eminence  nor by the defendants to maintain their post But here the Lacedaemonians defended them selves with more ease than in the preceding engagement because now they could not be encompassed on their flanks When the dispute could not thus be brought to a decision the commander of the Messenians addressing himself to Cleon and Demosthenes assured them  they took a deal of  pains to no manner of purpose  but would they be per  suaded to put under his guidance a party of the archers and  light armed to get a round about way on the enemies rear  by a track which he himself could find he was confident he  could force an entrance Having received the party he demanded marching off from a spot undescried by the La cedaemonians in order to conceal the motion and continuing to mount higher and higher along the ridge of rock that lay upon the verge of the island in the quarter where the Lace daemonians depending upon its natural strength had placed no guard with great difficulty and fatigue he got behind them undiscovered Now shewing himself on a sudden upon the summit and in their rear he astonished the enemy with this unexpected appearance  and his friends who now beheld what they so earnestly looked for he very much emboldened The Lacedaemonians were now exposed to the missive weapons on both sides  and if a point of less consequence may be compared to one of greater were in a state parallel 328 THE PELOPOKNESIAN Ar â to that of their countrymen at Thermopylae For those being hemmed in by the Persians in a narrow pass were utter ly destroyed These now inl ike manner beset on both sides were no longer able to contend Being but a handful of men opposed to superior numbers and much weakened in their bodies for want of food they quitted their post And thus the Athenians became masters of all the approaches But Cleon and Demosthenes assuredly convinced that should the foe give way too fast it would only conduce to their expeditious slaughter under the fury of the victorious troops began to stop their fury and to draw off their men They were desirous to carry them alive to Athens in case they would so far hearken to the voice of a herald as to throw down their arms dejected as they must be in spirit and over powered with the instant danger It was accordingly pro claimed that  such as were willing should deliver up their  arms and their persons to the Athenians to be disposed of  at discretion When this was heard the greater number threw down their bucklers and waved their hands in token of accepting the proposal A suspension of arms immediately took place and a conference was held between Cleon and De mosthenes on one side and Styphon the son of Pharax on the othen Of those who had preceded in the command Epitadas who was the first had been slain and Hippagretes who was his successor lying as dead among the slain though he had yet life in him Styphon was now the third appointed to take the command upon him according to the provision â The famous three hundred Spartans with king I eonidas at their head who stopped the vast army of Xerxes at the pass of Thermopylx and at length perished all to a man They were all afterwards intombed on the spot where they fell with this short epitaph  Tell traveller at Sparta what you saw That here trelie obedient to her law The same spirit and resolution was at this time generally expected from the Spartans now encompassed round about by thrir enemies in tlir isti of Sphacteria B IV 329 YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 made by their law in case their generals drop Styphon intimated his desire of leave to send over to the Lacedaemo nians on the continent for advice This the Athenians re fused but however called over some heralds to him from the continent Messages passed backwards and forwards twice or thrice but the last who crossed over to them from the Lacedaemonians on the continent brought this determination â The Lacedaemonians permit you to take care of your own concerns provided you submit to nothing base In conse quence of this after a short consultation with one another apart they delivered up their arms and their persons The remainder of the day and the succeeding night the Atheni ans confined them under a strong guard But the day follow ing having erected a trophy upon the island they got them selves in readiness to sail away and distributed the prisoners to the custody of the captains of the triremes The Lacedae monians having obtained permission by a herald fetched ofT their dead The number of those who were slain and those who were taken alive stood thus They who had thrown themselves into the island amounted in the whole to four hundred and twenty heavy armed Of these three hundred wanting eight were carried off alive the rest had been destroyed Among the prisoners were about one hundred and twenty Spartans The number of Athenians slain was inconsiderable  for it was not a standing fight The whole space that these men were besieged in the island from the engagement at sea till the battle in the island was seventy two days Twenty of these during the absence of the ambassadors to nego ciate an accommodation they were supplied with food The remainder of the time they were fed by such as got over by stealth Nay meal and other eatables were found in the island even when all was over Their commander Epi tadas had made a more sparing distribution than his stores required Now the Athenians and Peloponnesians respectively drew off their forces from Pylus to return home  And the promise 330 THE PELOPOKNESIAN WAR of Cleon mad as it had been was fully executed For within the twenty days he brought them prisoners to Athens and made his words good The expectation of Greece was more disappointed by this event than by any other occurrence whatever in the series of the war It was generally presumed that neither famine noo any extremity could have reduced these Lacedaemonians to deliver up their arms but that sword in hand and fighting to the last gasp they would have bravely perished They could not afterwards believe that those who surrendered were like to those who were slain Some time after a soldier in one of the confederate bands of the Athenians demanding with a sneer of one of them who were taken prisoners in the island  if the slain were not men of true gallantry and cou  rage  the other replied that  a spindle by which he  meant an arrow would be valuable indeed if it knew how  to distinguish the brave  intimating by this answer that the slain were such as stones and darts dispatched in the med ley of battle When the prisoners were brought to Athens it was the public resolution there  to keep them in bonds till some  definitive treatv could be agreed on And if previously  to this the Peloponnesians should repeat their inroad into  the Attic territory they should all undergo a public exe  cution They established also a garrison for Pylus And the Messenians of Naupactus sending thither the most pro per of their own people as into their own native country â It should be added here that he also robbed for the present a very able and gallant officer of the praise he merited on this occasion The whole affair of Pylus was planned carried into execution and brought to a suc cessful and glorious issue by the conduct and bravery of Demosthenes Aristophanes in the A nighttJ hath made a low comic character of the

did them vast damage the more be cause they spoke the same dialect As for the Lacedaemonians who never knew before what it was to be thus plundered war in such a shape being new to them and their Helots deserting continually to the foe  ap prehensive farther lest such unusual proceedings within their own district might draw worse consequences after themâ they had a painful sense of their present situation This compelled them to send their embassies to Athens desirous however at the same time to conceal what they really thought of their own state and spare no artifice for the recovery of Pylus and their people But the Athenians grew more un reasonable in their demands and after many journeys to and fro sent them finally away with an absolute denial Such was the course of proceedings in relation to Pylus The same summer and immediately on the close of the former event the Athenians set out to invade Corinth with a fleet of eighty ships which carried two thousand heavy armed of their own people and with some horse transports on board of which were two hundred horsemen They were also attended by some of their confederates by the Milesians and Andrians and Carysthians Nicias the son of Niceratus with two colleagues commanded this armament At the early dawn of morning they came to anchor between Cherro nesus and Reitus on the shore of that place which the Soly gian hill overhangs of which formerly the Dorians possess ing themselves made war upon the Corinthians then in Co rinth who were of iEolian descent Upon that eminence there is now a village called Solygia From the shore where the armament came now to anchor this village was distant about twelvej the city of Corinth sixtyf and the Isthmus twenty stadia The Doric f Near 1J mile  6 miles Â 2 miles 332 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR The Corinthians who had already been advised from Argos of the approach of the Athenian armament had long since by way of prevention drawn their whole force together at the Isthmus excepting what was in employ without the Isthmus and the five hundred absent in the guard of Ambracia and Leucadia With all the rest of their people able to bear arms they were posted on the Isthmus to watch the approach of the Athenians But when the Athenian fleet had passed by undiscovered by favour of the night and sig nals notified their approach elsewhere leaving half their force at Cenchrea to obstruct any attempt of the Athenians upon Crommyon they marched with all speed against the enemy Battus one of their commanders for there were two such in the field at the head of a separate body marched up to the open village of Solygia in order to defend it whilst Lycophron with the remainder advanced to the charge The Corinthians fell first upon the right wing of the Athenians who were but just landed before Cherronesus and then proceeded to en gage the whole of that army The action was warm and fought hand to hand The right wing consisting of the Athenians and also the Carysthians who were drawn up in the rear gave the Corinthians a warm reception and with much difficulty repulsed them Retreating therefore upwards to a wall built of stone for the ground was a continued as cent and being there above the enemy they annoyed them with stones  and having sung their paean rushed down upon them again The Athenians having stood the shock they engaged a second time hand to hand But a band of Corin thians being come up to the support of their own left wing occasioned the rout of the right wing of the Athenians and pursued them to the sea side But the Athenians and Carysthians now turned again and beat them off from the ships In other parts of the action the dispute was resolute on both sides especially where the right wing of the Corinthi ans with Lycophron at its head was engaging the left wing B IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 425 333 of the Athenians They were apprehensive the enemy would endeavour to force their way to the village of Solygia For a considerable space the battle was obstinate neither side giving way  but at length through the advantage on the Athenian side of being assisted by a party of horse whereas their opposites had none the Corinthians were broke and driven up the ascent where grounding their arms they came down no more to the charge but remained in a quiet posture In this route of the right wing numbers of the Corinthians perished and Lycophron their general But the rest of the body had the good fortune to make a safe retreat and so to secure themselves upon the eminence as they could not be briskly pursued and were not compelled to move off with pre cipitation When the Athenians perceived that the enemy would no more return to the pharge they rifled the bodies of the foes whom they had slain and carried off their own dead and then without loss of time erected their trophy That division of the Corinthians which had been posted at Cenchrea to prevent any attempt upon Crommyon had the view of the battle intercepted from them by the moun tain Oneius But when they saw the cloud of dust and thence knew what was doing they marched full speed to wards the spot The aged inhabitants also when they are informed of the battle rushed out of Corinth to succour their own people The Athenians perceiving the approach of such numerous bodies and judging them to be succours sent up by the neighbouring Peloponnesians threw them selves immediately on board their ships with what spoil they had taken and the bodies of their own dead excepting two which not finding in this hurry they left behind They were no sooner re embarked than they crossed over to the adjacent islands from whence they dispatched a herald to demand leave which was granted to fetch off the dead bodies they had left behind â This incident is related by Plutarch in Me Life jfNicias as a proof of the great piety and humanity of Nicias His asking leave to fetch off these Vol I 3 K 334 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR The number of Corinthians slain in the battle was two hundred and twelve  that of Athenians somewhat less than fifty The Athenians leaving the islands appeared the same day before Crommyon situated in its territory and distant from the city of Corinth one hundred and twenty stadia They landed and ravaged the country and that night re posed themselves there The day following they sailed along the coast first to Epidaurus  and after a kind of de scent there arrived at Methone which lies between Epidau rus and Troezen Possessing themselves there of the isthmus of Cherronesus on which Methone is situated they run up a wall across it and fixed a garrison of continuance in that post which for the future extended their depredations over all the districts of Troezen Halias and Epidaurus But the fleet when once this post was sufficiently secured sailed away for Athens During the space of time which co incided with these transactions Eurymedon and Sophocles who with the ships of the Athenians had quitted Pylus to proceed in the voyage to Sicily arrived at Corcyra They joined the Corcyreans of the city marching out against those who were posted on the mount of Istone that party who repassing soon after the sedition were at this time masters of the country and corn two bodies was according to that writer an actual renunciation of the vic tory  since it was against all rules for persons who had condescended to such a submission to erect a trophy But without disparaging the good qualities of Nicias or his obedience to the institutions of his country in re gard to the dead which were ever most sacredly observed it may be ques tioned whether he renounced the victory on this occasion Thucydides says the trophy was already erected which ascertained without doubt the honour of the victory and nothing is said of its demolition by the Corinthi ans when they received this request of truce from Nicias His re em barking in a hurry seems a distinct affair It had no connexion with the late battle which had been clearly and fairly won  but was owing to a fresh army coming into the field on the side of the enemy This stopped him indeed from gaining any fresh honour but surely did not deprive him of what he was already possessed of â About 12 English miles B IV YEAR VII BEFORE CHRIST 42 335 mitted sad ravage Accordingly they assaulted that post and carried it by storm The defendants who had fled away in a body towards another eminence were soon forced to capitulate  giving up their auxiliaries and then giving up  their own arms to be proceeded with afterward at the  pleasure of the people of Athens The commanders re moved them all for safe custody into the isle of Ptychia till they could conveniently be conveyed to Athens with this proviso that if any one person should be caught in an attempt  to get off the whole number should forfeit the benefit of  the capitulation But the leaders of the populace at Corcyra apprehend ing that the Athenians should they be sent to Athens might possibly save their lives contrive the following machination â They tamper successfully with some of those who were con fined in the isle by the means of some trusty agents whom they sent privately amongst them and instructed that  with  great professions of regard for them they should insinuate  no other resource was left for them but to make their escape  with all possible expedition and that themselves would un  dertake to provide them with a bark for it was the certain  resolution of the Athenian commanders to give them up to  the fury of the Corcyrean populace â When they had given ear to these suggestions and were on board the bark thus treacherously provided for them and so were appre hended in the very act of departure the articles of capitula tion came at once to an end and they were all given up to the Corcyreans Not that the Athenian commanders did not highly contribute to the success of this treachery  since in order to make it go down more easily and to lessen the fears of the agents in the plot they had publicly declared that the  conveyance of those persons to Athens by any other hands  would highly chagrin them because then whilst they were  attending their duty in Sicily others would run away with  all the honour The Corcyreans had them no sooner in their power than they shut them up in a spacious edifice â 336 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Hence afterwards they brought them out by twenties and having formed two lines of soldiers in all military habile ments facing one another they compelled them to walk be tween the lines chained one to another and receiving blows and wounds as they passed along from those who formed the lines and struck at pleasure so soon as they perceived the ob jects of their hatred They were followed by others who car ried scourges and lashed those forwards who moved not readi ly along Threescore persons had been brought forth and de stroyed in this manner before those who remained in the edi fice became sensible of their fate For they had hitherto ima gined that those who fetched them out did it merely to shift their confinement But when they learned the truth from some person or other whom they could not disbelieve they called out aloud on the Athenians and implored as a favour to be put to death by them To stir from the place of their confinement they now absolutely refused and averred that to the utmost of their power they would hinder every body from coming into them But the Corcyreans had not the least in clination to force an entrance by the doors They mounted up on the top of the edifice and tearing off the roof flung the tiles and shot arrows down upon them The others protected themselves to the best of their power and many of them were employed in making away with themselves by cramming the arrows shot from above down their own throats Others tearing away the cordage from the beds which happened to be within or twisting such ropes as they could from shreds of their own garments so strangled themselves to death No method was omitted during the greatest part of the night for night dropt down upon this scene of horror till either dis patched by their own contrivance or shot to death by those above their destruction was completely finished So soon as it was day the Corcyreans having thrown their bodies on heaps into carriages removed them out of the city But their wives so many as had been taken prisoners in company with their husbands they adjudged to slavery for life B IV YEAR VII â BEFORE CHRIST 425 In this manner the Corcyreans from the mountains were destroyed by the people And a sedition so extensive was brought to this tragical period so far at least as relates to the present war For nothing of the same nature broke out af terwards so remarkable as to need a particular relation The Athenians departed from Corcyra made the best of their way for Sicily whither they were bound at first setting out and prosecuted the war there in concert with their allies In the close of this summer the Athenians on the station of Naupactus marching in junction with the Acarnanians possessed themselves of Anactorium a city of the Corinthi ans situated on the mouth of the gulf of Ambracia It was put into their hands by treachery In consequence of this the Corinthian inhabitants were ejected and the place repeo pled by new inhabitants invited thither from all parts of Acar nania And the summer ended The ensuing winter Aristides the son of Archippus one of those who commanded the squadrons which the Atheni ans had put out to raise contributions among their depend ents apprehended Artaphernes a noble Persian at Eion on the river Strymon He was going to J acedaemon on a com mission from the King Being conveyed to Athens the Athenians had his letters which were wrote in Assyrian translated and read in public Their contents were large but the principal was this passage addressed to the Lacedae monians that  he was not yet properly informed what it  was they requested of him For though he had been at  tended by frequent embassies yet they did not all agree in  their demands If therefore they were desirous to make  an explicit declaration they should send some of their body  to him in company with this Persian But the Athenians afterwards sent Artaphernes back to F phesus in a trireme and with an embassy of their own who meeting at that place with the news that Artaxcrxes the son of Xerxes was lately 338 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR dead for about this time that monarch died the ambassa dors returned back to Athens The same winter also the Chians demolished their new for tifications The Athenians had expressly ordered it suspect ing that they were intent on some innovating schemes It availed nothing that they had lately given the Athenians all possible securities and the strongest assurances that they would in no shape attempt or think of innovations And thus the winter ended and with it the seventh year of this war of which Thucydides hath compiled the history was brought to a conclusion YEAR VIII EARLY in the following summer at the time of the new moon the sun was partially eclipsed and in the be ginning of the same month the shock of an earthquake was felt The fugitives from Mitylene and Lesbos in general who to a great number had sheltered themselves on the conti nent assemble in a body and having hired some additional succours in Peloponnesus and drawn them over safely from thence surprise Rhaetium but in consideration of two thousand Phocean staters paid immediately down they restored it again undamaged This being done they marched next against Antandrus and got possession of it by the treachery of a party within the city who betrayed it to them It was farther their intention to set at liberty those cities styled the Actean which had formerly been possessed by the Mityleneans but were now in the hands of the Athe nians But their principal view was the possession of An tandrus which once effectually secured for it lay conve nient for the building of ships as it had plenty of timber and mount Ida stood just above it they would then be amply â Above 1 8001 sterling B IV 339 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 furnished with all the expedients of war nay might act of fensively from thence might terribly annoy Lesbos which lies near it and reduce the iEolian fortresses along the coast This was the plan which now they were intent to put in execution The same summer the Athenians with a fleet of sixty ships and taking with them two thousand heavy armed a few horsemen the Milesians and others of their confede rates made an expedition against Cythera The command was lodged with Nicias son of Niceratus Nicostratus son of Diotrephes and Autocles son of Tolmaeus Cythera is an island it lies upon the coast of Laconia over against Malea The inhabitants are Lacedaemonians resorting thi ther from the neighbouring coast A magistrate was sent over yearly from Sparta by the stile of Judge of Cythera  the garrison of heavy armed established there was regularly relieved  and no care omitted in the good government and management of the place It was the port which their trad ing ships first entered in their return from Egypt and Libya It was the chief security of Laconia against those piratical parties which might infest it from the sea from whence alone they are capable of doing them any mischief for by its situation it hath intirely the command of the seas of Sicily and Crete The Athenian armament therefore arriv ing here with a detachment of ten ships and two thousand heavy armed surprise a maritime town which is called Scan dea With the rest of their force they made a descent on that part of the island which is opposite to Malea and ad vanced toward the city of Cythera situated also on the sea and they found immediately that all the inhabitants were drawn out into the field in readiness to receive them An engagement ensued wherein the Cythereans maintained their ground for a small space of time but then turning about fled amain into their citadel They soon afterwards capitulated with Nicias and his colleagues submitting to the Athenians at discretion barring only the penalty of death 346 THE tELOPONNESlAN WAR Some of the Cythereans had before hand obtained a confer ence with Nicias This rendered the capitulation more easy and expeditious and not only the present but all future points were by this means speedily and satisfactorily ad justed For the Athenians insisted that they should eva cuate Cythera because they were Lacedaemonians and be Â cause the island lay so conveniently on the Laconic coast The accommodation being once perfected the Athenians having secured Scandea the fortress situated upon the har bour and fixed a garrison in Cythera stood away for Asine and Helas and most of the adjacent places on the coast There they made descents and reposing themselves in the nights at the most convenient of those places they spent about seven days in ravaging the country The Lacedaemonians though they saw the Athenians had possessed themselves of Cythera and expected further that they would proceed to make more such descents upon their territories yet no where drew together in a body to re pulse them They only stationed their parties of guard in such posts as were of greatest importance In other re spects they exerted their utmost vigilance being under ap prehensions that the very form of their government was in danger of subversion Their loss in Sphacteria was unex pected and great indeed Pylus was now in the hands of the enemy as was also Cythera War was bursting in upon them on all sides with irresistible impetuosity This com pelled them contrary to their usual maxims to form a body of four hundred horse and archers If they were ever dejected by the prevalence of fear at this juncture they were more feelingly so when they saw the necessity of en tering the lists contrary to all that practice of war to which they had been inured in a naval contest and in this against the Athenians whose passion it was to compute as so much loss whatever they left unattempted Their general misfor tune besides which so suddenly and so fast had poured in upon them had thrown them into the utmost consternation B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 341 They excessively dreaded the weight of such another calami ty as they had been sensible of in the blow at Sphacteria Intimidated thus they durst no longer think of fighting  nay whatever measures they concerted they at once desponded of success as their minds accustomed till of late to an unin terrupted career of good fortune were now foreboding nothing but disappointments Thus for the most part whilst the Athenians were extending their devastations all along their coasts they remained inactive Each party on guard though the enemy made a descent in the face of their post knowing themselves inferior in number and sadly dis pirited made no offer to check them One party indeed which was posted near Cortyta and Aphrodisia perceiving the light armed of the enemy to be straggling ran speedily to charge them  but when the heavy armed advanced to their support they retreated with so much precipitation that some though few of them were killed and their arms rifled The Athenians after erecting a trophy re embarked and re passed to Cythera From thence they sailed again along the coast to the Li merian Epidaurus  and after ravaging part of that district they arrived at Thyrea which though it lies in the district called Cynuria is the frontier town which parts Argia and Laconia This place belonged to the Lacedaemonians who had assigned it for the residence of the exiled iEginetae in requital of the services they had done them at the time of the earthquake and the insurrection of the Helots and further because though subject to the Athenians they hadjever firmly abided in the Lacedaemonian interest The iEginetae thus again invaded by the Athenians abandoned the fortification upon the sea side which they were busy in throwing up and retreated into the city which was the place of their residence seated higher up at the distance of about ten stadia from the shore A party of Lacedaemonians had been posted Vol I â About a mile 3L 342 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR there to assist those who were employed in the new fortifica tion  and yet though earnestly pressed by the iEginetae they refused to accompany them within their walls being averse to run the risk of a new blockade They chose rather to retreat towards the eminences as they judged themselves disabled by the inferiority of their number from facing the enemy and remained there in a state of inaction By this time the Athenians having compleated their land ing and advanced with their whole force take Thyrea by storm They set the city in flames and destroyed whatever was within it Such of the iEginetae as survived the instant carnage they carried prisoners to Athens  and with them Tantalus son of Patrocles who commanded there as general for the Lacedaemonians He had been wounded and so taken prisoner They also carried thither some few persons whom they had taken in Cythera such as for its security it was expedient to remove These the Athenians after a con sultation decreed  to be disposed of in the islands but  the rest of the Cythereans still to occupy their own lands  subjected to the yearly tribute of four talents but the  iEginetae as many as had been taken prisoners to be all in  stantly put to death to gratify that eternal rancour they bore them  and Tantalus to be kept in prison along with his  countrymen taken in Sphacteria The same summer a suspension of arms was agreed on in Sicily first between the Camarineans and Geloans and then the other Sicilians holding a general congress at Gela whither the ambassadors from the several States re sorted entered into conferences about the terms of a gene ral reconciliation Many different expedients were proposed on all sides and many disputes arose each insisting on a re paration suitable to their own private sense of grievance But Hermocratesf the son of Hermon a Syracusan who â Seven hundred and seventy five pounds sterling t This great and accomplished Syracusan seems to be ushered into this history with peculiar dignity as the very month of Sicily exhorting B IV 343 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 laboured most of any at a firm re union delivered his senti ments thus  I am here the representative ye men of Sicily of one  and not the meanest of the Sicilian states nor yet the most  exhausted by war  and what I am going to propose is cal  culated for and will I am convinced most effectually se  cure the welfare of our common country And what need  is there now to run over in minute detail the calamities in  separable from war in the hearing of men who have expe  rienced them all  None ever plunge headlong into these  through an utter ignorance of them  nor when the views  are fixed on gratifying ambition are men used to be deter  red by fear The acquisitions proposed in the latter case  are generally imagined to overbalance dangers and the â 4 former choose rather to submit to hazards than suffer di  minution of their present enjoyments Yet where the parties  actuated by these different views embroil themselves at a juncture when it is impossible to succeed exhortations to a  mutual agreement are then most highly expedient  To be influenced by such exhortations must at present be  highly for the advantage of us all For it was the strong  desire of fixing our own separate views on a firm establish  ment which at first embroiled us in this war and which at  present raiseth such mutual altercations even during our en  deavours to effect an accommodation and in fine unless  matters can be so equally adjusted as to satisfy all parties  we shall again have recourse to arms But then we ought  to recollect that not merely for securing our separate in them all to concorJ and unanimity and teaching them the method of se curing the welfare and glory of their common country upon the noblest plan This is noted merely to draw upon him the attention of the reader He will act afterwards in the most illustrious scenes and shew himself on all occasions a man of true honour and probity a firm and disinterested patriot an excellent statesman and a most able commander The Athe nians never had a more determined or a more generous enemy But that will not hinder our historian from representing him in all his merit 344 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  terests if we would act like men of sense is this present  congress opened  but to concert the best measures within  our reach to preserve if possible our country from falling  and as I judge in great danger of falling a sacrifice to  Athenian ambition It is to convince you how unneces  sary a reunion is not so much from what I can urge as  from the light these very Athenians themselves hold out  before you Possessed of a power far superior to any other  Grecians here they lie amongst us with a few ships to note  down our indiscretions  and under the plausible pretext of  alliance though with malice lurking in their hearts they are  studying to improve them in a specious manner to their own  advantage For should war be again our option  and in it  should the assistance of men be accepted who though un  invited would be glad to invade us  whilst we are harass  ing and exhausting one another and cutting open for these  Athenians a road to our subjection it is much to be appre  hended that when once they behold our strength at the  lowest ebb they will pay us a visit with more formidable  armaments and exert their utmost endeavours to compleat  our destruction  It becomes each party amongst us provided we know  what is really our interest to form alliances and to launch  into hazardous attempts rather to acquire what belongs  to others than to prejudice what themselves at present pos  sesi  and to rest assured that sedition must ruin our seve  ral States nay Sicily itself of which we the joint possessors  are ready are all of us ready to be supplanted by hostile  treachery whilst mutually embroiled in our domestic quarrels It is high time we were convinced of this that  every individual might be reconciled with his neighbour  and community with community and all in general com  bine together to preserve the whole ot Sicily that our  ears be deaf to the mischievous suggestions that those  amongst us of Doric descent are enemies to every thing B tV TEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424  that is Attic whilst those of Chalcidic because of that  Ionian affinity are sure of their protection The Athenians  invade us not from private enmity because we are peopled  here from these divided races but to gratify their lust after  those blessings in which Sicily abounds and which at pre  sent we jointly possess Nay this they have already  clearly declared by their ready compliance with the invi  tation of those of the Chalcidic race For though they  have never claimed assistance from hence by virtue of  their natural attachments here yet they have shewn a  greater readiness in support of those than any compact be  tween them required Yet though the Athenians be in  this manner rapacious in this manner politic by me at  least they ought to be forgiven since I blame not men  who are greedy of empire but such as are too eager to  bend their necks to their yoke  Because it is the constant  never failing turn of the human temper to control who  will submit but to make head against more powerful in  croachments As for us who know these things and yet  will not timely provide against them though each in this  assembly be separately convinced that it demands our  greatest attention to unite in dissipating a storm which  threatens us all we err strangely in our conduct especially  when its diversion might be so readily effected would we  only bring our private quarrels to an amicable determina  tion For it is not from quarters of their own that the  Athenians rush thus to annoy us  but from ground which  belongs to those who invited them Thus of course with  out any intervening trouble one war will not be terminated by another but dissension will at once subside in peace  And these new comers who under specious colours are  here for our ruin must return again with a disappointment  which they may as speciously palliate So desirable a bene  fit will at once infallibly accrue from proper determinations  in regard to the Athenians  That peace is the greatest of human blessings is a truth 346 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  which all the world allovveth â what hindereth us then why  we should not firmly establish it with one another  or do  you rather imagine that if the condition of one man be  happy and that of another be wretched tranquillity will not  contribute sooner than warfare to amend the state of the  latter and to preserve the state of the former from a sad  reverse or that peace is not better calculated to preserve 4 unimpaired the honours and splendors of the happy and all  other blessings which should we descend to a minute de  tail might largely be recounted or might be set in the  strongest light by opposing to them the calamities which  ensue from war  Fix your minds therefore on these con  siderations that you may not overlook my admonitions but 4 in compliance with them look out respectively in time for  expedients of prevention  In case it be presumed that success must result from  power without taking into debate the justice or violence  of the cause let me detect the dangerous fallacy of such a  sanguine hope which must be blasted in the end Many  are they it is well known who would have gratified their  revenge on violent oppressors and many who have exerted  their utmost force for their own aggrandisement yet the  first so far from accomplishing their revenge have met  destruction in its pursuit and it hath been the fate of the  latter instead of inlarging to suffer the loss of what they  already possessed For revenge is not certain because justly sought after to retaliate violence nor is power as  sured of its end because invigorated with sanguine expec  tation Events are for the most part determined by the  fallible unsteady balance of futurity which though de  ceivable as deceit can be yet holds out before us the most  instructive hints For thus armed equally beforehand  with needful apprehension we embark into mutual contests  with wise premeditation Now therefore checked by the  gloomy dread of the yet invisible event and awed on all  sides by the terrors which the presence of these Athenians B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 347  spreads amongst us  deterred further by these hopes already  blasted which assured us alternately of success against one  another had not they interfered to obstruct and controul  us  let us send far away from Sicily these enemies that are  hovering about us  let us enter into firm and lasting uni  on with one another at least let us conclude a truce for  so long a time as can possibly be agreed and defer our  own private disputes to a remote decision In a word let  us acknowledge that if my advice takes place we shall  continue free in our respective communities where mas  ters of ourselves and accountable to none besides we shall  be enabled to recompence both our friends and our foes ac  cording to their deserts But in case it be obstinately re jected and the mischievous insinuations of others prevail  why then adieu henceforth to the just vindication of our  own wrongs  or if we are violently bent upon effecting it  we must strike up a friendship with unrelenting foes and  must range ourselves in opposition there where nature hath  most closely attached us  For my own part who now as I observed at setting u out represent the greatest of the Sicilian states and in  this character am more accustomed to attack another than  to defend myself I here in her name conjure you to make  use of conviction and unite together in a speedy accom  modation nor so eagerly to thirst after the damage of our  foes as to plunge ourselves into irreparable mischiefs I  am not conscious to myself of that foolish haughtiness of  heart which expects to be absolute in its own private will  or that fortune whose master I am not should attend my  orders  but I am ready to give way to good sense and rea  son And I require you all respectively thus to give way  to one another and not to wait till you are compelled to  do so by your enemies It can argue no baseness for  kinsmen to give way to kinsmen a Dorian to a Dorian or  a Chalcidean to others of his own race Nay what is  most comprehensive we are all neighbours all joint in 348 THE PELOPONNESIAtf WAR  habitants of the same land a land washed round by the  sea and all stiled by the same common name of Sicilians  Wars indeed in the course of time I foresee we shall wage  upon one another and future conferences will again be held  and mutual friendship shall thus revive But when foreign  ers invade us let us be wise enough to unite our strength  and drive them from our shores For to be weakened in  any of our members must endanger the destruction of the  whole and to such confederates and such mediators we  will never for the future have recourse  If to such conduct we adhere we shall immediately  procure a double blessing for Sicily We shall deliver her  from the Athenians and a domestic war For the future  we shall retain the free possession of her in our own hands  and more easily disconcert any projects that hereafter may  be formed against her THE Sicilians acknowledged the weight of these argu ments thus urged by Hermocrates and all the several parties joined in one common resolution  to put an end to the war  each retaining what they were at present possessed of but  that Morgantina should be restored to the Camarineans  upon the payment of a certain sum of money to the Syra  cusans Such also as were confederated with the Athe nians addressing themselves to the Athenian commanders notified their own readiness to acquiesce in these terms and their resolution to be comprehended in the same peace These approving the measure the last hand was put to the accommodation The Athenian fleet which had no longer any business there sailed away from Sicily But the people at Athens manifested their displeasure against the commanders at their return home by passing a sentence of banishment against Pythodorus and Sophocles and subjecting Eurymedon who was the third to a pecuniary mulct as if when able to have perfected the reduction of Sicily they had been bribed to desist They had enjoyed so long a career of good for B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 349 tune that they imagined nothing could disconcert their schemes  that enterprizes of the greatest as well as of small importance no matter whether adequately or insufficiently supported must be ended to their wish This was owing to the unexpected good luck with which most of their pro jects had of late succeeded and now invigorated all their expectations The same summer the Megareans of the city of Me gara pressed hard by the Athenians who constantly twice a year made an inroad into their territory with their whole united force harassed at the same time by their own out laws who having been ejected by the popular party in the train of a sedition had settled at Pegae and from thence were continually plundering them began to have some con ference about the expediency of recalling their outlaws that the city might not doubly be exposed to ruin The friends of these exiles perceiving such a design to be in agitation insisted more openly than ever that the affair should be re gularly considered The leaders of the people being con vinced that their own and the strength of the people united in their present low condition could not possibly over rule it were so far influenced by their fears as to make a secret offer to the Athenian generals Hippocrates the son of Ariphron and Demosthenes the son of Alcisthenes  to put  the city into their hands concluding they should be less endangered by such a step than by the restoration of the exiles whom they themselves had ejected It was agreed that in the first place the Athenians should take possession of the long walls these were eight stadia in length reach ing down from the city to Nisaea their port to prevent any succour which might be sent from Nisaea by the Peloponne sians since there alone they kept their garrison for the se curity of Megara After this they promised their endea vours to put them in possession of the upper city And this they would be able to effect more easily when the former point was once secured â About three quarters of a mile Vol I 3 M 3S0 THE PELOP0NNE8IAX WAR The Athenians therefore when all was fixed and deter mined on both sides crossed over by night to Minoa the island of the Megareans with six hundred heavy armed commanded by Hippocrates and sat themselves down in a hollow whence the bricks for the walls had been taken and which lay near enough for their purpose  whilst another body under Demosthenes the other commander consisting of light armed Plateeans and the Athenian patroles con cealed themselves near the temple of Mars which lies still nearer Not a soul within the city knew any thing of these motions excepting those whose vigilance it concerned this night to observe them When the morning was ready to break the plotters of Megara proceeded thusâ Through a series of time they had established a custom to have the gates of the long walls opened to them in the night by carrying out a wherry upon a carriage which they persuaded the officers posted there they conveyed nightly down the ditch into the sea and so went upon a cruize And before it was light bringing it back again to the walls upon the carriage they conveyed it through the gates that it might escape the notice of the Athenian watch on Minoa who by this means might be eluded as they never would descry any boat in the harbour The carriage was now at the gates which were opened as usual for the reception of the wherry This the Athenians observing for this was the signal agreed on came running from their place of ambush to take possession of the gates before they could be shut again The very moment the carriage was between and obstructed the closing thenl together both they and the Megarean coadjutors put the watch which was posted at the gates to the sword The Plataans and patroling parties under Demosthenes rushed in first to that spot where the trophy now stands and having thus gained an entrance for the Peloponnesians who were nearest had taken the alarm the Plataeans made good their ground against those who at tacked them and secured the gates till the heavy armed Athenians who were coming up with all speed had entered Jl IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 351 Each of these Athenians afterwards so fast as he got in ad vanced along the wall The Peloponnesian guards though few in number made head against them for a time some of them soon dropped and then the rest ran speedily off They were dismayed at such an attack from their enemies in the night and as the treacherous Megareans fought against them they concluded that all the Megareans were combined together in betraying them It happened farther that an Athenian herald had proclaimed of his own accord that  such Megareans as were willing to side with the Athe  nians should throw down their arms When the Pelopon nesians heard this they at once quitted their posts  and se riously believing that all the Megareans had combined to betray them fled amain into Nisaea At the time of morning s dawn the long walls being thus surprised and the Megareans within the city thrown into a tumult the agents for the Athenians in concert with all their accomplices in the plot insisted on the necessity to throw open the city gates and march out to battle  since it had been agreed between them that so soon as ever the gates were thus opened the Athenians should rush in There was a method to be observed on their side in order to be distinguished  this was to besmear themselves with ointment that they might receive no harm Their security would have been greater had they opened the gates at once  for now four thousand heavy armed Athenians and six hundred horsemen who had marched in the night from Eleusis according to a prior disposition were at hand But whilst the accomplices properly besmeared stood ready at the gates one of their own party who was privy to the whole plot discovereth it to the other Megareans These drawing up together came forwards in a body and denied  the expediency of marching out since formerly when  stronger than now they durst not hazard such a step or  running such a manifest risk of losing the city and â â should any one affirm the contrary the point should be 352 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  instantly determined by blows They gave not the least hint as if they had discovered the design but strenuously insisted that their own measure was most adviseable and stood firm together for the security of the gates Thus it â was no longer possible for the conspirators to put their plot in execution The Athenian commanders being sensible that the pro ject had been somehow crossed and that they were not able themselves to take the city by storm immediately run up a wall to invest Nisaea concluding that could they carry it before any succours came up it would be impossible for Megara to hold out much longer Iron and workmen and all proper materials were quickly supplied them from Athens They begun at the wall which they had lately surprised they ran it along for some time parallel with Megara and then down to the sea on both sides of Nisaea The work both of ditch and wall was divided amongst the army They made use of the stones and bricks of the suburbs and having felled some trees and wood they strengthened what was weak with an additional palisade The houses of the suburbs being topped with battlements served the use of turrets This whole day they plied hard at the work  and about the evening of the succeeding day it was only not com pleted The garrison within Nisaea was in great consterna tion They laboured already under a scarcity of provisions which they had been used to fetch daily from the upper city Thus concluding that the Peloponnesians could not succour them with sufficient expedition and imagining the Mega reans were combined against them they capitulated with the Athenians on the following terms  To be dismissed every man at a certain ransom after delivering up their arms  But as for the Lacedaemonians their commander and  every other person in that number these to be disposed of  by the Athenians at discretion These terras being agreed to they evacuated Nisaea And B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 the  Athenians having thus cut off their long walls from the city of the Megareans and possessed themselves of Nisaea were preparing to accomplish what was yet to be done But Brasidas son of Tellis the Lacedaemonian happened at this time to be about Sicyon and Corinth levying forces to march for Thrace He was no sooner informed of the surprisal of the walls than he trembled for the Peloponne sians in Nisaea and lest Megara should be taken He sum mons the Boeotians to attend him expeditiously with their forces at Tripodiscus the place so named is a village of the Megaris under the mountain Geranea whither he was march ing himself with two thousand seven hundred heavy armed Corinthians four hundred Phliasians six hundred Sicyoni ans and what levies he had already made upon his own ac count He imagined he might come up before Nisaea could be taken But hearing the contrary for he came up in the night to Tripodiscus with a picked body of three hundred men before the news of his march could be spread he ap proached to the city of Megara undescried by the Atheni ans who were posted near the sea He intended to declare that he was ready to attempt and in fact would have been glad to have effected the recovery of Nisaea But it was principally his view to get admission into Megara and pro vide for its security He demanded admission assuring them he had great hope of recovering Nisaea But the fac tious in Megara perplexed at this step of Brasidasâ on one side lest he meant to reinstate the exiles by ejecting them  the other lest the people with such an apprehension might at once fall upon them and their city thus plunged into a tu mult of arms might be lost if the Athenians who lay ready in ambush should seize it refused him admittance and both factions thought proper without any stir to await the event For it was severally their full expectation that a battle must ensue between the Athenians and these new comers  and then without plunging themselves into unne 354 THE PELOPONNESIAH WAR cessary hazards they might join their own favourite party if victorious Brasidas when he could not prevail withdrew again to the main of his army By the succeeding dawn the Boeo tians joined him who had resolved to succour Megara even previous to the summons sent by Brasidas since they re garded the danger that place was in as their own They were actually advanced with their whole force as far as Plataea  and the messenger having met with them here they became much more eager than before They sent for wards a detachment of two and twenty hundred heavy armed and six hundred horsemen but dismissed the multi tude to their own homes When the whole force was thus united consisting of at least six thousand heavy armed and the heavy armed Athenians stood drawn up in order near Nisaea and the sea shore whilst their light armed were straggling about the plain the Boeotian cavalry made an unexpected sally against those stragglers and chaced them to the shore  For hitherto no aid whatever had taken the field in behalf of the Megarfcans The Athenian cavalry clapped spurs to repel the Boeotian and a battle ensued The horse were a long time thus engaged and both sides claimed a victory For the general of the Boeotian cavalry and a small number of his party the Athenians drove be fore them to Nisaea where they put them to the sword and rifled them They remained masters of the dead bo dies gave them up afterwards by truce and erected a tro phy  But neither side so keeping their ground as to render the action decisive they retreated as it were by consent  the Boeotians to their main army and the Athenians to Nisaea Brasidas after this advanced nearer to the sea and to the city of Megara with his army Having occupied there some advantageous gronnd they drew up in order and stood still imagining the Athenians would attack them and as sured that the Megareans were intently observing for whom B IV 355 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 the victory might declare In both these respects they judged their present posture the most judicious  because it was not their own business to attack or voluntarily to run into conflict and danger and thus having manifestly exhibited their alacrity to act defensively a victory might justly be as cribed to them without the expence of a battle In re gard further to the Megareans the consequence could not but be fortunate For in case the latter had never beheld them thus prompt in their succour they would have stopped all farther risk and so undoubtedly they should have lost the city as men completely vanquished But now should the Athenians decline an engagement the points for which they themselves came thither must be secured without a blow  which proved to be the result For the MegarCans when the Athenians came out and drew up in order close to the long walls and then as the enemy did not advance to at tack them stood quiet in their ranks  their commanders also judging the hazard by no means equal and themselves who had so far been successful not at all concerned to begin an engagement against superior numbers in which should they prevail they could only take Megara but should they miscarry must lose the flower of their domestic strength especially as their opponents would act in probability with more daring resolution since as the large strength they had now in the field consisted only of quotas from several con stituents they hazarded but little  thus facing one another for a considerable space and neither side presuming to make an attack till each at length wheeled off the Athenians first towards Nisaea and the Peloponnesians again to their for mer post â Then I say the Megareans in the interest of the exiles regarding Brasidas as victor aud animated by the refusal of attack on the Athenian side open the gates of Megara to Brasidas himself and the several commanders from the auxiliary states and having given them admission proceed with them to consultation whilst the partizans of the Athenian interest were in the utmost consternation 356 THE PEI OPONNESIAN WAR Soon afterwards the confederates being dismissed to their respective cities Brasidas also himself returned to Co rinth to continue his preparations for that Thracian expedi tion in which before this avocation he had been intently employed The Athenians also being now marched homewards the Megar ans in the city who had acted most zealously in fa vour of the Athenians finding all their practices detected stole off as fast as possible The others after concerting the proper steps with the friends of the exiles fetch them home from Pegae having first administered to them the most solemn oaths  to think no more on former injuries and to  promote the true welfare of the city to the utmost of their  power But these when re invested with authority and taking a review of the troops of the city having previously disposed some bands of soldiers in a proper manner picked out about a hundred persons of their enemies and who they thought had busied themselves most in favour of the Athenians And having compelled the people to pass a public vote upon them they were condemned to die and suffered an instant execu tion They farther new modelled the government of Me gara into almost an oligarchy And this change though introduced by an inconsiderable body of men  nay what is more in the train of sedition yet continued for a long space of time in full force at Megara The same summer the Mityleneans being intent on exer cuting their design of fortifying Antandrus Demodocus and Aristides who commanded the Athenian squadron for levy ing contributions and were now at Hellespont for Lama chus the third in the commission had been detached with ten ships towards Pontus when informed of what was thus in agitation became apprehensive that Antandrus might prove of as bad consequence to them as Ana a in Samos had already done wherein the Samian exiles having fortified themselves were not only serviceable to the Peloponnesians B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 357 at sea by furnishing them with pilots but farther were continually alarming the Samians at home and sheltering their deserters From these apprehensions they assembled a force from among their dependents sailed thither and hav ing defeated in battle those who came out of Antandrus to oppose them gain once more possession of that town And no long time after Lamachus who had been detached to Pontus having anchored in the river Calex in the district of Heraclea lost all his ships A heavy rain had fallen in the upper country and the land flood rushing suddenly down bore them all away before it He himself and the men under his command were forced to march over land through Bithynia possessed by those Thracians who acre seated on the other side of the strait in Asia to Chalcedon a colony of the Megareans in the mouth of the Euxine sea This summer also Demosthenes immediately after he had quitted the Megaris with the command of forty sail of Athe nians arrives at Naupactus For with him and with Hip pocrates some persons of the Boeotian cities in those parts had been concerting schemes how to change the government of those cities and introduce a democracy on the Athenian model The first author of this scheme was Ptoeodotus an exile from Thebes and matters were now ready for exe cution Some of them had undertaken to betray Siphae Siphae is a maritime town in the district of Thespiae upon the gulf of Crissa Others of Orchomenus engaged for Chaeronea a town tributary to that Orchomenus which was formerly called the Minyeian but now the Boeotian Some Orchome nian exiles were the chief undertakers of this point and were hiring soldiers for the purpose from Peloponnesus Chaero nea is situated on the edge of Boeotia towards Phanotis of of Phocis and is in part inhabited by Phocians The share assigned to the Athenians was the surprisal of Delium a temple of Apollo in Tanagra looking towards Euboea These Vol I 3 N 358 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR things farther were to be atchieved on a day prefixed that the Boeotians might be disabled from rushing to the rescue of Delium with all their force by the necessity of staying at home to defend their respective habitations Should the at tempt succeed and Delium once be fortified they easily pre sumed that though the change of the Boeotian government might not suddenly be effected yet when those towns were in their hands when their devastations were extended all over the country and places of safe retreat lay near at hand for tneir parties things could not longer remain in their for mer posture  but in process of time when the Athenians ap peared in support of the revolters and the Boeotians could not unite in a body to oppose them the designed revolution must necessarily take place This was the nature of the scheme at present in agitation Hippocrates having the whole force of Athens under his command was ready at the proper time to march into Bceo tia But he had dispatched Demosthenes beforehand to Naupactus with forty ships that after he had collected a suf ficient force in those parts from the Acarnanians and their other confederates he should appear with his fleet before Siphae which was then to be betrayed to him A day also was fixed upon between them in which both of them were at once to execute the parts assigned them Demosthenes being arrived at Naupactus found the Oeni adae already compelled by the united Acarnanians into an as sociation with the confederates of Athens He marched away therefore at the head of the whole confederacy in those parts and invaded first Salynthius and the Agraeans  and having carried some other points got all in readiness to shew himself before Siphae at the time appointed About the same time this summer Brasidas at the head of seventeen hundred heavy armed began his march to wards Thrace When he was come up to Heraclea in Tra chis he dispatched a messenger beforehand to his corres pondents in Pharsalus to beg a safe conduct for himself Â IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 359 and his army And as soon as he was met at Melitia of Achaea by Panaerus and Dorus and Hippolochidas and To ry laus and Strophacus who had been formerly the public host of the Chalcideans he continued his march forwards Others also of the Thessalians assisted in conducting him and from Larissa Niconidas the friend of Perdiccas The passage through Thessaly without proper guides is always difficult and must be more so to an armed body Besides to attempt such a thing through a neighbouring dominion without permission first obtained hath ever been regarded by all the Grecians with a jealous eye and the bulk of the Thessalians had been ever well affected to the Athenians Nor could Brasidas have possibly effected it had not the Thessalian been rather despotic than free governments For upon his route he was stopped at the river Enipeus by some of contrary sentiments to the rest of their countrymen who ordered him to proceed at his peril and taxed him with in justice in having come so far without the general permis sion His conductors told them in return that  without  such permission he should not proceed but as he had  come amongst them on a sudden they thought themselves  obliged in friendship to conduct him Brasidas also gave them strong assurances that  he was come thither for the  service of Thessaly and of them  that his arms were not  intended against them but against the common enemy  the Athenians that he never suspected any enmity be  tween Thessalians and Lacedaemonians why they might  not tread upon one another s ground that even now  should they withhold their consent he was neither willing  nor indeed able to proceed  but he conj ured them  however to give him no molestation Having heard these declarations they acquiesced and withdrew Brasi das now by the advice of his conductors advanced with the utmost speed without ever halting in order to anticipate fresh and more potent obstruction Nay the very same day that he left Melitia he advanced as far as to Pharsalus and en camped upon the banks of the Apidanus From thence he 360 THE PELOPOKTNESIAN WAR proceeded to Phacium and from thence into Peraebia Being so far advanced his Thessalian guides received their dismission  and the Peraebians who are tributaries to the Thessalians escorted him to Dium in the kingdom of Per diccas  it is a fortress of Macedonia situated under mount Olympus on the Thessalian side In this manner Brasidas advancing so expeditiously as to prevent all obstruction compleatcd his passage through Thessaly and arrived in the dominion i of Perdiccas and the region of Chalcis For those in Thrace who revolted from the Athenians had joined with Perdiccas in procuring this auxiliary force out of Pelo ponnesus because the great success of the Athenians had struck a terror amongst them The Chalcideans were per suaded that they should be first attacked by the Athenians  and in truth their neighbour states who yet persevered in their obedience were secretly instigating them to it Per diccas indeed had not yet declared himself their enemy  but he dreaded the vengeance of the Athenians for former grudges  and now he had a scheme at heart for the subjec tion of Arribaeus king of the Lyncestians Other points concurred to facilitate the procurement of such a succour from Peloponnesus suph as the misfortunes by which the Lacedaemonians at present were afflicted For the Athenians pressing hard on Peloponnesus and not least of all on Laconia they hoped in case they could equally annoy them in this quarter by thus marching an army against their dependents to effect a diversion And thev were more encouraged by the offers of maintenance for their troops and solicitations to support revolts They were at the same time glad of a pretext to rid themselves of their Helots lest in the present state of affairs now that Pylus was in hostile hands they might be tempted to rebel This far ther gave rise to the following event â Dreading the youth and number of these slaves for many precautions have ever been put in practice by the Lacedaemonians to curb and awe their Helots they made public proclamation that  so B IV 361 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424  many of them as could claim the merit of having done  signal service to the Lacedaemonians in the present war  should enter their claims and be rewarded with freedom The view in this was to sound them imagining that such who had the greatness of spirit to claim their freedom in re quital of their merit must be also the ripest for rebellion About two thousand claimants were adjudged worthy and accordingly were led about in solemn procession to the temples crowned with garlands as men honoured with their freedom But in no long time after they made away with them all nor hath the world been able to discover in what manner they were thus to a man destroyed Now also with alacrity they sent away seven hundred of their heavy armed under the orders of Brasidas The rest of his body were mercenaries whom he had hired in Pelo ponnesus And it was in compliance with his own particu lar desire that Brasidas was employed in this service by the Lacedaemonians The Chalcidfeans however were highly satisfied with a person who had ever passed in Sparta for one of the most active and accomplished citizens  and who in his foreign employments had performed very signal services for his country From his first appearance amongst them his jus tice and moderation so instantly recommended them to the adjacent cities that some voluntarily submitted and others were by intrigue put into his possession By him the Lace daemonians were actually impowered if the accommodation they wished for took place which it afterwards did to make exchange and restitution of towns and so relieve Pelopon nesus from the hardships of the war Nay more even in succeeding time upon the breaking out of the Sicilian war the virtue and prudence of Brasi das exerted at this juncture which some attested by their own experience others upon sound and unsuspected report im printed a zeal on the confederates of Athens to go over to the Lacedaemonians Fpr having been the first sent out to 362 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR foreign trust and approved in all respects as a worthy man he left behind him a strong presumption that the rest of his countrymen are like himself So soon therefore as it was known at Athens that he was arrived to take upon him the conduct of affairs in Thrace the Athenians declare Perdiccas their enemy as cribing this expedition to his cabals and by strengthening their garrisons kept a strict watch over all their dependants in that quarter But Perdiccas with his own forces and accompanied by the body under Brasidas marcheth against a neighbouring potentate Arribaeus son of Bromerus king of the Macedo nian Lyncestians Enmity was subsisting between them and the conquest of him was the point in view When he was advanced with his army and in conjunction with Brasidas to the entrance of Lyncus Brasidas communicated his in tention to hold a parley with Arrilwcus before he proceeded to act offensively against him  and if possible to bring him over to the Lacedaemonian alliance  For Arribaeus had already notified by a herald that he was willing to refer the points in dispute to the arbitration of Brasidas The Chalcidean embassadors also who followed the camp were continually suggesting to him that  he ought not to plunge  himself rashly into difficulties for the sake of Perdiccas designing to reserve him more intire for their own service And besides this the ministers of Perdiccas had declared it at Lacedaemon to be their master s intention to bring over all the neighbouring States into this alliance  So that it was entirely with public views that Brasidas insisted upon treating with Arribaeus But Perdiccas urged in opposition that  he had not brought Brasidas to be the judge of his  controversies but to execute his vengeance on the ene  mies he should point out to him  that it would be unjust â When Brasidas was beginning his march for Thrace he wrote this let ter to the Ephon at Sparta â 1 will execute your orders in this war or die Plutarch s Laconic Apothegms B IV 4VEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 363  in Brasidas to treat with Arribaeus when he supported half  the expence of his troops Yet in spite of such remon strances and in open defiance of him Brasidas parleyed And being satisfied with the offers of Arribaeus he drew off his troops without so much as entering his dominions â But henceforth Perdiccas looking upon this step as an injury to himself reduced his contribution of support from a moiety to a third Brasidas however the same summer without loss of time continued the operations of war and a little before the vintage being attended by the Chalcidcans marched to wards Acanthus a colony of the Andrians The inhabi tants of this place were embroiled in a sedition about his re ception  a party who co operated with the Chalcideans were for it but the people opposed Yet fearing the loss of their fruit which was not quite got in the people were at last prevailed upon by Brasidas to grant entrance to him self without any attendants and after giving him audience to resolve for themselves Brasidas is admitted and stand ing forth in the presence of the people for though a Lace daemonian he was an able speaker he harangued them thus  4 My commission from the Lacedaemonians and the  march of their troops hither under my command verify O  ye Acanthians the declaration made by us when first we  begun this war against the Athenians that we were going  to fight for the liberties of Greece But if our appear  ance here hath been too long deferred it should be as  cribed to the unexpected turns of war nearer home where  as we hoped to demolish the Athenians speedily with  out endangering you we ought to be exempted from any  censure here For now you behold us opportunely at  hand and intent in conjunction with you to pull these ty  rants down  I am surprized indeed that your gates should be barred  against me or that my presence should any way chagrin 364 THE FELOP0NNESIAN WAR  you For we Lacedaemonians imagining we were going  to confederates whose wishes were fastened upon us be  fore their eyes could behold us and from whom we might  depend upon the most cordial reception  we I say have  pierced forwards through a series of dangers marching  many days together through hostile territories and sur  mounting every obstacle by a zeal for your service If  therefore your affections are alienated from us or if you  act in opposition to your own and to the liberty of the rest  of Greece your conduct must terribly distress us And  that not only because you yourselves reject us but may by  such a step deter all others to whom I shall afterwards ap  ply from co operating with me Such obstacles you will  raise before me if you to whom first I have addressed my  self you who are masters of a city of great importance  and are in esteem for your good sense and discretion  should refuse to receive me I shall be utterly unable to  put a plausible colour upon such a refusal and shall be ex  posed to reproach as if I meant injustice under the cloak  of liberty or came hither too weak and impotent to make  head against the Athenian strength should it be exerted  against me  And yet with that force of which at this very moment  I am honoured with the command I marched myself to  the succour of Nisaea and openly defied a superior num  ber of Athenians who declined the encounter It is not  therefore probable that they can send hither a force to our annoyance equal to that armament they employed  at Nisaea Nor am I sent hither to execute the schemes of  oppression but to further the deliverance of Greece I  have the security of most solemn oaths sworn by the  magistrates of Lacedaemon that whatever people I bring  over to their alliance shall remain in free possession of  their own liberties and laws And farther we are forbid the  use of violence and fraud as the means of rendering you  dependent on us  but on the contrary are to act in sup B IV 365 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424  port of you who are oppressed with Athenian bondage  Upon reasons so valid do I insist upon it that I am no  longer suspected by you having given you the strongest  assurances that I am no impotent avenger and that you  may boldly abet my cause  If there be any person in this assembly who hesitates  upon the apprehension that I may betray the city into the  hands of a private cabal let him bid adieu to his fears and  distinguish himself in open confidence I came not hither  to be the tool of faction I am convinced that liberty can  never be re established by me if disregarding ancient  constitutions I enslave the multitude to the few or the few  to the crowd Such things would be more grievous than  the yoke of foreign dominion And should we Lacedaemo  nians proceed in this manner our labours could never  merit a return of gratitude but instead of honour and glory  foul reproach would be our portion The crimes on which  we have grounded this war against the Athenians would  then appear to be our own and more odious in us for hav  ing made parade of disinterested virtue than in a State  which never pretended to it For it is more base in men  of honour to enlarge their power by specious fraud than by  open force The latter upon the right of that superior  strength with which fortune hath invested it seizeth at once upon its prey the other can only compass it by the  treachery of wicked cunning  It is thus that in all concerns of more than ordinary w importance we are accustomed to exert the utmost cir  cumspection And besides the solemn oaths in your fa  vour you can receive no greater security of our honest  intention than the congruity of our actions with our words from whence the strongest conviction must result that  with what I have suggested you are obliged in interest to  comply But if all my promises are unavailing and you 44 declare such compliance impossible  if professing your V selves our sincere well wishers you beg that a denial may Vol I 3 O 366 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  not expose you to our resentments  if you allege that the  dangers through which your liberty must be sought to over  balance the prize that in justice it ought only to be pro  posed to such as are able to embrace the offer but that no  one ought to be compelled against his own inclinations  I shall beseech the tutelary gods and heroes of this island 44 to bear me witness that whereas I come to serve you and  cannot persuade I must now by ravaging your country  endeavour to compel you And in acting thus I shall not  be conscious to myself of injustice but shall justify the  step on two most cogent motives â For the sake of the  Lacedaemonians  lest whilst they have only your affections  and not your actual concurrence they may be prejudiced  through the sums of money you pay to the Athenians â  For the sake of all the Grecians  that they may not be ob  structed by you in their deliverance from bondage This  is the end we propose and this will justify our proceedings  For without the purpose of a public good we Lacedaemo  nians ought not to set people at liberty against their wills  We are not greedy of empire but we are eager to pull down  the tyranny of others And how could we answer it to the  body of Greece if when we have undertaken to give libertv  to them all we indolently suffer our endeavours to be tra  versed by you   Deliberate seriously on these important points and ani  mate yourselves with the glorious ambition of being the  first who enter the list for the liberties of Greece of gain  ing an eternal renown of securing the uninterrupted pos  session of your private properties and investing the State  of which you are members with the most honourable of  all titles Here Brasidas concluded And the Acanthians who had already heard this affair largely discussed on both sides and secretly declared their votesâ the majority because the arguments of Brasidas were prevailing and because they â Free B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 367 dreaded the loss of their fruit resolved to revolt from the Athenians Then they required of Brasidas himself to swear the oath of their security which the Lacedaemonian magis trates had at his departure injoined him to take that  what  ever people was brought over into their alliance by him  should remain in possession of their own liberties and laws and this done they receive his army Not long after Sta gyrus also another colony of the Andrians revolted And thus ended the transactions of this summer Very early in the succeeding winter when the strong places of Boeotia were to have been betrayed to Hippocrates and Demosthenes the Athenian commanders preparatory to which Demosthenes was to shew himself with his fleet before Siphae and the other to march to Delium there happened a mistake about the days prefixed for execution Demosthenes indeed who steered towards Siphae and had on board the Acarna nians and many of the confederates of that quarter is totally disappointed The whole scheme had been betrayed by Ni comachus the Phocian of Phanotis who gave information of it to the Lacedaemonians and they to the Boeotians All Boeotians now taking up arms to prevent consequences for Hippocrates was not yet in their country to distress them on that side Siphae and Chaeronea are secured in time And so soon as the conspirators perceived that things went wrong they gave up all farther thoughts of exciting commotions in the cities Hippocrates having summoned into the field the whole force of Athens as well citizens as sojourners not excepting even foreigners who chanced at that time to be there ar riveth too late before Delium not before the Boeotians were returned home again from Siphae He incamped his forces and set about fortifying Delium the temple of Apollo in the following manner â Round about the temple and its pre cincts they sunk a ditch Of the earth thrown up they formed a rampart instead of a wall They drove into the ground on each side a row of stakes and then threw on the vines they 368 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR cut from within the precincts of the temple They did the same by the stones and bricks of the adjacent buildings which had been demolished and omitted no expedient to give height and substance to the work They erected wooden turrets upon such spots as seemed most to require it No part of the old pile of the temple was now standing The portico which stood the longest had lately fell down They began the work the third day after their marching out from Athens That day they plied it and the following and continued it on the fifth till the time of repast Then the work being for the most part compleated they drew off their army to the dis tance of about ten stadia from Delium in order to return home Their light armed indeed for the most part march ed off directly but the heavy armed halting there sat down upon their arms Hippocrates stayed behind for the time necessary to post the proper guards and to put the finishing hand to those parts of the fortification which were not yet perfectly compleated But during all this space the Boeotians had been employed in drawing their forces together to Tanagra When the quotas from the several cities were come up and they perceived the Athenians were filing off towards Athens the other rulers of Boeotia for they were eleven in all de clared their resolution not to engage since the enemy is no longer on Boeotian ground for the Athenians when they grounded their arms were within the borders of Oropia But Pagondas the son of Eoladas one of the Boeotian rulers in the right of Thebes and at this time in the supreme com mand in concert with Arianthidas the son of Lysimachidas declared for fighting He judged it expedient to hazard an engagement and addressing himself to every battalion apart lest calling them together might occasion them to abandon their firms he prevailed upon the Boeotians to march up to the Athenians and to offer battle His exhortation to each was worded thus â About an English mile B IV 369 YEAR VIII â BEFORE CHRIST 424  IT ought never ye men of Boeotia to have entered in  to the hearts of any of your rulers that it is improper for  us to attack the Athenians because we find them not upon  our own soil For they out of a neighbouring country  have rushed into Boeotia and have fortified a post in it  from whence they intend to ravage and annoy us And our  enemies in short they are in whatever place we find them  from what place soever they march to execute hostilities u against us Now therefore let him who hath judged this  step we are taking hazardous and insecure acknowledge  and forego his error Cautious and dilatory measures are  not to be adhered to by men who are invaded and whose  all is at stake  they are expedient only for those whose  properties are secure and who bent on  rapine exert their  malice in the invasion of others But it is eternally the  duty of you Boeotians to combat such foreigners as pre  sume to invade you either upon your own or your neigh  hour s ground no matter which And this above all must  he done against Athenians not only because they are  Athenians but because they are the nearest borderers upon  us For it is a maxim allowed that no State can possibly  preserve itself free unless it be a match for its neighbour  ing powers 44 Let me add farther that when men are bent on m  slaving not neighbours only but even such people as are  more remote how can it be judged improper to encounter  such so long as we can find ground whereon to stand   Call to mind for your present information the Eubccans  situated in yon island opposite to us  call to mind the  present disposition of the bulk of Greece in regard to these  Athenians Why should we forget that neighbouring  States so often battle one another about settling their  various boundaries  whereas should we be vanquished  our whole country will be turned merely into one heap of limitation and that never again by us to be disputed  For when once they have entered upon it they will remain 370 THE PEJLOPONNESIAN WAR the masters of it all beyond controul So much more  have we to fear from these neighbours of ours than any  other people  Those again who in all the daring insolence of su  perior strength are wont to invade their neighbours as 4 these Athenians now do us march with extraordinary de  grees of confidence against such as are inactive and de  fend themselves only on their own soil His schemes are  more painfully compleated when men sally boldly beyond  their borders to meet the invader and if opportunity  serveth attack him first Of this truth our own experi  ence will amply convince us For ever since the defeat  we gave these very men at Coronea when taking the ad  vantage of our seditions they had possessed themselves of  our lands we have kept Boeotia quiet from every alarm  till the present This we ought now to remember that  the seniors among us may proceed as they then begun   that the juniors the sons of those sires who then displayed  such uncommon bravery may exert themselves to preserve  unblemished their hereditary virtues We ought all to  be confident that the God will fight on our side whose  temple they pollute by raising ramparts and dwelling  within its verge And as the victims we have offered are  fair and auspicious we ought at once to advance to the  charge of these our foes and make them know that their  lust and rapine they only then can gratify when they in  vade such cowards as abandon their own defence  but  from men who were born to vindicate their own country  for ever by the dint of arms and never unjustly to inslave  another â that from such men they shall not get awav  without that struggle which honour injoins In this manner Pagondas exhorted the Boeotians and persuaded them to march against the Athenians He put them instantly in motion and led them towards the enemy  For it waÂ now late in the day When he had approached the spot on which they were posted he halted in a plact B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 371 from whence as an eminence lay between they could have no view of one another There he drew up his men and made all ready for the attack When the news was brought to Hippocrates who was yet at Delium that  the enemy is advancing to the charge he sendeth orders to the main body to form into the order of battle And not long after he himself came up having left about three hundred horse at Delium to guard that place in case an attempt should be made upon it or seizing a fa vourable opportunity to fall upon the rear of the Boeotians during the engagement Not but that the Boeotians had posted a party of their own to watch their motions and find them employment When therefore the whole disposition was perfected they shewed themselves on the top of the eminence and there grounded their arms remaining still in the same order in which they designed to attack being in the whole about seven thousand heavy armed more than ten thousand light armed a thousand horse and five hun dred targeteers The right wing was composed of Thebans and those who ranked with them  the centre of the Haliar tians and Coroneans and Copiensians and others that live about the lake Copaeis  and the left of Thespiensians Ta nagreans and Orchomenians In the wings were posted the cavalry and light armed The Thebans were drawn up in files of twenty five  the others variously as circumstances required And such was the order and disposition of the Boeotians On the Athenian side the heavy armed being in num ber equal to their enemies were drawn up in one entire body of eight in depth Their cavalry was posted on either wing But light armed soldiers armed as was fitting the Athenians had none at this juncture neither in the field nor in thp city The number which had taken the field at first to attend this expedition exceeded many times over the number of the enemy  but then most of them had no arms at all since the summons had been extended to all who resided in Athens 372 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  both citizens and foreigners The crowd of these so sooq as ever the route was pointed homewards were excepting a few gone speedily off But when they were drawn up in the order of battle and were every moment expecting the charge Hippocrates the general shewing himself in the front of the Athenians animated them with the following harangue   THE admonition Athenians I intend to give you will  be very concise but such a one is sufficient to the brave   I pretend not to encourage Athenians but merely to re  mind them of their duty Let the thought be a stranger to  every heart amongst you that we are going to plunge into  needless hazards in the territory of a foe Be it the terri  tory of a foe yet in it you must fight for the security of  your own And if we conquer now the Peloponnesians  will never again presume without the aid of the Boeotian  horse to repeat their inroads into Attica By one battle  therefore you acquire this and secure your own land from  future annoyance Charge therefore your enemies as you  ought with a spirit worthy of the State of Athens that  State which every soul amongst you boasts to be the first  of Greece  and worthy of your great forefathers who  formerly at Oenophyta under the conduct of Myronides  defeated these people in the field and possessed for a time  all Bocotia as their prize Hippocrates had not gone along half the line encouraging them in this manner when he was compelled to desist and leave the greater part of his army unaddressed For the Boeotians to whom Pagondas also had given but a short ex hortation and had this moment finished the paean of attack were coining down from the eminence The Athenians ad vanced to meet them and both sides came running to the charge The skirts of both armies could not come to an en gagement as some rivulets that lay between stopped them equally on both sides The rest closed firm in a stubborn fight and with mutual thrusts of their shields The left B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 373 wing of the Boeotians even to the centre was routed by the Athenians who pressed upon those who composed it but es pecially on the Thespiensians For the others who were drawji up with them giving way before the shock the Thes piensians were inclosed in a small compass of ground where such of them as were slaughtered defended themselves bravely till they were quite hewed down Some also of the Athenians disordered in thus encompassing them about knew not how to distinguish and slew one another In this quarter therefore the Boeotians were routed and fled to wards those parts where the battle was yet alive Their right wing in which the Thebans were posted had the better of the Athenians They had forced them at first to give ground a little and pressed upon them to pursue their advantage It happened that Pagondas had detached two troops of horse which motion was not perceived to fetch a compass round the eminence and support the left wing which was routed These suddenly appearing in sight the victo rious wing of Athenians imagining a fresh army was coming up to the charge was struck into consternation And now being distressed on both sides by this last turn and by the Thebans who pursued their advantage close and put them into a total disorder the whole Athenian army was routed and fled Some ran towards Delium and the sea others to Oropus and others towards mount Parnes  all to whatever place they hoped was safe But the Boeotians especially their horse and the Locrians who had come up to the field of battle just as the rout began pursued them with great exe cution But the night putting an end to the chace the bulk of the flying army preserved themselves more easily The day following such of them as had reached Delium and Oropus leaving behind a garrison in Delium which still remained in their possession transported themselves by sea to Athens The Boeotians also having erected a trophy carried off their own dead rifled those of the enemy and having posted a guard upon the field of battle retired to Vol I 3 P 374 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR Tanagra and called a consultation about the method of as saulting Delium A herald farther dispatched by the Athenians about their dead meets upon his way a herald of the Boeotians who turned him back by assuring him that his errand would be fruitless till he himself should be again returned The latter being come to the Athenians declared to them in the name of the Boeotians  THAT by their late proceedings they had enormously  violated the laws of the Grecians amongst whom it was  an established rule that amidst their mutual invasions re  ligious places should be ever spared whereas the Athe  nians had not only fortified but had made Delium a place  of habitation and whatever profanations mankind can be  guilty of had been there by them committed That the 44 water which it would even be impious for the Boeotians  themselves to touch unless by way of ablution before  they sacrificed had been profanely drawn by them for  common use That for these reasons the Boeotians in  the cause of the God and in their own invoking the as  sociated Daemons and Apollo gave them this early no  tice to evacuate the sacred place and clear it of all in  cumbrances This message being thus delivered by the herald the Athenians returned this answer to the Boeotians by a herald of their own  THAT they were hitherto guilty of nothing illegal in 4 regard to the holy place nor would willingly be so for the  future They had no such intention when they first en  tered into it and their view was merely to give an ejec  tion from thence to persons who had basely injured them  It was a law among the Grecians for those who were  masters of any district whether great or small to be also  proprietors of its temples which are to be honoured by  them with the usual forms and with what additional ones  they may be able to appoint Even the Boeotians as well B IV TEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 375  as many other people who this moment were possessed  of lands from which they had ejected the old proprietors  made a seizure first of those temples which had belonged  to others and continued in the free possession of them  For their own parts could they conquer more of their ter  ritory they should manfully retain it and as to the spot  they now occupied their position there was voluntary and  as it was their own they would not quit it It was ne  cessity alone made them use the water which ought not to  be ascribed to any insolent or profane motive but to the pre  ceding invasions their enemies had made self preservation  against which laid them under a present necessity of acting  as they did It might with reason be hoped that every  proceeding to which war and violence indispensably obliged  would obtain forgiveness from the God  For the altars are  a refuge to involuntary offences and transgression is im  puted only to those who are bad without compulsion and  not to such as urgent necessities may render daring The 4 guilt of impiety belonged more notoriously to such as in  sisted on the barter of temple for the bodies of the dead than to those who are content to lose their just demands  rather than submit to so base an exchange They farther injoined him in their name to declare that  they would not  evacuate Boeotia since the ground which they occupied in  it belonged to no Boeotians but was now their own property  acquired by dint of arms All they required was a truce  for fetching off their dead according to the solemn institu  tions of their common country The Boeotians replied thusâ If they are now in Boeotia  let them quit the ground which belongeth to us and carry  off what they demand But if they are upon ground of  their own they themselves know best what they have  to do They judged indeed that Oropia on which it happened that the bodies of the dead were lying as the battle had been fought upon the lines of partition belonged 376 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR to the Atheniaa jurisdiction and yet that it was impossible for them to be carried off by force and truce farther they would grant none where the point related to Athenian ground  that it was therefore the most proper replyâ  they should quit their territory and so obtain their de  mands The herald of the Athenians having heard this departed without effect Immediately after the Boeotians having sent for darters and slingers from the Melian bay and being reinforced by two thousand heavy armed Corinthians and the Pelopon nesian garrison which had evacuated Nisaea and a party of Megareans all which had joined them since the battle marched against Delium and assaulted the fortification They tried many methods and took it at last by the help of a machine of a very particular structure â Having split asunder a large sail yard they hollowed it throughout and fixed it together again in a very exact manner so as to re semble a pipe At its extremity they fastened a caldron by help of chains into which a snout of iron was bent down wards from the yard The inside farther of this wooden machine was lined almost throughout with iron They brought it from a distance to the fortification on carriages and applied it where the work consisted chiefly of vines and timber And when near enough they put a large bellows to that extremity of the yard which was next themselves and begun to blow But the blast issuing along the bore into the caldron which was filled with glowing coals and sulphur and pitch kindled up a prodigious flame This set fire to the work and burnt with so much fury that not a soul durst any longer stay upon it but to a man they aban doned it and fled away amain and in this manner was the fortress carried Of the garrison some were put to the sword but two hundred were made prisoners The bulk of the remainder throwing themselves on board their vessels escaped in safety to Athens It was the seventeenth day after the battle that Delium B IV 377 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 was taken And not long after a herald dispatched by the Athenians came again but quite ignorant of this event to sue for the dead which were now delivered by the Boeotians who no longer laid any stress upon their former reply In the battle there perished of the Boeotians very little under five hundred  of the Athenians few less than a thou sand and Hippocrates the general but of light armed and baggage men a considerable number indeed Somewhat later in time than this battle Demosthenes who on his appearance before Sipha had been disappointed in his hope of having it betrayed to him having the land force still on board his fleet consisting of four hundred heavy armed Acarnanians and Agraeans and Athenians made a descent on Sicyonia But before all his vessels could land their men the Sicyonians had marched down to make head against them They defeated those that were landed and chased them again on board Some they killed and some they took alive  and after erecting their trophy they de livered up the dead by truce â The Athenians received in truth a terrible blow on this occasion The Boeotians a people heavy and stupid to a proverb continued ever after the terror of the Athenians the politest and most enlightened people upon earth Nay thut gross and stupid people had this day well nigh com pleated the destruction of all that was pre eminently wise and good at this time upon earth  and done an irreparable mischief to sound reason and good sense for ever after When the two troops of horse after fetching a compass round the hill had compleated the rout of the Athenians who were now flying away with the utmost speed the divine Socrates was left almost alone facing the enemy and fighting and retreating like a lion over powered Alcibiades who served in the cavalry was making off on horse back  but seeing Socrates in such imminent danger he rode up to hini covered his retreat and brought him off safe He thus repaid him the great obligation he had formerly received frnm him at Potidaa Strabo relates further Gcog I 9 that Xenopiion also the same day owed his life to Socrates Having fallen from his horse and being trampled among the crowd Socrates took him upon his shoulders and carried him to a place of safety Upon the whole brutal strength and mere bodily merit were never so near getting a total conquest over all the light and under standing which human nature hath to boast of that did not come directly down from heaven THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR During the former transactions at Delium Shakes also king of the Odiysians was killed in an expedition he had form ed against the Triballians who encountered and vanquished him And Seuthes the son of Sparadocus his nephew by the brother succeeded him in the kingdom of the Odrysians and the rest of Thrace over which he had reigned The same winter Brasidas in conjunction with the allies of Thrace marched against Amphipolis an Athenian colony upon the river Strymon The spot of ground on which the city now standeth Aris tagoras the Milesian formerly when he fled from king Da rius had endeavoured to plant but was beat off by the Edo nians Two and thirty years after the Athenians made the same attempt having sent thither a colony consisting of ten thousand of their own people and such others as voluntarily came in all of whom were destroyed by the Thracians at Drabescus But after an interval of twenty nine years the Athenians came hither again with a fresh colony led by Agnon the son of Nicias who having drove away the Edo nians built this city upon that spot of ground which had formerly been called the nine roads They rushed to the seizure from Eion a maritime emporium situated at the ri ver s mouth and belonging to them Eion is distant twenty stadia from the spot where the city now standeth and which by Agnon was named Amphipolis because it is almost sur rounded by the Strymon which floweth along it on both sides Running therefore a wall from the river to the river  5he planted his colony on a spot conspicuous both to the land and to the sea Against this place Brasidas decamping from Arne of Chalcidica advanced with his army About sun set he ar rived at Aulon and Bromiscus where the lake Bolbe issueth into the sea From hence after taking the evening repast he continued his march by night It was winter and a snow was falling This favoured and encouraged his enter  prize as he intended to surprize the people of Amphipolis â About two English miles B iV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 379 except such as were privy to his design For there resided in the place a body of Argillians who are an Andrian co lony and others who acted in combination with him some of them at the instigation of Perdiccas and others at that of the Chalcideans But in a more particular manner the Argillians who had a place of residence very near it who farther had ever been suspected by the Athenians and were really intent on the ruin of the place when now a fair op portunity was within their reach and Brasidas at hand who long before had been tampering with these inhabitants of foreign mixture in order to have the city betrayed to him The Argyllians at this juncture received him into their own city and revolting from the Athenians led his army forwards that very night to the bridge laid over the Strymon The city is seated at some distance from this pass and it was not then defended by a fort as it is now but was only the station of a small party of guards Brasidas therefore easily forced the guard being favoured in some degree by treachery not a little also by the season and his own unexpected ap proach He then passed the bridge and was immediately master of all the effects of those Amphipolitans who reside in all the tract without the walls Thjs passage was so sudden that those within the city had no notice of it and as to those without many of them being seized and others flying for preservation within the wall the Amphipolitans were thrown into vast confusion increased by their mutual suspicions of one another And it is said that if Brasidas instead of permitting his troops to disperse for plunder had advanced directly against the city it must unavoidably have fallen into his hands But he on the contrary having or dered them to halt employed himself in the ravage of what lay without and finding nothing effectuated in his favour by accomplices within he for the present desisted But those his accomplices were overpowered in number by the opposite party who prevented their opening the gates im mediately to Brasidas and acting in concert with Eucles 580 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR their commandant who resided there by the orders of the Athenians to guard the place they dispatch a messenger to the other commander in Thrace Thucydides the son of Olorus who compiled this history and was then in Thasus Thasus is an island a colony of the Parians and distant about half a day s sail from Amphipolis pressing him to come instantly to their relief Thucydides no sooner received this notice than with the utmost expedition he put to sea with seven ships that hap pened to be at hand He designed nothing so much as to prevent if possible the loss of Amphipolis or if that was impracticable to throw himself into Eion and secure it in time Brasidas in the mean while fearing at the approach of this succour from Thasus informed besides that Thucydides drew an ample revenue from the working of his gold mines in this quarter of Thrace and was on this account of great credit amongst the principal persons of this part of the con tinent tried all possible expedients to get possession of the city before his arrival lest his appearance amongst them might animate the Amphipolitans with the hope of succour by sea and from Thrace which the credit of Thucydides might easily obtain for their effectual preservation and in pursuance of this they might refuse to capitulate He sent them therefore very moderate terms ordering his herald to proclaim that  the Amphipolitans and Athenians within the  city should if they desired it be continued in the free pos  session of their property and of all their rights and liberties  whatever But those who refused to stay should have the  space of five days allowed them to quit the town and re  move their effects This proposal was no sooner heard than the inclinations of the many took a new turn The Athenian interest had but a few supporters in the city The bulk of the inhabitants were a mixture of foreign nations There were also within manv persons relations of those who had been made prison B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 381 ers without And thus in their present consternation the proposal was generally received as mild and gentle The Athenians for their part who thought themselves more ex posed to danger than the rest and had besides no hope of speedy relief were delighted with the offer of quitting the place So also were all the rest that they were not to lose their rights and liberties as citizens and should thus escape the danger they had dreaded even beyond their hopes Upon this the agents of Brasidas expatiated only on the mild ness and generosity of the terms he had offered because now they perceived that the multitude had altered their sentiments and would no longer hearken to the Athenian commandant In short an accommodation was perfected and they opened the gates to Brasidas upon the conditions he had proposed by his herald And in this manner did the inhabitants de liver up Amphipolis But in the evening of the same day Thucydides and the squadron came over to Eion Brasidas was already in possession of Amphipolis and designed that very night to seize Eion also And unless this squadron had come in thus critically to its defence at break of day it had been lost Thucydides instantly took care to put Eion in a pos ture of defence in case Brasidas should attack it and to provide farther for its future security when he had opened a refuge there for such as were willing to remove thither from Amphipolis according to the articles of the late sur render But Brasidas on a sudden fell down the river with a large number of boats towards Eion desigÂ iug if possible to seize the point of land that juts out from the walls which would have given him the command of the river s mouth He endeavoured at the same time also to assault it by land but was repulsed in both attempts And now he ef fectually employed his care in resettling and securing Am phipolis Vol I 3 Q 383 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR Mercinus also a city of Edonia revolted to him upon the death of Pittacus king of the Edonians who was killed by the sons of Goaxis and his own wife Braures Gapselus soon after did the same and Oesyme They are colonies of the Thrasians These events were owing to the practices of Perdiccas who came thither in person immediately after the surrender of Amphipolis The loss of that city cast the Athenians into great con sternation and with reason because it was a place of great importance to them since from thence they had materials for building ships and a pecuniary revenue  and farther be cause after a safe conduct through Thessaly the route was now open to the Lacedaemonians as far as the Strymon to annoy their dependents Yet had they not possessed them selves of the bridge the large lake formed above by the ri ver and the check given by the triremes stationed at Eion would have hindered the Lacedaemonians from penetrating further But all obstacles appeared to the Athenians now quite easy to be surmounted  and their apprehensions that their dependents would revolt alarmed them much For Brasidas in the rest of his conduct gave constant proofs of an excellent temper  and the declaration was ever in his mouth  that he had been sent thither to restore the liberty  of Greece Accordingly the cities which were subject to the Athenians had no sooner heard of the surrender of Amphipolis together with the brave exploits and the mild engaging deportment of Brasidas than they conceived the most ardent inclination to shake off the yoke They se cretly dispatched their agents to him earnestly desiring a visit from him with respective assurances from each that they w 5uld be the first to revolt They judged there was no longer room to apprehend any bad consequences from such a step falsely estimating the Athenian power to be much less considerable than it afterwards appeared But this their judgment was founded more upon uncertain presumption than deliberate prudence It is the turn of B IV YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 383 mankind when their passions are warm to give themselves up to blind and sanguine hope and to throw aside with de spotic scorn whatever seemeth to be counter to their wishes It was but lately that the Athenians had been vanquished by the Boeotians  and Brasidas had been making such re citals as might persuade though in fact they were collusive that at Nisaea with his single force he offered battle to the Athenians and they declined it This made them confident and they became perfectly convinced that there was no longer a strength sufficient to chastise them But what had the greatest influence on their thoughts and disposed them entirely to run all hazards was the immediate pleasure they promised themselves in a change and that now they were going for the first time to experience the sweets of Lacedae monian friendship These inclinations were perceived by the Athenians who sent garrisons into each of these cities in order to curb them with as much expedition as the shortness of time and the wintry season would permit Brasidas also had sent to Lacedaemon soliciting a speedy reinforcement and was busy himself in providing materials to build triremes in the Strymon But the Lacedaemonians ne glected to supply him partly through the envy which the leading men at Sparta had conceived against him and partly because their attention was principally confined to the recove ry of their people made prisoners in Sphacteria and to bring the war to a conclusion The same winter the Megareans having recovered their long walls which were in the possession of the Athenians levelled them with the ground Brasidas thus master of Amphipolis gathereth together the allies and leadeth them into the district called Acte It is the tract which stretcheth out into the sea from the canal which was dug by Xerxes and Athos the highest mountain in Acte is its utmost verge upon the iEgean sea The cities in it are  Sane a colony of Andrians seated close to the ca THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR nal and on that part which faceth the sea towards Euboea Thyssus farther and Cleone and Acrothous and Olophyxus and Dyum which are promiscuously inhabited by various sets of Barbarians who speak both languages There is also a small number of Chalcideans amongst them bnt the bulk are Pelasgians the issue of those Tyrrhenes who formerly inhabited Lemnos and Athens and Bisaltians and Cresto nians and Edonans  They reside in small fortresses Most of them went over to Brasidas but Sane and Dium stood out He therefore made his army halt on their lands and laid them waste Yet as this had no effect he marched from thence to Torone of Chalcidica then possessed by the Athe nians He hastened thither at the invitation of a small party who were ready to betray the city to him Being arrived whilst yet it was dark he sat down about break of day with his army near the temple of the Dioscuri which liethnotat most above three stadia from the city The bulk of the Torone ans and the Athenian garrison were ignorant of his approach But the accomplices who knew he would be punctual sent some of their body unperceived to observe his approach When these were thus certainly assured he was at hand they con ducted back with them to their friends seven men armed only with daggers Twenty had at first been selected for this ser vice but only seven of them now had the courage to proceed Lysistratus the Olynthian was the person who commanded They got in by the wall towards the sea without causing an alarm and ascending from thence slaughtered the guard in the citadel which is seated upon the most eminent spot the whole city being built on the declivity of a hill and burst open the postern towards Canastraeum Brasidas having since advanced a little with the rest of his force halted again But he ordered a hundred targeteers to go before that when the gates should be opened and the signal given which was before agreed on they might break in first  Above a quarter of a mile B IV 385 YEAR VIII BEFORE CHRIST 424 These after an interval of time wondered at the delay and by gradually advancing were got close to the city Such of the Toroneans within as acted in concert with those who had entered when once the postern was burst and the gates leading to the forum were thrown open after bursting the bar in the first place conducting some of them about led them in at the postern that they might strike a sudden panic on the ignorant inhabitants when attacked in rear and in flank and on all sides This done they lifted up the appointed signal of fire and gave instant admittance to the rest of the targeteers through the gates which led to the forum Brasidas when once he saw the signal roused up his army and led them running towards the place shouting all at once aloud and thus striking the greatest consternation into the inhabitants Some immediately rushed in at the gates  others mounted over the square wooden machines which as the wall had lately fallen down and was now rebuilding lay close to it for the raising of stones Brasidas with the bulk of his force betook himself immediately to the upper parts of the city intending to seize the eminence and possess him self effectually of the place The rest dispersed themselves equally through every quarter Amidst this surprisal the majority of the Toroneans quite Vgnorant of the plot were in vast confusion But the agents in it and all their party were quickly ranged with the assail ants The Athenians for of them there were about fifty heavy armed asleep in the forum when they found what was done some few excepted who were slain instantly on the spot fled away for preservation and some by land others in the guard ships stationed there got safe into Lecythus a fort of their own They kept this in their own hands as it was the extremity of the city towards the 6ea stretched along on a narrow isthmus Hither also those of the Toroneans who persevered in their fidelity fled to them for refuge It being now broad day and the city firmly secured Bra 386 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR sidas caused proclamation to be made to those Toroneans who had fled for refuge to the Athenians that  such as were  willing might return to their old habitations and should  enjoy their rights without any molestation But to the Athenians a herald was sent expressly commanding them  to evacuate Lecythus which rightfully belonged to the  Chalcideans and a truce should be granted them to re  move themselves and their baggage An evacuation they absolutely refused but requested one day s truce to fetch off their dead  He solemnly accorded two During this space he was very busy in strengthening the houses adjacent to Lecythus and the Athenians did the same within He also convened the Toroneans to a general assembly and harangued them very nearly in the same manner as he had done at Acanthus â that  it was unjust to look upon those who had been his coadjutors in the surprisal of the  city as men worse than their neighbours or as traitors   they had no inslaving views nor were biassed to such a  conduct by pecuniary persuasions  the welfare and liberty  of the city had been their only object Neither should  they who had no share in the event be more abridged 4 than those who had He was not come thither to destroy  the city or so much as one private inhabitant of it For  this very reason he had caused the proclamation to be made  to those who had sheltered themselves amongst the Athe  nians because such an attachment had not in the least im  paired them in his esteem since it was entirely owing to  their ignorance that they had thus undervalued the Lace  daemonians whose actions as they were always more just  would for the future entitle them much more to their be  nevolence  their terror hitherto had been merely the result  of inexperience He then exhorted them in general  to  take care for the future to be steady and firm allies since  should they henceforth offend they would be made answer  able for the guilt They were not chargeable for the past 4 as they had rather been sufferers themselves from superior B IV YEAR VlII BEFORE CHRIST 424 387  force  the preceding opposition therefore deserved forgive  ness Having spake thus and revived their spirits when the truce was expired he made assaults upon Lecythus The Athenians defended themselves from a paltry rampart and the battlements of the houses One whole day they effec tually repulsed them But on the following when a machine was to be planted against them by the enemy from whence they intended to throw fire upon their wooden fences and the army was now approaching to the spot which seemed convenient for lodging their machine and whence it might be played off with effect they raised for prevention a wooden turret the base of which was an edifice that lay ready at hand and carried up many buckets and tubs of water and heavy stones  and upon it also many defendants were mount ed But the edifice too heavily laden on a sudden was crushed by the weight The crash with which it fell was great and those of the Athenians who stood near and saw it were rather concerned than terrified But those at a dis tance and especially such as were most remote imagining the place was already taken in that quarter fled amain to the sea and to their vessels When Brasidas perceived they were quitting the battle ments and had himself beheld the accident he led his army to the assault and immediately carrieth the fortress Such as were found within it were instantly destroyed And the Athenians in boats and ships after having thus abandoned it to the enemy crossed over to the Pallene But Brasidas for in Lecythus there is a temple of Miner va  and before he proceeded to the assault he had publicly proclaimed that a reward of thirty mina of silver should be given the man who first mounted the rampart concluding now that it was taken less by human than some other means reposited the thirty mina in the temple as an offering to the Goddess And having demolished Lecythus and cleared all â 9Q 15s sterling 388 THE PELOPOKNESIAN WAR away he consecrated the whole spot as sacred to her During the remainder of the winter he provided for the security of the places already in his possession and was planning future conquests And with the end of this winter the eighth year of the war expired YEAR IX VERY early in the spring of the ensuing summer the Athenians and Lacedaemonians made a truce to continue for a year The motives on the Athenian side were theseâ That  Brasidas might no longer seduce any of their towns to re  volt before they were enabled by this interval of leisure to  act against him  and besides that if they reaped any ad  vantage from this truce they might proceed to a farther  accommodation On the Lacedaemonian side it was imagined that  the Athenians were under such terrors as  in fact they were  and after a remission of calamities and  misfortunes would more eagerly come into some expe  dients for a future reconciliation  of course would deliver  up to them their citizens and come into a truce for a larger  term The recovery of these Spartans was a point on which thev laid a greater stress than ever even during the career of success which attended Brasidas They foresaw that in case he extended his conquests and even brought them to a balance with their foes of those they must for ever be deprived and the conflict then proceeding upon equal advantages the dangers also would be equal and the victory still in suspence Upon these motives both parties and their allies agreed to a truce of the following tenor   AS to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo it  seemeth good unto us that access be granted to all who  desire it without fraud and without fear according to  the laws of our country The same is approved of by  the Lacedxinonians and their allies now present and B IV TEAR IX â BEFORE CHRIST 423 389  they promise to send heralds on purpose and to spare  no pains to procure the consent of the Boeotians and  Phocians  As to the treasure belonging to the God care shall be  taken by us to find out those who have presumed to embez  zle it and this fairly and honestly according to the laws  of our country both by you and by us and by all others  who are willing  all proceeding respectively according to  the laws of their several constitutions  It hath farther seemed good to the Lacedaemonians and  their other allies if the Athenians agree to the truce that  both parties shall keep within their own bounds and hold  what we are at present respectively possessed of that is to  say  the former to keep in Coryphasium within the  mountains of Bouphras and Tomeus the latter in Cythera  without enlarging the communication for the procuring of  alliance neither on our side against you nor on your side  against us That those in Nisaea and Minoa pass not be  yond the road that leads from the gates of Megara adja  cent to the temple of Nisus towards the temple of Neptune  and from the temple of Neptune carrieth directly to the  bridge laid across to Minoa That neither the Megareans  nor their allies pass beyond the same road nor into the island  which the Athenians have taken both keeping within their  bounds and upon no occasion whatever to have any inter  course with one another The Megareans still to retain  what they possess in Troezen and whatever they hold by  compact with the Athenians  to have farther the free use  of the sea upon their own coasts and those of their al  liance  That the Lacedaemonians and allies shall not navigate  the sea in a long shipf but in any other

upon which their embassy should  be empowered to put an end to the war And  That the ambassadors who were now present in the as  sembly shall give a solemn ratification that they will  punctually

Niceratus Autocles the son of Tolmaeus Generals of the State In this manner was a suspension of arms concluded during which they continued without interruption to hold conferen ces with one another about settling the terms of a firm and lasting peace  During the interval these matters were thus in agitation Scione a city in the Pellene revolted from the Athenians to Brasidas The Scioneans indeed in the Pellene give out that they are of Peloponnesus  that their ancestors who settled in these other seats were driven there originally by a storm which in their return from Troy dispersed the Achaeans 392 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR When they had notified their revolt to him Brasidas passed over to Scione by night A party of his friends sailed be fore him in a trireme and he followed at some distance in a fly boat to the end that if he should fall in with any vessel larger than this boat the trireme might make head against her but if another trireme of equal strength should come up to them he judged she would neglect his smaller boat and would attack the ship which would give him time to Complete his passage in security When he was safe landed and had convened an asscm bly of the Scioneans he harangued them as had done before at Acanthus and Torone But he added farther that  they  were a people most deserving of applause since though  the communication with the Pallene as being an isthmus  was cut off by the Athenians who were masters of Poti  daea and they were by this means become islanders to all  intents and purposes yet they had without prior solicita  tion advanced boldly towards liberty nor could bear to lie in cowardly inactivity till necessity forced them to  such measures as tended to their manifest welfare This was ample proof that they were ready to undergo any  other the greatest perils to obtain the wished for settle  ment of their State He therefore regarded them as in  truth the most gallant friends of the Lacediemonians and  would in all respects do proper honour to their worth The Scioneans were elevated by these handsome com mendations All of them became full of spirits not even those excepted to whom the prior steps had been by no means agreeable They chearfully determined to sustain all future war and in every shape gave Brasidas honourable entertainment By public vote they placed upon his head a golden crown as the deliverer of Greece whilst every single Scionean was busy in adorning him with ribands and caressing him like a victor in the solemn games His stay at present was short he only placed a small party in B IV 393 YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423 the town to secure it and then repassed to Torone But soon after he transported thither the greater part of his force designing with the aid of the Scioneans to make attempts upon Mende and Potidaea He concluded however that the Athenians would lose no time in throwing in a succour as into an island and so he endeavoured to be beforehand with them He had already formed an intelligence to the prejudice of those cities to get them betrayed and he was now intent on executing his schemes against them But during this pause Aristonymus dispatched by the Athenians and Athenaeus by the Lacedaemonians to circulate the news arrive in a tri reme and notify to him the suspension of arms His forces were then transported back to Torone The persons employed communicated the articles of thcs truce to Brasidas and all the Lacedaemonian confederates in Thrace declared their acquiescence in what had been done Aristonymus was well satisfied in other respects but finding by computing the days that the revolt of the Scio neans was too late in point of time he protested against their being intitled to the benefit of the truce Brasidas on the other hand urged many arguments to prove it prior in time and refuseth to restore that city When therefore Aristonymus had reported this affair at Athens the Athe nians in an instant were ready to take up arms again for the reduction of Scione But the Lacedaemonians by an em bassy purposely dispatched remonstrated that  they should  regard such a proceeding as a breach of the truce and asserted  their right to the city as they reposed entire cre  dit on Brasidas  however they were ready to refer the  dispute to a fair arbitration The others refused to abide by so hazardous a decision but would recover it as soon as possible by force of arms They were irritated at the thought that persons seated as it were upon an island should presume to revolt from them and place such confidence in the unprofitable land power of the Lacedaemonians There 394 THE PELOPONNESIAK WAR was farther more truth in the date of the revolt than at pre sent the Athenians could evince  For in fact the Scioneans revolted two clays too late But at the instigation of Cleon they immediately passed a decree that  the Scioneans  should be reduced by force and then put to the sword And their attention was recalled from all other points to expedite the needful preparations for the execution of this In the mean time Mende also a city in the Pellene and a colony of Eretrians revolted from them Brasidas re ceived them into his protection thinking himself justified as they had openly come over to him in the time of truce Besides he had himself some reasons to recriminate upon the Athenians as violaters of the articles Upon this ac count the Mendeans were more encouraged to the step as they saw Brasidas was determined to support them  and were convinced by the affair of Scione that he would not abandon them The design farther had been originally set on foot by the yew  who though they delayed it for a time were resolved to push it into execution  for they appre hended that a discovery might prove fatal to themselves  and so forced the bulk of the people to act against their in clination But the Athenians who had a quick intelli gence of it were now exasperated much more than be fore and redoubled their preparations against both those places Brasidas who soon expected the arrival of their arma ment conveyed away the wives and children of the Scio neans and Mendeans to Olynthus of Chalcidica and had them escorted thither by five hundred heavy armed Pelo ponnesians and three hundred Chalcidic targeteers the commander of the whole escort was Polydamidas Those left behind expecting soon to be visited by the Athenians united their endeavours to get things in good order for their reception In the interval Brasidas and Perdiccas march together B IV YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423 a second time into Lyncus against Arribaeus They com manded their separate bodies one the forces of the Mace donians subject to himself and the heavy armed Grecians who dwelled amongst them the other the remainder of his own Peloponnesians reinforced by Chalcideans and Acanthi ans and quotas from other cities such as they were able to furnish The number of heavy armed Grecians computed together amounted to about three thousand The cavalry that attended both of Macedonians and Chalcideans was upon the whole little less than a thousand And the remaining crowd of Barbarians was great Breaking thus into the territory of Arribaeus and find ing the Lyncestians already in the field to oppose them they also sat down and faced them The infantry on each side were posted on an eminence and a plain lay between them This yielding room for the excursions of the horse the cavalry of both began a skirmish first But then Bra sidas and Perdiccas so soon as the Lyncestian heavy armed were moving first from the eminence to the aid of their ca valry and were ready to engage marched also down into the plain to oppose them where they charged and routed the Lyncestians A large number of the latter M ere slain the rest fled for preservation to the eminences and there stood quiet The victors after this having erected a trophy continued for two or three days in the same post waiting for the Illy rians who were coming up to join Perdiccas for a stipulated pay And then Perdiccas intended to advance farther against the villages of Arribaeus and sit no longer inactive Mende however was still uppermost in the care of Bra sidas â That place must be lost should the Athenians ar rive before it in the interval â The Illyrians besides were not yet come up He relished not the project and was more inclined to go back This engendered some disputes be tween them in the midst of which the news was brought that the Illyrians had deserted Perdiccas and joined them 396 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR selves with Arribaeus Upon which it was soon resolved be tween them to retire as there was reason to dread the ac cession of men so renowned for military valour Yet the disagreement between them prevented their fixing on any certain time for filing off Night came on in which the Macedonians and the crowd of Barbarians being struck with a sudden panic as numerous armies are apt to be without any certain cause and imagining that much larger numbers were coming against them than in fact was true and that they were only not near enough to attack them they in stantly took to their heels and hurried homewards Perdic cas for a time knew nothing of the matter and when in formed of it was compelled by the flying troops to dis lodge in their company without being able to get a sight of Brasidas For they were encamped at a distance from each other At the dawn of day Brasidas perceived that the Macedo nians had dislodged and that the Illyrians and Arribaeus were approaching to attack him He therefore drew his forces to gether forming a square with his heavy armed in the centre of which he disposed all the crowd of light armed and in this form he intended to retreat He appointed the youngest men to sally out in case the enemy any where attacked them  And he himself with a picked body of three hundred deter mined to bring up the rear in person in order to sustain and make good their retreat against the van of the enemy who should press upon their rear And before the enemy came near as well as the hurry would admit he animated his sol diers thus  DID I not suspect ye men of Peloponnesus that thus  abandoned as you are and ready to be attacked by Barba  rians and those numerous too you were in some conster  nation I should judge it needless to instruct or to encou  rage you But now against this desertion of our friends  and this multitude of our enemies I shall endeavour by a  short admonition and exhortation to raise within you the B IV 397 YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423 full grandeur of your souls Upon you it is incumbent to  behave with gallantry in every martial scene upon the ac  count not merely of acting in the open field in the presence  of so many confederates but of your own hereditary valour  Your souls ought not to be dismayed at a multitude of  foes since you were not born under governments where the  many control the ferv but where the few command the  many And the only means by which you acquired this  noble privilege was victorious perseverance in the fields of  battle Yet of these Barbarians your fears of whom are  the result of your ignorance you ought to be informed  from what you have learned yourselves in former conflicts  against them with the Macedonians as well as from what  I conjecture and what I depend upon from the accounts of  others that in action they will be by no means terrible  For when a hostile force though in reality weak carrieth  with it the appearance of strength a true discovery of its  state is no sooner obtained than it redoubleth the courage  of their opponents But men in whom valour is firmly im  planted none can assault with extraordinary spirit but such  as know them not These enemies of yours are dreadful  for a while merely till brought to trial Their multitude  rendereth them terrible to the sight the loudness of their  shouts is insupportable to the ear Their weapons bran  dished about and clashing in the air have a frightful and  menacing look But their spirit will not answer their shew  when charging against such as will sustain their shock  They are not drawn up with skill nor will they blush when compelled to quit their ground To fly from or to  fly after an enemy is equally a matter of glory to them   By such things is their valour established and rescued  from reproach For a battle where every combatant is  his own commander leaveth a specious and handsome  opportunity to each of providing for his safety They this moment judge it more safe to intimidate us at a distance Vol I S S 398 The peloponnesian war  than to run to the charge  for otherwise before this they  had attacked us And you plainly see that all the terror  which now runs before them will vanish at the onset as  terrible only to sight and hearing When therefore they  advance to the charge sustain it and repulse them and  when opportunity serveth fall back into your ranks again  with regularity and order You shall thus the sooner se  cure your retreat and be convinced for the time to come  that such rabbles to men who can stand the first fury of  their onset have only made at a distance and by their  pausing a vain and menacing parade of valour  but such  as will give ground and fly before them they pursue  with eagerness  and are excellently brave when there is no  resistance After this exhortation Brasidas caused his army to file leisurely off The Barbarians perceiving it pressed forward with great noise and clamour supposing that he fled and that they might intercept and cut him off But when the appointed parties sallied out from all quarters to receive them and Brasidas himself with his picked body sustained their charge they repulsed them at their first assault to the great surprize of the enemy Afterwards receiving every repeat ed attack they beat them off continually  and then during the intervals of pause retreated in good order till at length the bulk of the Barbarians discontinued their efforts in the plain against the Greeks under Brasidas and leaving only a part of their body to follow and annoy them in their retreat the rest wheeled speedily off to pursue the flying Macedoni ans and such as they overtook they slaughtered To the narrow pass farther between two hills which was the en trance into the territories of Arribaeus they hurried before in order to secure it knowing it to be the only rout by which Brasidas could retreat He was now drawing near it and in the most difficult part of the passage they were spreading themselves circularly to encompass him on all sides But Brasidas perceiving their design ordered the three hundred B IV YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423 399 that marched with him to advance full speed up that hill which he thought was most practicable and possess them selves of it and this with the utmost expedition each as he was able without regarding form and endeavour to drive the Barbarians thence who were already posting themselves upon it before they were joined by larger numbers and could invest him on all sides They did so attacked and made themselves masters of the hill which enabled the main body of the Grecians to march up without obstruction For now the Barbarians were thrown into consternation when their detachment had in this manner been beat off from the eminence And here they discontinued the pursuit imagin ing the enemy had already passed the frontier and secured their retreat Brasidas when once he was master of the eminences marched on without molestation and the very same day reached Arnissa the first place within the dominions of Per diccas His soldiers indeed who were exasperated against the Macedonians for having thus precipitately abandoned them whatever yokes of oxen they met with on their route or whatever baggage lay dropped upon the ground as such things it was likely should happen in a retreat by night and confused by fear the former they unyoked and cut to pieces and secreted the latter as lawful plunder Here Perdiccas first began to regard Brasidas as his enemy and ever after forced himself against his inclinations to hate the Peloponne sians  not indeed in his judgment preferring the Athenians but prevailed upon by the exigencies of his own affairs he cast about for the means of being again reconciled to the lat ter and disentangling himself from the former Brasidas having retreated through Macedonia to Torone findeth the Athenians already in possession of Mende Judg ing it impossible now to pass over into the Pallene and drive out the enemy he chose to remain there and securely to garrison Torone For during the time of the expedition into JL yncus the Athenians had put to sea against Mende and 400 THE PKI OPONNF SIAN WAR Stionc with the armament they had provided consisting of fifty ships ten of which were Chian of a thousand heavy armed of their own citizens six hundred archers a thousand mercenary Thracians and a body of targeteers furnished by their adjacent dependents  Nicias the son of Niceratus and Nicostratus the son of Diotrephes had the command of the whole They weighed from Potidaea and landing at the temple of Neptune marched directly for Mende The Men dans with their own force and three hundred Scioneans who were come to their succour and the Peloponnesian auxiliaries in all seven hundred heavy armed under the com mand of Polydamidas were encamped without the city upon a strong eminence Nicias taking with him a hundred and twenty light armed Methoneans and sixty picked men of the heavy armed Athenians and all the archers attempted to mount by a path that led up the eminence  but being galled by the enemy was not able to force the ascent Nicostratus with all the rest of the force having fetched a compass about in order to mourn in a remote quarter where the ascent was impracticable was quite thrown into disorder and thus the whole Athenian army narrowly escaped a total defeat As therefore the Mend ans and allies maintained their post the whole clay the Athenians drew off and encamped And when night came on the Mendeans withdrew into the city The next day the Athenians sailing round to the Scione side possessed themselves of the suburbs and spent the whole day in ravaging the country as not a soul sallied out to obstruct them For some bustles now were on foot in the city inclining to a sedition The three hundred Scioneans departed also in the succeeding night to their own home  And the day following Nicias advancing with a moiety of the force within their frontier ravaged the district of the Scioneans  whilst Nicostratus with the remainder sat down before the upper gates of Mende from whence the road leadcth to Potidaea But Polvdamidas as the MeatU ans B IV YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423  401 and the auxiliaries had chanced to ground their arms in this quarter within the wall drew them up in order of battle and exhorted the Mendeans to sally out It was replied in a seditious manner by one of the popular faction that  they would not sally and would have nothing to do with  the war At such a refusal Polydamidas having laid hands upon the person a tumult at once ensued in which the people ran immediately to arms and furious with anger made towards the Peloponnesians and all those of the op posite faction who sided with them They fell upon and routed them in an instant terrified as they were at this sud den assault and the gates were thrown open at the same time to the Athenians They supposed this insurrection had been made against them in consequence of some previous combination and as many as escaped out of the scuffle with life fled away to the citadel which was before in their possession But the Athenians for Nicias was now returned before the city bursting into Mende for it was not opened by composition with their whole united force plundered it as though taken by storm nay the generals had some diffi culty to restrain their soldiers from putting the inhabitants to the sword And after this they issued their commands to the Mendeans to continue their government in the usual form and to proceed judicially against those of their body whom they esteemed the principal authors of the revolt Those in the citadel they shut up with a wall extending on both sides to the sea and posted a guard to secure the blockade When in this manner they had possessed themselves of Mende they marched against Scione The inhabitants with the Peloponnesian aids coming out to receive them posted themselves on a strong eminence before the city  which un less the enemy could take it would infallibly prevent their walling them about But the Athenians stormed the post and after an engagement forced them to dislodge they formed 402 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR their camp and having erected a trophy got every thing in readiness for the circumvallation And no long time after whilst they were busied in this work the auxiliaries blocked up in the citadel at Mende having forced the guard posted near the sea get away by night and the major part of them escaping privily through the Athenian camp before Scione got safe into that town When the circumvallation of Scione was in hand Per diccas having dispatched a herald for the purpose to the Athenian generals strikes up a new treaty with the Athe nians He took this step out of pure enmity to Brasidas arising from the retreat out of Lyncus  and had begun from that time to act in their favour For it happened that at this very juncture of time Ischagoras the Lacedaemonian was bringing up by land a reinforcement to Brasidas But Perdiccas as well to oblige Nicias who as he had renewed his alliance commanded him to give some conspicuous proof of his attachment to the Athenians as to gratify his own resentment in refusing the Peloponnesians a passage through his dominions had gained the concurrence of his Thessalian friends since with the chief persons of that country he had ever been closely united by the hospitable ties and so stopped the reinforcement and their convoy that they durst not attempt to pass through Thessaly Ischagoras however and Aminias and Aristeus reached Brasidas in per son being commissioned by the Lacedaemonians to inspect the posture of their affairs and brought with them some young men of Sparta though contrary to their laws who were to take upon them the government of the cities which were no longer to be trusted to their former managers In effect Clearidas the son of Cleonymus they place as gover nor in Amphipolis and Epitelidas the son of Hegesander in Torone This same summer the Thebans demolished the walls of the Thespiensians alleging as the reason that they were B IV 403 YEAR IX BEFORE CHRIST 423 practising with the Athenians This demolition had ever been intended but its execution was now become more easy as the flower of their youth had perished in the late battle fought against the Athenians This summer also the temple of Juno at Argos was de stoyed by fire Chrysis the priestess had placed a burning torch too near the garlands and unawares fell fast asleep The flames broke out and were raging all around before they were perceived Chrysis indeed instantly for fear of the Argives flies away by night to Phlius They according to the law enacted for that purpose appointed another priestess in her room whose name was Phacinis Eight years of this war were elapsed and it was the middle of the ninth when Chrysis fled The circumvallation of Scione also was compleated about the close of this summer  and the Athenians leaving behind a sufficient body to guard it drew off the rest of their army In the ensuing winter things were quiet between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians because of the suspension of arms But the Mantin ans and Tegeatae and the con federates on both sides engaged at Laodicea of Orestis But the victory was doubtful Each party routed a wing of their opponents and both sides erected trophies and sent the spoils to Delphi Many however were slain on both sides and the battle was drawn the night putting an end to th contest The Tegeatae indeed passed the night upon tie field and immediately erected a trophy But the Mantiie ans withdrew to Bucolion and afterwards erected their ro phy in opposition In the close of this winter and when the spring al ready approaching Brasidas farther made an attempt upon Potidaea For having approached it in the night and ap plied his ladders so far he proceeded without causing an alarm For the bell being passed by during that interval before he that carried it forwards could return the moment 404 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR was seized for applying them However the alarm was taken before he could possibly scale upon which he drew off his army without loss of time not caring to wait for the return of day And thus ended the winter and with it the ninth year of this war of which Thucydides hath com piled the History â The officers regularly went their rounds to see that all the centinels were at their posts When they approached any of them a little bell was rung to which the centinel was to answer in proof that he was at his post and awake The interval between the rounds was so considerable and the vigilance of the centinel as the bell was just gone by might be so re laxed that Brasidas hoped he might execute his scheme   END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
