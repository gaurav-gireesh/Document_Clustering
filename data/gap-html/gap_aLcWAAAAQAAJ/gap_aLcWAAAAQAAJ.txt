    4 s3 â   1 THE HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE By EDWARD GIBBON Esq VOLUME THE FIRST Jam provides ammo velut qui pradmif littori radii inducti mare pedibui ingredi untur quicquid progredior in vastiorem me altitudinem ac velut profundum invehi et crescere pene opus quod prima quxque perficiendo minui videbatur LONDON PRINTED FOR W STRAHAN AND T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXVI I I ri  1 s i MI i  f      PREFACE IT is not my intention to detain the reader by ex patiating on the variety or the importance of the subject which I have undertaken to treat firtce the merit of the choice would serve to render the weak ness of the execution still more apparent and still less excusable But as I have presumed to lay before the Public a first volume only of the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire it will per haps be expected that I mould explain in a few words the nature and limits of my general plan The memorable series of revolutions which in the course of about thirteen centuries gradually un dermined and at length destroyed the solid fabric of Roman greatness may with some propriety be divided into the three following periods â º Vol I A L The PREFACE I The first of these periods may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines when the Ro man monarchy having attained its full strength and maturity began to verge towards its decline and will extend to the subversion of the western empire by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia the rude ancestors of the most polished nations of modern Europe This extraordinary revolution which sub jected Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror was completed about the beginning of the sixth century II The second period of the Decline and Fall of Rome may be supposed to commence with the reign of Justinian who by his laws as well as by his vic tories restored a transient splendor to the Eastern Empire It will comprehend the invasion of Italy by the Lombards the conquest of the Asiatic and African provinces by the Arabs who embraced the religion of Mahomet the revolt of the Roman people against the feeble princes of Constantinople and the eleva tion of Charlemagne who in the year eight hun  dredj PREFACE Â â dred established the second or German Empire of the west III The last and longest of these periods includes about seven centuries and a half from the revival of the Western Empire till the taking of Constantino ple by the Turks and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes who continued to assume the titles of CÃ sar and Augustus after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a iingle city in which the language as well as manners of the ancient Romans had been long since forgotten The writer who stiould undertake to relate the events of this period would find himself obliged to enter into the general history of the Crusades as far as they contributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire and he would scarcely be able to restrain his curiosity from making some inquiry into the state of the city of Rome during the darkness and confusion of the middle ages As I have ventured perhaps too hastily to commit to the press a work which in every sense of the A 2 word PREFACE word deserves the epithet of imperfect I eon fider myself as contracting an engagement to finish most probably in a second volume the first of these memorable periods and to deliver to the Public the complete history of the Decline and Fall of Rome from the age of the Antonines to the subversion of the Western Empire With regard to the subsequent periods though I may entertain some hopes I dare not presume to give any assurances The execution of such an extensive plan as I have traced out and which might perhaps be comprehended in about four volumes would fill up the long interval between ancient and modern history but it would require many years of health of leisure and of perseve rance Bentinck Street Feb i 1776 CONTENTS CHAP I The Extent and Military Force

77je Extent and Military Force of the Empire in the Age of the Antonines IN the second century of the Christian Ã ra the empire of Rome introduaion comprehended the fairest part of the earth and the most civi lized portion of mankind The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gra dually cemented the union of the provinces Their peaceful in habitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government Ai p 9 During a happy period of more than fourscore years the public 8Â administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Trajan Hadrian and the two Antonines It is the design of this and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous condition of their empire and afterwards from the death of Marcus Antoni Vol I B  nus THE DECLINE AND FALL Â uÂ to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of the earth Moderation The principal conquests of the Romans were atchieved under the of Augustas     republic and the emperors for the most part were satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the policy of the senate the active emulation of the consuls and the martial enthusiasm of die people The seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succeflion of triumphs but it was reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth and to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils In clined to peace by his temper and situation it was easy for him to discover that Rome in her present exalted situation had much less to hope than to fear from the chance of arms j and that in the prosecution of remote wars the undertaking became every day more difficult the event more doubtful and the possession more precarious and less beneficial The experience of Augustus added weight to these salutary reflections Instead of exposing his person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians he satisfied himself with the restitution of tbe standards and prisoners which were taken in the defeat of Crassus   His generals in the early part of his reign attempted the re duction of Ã thiopia and Arabia Felix They marched near a thousand miles to the south of the tropic but the heat of the climate loon repelled the invaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the expence and labour of the conquest The forests and morasses of Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbari ans who despised life when it was separated from freedom and though on the first attack they seemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power they soon ty a signal act of despair re Â gained their independence and reminded Augustus of the vicis 4  situde OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE situde of fortune  On the death of that emperor his testament was publickly read in the senate He bequeathed as a valuable legacy to his successors the advice of confining the empire within those limits which Nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries on the west the Atlantic ocean the Rhine and Danube on the north the Euphrates on the east and towards the south the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa 4 Happily for the repose of mankind the moderate system recom imitated by mended by the wisdom of Augustus was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure or in the exercise of tyranny the first CÃ sars seldom shewed themselves to the armies or to the provinces nor were they dis posed to suffer that those triumphs which their indolence neglected should be usurped by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants The military fame of a subject was considered as an insolent in vasion of the Imperial prerogative and it became the duty as well as interest of every Roman general to guard the frontiers entrusted to his care without aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished barbarians5 The only accession which the Roman empire received during Conquest of the first century of the Christian Ã ra wa6 the province of Britain she first ex In this single instance the successors of CÃ sar and Augustus were P11011 M  persuaded to follow the example of the former rather than the precept of the latter The proximity of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed to invite their arms the pleasing though doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice6 and as Britain was viewed in the light of a distinct and insulated world the conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system of continental measures After a war of about forty years under taken by the most stupid7 maintained by the most dissolute and terminated by the most timid of all the emperors the far greater part of the island submitted to the Roman yoke8 The B 2 various THE DECLINE AND FALL various tribes of Britons possessed valour without conduct and the love of freedom without the spirit of union They took up arms with savage fierceness they laid them down or turned them against each other with wild inconstancy and while they fought singly they were successively subdued Neither the fortitude of Caractacus nor the despair of Boadicea nor the fanaticism of the Druids could avert the slavery of their country or relist the steady progress of the Imperial generals who maintained the national glory when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or the most vicious of mankind At the very time when Domitian confined to his palace felt the terrors which he inspired his legions under the command of the virtuous Agricola defeated the collected force of the Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills and his fleets venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation displayed the Roman arms round every part of the island The conquest of Britain was considered as already atchieved and it was the design of Agricola to complete and ensure his success by the easy reduction of Ireland for which in his opinion one legion and a few auxiliaries were sufficient9 The western ifle might be improved into a valuable possession and the Britons would wear their chains with the less reluctance if the prospect and example of freedom was on every side removed from before their eyes But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal from tha government of Britain and for ever disappointed this rational though extensive scheme of conquest Before his depar ture the prudent general had provided for security as well as for dominion He had observed that the island is almost divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs or as they are now called the Firths of Scotland Across the narrow interval of about forty miles he had drawn a line of military stations which was after wards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius by a turf rampart erected on foundations of stone Â This wall of Antoninus at a small OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE small distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glas gow was fixed as the limit of the Roman province The native Caledonians preserved in the northern extremity of the island their wild independence for which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valour Their incursions were frequently re pelled and chastised but their country was never subdued The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the winter tem pest from lakes concealed in a blue mist and from cold and lonely heaths over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians Such was the state of the Roman frontiers and such the maxims of Conquest of _ Dacia the imperial policy from the death of Augustus to the accession of Tra second ex Jan That virtuous and active prince had received the education cepUon of a soldier and possessed the talents of a general  The peace ful system of his predecessors was interrupted by scenes of war and conquest and the legions after a long interval beheld a military emperor at their head The first exploits of Trajan were against the Dacians the most warlike of men who dwelt beyond the Danube and who during the reign of Domitian had insulted with impunity the Majesty of Rome To the strength and fierceness of barbarians they added a contempt for life which was derived from a warm persuasion of the immortality and transmigration of the soul Decebalus the Dacian King approved himself a rival not unworthy of Trajan nor did he despair of his own and the public fortune till by the confession of his enemies he had exhausted every resource both of valour and policy 6 This memorable war with a very short suspension of hostilities lasted five years and as the emperor could exert without controul the whole force of the state it was terminated by the absolute submission of the barbarians 7 The new province of Dacia which formed a se cond exception to the precept of Augustus was about thirteen hun 3 dredl 6 THE DECLINE AND FALL dred miles in circumference Its natural bqundaries were the Niester the Teyss or Tibiscus the Lower Danube and the Euxine Sea The vestiges of a military road may still be traced from the banks of the Danube to the neighbourhood of Bender a place famous in modern history and the actual frontier of the Turkish and Ruffian empires s Conquests of Trajan was ambitious of fame and as long as mankind shall Trajan in the  â ž east continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of the most exalted characters The praises of Alexander transmitted by a succession of poets and historians had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan Like him the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east but he lamented with a sigh that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Philip Yet the success of Trajan however transient was rapid and specious The degenerate Parthians broken by intestine discord fled before his arms He descended the river Tigris in triumph from the moun tains of Armenia to the Persian gulph He enjoyed the honour of being the first as he was the last of the Roman generals who ever navigated that remote sea His fl eets ravaged the coasts of Arabia and Trajan vainly flattered himself that he was approach ing towards the confines of India  Every day the astonished senate received the intelligence of new names and new nations that acknowledged his sway They were informed that the Kings of Bosphorus Colchos Iberia Albania Osrhoene and even the Par thian monarch himself had accepted their diadems from the hands of the emperor that the independent tribes of the Median and Carduchian hills had implored his protection and that the rich countries of Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria were reduced in to the state of provinces But the death of Trajan soon clouded the splendid prospect and it was justly to be dreaded that so many distant OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 7 distant nations would throw off the unaccustomed yoke when they were no longer restrained by the powerful hand which had imposed it It was an ancient tradition that when the Capitol was founded by Resigned by one of the Roman kings the god Terminus who presided over Adrian boundaries and was represented according to the fashion of that age by a large stone alone among all the inferiour deities refused to yield his place to Jupiter himself A favourable inference was drawn from his obstinacy which was imterpreted by the augurs as a sure presage that the boundaries of the Roman power would never recede  Daring many ages the prediction as it is usual con tributed to its own accomplishment But though Terminus had resisted the majesty of Jupiter he submitted to the authority of the emperor Hadrian15 The resignation of all the eastern conquests of Trajan was the first measure of his reign He restored to the Parthians the election of an independent Sovereign withdrew the Roman garrisons from the provinces of Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria and in compliance with the precept of Augustus once more established the Euphrates as the frontier of the empire 4 Censure which arraigns the public actions and the private motives of princes has ascribed to envy a conduct which might be attri buted to the prudence and moderation of Hadrian The various character of that emperor capable by turns of the meanest and the most generous sentiments may afford some colour to the sus picion It was however scarcely in his power to place the superiority of his predecessor in a more conspicuous light than by thus confessing himself unequal to the task of defending the conquests of Trajan The martial and ambitious spirit of Trajan formed a very sin Contrast os gular contrast with the moderation of his successor The restless Antoninus activity of Hadrian was not less remarkable when compared with Plu the gentle repose of Antoninus Pius The life of the former was almost THE PECLINE AND FALL and the two Antonines almost a perpetual journey and as he possessed the various talents of the soldier the statesman and the scholar he gratified his cu riosity in the discharge of his duty Careless of the difference of seasons and of climates he marched on foot and bare headed over the snows of Caledonia and the sultry plains of the Upper Egypt nor was there a province of the empire which in the course of his reign was not honoured with the presence of the monarch s But the tranquil life of Antoninus Pius was spent in the bosom of Italy and during the twenty three years that he directed the public administration the longest journies of that amiable prince were no more than from his palace in Rome to the retirement of his Lanuvian Villal5 ImalmT Nowithstanding this difference in their personal conduct the general system of Augustus was equally adopted and uniformly pursued by Hadrian and by the two Antonines They persisted in the design of maintaining the dignity of the empire without at tempting to enlarge its limits By every honourable expedient they invited the friendship of the barbarians and endeavoured to convince mankind that the Roman power raised above the tempta tion of conquest was actuated only by the love of order and justice During a long period of forty three years their virtuous labours were crowned with success and if we except a few flight hostili ties that served to exercise the legions of the frontier the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the fair prospect of universal peace 11 The Roman name was revered among the most re mote nations of the earth The fiercest barbarians frequently sub mitted their differences to the arbitration of the emperor and we are informed by a cotemporary historian that he had seen am bassadors who were refused the honour which they came to solicit of being admitted into the rank of subjectsl8 Defensive The terror of the Roman arms added weight and dignity to the MsAwoni moderation of the emperors They preserved peace by a constant nus  preparation OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 9 naia preparation for war and while justice regulated their conduct they n0Jv ar announced to the nations on their confines that they were as little cas Aatoni disposed to endure as to offer an injury The military strength which it had been sufficient for Hadrian and the elder Antoninus to display was exerted against the Parthians and the Germans by the emperor Marcus The hostilities of the barbarians provoked the resentment of that philosophic monarch and in the prosecution of a just defence Marcus and his generals obtained many signal victories both on the Euphrates and on the DanubeThe mi litary establishment of the Roman empire which thus assured either its tranquillity or success will now become the proper and important object of our attention In the purer ages of the commonwealth the use of arms Military esta r 0 blithment of was reserved for those ranks of citizen s who had a country to love the Roman i  â  emperors a property to defend and some share in enacting those laws which it Was their interest as well as duty to maintain But in pro portion as the publ c freedom was lost in extent of conquest War Was gradually improved into an art And degraded into a trade Â The legions themselves even at the time when they were recruited in the most distant provinces consisted of Roman citizens That distinction was generally considered either as a legal qualification or as a proper recompence for the soldier but a more serious regard was paid to the essential merit of age strength and military stature In all leviesi a just preference was given to the climates of the North over those of the South  the race of men born to the exercise of arms was sought for in the country rather than in cities and it was very reasonably presumed that the hardy occupations of smiths carpenters and huntsmen would supply more vigour and re solution than the sedentary trades vVhich are employed in the service of luxury J After every qualification of property had been laid aside the armies of the Roman emperors Were still commanded for the most part by officers of a liberal birth and education j but the com Vol I C mon THE DECLINE AND FALL mon soldiers like the mercenary troops of modern Europe wer drawn from the meanest and very frequently from the most pro fligate of mankind The ancient virtue of patriotism is derived from a strong fense of our own interest in the preservation and prosperity of the free government of which we are members Such a sentiment which had rendered the legions of the republic almost invincible could make but a very feeble impression on the mercenary servants of a despotic prince and it became necessary to supply that defect by other motives of a different but very forcible nature honour and religion The peasant or mechanic imbibed the useful prejudice that he was advanced to the more dignified profession of arms in which his rank and reputation would depend on his own valour and that although the prowess of a private soldier might escape the notice of fame it would be in his power to confer glory or disgrace on the company the legion or even the army to whose honours he was associated On his first entrancg into the service an oath was administered to him with every circumstance of solemnity He promised never to desert his standard to submit his own will to the commands of his leaders and to sacrifice his life for the safety of the emperor and the empire  The attachment of the Roman troops to their standards was inspired by the united influence of re ligion and of honour The golden  eagle which glittered in the front of the legion was the object of their fondest devotion j nor was it esteemed less impious than it was ignominious to abandon that sacred ensign in the hour of danger These motives which de rived their strength from the imagination were enforced by fears and hopes of a more substantial kind Regular pay occasional do natives and a stated recompence after the appointed term of service alleviated the hardships of the military life55 whilst on the other hand it was impossible for cowardice or disobedience to escape the severest punishment The centurions had a right to punish with blows OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE u l lows the generals with death and it was an inflexible maxim of Roman discipline that a good soldier should dread his officers far more than the enemy From such laudable arts did the valour of the Imperial troops receive a degree of firmness and docility unattain able by the impetuous and irregular passions of barbarians And yet so sensible were the Romans of the imperfection of va Exercises lour without skill and practice that in their language the name of an army was borrowed from the word which signified exercise fi Military exercises were the important and unremitted object of their discipline The recruits and young soldiers were constantly trained both in the morning and in the evening nor was age or knowledge allowed to excuse the veterans from the daily repetition of what they had completely learnt Large sheds were erected in the win ter quarters of the troops that their useful labours might not receive any interruption from the most tempestuous weather and it was carefully observed that the arms destined to this imitation of war should be of double the weight which was required in real action 7 It is not the purpose of this work to enter into any mi nute description of the Roman exercises We shall only remark that they comprehended whatever could add strength to the body activity to the limbs or grace to the motions The soldiers were â diligently instructed to march to run to leap to swim to carry heavy burdens to handle every species of arms that was used either for offence or for defence either in distant engagement or in a closer onset to form a variety of evolutions and to move to the found of flutes in the pyrrhic or martial dance s In the midst of peace the Roman troops familiarised themselves with the practice of war and it is prettily remarked by an ancient historian who had fought against them that the effusion of blood was the only circumstance which distinguished a field of battle from a field of exercise  It was the policy of the ablest generals and even of the emperors themselves to encourage these military studies by their C 2 presence THE DECLINE AND FALL presence and example and we are informed that Hadrian as well as Trajan frequently condescended to instruct the unexperienced soldiers to reward the diligent and sometimes to dispute with them the prize of superior strength or dexterity40 Under the reigns of those princes the science of tactics was cultivated with suc cess and as long as the empire retained any vigour their military instructions were respected as the most perfect model of Roman discipline The legions Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the service peroT n any alterations and improvements The legions described by Polybius and commanded by the Scipios differed very materially from those which atchieved the victories of Caesar or defended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines The constitution of the Imperial legion may be described in a few words 4 The heavy armed infantry which composed its principal strength 4J was di vided into ten cohorts and fifty five companies under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions The first cohort which always claimed the post of honour and the custody of the eagle was formed of eleven hundred and five soldiers the most approved for valour and fidelity The remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five hundred and fifty five and the whole body of legionary infantry amounted to six thousand one hundred men Arms Their arms were uniform and admirably adapted to the nature of their service an open helmet with a lofty crest a breast plate or coat of mail j greaves on their legs and an ample buckler on their left arm The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure four sect in length and two and a half in breadth framed of a light wood covered with a bull s hide and strongly guarded with plates of brass Besides a lighter spear the legionary soldier grasped in his right hand the formidable pilumt a ponderous javelin whose utmost length was about six feet and which was terminated by a massy triangular point of steel of eighteen inches4 This instrument was OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE was indeed much inferior to our modern fire arms since it was ex hausted by a single discharge at the distance of only ten or twelve paces Yet when it was launched by a firm and skilful hand there was not any cavalry that durst venture within its reach nor any shield or corslet that could sustain the impetuosity of its weight As soon as the Roman had darted his pilum he drew his sword and rushed forwards to close with the enemy It was a short well tempered Spanish blade that carried a double edge and was alike suited to the purpose of striking or of pushing but the soldier was always instructed to prefer the latter use of his weapon as his own body remained less exposed whilst he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his adversary 4V The legion was usually drawn up eight deep and the regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well as ranks 6 A body of troops habituated to preserve this open order in a long front and a rapid charge found them selves prepared to execute every disposition which the circumstances of war or the skill of their leader might suggest The soldier possessed a free space for hip arms and motions and sufficient inter vals were allowed through which seasonable reinforcements might be introduced to the relief of the exhausted combatants 47 The tactics of the Greeks and Macedonians were formed on very differ ent principles The strength of the phalanx depended on sixteen ranks of long pikes wedged together in the closest array But it was soon discovered by reflection as well as by the event that the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend with the activity of the legion  The cavalry without which the force of the legion would have remained imperfect was divided into ten troops or squadrons the first as the companion of the first cohort consisted of an hun dred and thirty two men whilst each of the other nine amounted only to sixty six The entire establishment formed a regiment if we may use the modern expression of seven hundred and twenty six horse naturally connected with its respective legion but occa sionally THE DECLINE AND FALL tonally separated to act in the line and to compose a part of the â wings of the army sÂ The cavalry of the emperors was no longer composed like that of the ancient republic of the noblest youths of Rome and Italy who by performing their military service on horseback prepared themselves for the offices of senator and consul and solicited by deeds of valour the future suffrages of their countrymen 51 Since the alteration of manners and government â the most wealthy of the equestrian order were engaged in the admi nistration of justice and of the revenue51 and whenever they embraced the profession of arms they were immediately intrusted with a troop of horse or a cohort of footTrajan and Hadrian formed their cavalry from the same provinces and the fame class of their subjects which recruited the ranks of the legion The horses were bred for the most part in Spain or Cappadocia The Roman troopers despised the complete armour with which the cavalry of the East was encumbered Their more useful arms consisted in a helmet an oblong shield light boots and a coat of mail A ja velin and a long broad sword were their principal weapons of offence The use of lances and of iron maces they seem to have bor rowed from the barbarians I The safety and honour of the empire was principally intrusted to the legions but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every useful instrument of war Considerable levies were regularly made â among the provincials who had not yet deserved the honourable distinction of Romans Many dependent princes and communities dispersed round the frontiers were permitted for a while to hold their freedom and security by the tenure of military service 5S Even select troops of hostile barbarians were frequently compelled or persuaded to consume their dangerous valour in remote climates and for the benefit of the state 5Â All these were included under the general name of auxiliaries and however they might vary ac cording to the difference of times and circumstances their numbers were OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE were seldom much inferior to those of the legions themselves S Among the auxiliaries the bravest and most faithful bands were placed under the command of prefects and centurions and severely trained in the arts of Roman discipline but the far greater part rer tained those arms to which the nature of their country or their early habits of life more peculiarly adapted them By this in stitution each legion to whom a certain proportion of auxiliaries was allotted contained within itself every species of lighter troops and of missile weapons and was capable of encountering every na tion with the advantages of its respective arms and discipline S Nor was the legion destitute of what in modern language would be styled a train of artillery It consisted in ten military engines Artillery of the largest and fifty five of a smaller size but all of which either in an oblique or horizontal manner discharged stones and darts with irresistible violence â The camp of a Roman legion presented the appearance of a for Encamp tisied city60 As soon as the space was marked out the pioneers ment carefully levelled the ground and removed every impediment that might interrupt its perfect regularity Its form was an exact quadrangle and we may calculate that a square of about seven hundred yards was sufficient for the encampment of twenty thou sand Romans though a similar number of our own troops would expose to the enemy a front of more than treble that extent In the midst of the camp the prÃ torium or general s quarters rose above the others the cavalry the infantry and the auxiliaries occupied their respective stations the streets were broad and perfectly straight and a vacant space of two hundred feet was left on all sides between the tents and the rampart The rampart itself was usually twelve feet high armed with a line of strong and intricate palisadesÂ and defended by a ditch of twelve feet in depth as well as in breadth This important labour was performed by the hands of the legionaries themselves to whom the use of the spade and the pick axe was no 2 less i6 THE DECLINE AND FALL less familiar than that of the sword or pilum nor is there an â circumstance which more fully demonstrates the excellence of the Roman discipline Active valour may often be the present of na ture but patient diligence can be the fruit only of reflection and habit  March Whenever the trumpet gave the signal of departure the camp was almost instantly broke up and the troops fell into their ranks without delay or confusion Besides their arms which the legion aries scarcely considered as an encumbrance they were laden with their kitchen furniture the instruments of fortification and the provision of many days  Under this weight which would oppress the delicacy of a modern soldier they were trained by a regular step to advance in about six hours near twenty miles 6 On the appearance of an enemy they threw aside their baggage and by easy and rapid evolutions converted the column of march into an order of battle6 The lingers and archers skirmished in the front the auxiliaries formed the first line and were seconded or sustained by the strength of the legions The cavalry covered the flanks and the military engines were placed in the rear Nambfrand Such were the arts of war by which the Roman emperors de disposition of fen ieci their extensive conquests and preserved a military spirit at the legions  4 a time when every other virtue was almost extinguished by the progress of despotism Tf in the consideration of their armies we pass from their discipline to their numbers we shall not find it easy to appreciate them with any tolerable accuracy We may compute however that the legion which was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and thirty one Romans might with its attendant auxiliaries amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men The peace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades and most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and seventy five thousand men Instead of being confined within the walls of 4 fortified OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ij fortified cities which the Romans considered as the refuge of weak ness or pusillanimity the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers and along the frontiers of the barbarians As their stations for the most part remained fixed and permanent we may venture to describe the distribution of the troops Three legioas were sufficient for Britain The principal strength lay upon the Rhine and Danube and consisted of sixteen legions in the follow ing proportions two in the Lower and three in the Upper Germany one in RhÃ tia one in Noricum four in Pannonia three in MÃ sia and two in Dacia The defence of the Euphrates was intrusted to eight legions six of whom were placed in Syria and the other two in Cappadocia With regard to Egypt Africa and Spain as they were far removed from any important scene of war a single legion maintained the domestic tranquillity of each of those great provinces Even Italy was not left destitute of a military force Above twenty thousand chosen soldiers distinguished by the titles of City Cohorts and Praetorian Guards watched over the safety of the monarch and the capital As the authors of almost every revolution that distracted the empire the prÃ torians will very soon and very loudly demand our attention but in their arms and institutions we cannot find any circumstance which discriminated them from the legions unless it were a more splendid appearance and a less rigid discipline 6j The navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to Navy their greatness but it was fully sufficient for every useful purpose of government The ambition of the Romans was confined to the land nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the enter prising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre of Car thage and even of Marseilles to enlarge the bounds of the world and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean To the Romans the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of curiosity 66 the whole extent of the Mediterranean after the destruction of Carthage and the extirpation of the pirates was included within their pro Vol I D vinces 18 THE DECLINE AND FALL vinces The policy of the emperors was directed only to pre serve the peaceful dominion of that sea and to protect the com merce of their subjects With those views of moderation Au gustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most convenient ports of Italy the one at Ravenna on the Adriatic the other at Misenum in the bay of Naples Experience seems at length to have convinced the ancients that as soon as their gallies exceeded two or at the most three ranks of oars they were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service Augustus himself in the victory of Actium had seen the superiority of his own light frigates they were called Liburnians over the lofty but unwieldy castles of his rival67 From these Liburnians he composed the two fleets of Ravenna and Misenum destined to command the one the eastern the other the western division of the Mediterranean and to each of the squadrons he attached a body of several thousand marines Besides these two ports which may be considered as the principal feats of the Roman navy a very considerable force was stationed at Frejus on the coast of Provence and the Euxine was guarded by forty stiips and three thousand soldiers To all these we add the fleet which preserved the communication between Gaul and Britain and  a great number of vessels constantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube to harass the country or to intercept the passage of the barbarians 6S Such is the general picture of the Im perial forces the cavalry as well as infantry of the legions the auxiliaries the guards and the navy And yet the most liberal computation that reason can justify will not allow us to fix the Amount of entire establishment by sea and by land at more than four hundred the whole e j gfty thousand men a military power which however formi dable it may seem was equalled by a monarch of the last century whose kingdom was confined within a single province of the Roman empire 9 We OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 19 We have attempted to explain the spirit which moderated and VleÂ r of the    provinces 01 the strength which supported the power of Hadrian and the Anto the Roman  r r empire nines We shall now endeavour with clearness and precision to describe the provinces once united under their sway but at present divided into so many independent and hostile states Spain the western extremity of the empire of Europe and of the Spain ancient world has in every age invariably preserved the same na tural limits the PyrenÃ an mountains the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean That great peninsula at present so unequally divided between two sovereigns was distributed by Augustus into three provinces Lusitania BÃ tica and Tarraconensis The king dom of Portugal has succeeded to the warlike country of the Lu sitanians since the loss sustained by the former on the side of the East is compensated by an accession of territory towards the North The confines of Grenada and Andalusia correspond with those of ancient Baetica The remainder of Spain Gallicia and the Asturias Biscay and Navarre Leon and the two Castilles Murcia Va lencia Catalonia and Arragon all contributed to form the third and most considerable of the Roman governments which from the name of its capital was styled the Province of Tarragona 7Â Of the native barbarians the Celtiberians were the most powerful as the Cantabrians and Asturians proved the most obstinate Confident in the strength of their mountains they were the last who sub mitted to the arms of Rome and the first who threw off the yoke of the Arabs Ancient Gaul as it contained the whole country between the Gaul Pyrenees the Alps the Rhine and the Ocean was of greater ex tent than modern France To the dominions of that powerful monarchy with its recent acquisitions of Alsace and Lorraine we must add the dutchy of Savoy the cantons of Switzerland the four electorates of the Rhine Liege Luxemburgh Hainault Flanders and Brabant When Augustus gave laws to the conquests of his D 2 father THE DECLINE AND FALL father ha introduced a division of Gaul equally adapted to the progrese of the legions to the course of the rivers and to the principal national distinctions that before the conquest had comprehended above an hundred independent states7 The sea coast of the Mediterranean Languedoc Provence and Dauphine received the provincial appellation from the colony of Narbonne The government of Aquitaiae was extended from the Pyrenees to the Loire Between the Loire and the Seine was situate the Celtic Gaul which soon borrowed a new denomination from the celehrated colony of Lugdunum or Lyon The Belgic lay beyond the Seine and in more ancient times had been bounded only by the Rhine but a little before the age of CÃ sar the Germans abusing their su periority of valour had occupied a considerable portion of the Belgic territory The Roman conquerors very eagerly embraced so flattering a circumstance and the Gallic frontier of the Rhine from Basil to Leyden received the pompous names of the Upper and the Lower Germany 7 Such under the reign of the Antonines were the six provinces of Gaul the Narbonnese Aquitaine the Celtic or Lyonnese the Belgic and the two Germanies Britain We have already had occasion to mention the conquest of Britain and to fix the boundary of the Roman province in this island It comprehended all England Wales and the lowland counties of Scotland as far as the Firths of Dunbarton and Edin burgh Before Britain lost her freedom it was irregularly divided between thirty tribes of barbarians of whom the most considerable were the BelgÃ in the West the Brigantes in the North the Silures in South Wale8 and the Iceni in Norfolk and Suffolk 7 As far as we can either trace or credit the resemblance of manners â and language Spain Gaul and Britain were peopled by the fame hardy race of savages Before they yielded to the Roman arms they often disputed the field and often renewed the contest After their submission they constituted the western division of the Eu ropean OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 21 ropean provinces which extended from the columns of Hercules to the wall of Antoninus and from the mouth of the Tagus to the sources of the Rhine and Danube Before the Roman conquest the country which is now called Italy Lombardy was not considered as a part of Italy It had been occupied by a powerful colony of Gauls who settling themselves along the banks of the Po from Piedmont to Romagna carried their arms and their name from the Alps to the Apenninc The Ligurians dwelt on the rocky coast which now forms the republic of Genoa Venice was yet unborn but the territories of that state which lie to the east of the Adige were inhabited by the Vene tians  The middle part of the peninsula that now composes the chitchy of Tuscany and the ecclesiastical state was the ancient seat of the Etruscans and Umbrians to the former of whom Italy was indebted for the first rudiments of a civilized life 7J The Ty ber rolled at the foot of the seven hills of Rome and the country of the Sabines the Latins and the Volsci from that river to the frontiers of Naples was the theatre of her infant victories On that celebrated ground the first consuls deserved triumphs their successors adorned villas and their posterity have erected con vents 4 Capua and Campania possessed the immediate territory of Naples the rest of the kingdom was inhabited by many warlike nations the Marsi the Samnites the Apulians and the Luca Â nians and the sea coasts had been covered by the flourishing colo nies of the Greeks We may remark that when Augustus divided Italy into eleven regions the little province of Istria was annexed to that feat of Roman sovereignty77 The European provinces of Rome were protected by the course The Danube of the Rhine and the Danube The latter of those mighty streams nd n yrian o J 7 frontier which rises at the distance of only thirty miles from the former flows above thirteen hundred miles for the most part to the south east collects the tribute of sixty navigable rivers and is at length through 82 THE DECLINE AND FALL through fix mouths received into the Euxine which appears scarcely equal to such an accession of waters 1 The provinces of the Danube soon acquired the general appellation of Illyricum or the Ulyrian frontier79 and were esteemed the most warlike of the empire but they deserve to be more particularly considered under the names of RhÃ tia Noricum Pannonia Dalmatia Dacia MÃ sia Thrace Macedonia and Greece RhÃ tia The province of RhÃ tia which soon extinguished the name of the Vindelicians extended from the summit of the Alps to the banks of the Danube from its source as far as its conflux with the Inn The greatest part of the flat country is subject to the elector of Bavaria the city of Augfburgh is protected by the con stitution of the German empire j the Grisons are safe in their mountains and the country of Tirol is ranked among the numerous provinces of the house of Austria Noricum and The wide extent of territory which is included between the Inn Pannonw  Danube and the Save Austria Styria Carinthia Carniola the Lower Hungary and Sclavonia was known to the ancients un der the names of Noricum and Pannonia In their original state of independence their fierce inhabitants were intimately connected Under the Roman government they were frequently united and they still remain the patrimony of a single family They now contain the residence of a German prince who styles himself Emperor of the Romans and form the center as well as strength of the Austrian power It may not be improper to observe that if we except Bohemia Moravia the northern slcirts of Austria and a part of Hungary between the Teyss and the Danube all the other domi nions of the house of Austria were situate within the limits of the Roman empire Dalmatia Dalmatia to which the name of Illyricum more properly belonged was a long but narrow tract between the Save and the Adriatic The best part of the sea coast which still retains its ancient ap pellation OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 2 pellation is a province of the Venetian state and the feat of the little republic of Ragusa The inland parts have assumed the Scia vonian names of Bosnia and Croatia the latter obeys an Austrian governor the former a Turkisti pasha but the whole country is still infested by tribes of barbarians whose savage independence describes the doubtful limit of the Christian and Mahometan power  After the Danube had received the waters of the Teyss and the Ã fiaand Save it acquired at least among the Greeks the name of Ister  It formerly divided MÃ sia and Dacia the latter of which as we have already seen was a conquest of Trajan and the only pro vince beyond the river If we inquire into the present state of those countries we shall find that on the left hand of the Danube Temeswar and Transylvania are annexed after many revolutions to the crown of Hungary whilst the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia acknowledge the supremacy of the Ottoman Porte On the right hand of the Danube MÃ sia which during the middle ages was broken into the barbarian kingdoms of Servia and Bul garia is again united in Turkish flavery The appellation of Roumelia which is still bestowed by the Thrace Ma Turks on the extensive countries of Thrace Macedonia and Greece Â doniaand Greece preserves the memory of their ancient state under the Roman empire In the time of the Antonines the martial Thrace from the mountains of Haemus and Rhodope to the Bosphorus and the Hellespont had assumed the form of a province Notwith standing the change of masters and of religion the new city of Rome which Gonstantine founded on the banks of the Bosphorus has ever since remained the capital of a great monarchy The Kingdom of Macedonia that under the reign of Alexander had given laws to Asia derived more solid advantages from the policy of the two Philips and with its dependencies of Epirus aod Theffaly extended from the Ã gean to the Ionian sea Whem 1 war 24 THE DECLINE AND FALL we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos of Sparta and Athens we can scarcely persuade ourselves that so many immortal repub lics of ancient Greece were lost in a single province of the Roman empire which from the superior influence of the AchÃ an league was usually denominated the province of Achaia Asia Minor Such was the state of Europe under the Roman Emperors The provinces of Asia without excepting the transient conquests of Trajan are all comprehended within the limits of the Turkish power But instead of following the arbitrary divisions of despotism and ignorance it will be safer for us as well as more agreeable to observe the indelible characters of nature The name of Asia Minor is attributed with some propriety to the peninsula which confined between the Euxine and the Mediterranean advances from the Euphrates towards Europe Its principal division westward of mount Taurus and the river Halys was dignified by the Romans with the exclusive title of Asia The jurisdiction of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of Troy Lydia and Phrygia the maritime countries of the Pamphylians Lycians and Carians and the Grecian colonies of Ionia which equalled in arts though not in arms the glory of their parent The kingdoms of Bi thynia and Pontus possessed the northern side of the peninsula from Constantinople to Trebizond On the opposite side the province of Cilicia was terminated by the mountains of Syria the inland country separated from the Roman Asia by the river Halys and from Armenia by the Euphrates had once formed the independ ent kingdom of Cappadocia In this place we may observe that the northern shores of the Euxine beyond Trebizond in Asia and beyond the Danube in Europe acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperors and received at their hands either tributary princes or Roman garrisons Budzak Crim Tartary Circaffia and Min grelia are the modern appellations of those savage countries  3 Under OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Under the successors of Alexander Syria was the feat of the sr 3 p Å  nitia and SeleucidÃ who reigned over Upper Asia till the successful revolt Palestine of the Parthians confined their dominions between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean When Syria became subject to the Romans it formed the eastern frontier of their empire nor did that province in its utmost latitude know any other bounds than the moun tains of Cappadocia to the north and towards the south the con sines of Egypt and the Red Sea PhÅ nicia and Palestine were sometimes annexed to and sometimes separated from the jurisdiction of Syria The former of these was a narrow and rocky coast the latter was a territory scarcely superior to Wales either in fertility or extent Yet PhÅ nicia and Palestine will for ever live in the memory of mankind since America as well as Europe has received letters from the one and religion from the other8 A sandy desert skirted along the doubtful confine of Syria from the Eu phrates to the Red Sea The wandering life of the Arabs was in separably connected with their independence and wherever on some spots less barren than the rest they ventured to form any settled habitations they soon became subjects of the Roman empire 8 The geographers of anticmity have sometimes hesitated to what Egypt portion of the globe they should ascribe Egypt8J Its situation is included within the immense peninsula of Africa but it is accessible only on the side of Asia whose revolutions in almost every period of history Egypt has humbly obeyed A Roman prÃ fect was seated on the splendid throne of the Ptolemies and the iron sceptre of the Mamalukes is now in the hands of a Turkish pastia The Nile flows down the country above five hundred miles from the tropic of Cancer to the Mediterranean and marks on either side the extent of fertility by the measure of its inundations Cyrene situate towards the west and along the sea coast was first a Greek Vol I E colony THE DECLINE AND FALL colony afterwards a province of Egypt and is now lost in the desert of Barca From Cyrene to the Ocean the coast of Africa extends above fif teen hundred miles yet so closely is it presled between the Me diterranean and the Sahara or sandy desert that its breadth seldom exceeds fourscore or an hundred miles The eastern division was considered by the Romans as the more peculiar and proper pro vince of Africa Till the arrival of the PhÅ nician colonies that fertile country was inhabited by the Libyans the most savage of mankind Under the immediate jurisdiction of Carthage it became the center of commerce and empire but the republic of Carthage is now degenerated into the feeble and disorderly states of Tripoli and Tunis The military government of Algiers oppresses the wide extent Qf Numidia as it was once united under Massanissa and Jugurtha but m the time of Augustus the limits of Numidia were contracted and at least two thirds of the country acquiesced in the name of Mauritania with the epithet of GÃ sariensis The genuine Mau ritania or country of the Moors which from the ancient city of Tingi or Tangier was distinguished by the appellation of Tingi tana is represented by the modern kingdom of Fez Salle on the Ocean so infamous at present for its piratical depredations was no ticed by the Romans as the extreme object of their power and almost of their geography A city of their foundation may still be discovered near Mequinez the residence of the barbarian whom we condescend to style the Emperor of Morocco but it does not appear that his more southern dominions Morocco itself and Segelmessa were ever comprehended within the Roman province The western parts of Africa are intersected by the branches of mount Atlas a name so idly celebrated by the fancy of poets 8 s but which is now diffused aver the immense occean that rolls between the ancient and the new continent 7 5 Having OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Â 7 Having now finished the circuit of the Roman empire we may The Medi Â terraneati observe that Africa is divided from Spain by a narrow strait of with its about twelve miles through which the Atlantic flows into the Medi terranean The columns of Hercules so famous among the ancients were two mountains which seemed to have been torn asunder by some convulsion of the elements and at the foot of the European mountain the fortress of Gibraltar is now seated The whole ex tent of the Mediterranean Sea its coasts and its islands were com prized within the Roman dominion Of the larger islands the two Baleares which derive their names of Majorca and Minorca from their respective size are subject at present the former to Spain the latter to Great Britain It is easier to deplore the fate than to describe the actual condition of Corsica Two Italian sovereigns assume the regal title from Sardinia and Sicily Crete or Candia with Cyprus and most of the smaller islands of Greece and Asia have been subdued by the Turkish arms whilst the little rock of Malta defies their power and has emerged under the government of its military Order into fame and opulence This long enumeration of provinces whose broken fragments General MÂ have formed so many powerful kingdoms might almost induce us empirefÂ maB to forgive the vanity or ignorance of the ancients Dazzled with the extensive sway the irresistible strength and the real or affected moderation of the emperors they permitted themselves to despise and sometimes to forget the outlying countries which had been left in the enjoyment of a barbarous independence and they gradually assumed the licence of confounding the Roman monarchy with the globe of the earth88 But the temper as well as knowledge of a modern historian require a more sober and accurate language He may impress a juster image by observing that the empire was above two thousand miles in breadth from the wall of Antoninus and the northern limits of Dacia to mount Atlas and the tropic of Cancer E 2 that THE DECLINE AND FALL that it extended in length more than three thousand miles from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates  that it was situated in the finest part of the Temperate Zone between the twenty fourth and the fifty sixth degrees of northern latitude and that it was sup posed to contain above sixteen hundred thousand square miles for the most part of fertile and well cultivated land 8 CHAP OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE CHAP II Of the Union and internal Prosperity of the Roman Empire in the Age of the Antonines I T is not alone by the rapidity or extent of conquest that we Principles of government should estimate the greatness of Rome The sovereign of the Ruffian deserts commands a larger portion of the globe In the seventh summer after his passage of the Hellespont Alexander erected the Macedonian trophies on the banks of the Hyphasis Within less than a century the irresistible Zingis and the Mogul princes of his race spread their cruel devastations and transient empire from the sea of China to the confines of Egypt and Germany  But the firm edifice of Roman power was raised and preserved by the wisdom of ages The obedient provinces of Trajan and the Antonines were united by laws and adorned by arts They might occasionally suffer from the partial abuse of delegated authority but the general principle of government was wife simple and beneficent They enjoyed the religion of their ancestors whilst in civil honours and advantages they were exalted by just degrees to an equality with their conquerors I The policy of the emperors and the senate as far as it con Universal cemed religion was happily seconded by the reflections of the lfrarion Â enlightened and by the habits of the superstitious part of their sub jects The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true by the philosopher as equally false  and by the magistrate as equally useful And thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence but even religious concord 2 The THE DECLINE AND FALL The superstition of the people was not embittered by any mixture of theological rancour nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative system The devout polytheist though fondly attached to his national rites admitted with implicit faith the different reli gions of the earthFear gratitude and curiosity a dream or an omen a singular disorder or a distant journey perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his belief and to enlarge the list of his protectors The thin texture of the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not discordant materials As soon as it was allowed that sages and heroes who had lived or who had died for the benefit of their country were exalted to a state of power and immortality it was universally confessed that they deserved if not the adoration at least the reverence of all mankind The deities of a thousand groves arid a thousand streams possessed in peace their local and respective influence nor could the Roman who deprecated the wrath of the Tiber deride the Egyptian who presented his offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile The visible powers of Nature the planets and the elements were the fame throughout the universe The invisible governors of the mo ral world were inevitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory Every virtue and even vice acquired its divine repre sentative every art and profession its patron whose attributes in the most distant ages and countries were uniformly derived from the character of their peculiar votaries A republic of gods of such opposite tempers and interests required in every system the mode rating hand of a supreme magistrate who was gradually invested by flattery and knowledge with the sublime perfections of an Eternal Parent and an Omnipotent Monarch  Such was the mild spirit of antiquity that the nations were less attentive to the difference than to the resemblance of their religious worship The Greek die Roman and the barbarian as they met before their1 respective altars easily persuaded themselves that under various names OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3 names and with various ceremonies they adored the fame deities The elegant mythology of Homer gave a beautiful and almost a regular form to the polytheism of the ancient world  The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals from the na Of phiioso ture of man rather than from that of God They meditated how rherS ever on the Divine Nature as a very curious and important spe culation and in the profound inquiry they displayed the strength and weakness of the human understanding 6 Of the four most considerable sects the Stoics and the Platonicians endeavoured to reconcile the jarring interests of reason and piety They have left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections of the first cause but as it was impossible for them to conceive the creation of matter the workman in the Stoic philosophy was not sufficiently distinguished from the work  whilst on the contrary the spiritual God of Plato and his disciples resembled more an idea than a substance The opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less religious cast but when the modest science of the former induced them to doubt the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny the providence of a Supreme Ruler Yet the Sages of Greece divided as they were agreed in one great principle an absolute disbelief of the popular superstition which they com municated to the ingenuous youth who from every part resorted to Athens and the other feats of learning in the Roman empire How indeed was it possible that a philosopher should accept as divine truths the idle tales of the poets and the incoherent tradi tions of antiquity or that he should adore as gods those im perfect beings whom he must have despised as men Against such unworthy adversaries Cicero condescended to employ the arms of reason and eloquence but the satire of Lucian was a much more adequate as well as more efficacious weapon We may be well assured that a writer conversant with the world would never have ventured to expose the gods of his country to public ridicule had they THE DECLINE AND FALL they not already been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and enlightened orders of society 7 Notwithstanding the fashionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of the Antonines both the interest of the priests and the credulity of the people were sufficiently respected In their writ ings and conversation the philosophers of antiquity asserted the dignity of reason but they resigned their actions to the com mands of law and of custom Viewing with a smile of pity and indulgence the various errors of the vulgar they diligently prac tised the ceremonies of their fathers devoutly frequented the tem ples of the gods and sometimes condescending to act a part on the theatre of superstition they concealed the sentiments of an Atheist under the sacerdotal robes Reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about their respective modes of faith or of worship It was indifferent to them what sliape the folly of the multitude might chuse to assume and they approached with the same inward contempt and the same external reverence the altars of the Libyan the Olympian or the Capitoline Jupiter s It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of persecu tion could introduce itself into the Roman councils The magis trates could not be actuated by a blind though honest bigotry since the magistrates were themselves philosophers and the schools of Athens had given laws to the senate They could not be impelled by ambition or avarice as the temporal and ecclesiastical powers were united in the fame hands The pontiffs were chosen among the most illustrious of the senators and the office of Supreme Pon tiff was constantly exercised by the emperors themselves They knew and valued the advantages of religion as it is connected with civil government They encouraged the public festivals which humanize the manners of the people They managed the arts of divination as a convenient instrument of policy and they respected as the firmest bond of society the useful persuasion that either in this OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tWs or in a future life the crime of perjury is most assuredly punished by the avenging gods But whilst they acknowledged the general advantages of religion they were convinced that the various modes of worstiip contributed alike to the fame salutary purposes and that in every country the form of superstition which had received the sanction of time and experience was the best adapted to the climate and to its inhabitants Avarice and taste Very inthepw frequently despoiled the vanquished nations of the elegant statues of vinces their gods and the rich ornaments of their temples IO but in the exercise of the religion which they derived from their ancestors they uniformly experienced the indulgence and even protection of the Roman conquerors The province of Gaul seems and indeed only seems an exception to this universal toleration Under the fair pretext of abolishing human sacrifices the emperors Tiberius and Claudius suppressed the dangerous power of the Druids  but the priests themselves their gods and their altars subsisted in peaceful obscurity till the final destruction of Paganism  Rome the capital of a great monarchy was incessantly filled with at Rome subjects and strangers from every part of the world J who all in troduced and enjoyed the favourite superstitions of their native country  Every city in the empire was justified in maintaining the purity of its ancient ceremonies and the Roman senate using the common privilege sometimes interposed to check this inunda tion  of foreign rites The Egyptian superstition of all the most contemptible and abject was frequently prohibited the temples of Serapis and Isis demolished and their worshippers banished from Rome and Italy But the zeal of fanaticism prevailed over the cold and feeble efforts of policy The exiles returned the proselytes multiplied the temples were restored with increasing splendor and Isis and Serapis at length assumed their place among the Roman deities 6 Nor was this indulgence a departure from the old maxims of government In the purest ages of the common er I F wealth 34 HE DECLINE AND F ALL wealth Cybele and Ã sculapius had been invited by solemn em bashes 17 and it was customary to tempt the protectors of besieged cities by the promise of more distinguished honours than they possessed in their native country 8 Rome gradually became the common temple of her subjects and the freedom of the city was bestowed on all the gods of mankind  Ro â of Th C narrow policy of preserving without any foreign mix ture the pure blood of the ancient citizens had checked the for tune and hastened the ruin of Athens and Sparta The aspiring genius of Rome sacrificed vanity to ambition and deemed it more prudent as well as honourable to adopt virtue and merit for her qwn wheresoever they were found among staves or strangers ene mies or barbarians  During the most flourishing zera of the Athenian commonwealth the number of citizens gradually decreased from about thirty to twenty one thousand If on the con trary we study the growth of the Roman republic we may discover that notwithstanding the incessant demands of wars and colonies the citizens who in the first census of Servius Tullius amounted to no more than eighty three thousand were multiplied before the commencement of the social war to the number of four hundred and sixty three thousand men able to bear arms in the service of their country When the allies of Rome claimed an equal share of honours and privileges the senate indeed preferred the chance of arms to an ignominious concession The Samnites and the Lu canians paid the severe penalty of their rafliness but the rest of the Italian states as they successively returned to their duty were ad mitted into the bosom of the republic  and soon contributed to the ruin of public freedom Under a democratical government the citizens exercise the powers of sovereignty and those powers will be first abused and afterwards lost when they are committed to an unwieldy multitude But when the popular assemblies had been suppressed by the administration of the emperors the con querors OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE querors were distinguished from the vanquished nations only as the â first and most honourable order of subjects and their increase however rapid was no longer exposed to the same dangers Yet the wisest princes who adopted the maxims of Augustus guarded with the strictest care the dignity of the Roman name and diffused the freedom of the city with a prudent liberality ts Till the privileges of Romans had been progressively extended ItalyÂ to all the inhabitants of the empire an important distinction was preserved between Italy and the provinces The former was es teemed the centre of public unity and the firm basis of the con stitution Italy claimed the birth or at least the residence of the emperors and the senate  The estates of the Italians were exempt from taxes their persons from the arbitrary jurisdiction of gover nors Their cities formed after the perfect model of the capital were intrusted under the immediate eye of the supreme power with the execution of the laws From the foot of the Alps to the extremity of Calabria all the natives of Italy were born citizens of Rome Their partial distinctions were obliterated and they in sensibly coalesced into one great nation united by language man ners and civil institutions and equal to the weight of a powerful empire The republic gloried in her generous policy and was frequently rewarded by the merit and services of her adopted sons Had she always confined the distinction of Romans to the an cient families within the walls of the city that immortal name would have been deprived of some of its noblest ornaments Virgil was a native of Mantua Horace was inclined to doubt whether he mould call himself an Apulian or a Lucanian it was in Padua that an historian was found worthy to record the majestic series of Ro man victories The patriot family of the Catos emerged from Tusculum and the little town of Arpinum claimed the double honour of producing Marius and Cicero the former of whom de served after ftom uiu and Camilhrs to be staled the Third Founder F 2 of 36 THE DECLINE ANI FAL1  of Rome and the latter after saving his country from the designs of Catiline enabled her to contend with Athens for the palm of eloquence 17 vinceT0 ne Provinces Â f rtie empire as they have been described in the preceding chapter were destitute of any public force or constitu tional freedom In Etruria in Greece 28 and in Gaul19 it was the first care of the senate to dissolve those dangerous confederacies which taught mankind that as the Roman arms prevailed by di vision they might be resisted by union Those princes whom an ostentation of gratitude or generosity permitted for a while to hold a precarious scepter were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations The free states and cities which had em braced the cause of Rome were rewarded with a nominal alliance and insensibly sunk into real servitude The public authority was every where exercised by the ministers of the senate and of the emperors and that authority was absolute and without control But the same salutary maxims of government which had secured the peace and obedience of Italy were extended to the most dis tant conquests A nation of Romans was gradually formed in the provinces by the double expedient of introducing colonies and of admitting the most faithful and deserving of the provincials to the freedom of Rome Colonies and Wheresoever the Roman conquers he inhabits is a very just towM IFal observation of Seneca confirmed by history and experience The natives of Italy allured by pleasure or by interest hastened to enjoy the advantages of victory and we may remark that about forty years after the reduction of Asia eighty thousand Romans were massacred in one day by the cruel orders of Mithridates  These voluntary exiles were engaged for the most part in the occupations of com merce agriculture and the farm of the revenue But after the legions were rendered permanent by the emperors the provinces were peopled by OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE By a race of soldiers and the veterans whether they received the reward of their service in land or in money usually settled with their families in the country where they had honourably spent their youth Throughout the empire but more particularly in the western parts the most fertile districts and the most convenient situations were reserved for the establishment of colonies some of which were of a civil and others of a military nature In their manners and internal policy the colonies formed a perfect repre sentation of their great parent and as they were soon endeared to the natives by the ties of friendship and alliance they effectually diffused a reverence for the Roman name and a desire which was seldom disappointed of sharing in due time its honours and ad vantages The municipal cities insensibly equalled the rank and splendour of the colonies and in the reign of Hadrian it was dis puted which was the preferable condition of those societies which had issued from or those which had been received into the bosom of Rome The right of Latiura as it was called conferred on the cities to which it had been granted a more partial favour The magistrates only at the expiration of their office assumed the quality of Roman citizens bat as those offices were annual in a few years they circulated round the principal families J Those of the provincials who were permitted to bear arms in the legions 51 thole who exercised any civil employment all in a word who performed any public service or displayed any personal talents were rewarded with a present whose value was continually di minished by the increasing liberality of the emperors Yet even in the age of the Antonines when the freedom of the city had been bestowed on the greater number of their subjects it was still accom panied with very solid advantages The bulk of the people ac quired with that title the benefit of the Roman laws particularly in the interesting articles of marriage testaments and inheritances and the road of fortune was open to those whose pretensions were 6 seconded THE DECLINE AND FALL seconded by favour or merit The grandsons of the Gauls who had besieged Julius CÃ sar in Alesia commanded legions governed provinces and were admitted into the senate of Rome Their ambition instead of disturbing the tranquillity of the state was inti mately connected with its safety and greatness So sensible were the Romans of the influence of language over national manners that it was their most serious care to extend with the progress of their arms the use of the Latin tongue 7 The ancient dialects of Italy the Sabine the Etruscan and the Vene tian sunk into oblivion but in the provinces the east was less docile than the west to the voice of its victorious preceptors This obvious difference marked the two portions of the empire with a distinction of colours which though it was in some degree con  cealed during the meridian splendor of prosperity became gradually more visible as the shades of night descended upon the Roman world The western countries were civilized by the fame hands Avhich subdued them As soon as the barbarians were reednciled to obedience their minds were opened to any new impressions of knowledge and politeness The language of Virgil and Cicero though with some inevitable mixture of corruption waS so uni versally adopted in Africa Spain Gaul Britain and Pannonia that the faint traces of the Punic or Celtic idioms were preserved only in the mountains or among the peasants Education and study insensibly inspired the natives of those countries with the sentiments of Romans  and Italy gave fashions as well as laws to her Latin provincials They solicited with more ardour and obtained with more facility the freedom and honours of the state supported the national dignity in letters 0 and in arms and at length in the person of Trajan produced an emperor whom the Scipios would not have disowned for their countryman The situation 6f the Greeks was very different from that of the barbarians The former had been long since civilized and corrupted They had OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE too much taste to relinquish their language and too much vanity to adopt any foreign institutions Still preserving the prejudices after they had lost the virtues of their ancestors they affected to despise the unpolished manners of the Roman conquerors whilst they were compelled to respect their superior wisdom and power  Nor was the influence of the Grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow limits of that once celebrated country Their empire by the progress of colonies and con quest had been diffused from the Hadriatic to the Euphrates and the Nile Asia was covered with Greek cities and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had introduced a silent revolution into Syria aud Egypt In their pompous courts those princes united the elegance of Athens with the luxury of the East and the example of the court was imitated at an humble distance by the higher ranks of their subjects Such was the general division of the Roman empire into the Latin and Greek languages To these we may add a third distinction for the body of the natives irt Syria and especially in Egypt The use of their ancient dialects by secluding them from the com merce of mankind checked the improvements of those barbarians 4 The slothful effeminacy of the former exposed them to the contempt  the sullen ferociousness of the lattei excited the aversion of the Roman conquerors They seldom desired or deserved the free dom of the city and it was remarked that more than two hund redi and thirty years elapsed after the ruin of the Ptolemies before a native Egyptian was admitted into the senate of Rome K  â H is a j uft though trite observation that victorious Rome was her G eneral use fclÂ subdued by the arts of Greece Those immortal writers whe g2 gÂ L n still command the admiration of modern Europe soon became the favourite object of study and imitation in Italy and the western pro vinces But the elegant amusements of the Romans were not suffered to interfere with their found maxims of policy Whilst they acknowledged the charms of the Greek they asserted the dignity of â Sv js t the THE DECLINE AND FALL the Latin tongue and the exclusive use of the latter was inflexibly maintained in the administration of civil as well as military govern ment 45 The two languages exercised at the same time their se parate jurisdiction throughout the empire  the former as the natural idiom of science the latter as the legal dialect of public trans actions Those who united letters with business were equally con versant with both and it was almost impossible in any province to find a Roman subject of a liberal education who was at once a stranger to the Greek and to the Latin language Slaves It was by such institutions that the nations of the empire insensibly melted away into the Roman name and people But there still re mained in the centre of every province and of every family an unhappy condition of men who endured the weight without fhar ing the benefits of society In the free states of antiquity the do Their treat mestic slaves were exposed to the wanton rigour of despotism The menu perfect settlement of the Roman empire was preceded by ages of violence and rapine The slaves consisted for the most part of barbarian captives taken in thousands by the chance of war pur chased at a vile price S accustomed to a life of independence and impatient to break and to revenge their fetters Against such in ternal enemies whose desperate insurrections had more than once reduced the republic to the brink of destruction 47 the most severe regulations 8 and the most cruel treatment seemed almost justified by the great law of self preservation But when the principal nations of Europe Asia and Africa were united under the laws of one sovereign the source of foreign supplies flowed with much less abundance and the Romans were reduced to the milder but more tedious method of propagation In their numerous families and particularly in their country estates they encouraged the mar riage of their slaves The affections of nature the habits of edu cation and the possession of a dependent species of property contributed to alleviate the hardships of servitude 9 The ex istence OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 41 istence of a slave became an object of greater value and though his happiness still depended on the temper and circumstances of the master the humanity of the latter instead of being restrained by fear was confirmed by the fense of his own interest The pro gress of manners was enforced by the virtue or policy of the em perors and by the edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines the protection of the laws was extended to the most abject part of man kind The jurisdiction of life and death over the staves a power long exercised and often abused was taken out of private hands and reserved to the magistrates alone The subterraneous prisons were abolished and upon a just complaint of intolerable treat ment the injured slave obtained either his deliverance or a less cruel master So Hope the best comfort of our imperfect condition was not denied Enfranchise to the Roman slave and if he had any opportunity of making him self either useful or agreeable he might very naturally expect that the diligence and fidelity of a few years would be reward ed with the inestimable gift of freedom The benevolence of the master was so frequently prompted by the meaner sug gestions of vanity and avarice that the laws found it more ne cessary to restrain than to encourage a profuse and undistinguish ing liberality which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuse5 It was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence that as a slave had not any country of his own he acquired with his liberty an admission into the political society of which his patron was a member The consequences of this maxim would have prostituted the privileges of the Roman city to a mean and promiscuous multitude Some sea sonable exceptions were therefore provided and the honourable distinction was confined to such slaves only as for just causes and with the approbation of the magistrate should receive a solemn and legal manumission Even these chosen freedmen obtained no more than the private rights of citizens and were rigorously excluded from civil employments and military service Whatever might be Vol I G the THE DECLINE AND FALL the merit or fortune of their sons they likewise were esteemed unworthy of a seat in the senate nor were the traces of a servile origin allowed to be completely obliterated till the third or fourth generation 5 Without destroying the distinction of ranks a dis tant prospect of freedom and honours was presented even to those whom pride and prejudice almost disdained to number among the human species It was once proposed to discriminate the slaves by a peculiar habit j but it was justly apprehended that there might be some danger in acquainting them with their own numbers Without interpret ing in their utmost strictness the liberal appellations of legions and myriads 54 we may venture to pronounce that the proportion of staves who were valued as property was more considerable than that of servants who can be computed only as an expence ss The youths of a promising genius were instructed in the arts and sciences and their price was ascertained by the degree of their skill and talents s s Almost every profession either liberal57 or mechanical might be found in the household of an opulent senator The mi nisters of pomp and sensuality were multiplied beyond the con ception of modern luxury 58 It was more for the interest of the merchant or manufacturer to purchase than to hire his workmen and in the country slaves were employed as the cheapest and most laborious instruments of agriculture To confirm the general ob servation and to display the multitude of slaves we might allege a variety of particular instances It was discovered on a very me lancholy occasion that four hundred slaves were maintained in a single palace of Rome S9 The fame number of four hundred belonged to an estate which an African widow of a very private condition resigned to her son whilst she reserved for herself a much larger sliare of her property 6o A freedman under the reign of Augustus though his fortune had suffered great losses in the civil wars left behind him three thousand six hundred yoke of oxen two hundred and fifty thousand head of smaller cattle and what OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 43 what was almost included in the description of cattle four thousand one hundred and sixteen slaves The number of subjects who acknowledged the laws of Rome Popuiousness of citizens of provincials and of slaves cannot now be fixed with empire 0111 such a degree of accuracy as the importance of the object would deserve We are informed that when the emperor Claudius ex ercised the office of censor he took an account of six millions nine hundred and forty five thousand Roman citizens who with the pro portion of women and children must have amounted to about twenty millions of souls The multitude of subjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating But after weighing with attention every circumstance which could influence the balance it seems pro bable that there existed in the time of Claudius about twice as many provincials as there were citizens of either sex and of every age and that the staves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of the Roman world The total amount of this im perfect calculation would rife to about one hundred and twenty millions of persons  a degree of population which possibly exceeds that of modern Europe 6l and forms the most numerous society that has ever been united under the fame system of government Domestic peace aud union were the natural consequences of the obedience moderate and comprehensive policy embraced by the Romans If and union we turn our eyes towards the monarchies of Asia we shall behold despotism in the center and weakness in the extremities the collection of the revenue or the administration of justice enforced by the presence of an army hostile barbarians hereditary satraps and provinces inclined to rebellion though incapable of freedom But the obedience of the Roman world was uniform voluntary and permanent The vanquished nations blended into one great people resigned the hope nay even the wish of resuming their inde pendence and scarcely considered their own existence as distinct from the existence of Rome The established authority of the G 2 emperors â 44 THE DECLINE AND FALL emperors pervaded without an effort the wide extent of their dominions and was exercised with the same facility on the banks of the Thames or of the Nile as on those of the Tyber The legions were destined to serve against the public enemy and the eivil magistrate seldom required the aid of a military force61 In this state of general security the leisure as well as opulence both of the prince and people were devoted to improve and to adorn the Roman empire Roman mo Among the innumerable monuments of architecture constructed r uniu t ky the Romans how many have escaped the notice of history how few have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism And yet even the majestic ruins that are still scattered over Italy and the pro vinces would be sufficient to prove that those countries were once the feat of a polite and powerful empire Their greatness alone or their beauty might deserve our attention but they are rendered more interesting by two important circumstances which connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful history of human manners Many of those works were erected at private ex pence and almost all were intended for public benefit Many of them It is natural to suppose that the greatest number as well as the most considerable of the Roman edifices were the works of the emperors who possessed so unbounded a command both of men and money Augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found his capital of brick and that he had left it of marble 6 The strict ceconomy of Vespasian was the source of his magni ficence The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius The public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of the empire were executed not only by his orders but under his immediate inspection He was himself an artist and he loved the arts as they conduced to the glory of the monarch They were encouraged by the Antonines as they contributed to the happiness of the people But if the emperors were the first they were not the only OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE only architects of their dominions Their example was universally imitated by their principal subjects who were not afraid of declar ing that they had spirit to conceive and wealth to accomplish the noblest undertakings Scarcely had the proud structure of the Coliseum been dedicated at Rome before edifices of a smaller scale indeed but of the same design and materials were erected for the use and at the expence of the cities of Capua and Verona 6 The inscription of the stupendous bridge of Alcantara attests that it was thrown over the Tagus by the contribution of a few Lusi tanian communities When Pliny was intrusted with the govern ment of Bithynia and Pontus provinces by no means the richest or most considerable of the empire he found the cities within his juris diction striving with each other in every useful and ornamental work that might deserve the curiosity of strangers or the gratitude of their citizens It was the duty of the Proconsul to supply their deficiencies to direct their taste and sometimes to moderate their emulation 66 The opulent senators of Rome and1 the provinces esteemed it an honour and almost an obligation to adorn the splendour of their age and country and the influence of fashion very frequently supplied the want of taste or generosity Among a crowd of these private benefactors we may select Herodes At ticus an Athenian citizen who lived in the age of the An tonines Whatever might be the motive of his conduct his mag nificence would have been worthy of the greatest kings The family of Herod at least after it had been favoured by Example fortune was lineally descended from Cimon and Miltiades Theseus Atticu and Cecrops Ã acus and Jupiter But the posterity of so many gods and heroes was fallen into the most abject state His grandfather had suffered by the hands of justice and Julius Atticus his father must have ended his life in poverty and contempt had he not dis covered an immense treasure buried under an old house the last remains of his patrimony According to the rigour of law the emperor THE DECLINE AND FALL emperor might have asserted his claim and the prudent Atticus p e vented by a frank confession the officiousnefs of informers But the equitable Nerva who then filled the throne refused to accept any part of it and commanded him to use without scruple the present of fortune The cautious Athenian still insisted that the treasure was too considerable for a subject and that he knew not how to use it Abuse it then replied the monarch with a good natured peevishness for it is your own 6 Many will be of opinion that Atticus literally obeyed the emperor s last instructions since he expended the greatest part of his fortune which was much increased by an advantageous marriage in the service of the Public He had obtained for his son Herod the prefecture of the free cities of Asia and the young magistrate observing that the town of Troas was indifferently supplied with water obtained from the munificence of Hadrian three hundred myriads of drachms about a hundred thousand pounds for the construction of a new aqueduct But in the execution of the work the charge amounted to more than double the estimate and the officers of the revenue began to murmur till the generous Atticus silenced their com plaints by requesting that he might be permitted to take upon himself the whole additional expence  â The ablest preceptors of Greece and Asia had been invited by liberal rewards to direct the education of young Herod Their pupil soon became a celebrated orator in the useless rhetoric of that age which confining itself to the schools disdained to visit either the Forum or the Senate He was honoured with the consulship at Rome but the greatest part of his life was spent in a philosophic retirement at Athens and his adjacent villas perpetually surrounded by sophists who acknowledged without reluctance the superiority of a rich and generous rival e The monuments of his genius have perished some remains still preserve the fame of his taste and munificence modern travellers have measured the ruins of the stadium OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 47 stadium which he constructed at Athens It was six hundred feet in length built entirely of white marble capable of admitting the whole body of the people and finished in four years whilst Herod was president of the Athenian games To the memory of his wife Regilla he dedicated a theatre scarcely to be paralleled in the empire no wood except cedar very curiously carved was em ployed in any part of the building The Odeum designed by Pericles for musical performance and the rehearsal of new tragedies was a trophy of the victory of the arts over Barbaric greatness as the timbers employed in the construction consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels Notwithstanding it had been once repaired by a king of Cappadocia it was again fallen to decay Herod restored its ancient beauty and magnificence Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen confined to the walls of Athens The most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple of Neptune in the Isthmus a theatre at Corinth a stadium at Delphi a bath at ThermopylÃ and an aqueduct at Canusi uni in Italy were insufficient to exhaust his treasures The people of Epirus Thef faly EubÅ a Bceotia and Peloponnesus experienced his favours and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Asia gratefully style Herodes Atticus their patron and benefactor 7Â In the commonwealths of Athens and Rome the modest sim Molt of the plicity of private houses announced the equal condition of freedom numems whilst the sovereignty of the people was represented in the ma fempL he jestic edifices destined to the public use 7 nor was this republican a cue spirit totally extinguished by the introduction of wealth and mo narchy It was in works of national honour and benefit that the most virtuous of the emperors affected to display their magnificence The golden palace of Nero excited a just indigna tion but the vast extent of ground which had been usurped by his selfish luxury was more nobly silled under the succeeding reign by the Coliseum the baths of Titus the Claudian portico and 4 the 48 THE DECLINE AND FALL the temples dedicated to the goddess of Peace and to the genius of Rome 71 These monuments of architecture the property of the Roman people were adorned with the most beautiful productions of Grecian painting and sculpture and in the temple of Peace a very curious library was open to the curiosity of the learned At a small distance from thence was situated the Forum of Trajan It was surrounded with a lofty portico and in the centre arose a column of marble whose height of one hundred and ten feet denoted the elevation of the hill that had been cut away This column which still subsists in its ancient beauty exhibited an exact representation of the Dacian victories of its founder The veteran soldier con templated the story of his own c ampaigns and by an easy illusion of national vanity the peaceful citizen associated himself to the honours of the triumph All the other quarters of the capital and all the provinces of the empire were embellished by the same liberal spirit of public magnificence and were silled with amphitheatres theatres temples porticos triumphal arches baths and aqueducts all variously conducive to the health the devotion and the pleasures of the meanest citizen The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention The boldness of the enterprise the solidity of the execution and the uses to which they were subservient rank the aqueducts among the noblest monuments of Roman genius and power The aqueducts of the capital claim a just pre eminence but the curious traveller who without the light of history should examine those of Spoleto of Metz or of Segovia would very naturally conclude that those provincial towns had formerly been the residence of some potent monarch The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered with flouristiing cities whose populousness and even whose existence was dei Ved from such ar tificial supplies of a perennial stream of frefli water Number and We have computed the inhabitants and contemplated the public greatness of _wort8 Qf tne Roman empire The observation of the number and the cries ot  the empire greatness OFTHE ROMAN EMPIRE greatness of its cities will serve to confirm the former and to multiply the latter It may not be unpleasing to collect a few scattered instances relative to that subject without forgetting however that from the vanity of nations arid the poverty of language the vague appellation of city has been indifferently bestowed on Rome and upon Lau rentum Ancient Italy is said to have contained eleven hundred In July and ninety seven cities J and for whatsoever Ã ra of antiquity the expression might be intended  there is not any reason to believe the country less populous in the age of the Antonines than in that of Romulus The petty states of Latium were contained within the metropolis of the empire by whose superior influence they had been attracted Those parts of Italy which have so long languished under the lazy tyranny of priests and viceroys had been afflicted only by the more tolerable calamities of war and the first symptoms of decay which they experienced were amply compensated by the rapid improvements of the Cisalpine Gaul The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains yet Verona was less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua Milan or Ravenna II The spirit of improvement had passed the Alps and been felt Gaul and even irt the woods of Britain York was the feat of government Spam and London was already enriched by commerce Gaul could boast of her twelve hundred cities 7r and

rose with new splendor from its ashes and that capital as well as Capua and Corinth soon recovered all the advantages whish sap be separated from independent sovereignty IV The provinces Asu of the east present the contrast of Roman magnificence with Turkish barbarism The ruins of antiquity scattered over un cultivated fields and ascribed by ignorance to the power as magic scarcely afford a shelter o the oppressed peasant or wan dering Arab Under the reign of the CÃ sars the proper Asia alone contained five hundred populous cities 79 enriched with all the gifts of nature and adorned with all the refinements of art Eleven cities of Asia had once disputed the honour of dedicating a temple to Tiberius and their respective merits were examined by the senate 8Â Four of them were immediately rejected as unequal ro the burthen  and among these was Laodicea whose splendor is ill displayed in its ruins 8 Laodicea collected a very considerable revenue from its flocks of sheep celebrated for the fineness of their wool and had received a little before the contest a legacy of above four hundred thousand pounds by the testament of a generous citizen81 If such was the poverty of Laodicea what must have been the wealth of those cities whose claim appeared preferable and particularly of Pergamus of Smyrna and of Ephesus who so long disputed with each other the titular primacy of Asia8i The capitals of Syria and Egypt held a still superior rank in Xhe empire Antioch and Alexandria looked down with disdain on a crowd of dependent cities84 and yielded with reluctance to the majesty of Rome itself  t OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE All these cities wire connected with each other and with the capital by the public highways which issuing from the forum of Rome traversed Italy pervaded the provinces and were termi mated only by the frontiers of the empire If we carefully trace the distance from the wall of Antoninus to Rome and from thence to Jerusalem it will be found that the great chain of communi cation from the north west to the south east point of the empire was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty Roman miles 8J The public roads were accurately divided by mile stones and ran in a direct line from one city to another with very little respect for the obstacles either of nature or private property Mountains were perforated and bold arches thrown over the broad est and most rapid streams 86 The middle part of the road was raised into a terrace which commanded the adjacent country con sisted of several strata of sand gravel and cement and was paved with large stones or in some places near the capital with mar ble 7 Such was the solid construction of the Roman highways whose firmness has not entirely yielded to the effort of fifteen centuries They united the subjects of the most distant provinces by an easy and familiar intercourse but their primary object had been to facilitate the marches of the legions nor was any country considered as completely subdued till it had been rendered in all its parts pervious to the arms and authority of the conqueror The advantage of receiving the earliest intelligence and of con veying their orders with celerity induced the emperors to establish throughout their extensive dominions the regular institution of posts 88 Houses were every where erected at the distance only of five or six miles each of them was constantly provided with forty horses and by the help of these relays it was easy to travel ad hundred miles in a day along the Roman roads 8 The use of the posts uwas allowed to those who claimed it by an Imi perial mandate but though originally intended for the public H 2 service THE DECLINE AND FALL service it was sometimes indulged to the business or conveniency Navigation of private citizens9o Nor was the communication of the Roman empire less free and open by sea than it was by land The provinces surrounded and enclosed the Mediterranean and Italy in the shape of an immense promontory advanced into the midst of that great lake The coasts of Italy are in general destitute of safe harbours  but human industry had corrected the deficiencies of nature and the artificial port of Ostia in particular situate at the mouth of the Tyber and formed by the emperor Glaudiu6 Was a useful monu ment of Roman greatness9 From the port which was only sixteen miles from the capital a favourable breeze frequently car ried vessels in seven days to the columns of Hercules and in nine or ten to Alexandria in Egypt L v i   j Improvement Whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to wremthe extensive empire the power of Rome was attended with some be Coumriesof P fic consequences to mankind j and the fame freedom of inter the empire course which extended the vices diffused likewise the improvements pf social life In die more remote ages of antiquity the world Was unequally divided The east was in the immemorial possession of arts and luxury whilst the west was inhabited by rude and war like barbarians who either disdained agriculture or to whom it was totally unknown Under the protection of an established government the productions off happier climates and the industry of more civilized nations were gradually introduced into the western countries of Europe and the natives were encouraged by an open and profitable commerce to multiply the former as well as to improve the latter It would be almost impossible to enu merate all the articles cither of the animal or the vegetable reign which were successively imported into Europe from Asia and Egypt9 but it will not be unworthy of the dignity and much less of the utility of an historical work slightly to touch on ja few of the principal heads i Almost an the flowers the herbs and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the fruits that grow in our European gardens are of foreign ex introduction traction which in many cafes is betrayed even by their nasties the apple was a native of Italy and when the Romans had tasted the richer flavour of the apricot the peach the pomegranate the citron and the orange they contented themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common denomination of apple dis criminating them from each other by the additional epithet of their country 2 In the time of Homer the vine grew wild in the island of Sicily and most probably in the adjacent continent 5 but it was not improved by the skill nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the taste of the savage inhabitants 9 A thousand years af terwards Italy could boast that of the fourscore most generous and celebrated wines more than two thirds were produced from her foil 9 The blessing was soon communicated to the Narbon nese province of Gaul but so intense was the cold to the north of the Cevennes that in the time of Strabo it was thought impossible to ripen the grapes in those parts of Gaul 9  This difficulty however was gradually vanquished and there is some reason to believe that the vineyards of Burgundy are as old as the age of the Antonines 97  The olive in the western world was the com _ J The olive panion as well as the symbol of peace Two centuries after the foundation of Rome both Italy and Africa were strangers to that useful plant it was naturalized in those countries and at length carried into the heart of Spain and Gaul The timid errors of the ancients that it requieed a certain degree of heat and could only flourish in the neighbourhood of the sea were insensibly explode by industry and experience 9 4 The cultivation of flax was trabfc

attention to mines and fisheries which by employing a multitude of laborious hands serve to increase the pleasures of the rich and the subsistence of the poor The elegant treatise of Columella describes the advanced state of the Spanish husbandry under the reign of Tiberius and it may be observed that those famines which so frequently afflicted the infant republic were seldom or never experienced by the ex tensive empire of Rome The accidental scarcity in any single province was immediately relieved by the plenty of its more fortu nate neighbours  t  â    Agriculture is the foundation of manufactures since the pro ductions of nature are the materials of art Under the Roman empire the labour of an industrious and ingenious people was variously but incessantly employed in the service of the rich In their dress their table their houses and their furniture the favourites of fortune united every refinement of conveniency of elegance and of splendour whatever could sooth their pride or gratify their sensuality Such refinements under the odious name of luxury have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue as well as happiness of mankind if all possessed the necessaries and none the superfluities of life But in the present imperfect condition of society luxury though it may proceed from vice or folly seems to be the only means that can correct the unequal dis tribution of property The diligent mechanic and the skilful artist who have obtained no share in the division of the earth receive a voluntary taxi from the possessors of land and the latter are prompted by a fense of interest to improve those estates with whose produce they may purchase  additional pleasures This y fi operation OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Operation the particular effects of which are felt in every society acted with much more diffusive energy in the Roman world The provinces would soon have been exhausted of their wealth if the manufactures and commerce of luxury had not insensibly restored to the industrious subjects the sums which were exacted from them by the arms and authority of Rome As long as the circu lation was confined within the bounds of the empire it impressed the political machine with a new degree of activity and its conse quences sometimes beneficial could never become pernicious But it is no easy task to confine luxury within the limits of an Fo empire The most remote countries of the ancient world were ransacked to supply the pomp and delicacy of Rome The forests of Scythia afforded some valuable furs Amber was brought over land from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube and the bar barians were astonished at the price which they received in exchange for so useless a commodity 0 There was a considerable demand fpr Babylonian carpets and other manufactures of the east but the most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried on with Arabia and India Every year about the time of tbe summer solstice a fleet of an hundred and twenty vessels failed from Myos hormos a port of Egypt on the Red Sea By the periodical assistance of the Monsoons they traversed the ocean in about forty days The coast of Malabar or the island of Ceylon ot was the usual term of their navigation and it was in those markets that the merchants from the more remote countries of Asia expected their arrival The return of the fleet of Egypt was fixed to the months of December or January and as soon as their rich cargo had been transported on the backs of camels from the Red Sea to the Nile and had descended that river as far as Alexandria it was poured without delay into the capital of the empire The objects of oriental traffic were splendid and trifling silk a pound of which was esteemed not inferior in value to a  â  pound THE DECLINE AND FALL pound of gold 4 precious stones among which the pearl claimed the first rank after the diamond 0J and a variety of aromatics that

few individuals were enriched at the expence of the Public As the sllvcr natives of Arabia and India were contented with the productions and manufactures of their own country silver on the fide of the Romans was the principal if not the only instrument of com merce It was a complaint worthy of the gravity of the senate that in the purchase of female ornaments the wealth of the state was irrecoverably given away to foreign and hostile nations The annual loss is computed by a writer of an inquisitive but cen sorious temper at upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling 107 Such was the style of discontent brooding over the dark prospect of approaching poverty And yet if we compare the proportion between gold and silver as it stood in the time of Pliny and as it was fixed in the reign of Constantine we mail dis cover within that period a very considerable increase laS There is not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce it is therefore evident that silver was grown more common that whatever might be the amount of the Indian and Arabian exports they were far from exhausting the wealth of the Roman world and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the demands of commerce 1 Notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to exalt the past and to depreciate the present the tranquil and prosperous state of the empire was warmly felt

future danger Â 9 Whatever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and declamation which seems to prevail in these passages the substance of them is perfectly agreeable to historic truth It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries should Decline of discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and cor couraÂ c â ruption This long peace and the uniform government of the Romans introduced a flow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire The minds of men were gradually reduced to the fame level the fire of genius was extinguished and even the military spirit evaporated The natives of Europe were brave and robust Spain Gaul Britain and Illyricum supplied the legions with ex cellent soldiers and constituted the real strength of the monarchy Their personal valour remained but they no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence the fense of national honour the presence of danger and the habit of command They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army  The posterity of their boldest leaders was contented With the rank of citizens and subjects The most aspiring spirits resorted to the court oi standard of the emperors and the deserted provinces deprived of political strength or union insensibly sunk into the lan guid indisserence of private life  The love of letters almost inseparable from peace and re    r OfgeniM sinement was fashionable among the subjects of Hadrian and Vol I I the 58 THE DECLINE AND FALL the Antonines who

transcribed and studied on the banks of the Rhine and Danuhe j and the most liberal rewards sought out the faintest glimmerings of literary merit Â Â The sciences of physic and astronomy were cultivated with some degree of reputation but if we except the inimitable Lucian an age of indolence passed away without producing a single writer of genius who deserved the attention of posterity The authority of Plato and Aristotle of Zeno and Epicurus still reigned in the schools and their systems transmitted with blind deference from one gene ration of disciples to another precluded every generous attempt to correct the errors or enlarge the bounds of the human mind The beauties of the poets and orators instead of kindling a fire like their own inspired only cold and servile imitations or if any ventured to deviate from those models they deviated at the fame time from good fense and propriety On the revival of letters the youthful vigour of the imagination after a long repose national emulation a new religion new languages and a new world called forth the genius of Europe The provincials of Rome trained by a uniform artificial foreign education were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients who by ex pressing their genuine feelings in their native tongue had already occupied every place of honour The name of Poet was almost forgotten that of Orator was usurped by the sophists A cloud of critics of compilers of commentators darkened the face of learn ing and the decline of genius was soon followed by the corruption of taste  Degeneracy The sublime Longinus who in somewhat a later period and in the court of a Syrian queen preserved the spirit of ancient Athens observes and laments this degeneracy of his contemporaries which debased OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE debased their sentiments enervated their courage and depressed their talents In the fame manner fays he as some children al ways remain pygmies whose infant limbs have been too closely confined thus our tender minds fettered by the prejudices and habits of a just servitude are unable to expand themselves or to attain that well proportioned greatness which we admire in the ancients who living under a popular government wrote with the  fame freedom as they acted This diminutive stature of mankind if we pursue the metaphor was daily sinking below the old standard and the Roman world was indeed peopled by a race of pygmies when the fierce giants of the north broke in and mended the puny breed They restored a manly spirit of freedom and after the revolution of ten centuries freedom became the happy parent of taste and science 1 2 CHAP 6o THE DECLINE AND FALL â CHAP III Of the Constitution of the Roman Empire in the Age of the Antonines i Idea of a mo HPHE general definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a narcb _ _ ate m ich a singie person by whatsoever name he may be distinguished is intrusted with the execution of the laws the management of the revenue and the command of the army But unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon degenerate into despotism The influence of the clergy in an age of superstition might be usefully employed to assert the rights of mankind but such is the connexion between the throne and the altar that the banner of the church has very seldom been seen on the side of the people A martial nobility and stubborn commons possessed of arms tenaci ous of property and collected into constitutional assemblies form the only barrier which can perpetually resist the perpetual enterprises of an aspiring prince Situation of Every barrier of the Roman constitution had been levelled by the Augustus vast ambition of the dictator every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the Triumvir After the victory of Actium the fate of the Roman world depended on the will of Octavianus fur named CÃ sar by his uncle s adoption and afterwards Augustus by the flattery of the senate The conqueror was at the head of forty four veteran legions conscious of their own strength and of the weakness of the constitution habituated during twenty years civil war to every act of blood and violence and passionately devoted to the house of CÃ sar from whence alone they had received and expected OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE expected the most lavish rewards The provinces long oppressed by the ministers of the republic sighed for the government of a single person who would be the master not the accomplice of those petty tyrants The people of Rome viewing with a secret pleasure the humiliation of the aristocracy demanded only bread and public shows and were supplied with both by the liberal hand of Augustus The rich and polite Italians who had almost univer sally embraced the philosophy of Epicurus enjoyed the present blessings of ease and tranquillity and suffered not the pleasing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom With its power the senate had lost its dignity many of the most noble families were extinct The republicans of spirit and ability had perished in the field of battle or in the proscription The door of the assembly had been designedly left open for a mixed multi tude of more than a thousand persons who reflected disgrace upon their rank instead of deriving honour from it  The reformation of the senate was one of the first steps in which Â fero ms r the senate Augustus laid aside the tyrant and professed himself the father of his country He was elected censor and in concert with his faithful Agrippa he examined the list of the senators expelled a few members whose vices or whose obstinacy required a public example persuaded near two hundred to prevent the shame of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat raised the qualification of a sena tor to about ten thousand pounds created a sufficient number of Patrician families and accepted for himself the honourable title of Prince of the Senate which had always been bestowed by the censors on the citizen the most eminent for his honours and services  But whilst he thus restored the dignity he destroyed the independ ence of the senate The principles of a free constitution are irre coverably lost when the legislative power is appointed by the ex ecutive 6 Before 62 THE DECLINE AND FALL Resigns his Before

Filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of his father s murder the humanity of his own nature had some M times given way to the stern laws of necessity and to a forcetl connexion with two unworthy colleagues as long as Antony lived the republic forbade him to abandon her to a degenerate Roman and a barbarian queen He was now at liberty to satisfy his duty and his inclination He

affected It was danger emperor or rr gerfeitf ous to trust the sincerity of Augustus to seem to distrust it was still more dangerous The respective advantages of monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers the present great ness of the Roman state the corruption of manners and the licence of the soldiers added new weight to the advocates of monarchy j and these general views of government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each individual Amidst this confusion of sen timents the answer of the senate was unanimous and decisive They refused to accept the resignation of Augustus they conjured him not to desert the republic which he had saved After a de cent resistance the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate and consented to receive the government of the provinces and the general command of the Roman armies under the well known names of Proconsul and ImpErator5 But he would receive them only for ten years Even before the expiration of a that OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE that period he hoped that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed and that the republic restored to its pristine health and vigour would no longer require the dangerous inter position of so extraordinary a magistrate The memory of this comedy repeated several times during the life of Augustus was preserved to the last ages of the empire by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of Rome always solemnized the tenth years of their reign 6 Without any violation of the principles of the constitution the Power of the  _  _   Roman ge general of the Roman armies might receive and exercise an au neral thority almost despotic over the soldiers the enemies and the subjects of the republic With regard to the soldiers the jealousy of freedom had even from the earliest ages of Rome given way to the hopes of conquest and a just fense of military discipline The dictator or cousul had a right to command the service of the Roman youth and to punisti an obstinate or cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious penalties by striking the offender out of the list of citizens by confiscating his property and by felling his person into slavery  The most sacred rights of freedom confirmed by the Porcian and Sempronean laws were suspended by the military engagement In his camp the ge neral exercised an absolute power of life and death his juris diction was not confined by any forms of trial or rules of pro ceeding and the execution of the sentence was immediate and with out appeal8 The choice of the enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legislative authority On the most important occa sions peace and war were seriously debated in the senate and solemnly ratified by the people But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great distance from Italy the generals assumed the liberty of directing them against whatever people and in what ever manner they judged most advantageous for the public service It was from the success not from the justice of their enterprises that 64 THE DECLINE AND FALL that they expected the honours of a triumph In the use of victory especially after they were no longer controlled by the commissioners of the senate they exercised the most unbounded despotism When Pompey commanded in the east he rewarded his soldiers and allies dethroned princes divided kingdoms founded colonies and distributed the treasures of Mithridates On his return to Rome he obtained by a single act of the senate and people the universal ratification of all his proceedings 9 Such was the power over the soldiers and over the enemies of Rome which was either granted to or assumed by the generals of the republic They were at the fame time the governors or rather monarchs of the conquered provinces united the civil with the military character administered justice as well as the finances and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the state Lieutenants From what has been already observed in the first chapter of this peror Cm work some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus intrusted to the ruling hand of Augustus But as it was im possible that he could personally command the legions of so many distant frontiers he was indulged by the senate as Pompey had already been in the permission of devolving the execution of his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants In rank and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient proconsuls but their station was dependent and precarious They received and held their commissions at the will of a superior to whose auspicious influence the merit of their actions was legally attributed Â They were the representatives of the emperor The emperor alone was the general of the republic and his jurisdiction civil as well as military extended over all the conquests of Rome It was some Satisfaction however to the senate that he always delegated his power to the members of their body The Imperial lieutenants were of consular or prÃ torian dignity the legions were com manded OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 65 manded by senators and the prÃ fecture of Egypt was the only important trust committed to a Roman knight â  Within six days after Augustus had been compelled to accept so Division of  the province very liberal a grant he resolved to gratify the pride of the senate between the by an easy sacrifice He represented to them that they had en senate3 larged his powers even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy condition of the times They had not permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and the frontiers but he must insist on being allowed to restore the more peaceful and secure provinces to the mild administration of the civil magistrate In the division of the provinces Augustus provided for his own power and for the dignity of the republic The proconsuls of the senate particularly those of Asia Greece and Africa enjoyed a more honourable character than the lieute nants of the emperor who commanded in Gaul or Syria The former were attended by lictors the latter by soldiers A law was passed that wherever the emperor was present his extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary jurisdiction of the governor a custom was introduced that the new conquests belonged to the Imperial portion and it was soon discovered that the authority of the Prince the favourite epithet of Augustus was the fame in every part of the empire In return for this imaginary concession Augustus obtained an The former preserve his military com Important privilege which rendered him master of Rome and pr erves hls Italy By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims he was â anrjsa nd authorized to preserve his military command supported by a Rome itself numerous body of guards even in time of peace and in the heart of the capital His command indeed was confined to those citi zens who were engaged in the service by the military oath but such was the propensity of the Romans to servitude that the oath was voluntarily taken by the magistrates the senators and the VoLvI K  equestrian THE DECLINE AND FALL equestrian order till the homage of flattery was insensibly con verted into an annual and solemn protestation Â f fidelity Consular snd Although Auguctus considered a military force as the firmest tribunician  _ _   powers foundation he wuely rejected it as a very odious instrument of government It was more agreeable to his temper as well as to his â policy to reign under the venerable names of ancient magistracy and artfully to eoi4ect 4n his own per son 11 the scattered rays of civil jurisdiction With thiÂ view lie permitted the senate to con fer upon him for his life the powers of the consular1 and lri brunitian office  which were in the fame manner continued to all his succeffbrs The consuls had succeeded to the kings of Rome and represented the dignity of the state They superintended the ceremonies of religion levied and commanded the legions gave audience to foreign ambassadors and presided in the assemblies hoth of the senate and people The general control of the finances was intrusted to their care and though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person they were considered as the supreme guardians of law equity and the public peace Such was their ordinary jurisdiction but whenever the senate empowered the first magistrate to consult the safety of the commonwealth he was raised by that 4egree above the laws and exercised in the defence of liberty a temporary despotism The character of the tribunes was in every respect different from that of the consuls The appearance of the former was modest and humble but their person3 were sacred and inviolable Their force was suited rather for op position than for action They were instituted to defend the oppressed to pardon offences to arraign the enemies of the people and when they judged it necessary to Hop by a single word the whole machine of government As long as the republic sub sisted the dangerous influence which either the consul or the tribune might derive from their respective jurisdiction was dir i mkulhed OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE minished by several important restrictions Their authority expired with the year in which they were elected j the former office was di vided between two the latter among ten persona and as both in their private and public interest they were adverse to each other their mutual conflicts contributed for the most part to strengthen rather than to destroy the balance of the constitution But when the con sular and tribunitian powers were united when they were vested for life hi a single person when the general of the army was at the fame time the minister of the senate and the representative of the Roman people it was impossible to resist the exorcise nor was it easy to define the limits of his imperial prerogative To these accumulated honour the policy of Augustus soon added imperial pw the splendid as well as important dignities of supreme pontiff and Â  of censor By the former he acquired the management of the religion and by the latter a legal inspection over the manners and fortunes of the Roman people If so many distinct and inde pendent powers did not exactly unite with each other the com plaisance of the senate was prepared to fill up every interval and to supply every deficiency by the most ample concessions The emperors as the first ministers of the republic were exempted from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws they were authorized to convoke the senate to make several motions in the fame day to recommend candidates for the honours of the state to enlarge the bounds of the city to employ the revenue at their discretion to declare peace and war to ratify treaties and by a most comprehensive clause they were impowered to execute whatsoever they should judge advantageous to the empire and agreeable to the majesty of things private or public human or divine Â When all the various powers of executive government were The magis committed to the Imperial magi lrate the ordinary magistrates trates of the commonwealth languished in obscurity without vigour and K 2 almost 0 THE DECLINE AND FALL almost without business The names and forms of the ancient administration were preserved by Augustus with the most anxious care The usual number of consuls prÃ tors and tribunes s were annually invested with their respective ensigns of office and con tinued to discharge some of their least important functions Those honours still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans and the emperors themselves though invested for life with the powers of the consulship frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity which they condescended to share with the most illustrious of their fellow citizens 6 In the election of these magistrates the people during the reign of Augustus were permitted to expose all the incon veniences of a wild democracy That artful prince instead of discovering the least symptom of impatience humbly solicited their suffrages for himself or his friends and scrupulously practised all the duties of an ordinary candidate 7 But we may venture to ascribe to his councils the first measure of the succeeding feign by which the elections were transferred to the senate The as semblies of the people were for ever abolished and the emperors were delivered from a dangerous multitude who without re storing liberty might have disturbed and perhaps endangered the established government By declaring themselves the protectors of the people Marius and CÃ sar had subverted the constitution of their country But as soon as the senate had been humbled and disarmed such an assembly consisting of five or six hundred persons was found1 a very tracta ble and useful instrument of dominion It was on the dignity of the senate that Augustus and his successors founded their new em pire and they affected on every occasion ta adopt the language and principles of Patricians In the administration of their own powers they frequently consulted the great national council and seemed to refer to its decision the most important concerns of peace and war Rome Italy and the internal provinces were subject to the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 69 the immediate jurisdiction of the senate With regard to civil obi jects it was the supreme court of appeal with regard to criminal matters a tribunal constituted for the trial of all offences that were committed by men in any public station or that affected the peace and majesty of the Roman people The exercise of the judicial power became the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate and the important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence As a council of state and as a court of justice the senate possessed very considerably prerogatives but in its legislative capacity in which it was sup posed virtually to represent the people the rights of sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly Every power was derived from their authority every law was ratified by their sanc tion Their regular meetings were held on three stated days in every month the Calends the Nones and the Ides The de bates were conducted with decent freedom and the emperors themselves who gloried in the name of senators fat voted and divided with their equals    â To resume in a few words the system of the Imperial govern General idea ment as it was instituted by Augustus and maintained by those rial system princes who understood their own interest and that of the people it may be defined an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth The masters of the Roman world surrounded their throne with darkness concealed their irre sistible strength and humbly professed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate whose supreme decrees they dictated and 9 The face of the court corresponded with the forms of the admini Court of the stration The emperors if we except those tyrants whose capricious eropero folly

suited only to the rank of an opulent senator Their family however numerous or splendid was composed entirely of their domestic slaves and freedmen â Augustus or Trajaa wsuld have blushed at employing the meanest of the Romans in those menial offices which in the household and bedchamber of a limited monarch are so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of Britain The deification of the emperors  is the only instance in which they departed from their accustomed prudence and mo desty The Asiatic Greeks were the first inventors the suc cessors of Alexander the first objects of this servile and im pious mode of adulation It was easily transferred from the kings to the governors of Asia and the Roman magistrates very fre quently were adored as provincial deities with the pomp of altars and temples of festivals and sacrifices  It was natural that the emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted and the divine honours which both the one and the other received from the provinces attested rather the despotism than the ser vitude of Rome But the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations in the arts of flattery and the imperious spirit of the first Caesar too easily consented to assume during his life time a place among the tutelar deities of Rome The milder temper of his successor declined so dangerous an ambition which was never after wards revived except by the madness of Caligula and Domitian Augustus permitted indeed some of the provincial cities to erect tem ples to his honour on condition that they should associate the wor hip of Rome with that of the sovereign he tolerated private superstition of which he might be the object   but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and people in his human character and wisely left to his successor the care of his public deification OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 7 deification A regular custom was introduced that on the decease of every emperor who had neither lived nor died like a tyrant the senate by a solemn decree should place him in the number of the gods  and the ceremonies of his Apotheosis were blended with those of his funeral This legal and as it should seem injudicious profanation so abhorrent to our stricter principles was received with a very faint murmur 4 by the easy nature of Polytheism but it was received as an institution not of religion but of policy We should disgrace the virtues of the Antonines by comparing them with the vices of Hercules or Jupiter Even the character of CÃ sar or Augustus were far superior to those of the popular deities But Lt was the misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened ager and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a mixture of fable and mystery as the devotion of the vulgar requires As soon as their divinity was established by law it funk into oblivion without contributing either to ther own fame or to the dignity of succeeding princes In the consideration of the Imperial government we have fre Titles of Au quently mentioned the artful founder under his well known title c r nd of Augustus which was not however conferred upon him till the edifice was almost completed The obscure name of Octavianus he derived from a mean family in the little town of Aricia It was stained with the blood of the proscriptions and he was desir ous had it been possible to erase all memory of his former life The illustrious surname of CÃ sar he had assumed as the adopted son of the dictator but he had too much good sense either to hope to be confounded or to wish to be compared with that extraordi nary man It was proposed in the senate to dignify their minister with a new appellation and after a very serious discuflion that of Augustus was chosen among several others as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity which he uni formly affected  Augustus was therefore a personal CÃ sar a family 72 THE DECLINE AND FALL family distinction The former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed and however the latter was diffused by adoption and female alliance Nero was the last prince who could claim so noble an extraction But at the time of his death the practice of a century had inseparably connected those appellations with the Imperial dignity and they have been preserved by a long succes sion of emperors Romans Greeks Franks and Germans from the fall of the republic to the present time A distinction was how ever soon introduced The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the monarch whilst the name of CÃ sar was more freely communicated to his relations and from the reign of Hadrian at least was appropriated to the second person in the state who was considered as the presumptive heir of the empire Character and The tender respect of Augustus for a free constitution which he Augustus had destroyed can only be explained by an attentive consideration of the character of that subtile tyrant A cool head an unfeeling heart and a cowardly disposition prompted him at the age of nineteen to assume the mask of hypocrisy which he never after wards laid aside With the same hand and probably with the same temper he signed the proscription of Cicero and the pardon of Cinna His virtues and even his vices were artificial and according to the various dictates of his interest he was at first the enemy and at last the father of the Roman world  When he framed the artful system of the Imperial authority his moderation was inspired by his fears He wished to deceive the people by an image of civil liberty and the armies by an image of civil govern ment jmageofii  I The death of Caesar was ever before his eyes He had lavished people wealth and honours on his adherents but the most favoured friends of his uncle were in the number of the conspirators The fidelity of the legions might defend his authority against open rebellion  but â their vigilance could not secure his person from the dagger of a deter mined OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 73 mined republican and the Romans who revered the memory of Brutus 17 would applaud the imitation of his virtue CÃ sar had provoked his fate as much by the ostentation of his power as by his power itself The consul or the tribune might have reigned in peace The title of King had armed the Romans against his life Augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to flavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom A feeble senate and enervated people cheerfully acquiesced in the pleasing illusion as long as it was supported by the virtue or by even the prudence of the suc cessors of Augustus It was a motive of self preservation not a principle of liberty that animated the conspirators against Cali gula Nero and Domitian They attacked the person of the tyrant without aiming their blow at the authority of the em peror   There appears indeed one memorable occasion in which the Attempt of senate after seventy years of patience made an ineffectual attempt after the to reassume its long forgotten rights When the throne was va jjgui Â f C cant by the murder of Caligula the consuls convoked that assembly in the Capitol condemned the memory of the CÃ sars gave the watch word liberty to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to their standard and during eight and forty hours acted as the independ ent chiefs of a free commonwealth But while they deliberated the prÃ torian guards had resolved The stupid Claudius brother of Germanicus was already in their camp invested with the Im perial purple and prepared to support his election by arms The dream of liberty was at an end and the senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude Deserted by the people and threat ened by a military force that feeble assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the prÃ torians and to embrace the benefit of an Vol I L amnesty 74 THE DECLINE AND FALL Image os go vernment for ihe ansies Their obe dience amnesty which Claudius had the prudence to offer and the generosity to observe1 II The insolence of the armies inspired Augustus with fears of a still more alarming nature The despair of the citizens could only attempt what the power of the soldiers was at any time able to execute How precarious was his own authority over men whom he had taught to violate every social duty He had heard their seditious clamours he dreaded their calmer moments of reflection One revolution had been purchased by immense rewards j but a second revolution might double those rewards The troops pro fessed the fondest attachment to the house of Caesar but the at tachments of the multitude are capricious and inconstant Au gustus summoned to his aid whatever remained in those fierce minds of Roman prejudices enforced the rigor of discipline by the sanction of law and interposing the majesty of the senate be tween the emperor and the army boldly claimed their allegiance as the first magistrate of the republic During a long period of two hundred and twenty years from the establishment of this artful system to the death of Commodus the dangers inherent to a military government were in a great measure suspended The soldiers were seldom roused to that fatal sense of their own strength and of the weakness of the civil authority which was before and afterwards productive of such dreadful calamities Caligula and Domitian were assassinated in their palace by their own domestics the convulsions which agitated Rome on the death of the former were confined to the walls of the city But Nero involved the whole empire in his ruin In the space of eighteen months four princes perished by the sword and the Roman world was fliaken by the fury of the contending armies Excepting only this short though violent eruption of military licence the two centuries from Augustus to Commodus passed away unstained OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 75 unstnined with civil blood and undisturbed by revolutions The ernperor was elected by the authority of the senate and the consent os the soldiers  The legions respected their oath of fidelity and it requires a minute inspection of the Roman annals to discover three inconsiderable rebellions which were all suppressed in a few months and without even the hazard of a battle 5 In elective monarchies the vacancy of the throne is a moment Designation   _ r of a successor big with danger and mischief The Roman emperors desirous to spare the legions thai interval of suspense and the temptation of an irregular choice invested their designed successor with so large a share of present power as should enable him after their decease to assume the remainder without suffering the empire to perceive the change of masters Thus Augustus after all his fairer prospects Of Tiberius had been snatched from him by untimely deaths rested his last hopes on Tiberius obtained for his adopted son the censorial and tribunitian powers and dictated a law by which the future prince was invested with an authority equal to his own over the provinces and the armies 5 Thus Vespasian subdued the generous mind of Of Titus his eldest son Titus was adored by the eastern legions which under his command had just finished the conquest of JudÃ a His power was dreaded and as his virtues were clouded by the intem perance of youth his designs were suspected Instead of listening to such unworthy suspicions the prudent monarch associated Titus to the full powers of the Imperial dignity and the grateful son ever approved himself the humble and faithful minister of so indul gent a father The good sense of Vespasian engaged him indeed to embrace every The race of measure that might confirm his recent and precarious elevation and the a The military oath and the fidelity of the troops had been conse vian family crated by the habits of an hundred years to the name and family of the

taught the armies to consider the emperors as the creatures of their will and the instruments of their licence The birth of Vespafian was mean his grandfather had been a private soldier his father a petty officer of the revenue 35 his own merit had raised him in an advanced age to the empire but his merit was rather useful than shining and his virtues were disgraced by a strict and even sordid

immediately by a decree of the senate declared him his colleague and successor A Dâ ž 98 jn the empire It is sincerely to be lamented that whilst we are fatigued with the disgustful relation of Nero s crimes and follies we are reduced to collect the actions of Trajan from the glimmer ings of an abridgment or the doubtful light of a panegyric There remains however one panegyric far removed beyond the 7 suspicion OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 77 suspicion of flattery Above two hundred and fifty years after the death of Trajan the senate in pouring out the customary accla mations on the accession of a new emperor wished that he might surpass the felicity of Augustus and the virtue of Trajan We may readily believe that the father of his country hesitated Hadria Z whether he ought to intrust the various characters of his nephew Hadrian with sovereign power In his last moments the arts of the empress Plotina either fixed the irresolution of Trajan or boldly supposed a fictitious adoption 8 the truth of which could not be safely disputed and Hadrian was peaceably acknowledged as his lawful successor Under his reign as has been already mentioned the empire flourished in peace and prosperity He encouraged the arts reformed the laws asserted military discipline and visited all his provinces in person His vast and active genius was equally suited to the most enlarged views and the minute details of civil policy But the ruling passions of his foul were curiosity and vanity As they prevailed and as they were attracted by different objects Hadrian was by turns an excellent prince a ridiculous sophist and a jealous tyrant The general tenor of his conduct deserved praise for its equity and moderation Yet in the first days of his reign he put to death four consular senators his personal enemies and men who had been judged worthy of empire and the tediousness of a painful illness rendered him at last peevish and cruel The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a god or a tyrant and the honours decreed to his memory were granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus 9 The caprice of Hadrian influenced his choice of a succeflor Adoption of  l ie el e a r d After revolving in his mind several men of distinguished merit youngtr whom he esteemed and hated he adopted Ã lius Verus a gay and â voluptuous nobleman recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover of

new CÃ sar  was ravistied from hie embraces by an untimely death He left only one son Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the Antonines He was adopted by Pius and on the accession of Marcus was invested with an equal share of sovereign power Among the many vices of this younger Verus he possessed one virtue a dutiful reverence for his wiser colleague to whom he willingly abandoned the ruder cares of empire The philosophic emperor dissembled his follies lamented his early death and cast a decent veil over his memory Adoption of As soon as Hadrian s passion was either gratified or disappointed tonines he resolved to deserve the thanks of posterity by placing the most exalted merit on the Roman throne His discerning eye easily discovered a senator about fifty years of age

In private life he was an amiable as well as a good man The native simplicity of his virtue was a stranger to vanity or affectation He enjoyed with moderation the conveniencies of his fortune and the innocent pleasures of society  and the be nevolence of his foul displayed itself in a cheerful serenity of temper The virtue of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was of a severer and Of Marcus more laborious kind 4S It was the well earned harvest of many a learned conference of many a patient lecture and many a midnight lucubration At the age of twelve years he embraced the rigid system of the stoics which taught him to submit his body to his mind his passions to his reason to consider virtue as the only good vice as the only evil all things external as things in different46 His meditations composed in the tumult of a camp are still extant and he even condescended to give lessons of philo sophy in a more public manner than suited the modesty of a sageÂ or the dignity of an emperor 7 But his life was the noblest com mentary on the precepts of Zeno He was severe to himself in dulgent to the imperfection of others just and beneficent to all mankind He regretted that Avidius Cassius who excited a re bellion in Syria had disappointed him by a voluntary death of the pleasure of converting an enemy into a friend and he justified the sincerity of that sentiment by moderating the zeal of the senate against 8o THE DECLINE AND FALL against the adherents of the traitor 4 War he detested as the disgrace and calamity of human nature hut when the necessity of a just defence called upon him

Domitian to the accession of Conuriodus The vast extent of the Roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four successive emperors whose characters and authority commanded involuntary respect The forms of the civil administration were carefully preserved by Nerva Trajan Hadrian and the Antonines

their days been capable of enjoying a rational freedom Its precarious The labours of these monarchs were over paid by the immense reward that inseparably waited on their success by the honest pride of virtue and by the exquisite delight of beholding the general happiness of which they were the authors A just but melancholy reflection embittered however the noblest of hu man enjoyments They must often have recollected the instability of a happiness which depended on the character of a single man The fatal moment v as perhaps approaching when some licentious youth or some jealous tyrant would abuse to the destruction that nature OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Bi 0 that absolute power which they had exerted for the benefit of their people The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws might serve to display the virtues but could never correct the vices of the emperor The military force was a blind and irresistible instrument of oppression and the corruption of Roman manners would always supply

In the conduct of those monarebs we may trace the utmost lines of vice and virtue the moist exalted perfection and the meanest degeneracy of our own species The golden age of Trajan and the Antonines

admitted into the great council which had once dictated laws to the earth whose name still gave a sanction to the acts of the monarch and whose authority was so often prostituted to the vilest

the indulgence stoics was unable to eradicate formed at the fame time the most amiable and the only defective part of his character His excellent understanding was often deceived by the unsuspecting goodness of his heart Artful men who study the passions of princes and conceal their own approached his person in the disguise of philosophic sanctity and acquired riches and honours by affecting to despise them  His excessive indulgence to his brother his wife and his son passed the bounds of private virtue and became a public injury by the example and consequences of their vices Faustina the daughter of Pius and the wife of Marcus has been To his wife as much celebrated for her gallantries as for her beauty The Faustm grave simplicity of the philosopher was ill calculated to engage her wanton levity or to fix that unbounded passion for variety which often discovered personal merit in the meanest of mankind  The Cupid of the ancients was in general a very sensual deity and the amours of an empress as they exact on her fide the plainest advances are seldom susceptible of much sentimental delicacy Marcus was the only man in the empire who seemed ignorant or insensible of the irregularities of Faustina which according to the prejudices of every age reflected some disgrace on the injured1 husband He promoted several of her lover6 to posts of honour and profit and during a connexion of thirty years invariably gave 2 her 86 THE DECLINE AND FALl To his son Commodus Accession of the emperor Commodus her proofs of the most tender confidence and of a respect which ended not with her life In his Meditations he thanks the gods who had bestowed on him a wife so faithful so gentle and of such a wonderful simplicity of manners  The obsequious senate at his earnest request declared her a goddess She was represented in her temples with the attributes of Juno Venus and Ceres and it was decreed that on the day of their nuptials the youth of either sex should pay their vows before the altar of their chaste patroness s The monstrous vices of the son have cast a hade on the purity of the father s virtues It has been objected to Marcus that he sacrificed the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a worth less boy and that he chose a successor in his own family rather than in the republic Nothing however was neglected by the an xious father and by the men of virtue and learning whom he summoned to his assistance to expand the narrow mind of young Commodus to correct his growing vices and to render him wor thy of the throne for which he was designed But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dis positions where it is almost superfluous The distasteful lesson of a grave philosopher was in a moment obliterated by the whisper of a profligate favourite and Marcus himself blasted the fruits of this laboured education by admitting his son at the age of fourteen or fifteen to a full participation of the Imperial power He lived but four years afterwards but he lived long enough to repent a rash measure which raised the impetuous youth above the restraint of reason and authority Most of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society are produced by the restraints which the necessary but unequal laws of property have imposed on the appetites of mankind by con fining to a few the possession of those objects that are coveted by many Of all our passions the love of power is of the most im perious OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 87 perious and unsociable nature since the pride of one man requires the submission of the multitude In the tumult of civil discord the laws of society lose their force and their place is seldom sup plied by those of humanity The ardor of contention the pride of victory the despair of success the memory of past injuries and the fear of future dangers all contribute to inflame the mind and to silence the voice of pity From such motives almost every page of history has been stained with civil blood but these motives will not account for the unprovoked cruelties of Commodus who had nothing to wish and every thing to enjoy The beloved son of a D 18a Marcus succeeded to his father amidst the acclamations of the se nate and armies 6 and when he ascended the throne the happy youth saw round him neither competitor to remove nor enemies to punish In this calm elevated station it was surely natural that he should prefer the love of mankind to their detestation the mild glories of his five predecessors to the ignominious fate of Nero and Domitian Yet Commodus was not as he has been represented a tiger born character of with an insatiate thirst of human blood and capable from his Commodau infancy of the most inhuman actions 7 Nature had formed him of a weak rather than a wicked disposition His simplicity and timidity rendered him the slave of his attendants who gradually corrupted his mind His cruelty which at first obeyed the dictates of others degenerated into habit and at length became the ruling passion of the foul8 Upon the death of his father Commodus found himself em He returns tan barrassed with the command of a great army and the conduct of a

compared the tranquillity the splendor the refined pleasures of Rome with the tumult of a Pannonian camp â which afforded neither leisure nor materials for luxury  Corn modus listened to the pleasing advice but whilst he hesitated be tween his own inclination and the awe which he still retained For Iris father s counsellors the summer insensibly elapsed and his triumphal entry into the capital was deferred till the autumn His graceful person popular address and imagined virtues at tracted the public favour the honourable peace which he had just granted to the barbarians diffused an universal joy M his impa tience to revisit Rome was fondly ascribed to the love of his country and his dissolute course of amusements was faintly condemned in a prince of nineteen years of age During the three first years of his reign the forms and even the spirit of the old administration was maintained by those faith ful counsellors to whom Marcus had recommended his son and for whose wisdom and integrity Commodus still entertained a re luctant esteem The young prince and his profligate favourites re velled in all the licence of sovereign power but his hands were yet unstained with blood and he had even displayed a generosity of sentiment which might perhaps have ripened into solid virtue A fatal incident decided his fluctuating character Is wounded 0 e evening as the emperor was returning to

of wealth stimulated the diligence of the informers rigid virtue implied a tacit censure of the irregularities of Commodus important services implied a dangerous superiority of merit and the friendship of the father always ensured the aver sion of the son Suspicion was equivalent to proof Trial to condemnation The execution of a considerable senator was at tended with the death of all who

recoiled on the principal instrument of his cruelty Whilst Commodus was immersed in blood and luxury he devolved the detail of the public business on Perennis  a servile and ambitious minister who had obtained his post by the murder of his predecessor but who possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability By acts of extortion and the forfeited estates of the nobles sacrificed to his avarice he had accumulated an immense treasure The PrÃ torian guard s were under his immediate command and his son who already discovered a military genius was at the head of the Illyrian legions Perennis aspired to the empire or what in the eyes of Commodus amounted to the fame crime he was capable of aspiring to it had he not been prevented surprised and put to t8ty death The fall of a minister is a very trifling incident in the general history of the empire but it was hastened by an extra ordinary circumstance which proved how much the nerves of dis cipline were already relaxed The legions of Britain discontented with the administration of Perennis formed a deputation of fifteen hundred select men with instructions to march to Rome and lay their OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE â their complaints before the emperor These military petitioners by their own determined behaviour by inflaming the divisions of the guards by exaggerating the strength of the British army and by alarming the fears of Commodus exacted and obtained the mi nister s death as the only redress of their grievances 7 This presumption of a distant army and their discovery of the weakness of government was a sure presage of the most dreadful convul sions The negligence of the public administration was betrayed soon afterwards by a new disorder which arose from the smallest begin nings A spirit of desertion began to prevail among the troops and the deserters instead of seeking their safety in flight or conceal ment infested the highways Maternus a private soldier of a daring boldness above his station collected these bands of robbers into a little army set open the prisons invited the slaves to assert their freedom and plundered with impunity the rich and defence less cities of Gaul and Spain The governors of the provinces who had long been the spectators and perhaps the partners of his de predations were at length roused from their supine indolence by the threatening commands of the emperor Maternus found that he was encompassed and foresaw that he must be overpowered A great effort of despair was his last resource He ordered his fol lowers to disperse to pass the Alps in small parties and various disguises and to assemble at Rome during the licentious tumult of the festival of Cybele 8 To murder Commodus and to ascend the vacant throne was the ambition of no vulgar robber His measures

have regained the affection and confidence of his subjects l8 But every sentiment of virtue and humanity was extinct in the mind of Commodus Whilst he thus abandoned the reins of em pire to these unworthy favourites he valued noting in sovereign power except the unbounded licence of indulging his sensual appe tites His hours were spent in a seraglio of three hundred beautiful women and as many boys of every rank and of every province and if the arts of seduction were ineffectual the brutal lover had recourse to violence The ancient historians 9 have expatiated on these abandoned scenes of prostitution which scorned every restraint of nature or modesty  but it would not be easy to translate their too faithful descriptions into the decency of modern language The intervals of lust were filled up with the basest amusements The influence of a polite age and the labour of an attentive education had never been able to infuse into his rude and brutish mind the least tincture of learning

of music and poetry nor should we despise his pursuits had he not converted the pleasing relaxation of a leisure hour into the serious business and ambition of his life But Commodus from his earliest infancy discovered an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal and a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace the sports of the circus and amphitheatre the combats of gladiators and the hunting of wild beasts The masters in every branch of learning whom Marcus provided for his son were heard with in attention and disgust whilst the Moors and Parthians who taught him to dart the javelin and to shoot with the bow found a disciple who delighted in his application and soon equalled the most skil ful of his instructors in the steadiness of the eye and the dexterity of the hand

beneficial labours of heroism In the civilized state of the Ro man empire the wild beasts had long since retired from the face of men and the neighbourhood of populous cities To surprise them in their solitary haunts and to transport them to Rome that they might be slain in pomp by the hand of an emperor was an enter prise equally ridiculous for the prince and oppressive for the peo ple Â Ignorant

entangle with the other to dis patch his enemy If he missed the first throw he was obliged to fly from the pursuit of the Secutor till he had prepared his net for a second cast 7 The emperor fought in this character seven hundred and thirty five several times These glorious achievements were carefully recorded in the public acts of the empire and that he might omit no circumstance of infamy he received from the com mon fund of gladiators a stipend so exorbitant that it became a new and most ignominious tax upon the Roman people j8 It may be easily supposed that in these engagements the master of the world was always successful in the amphitheatre his victories were not often sanguinary but when he exercised his skill in the school of gladiators or his own palace his wretched

ferocious spirit was irritated by the consciousness of that hatred by the envy of every kind of merit by the just apprehension of danger and by the habit of slaughter which he contracted in his daily

193 and the commencement or the new year the senators expected a istjanua y fummons to attend an ignominious ceremony In spite of all remon strances even of those of his creatures who yet preserved any re gard for prudence or decency Commodus had resolved to pass the night in the gladiators school and from thence to take possession of the consulship in the habit and with the attendance of that infa mous crew On a sudden before the break of day the senate was called together in the temple of Concord to meet the guards and to ratify the election of a new emperor For a few minutes they fat in silent suspence doubtful of their unexpected deliverance and suspicious of the cruel artifices of Commodus but when at length they were assured that the tyrant was no more they resigned themr selves to all the transports of joy and indignation Pertinax who modestly represented the meanness of his extraction and pointed out several noble senators more deserving than himself of the empire was constrained by their dutiful violence to ascend the throne and received all the titles of Imperial power confirmed by the most The memory sincere vows of fidelity The memory of Commodus was branded modus de with eternal infamy The names of tyrant of gladiator of public enemy resounded in every corner of the house They decreed in tumultuous votes that his honours should be reversed his titles erased from the public monuments his statues thrown down his body dragged with a hook into the stripping room of the gladiators to satiate the public fury and they expressed some indignation against those officious servants who had already presumed to screen his remains from the justice of the senate But Pertinax could not refuse those last rites to the memory of Marcus and the tears of his first protector Claudius Pompeianus who lamented the cruel fate dared infa mous 1 1 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IOI fate of his brother in law and lamented still more that he had de served it 7 These effusions of impotent raere against a dead emperor whom the Legal juris r o o  diction of th senate had flattered when alive with the most abject servility betrayed senate over  11 â n â i r the emperor a spirit of revenge more agreeable to justice than to generouty The legality of these decrees was however supported by the prin ciples of the Imperial constitution To censure to depose or to punisli with death the first magistrate of the republic who had abused his delegated trust was the ancient and undoubted preroga tive of the Roman senate but that feeble assembly was obliged to content itself with inflicting on a fallen tyrant that public justice from which during his life and reign he had been shielded by the strong arm of military despotism Pertinax found a nobler way of condemning his predecessor s virtues of memory by the contrast of his own virtues with the vices of Pertinax Commodus On the day of his accession he resigned over to his wife and son his whole private fortune that they might have no pretence to solicit favours at the expence of the state He refused to flatter the vanity of the former with the title of Augusta or to corrupt the inexperienced youth of the latter by the rank of CÃ sar Accurately distinguishing between the duties of a parent and those of a sovereign he educated his son with a severe simplicity which while it gave him no assured prospect of the throne might in time have rendered him worthy of it In public the behaviour of Pertinax was grave and affable He lived with the virtuous part of the senate and in a private station he had been acquainted with the true cha racter of each individual without either pride or jealousy con sidered them as friends and companions with whom he had shared the dangers of the tyranny and with whom he wished to enjoy the security of the present time He very frequently invited them to familiar entertainments the frugality of which was ridiculed by those THE DECLINE AND FALL those who remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of Commodus  To heal as far as it was possible the wounds inflicted by the hand of tyranny was the pleasing but melancholy task of Pertinax The innocent victims who yet survived were recalled from exile re leased from prison a d restored to the full possession of their ho nours and fortunes The unburied bodies of murdered senators for the cruelty of Commodus endeavoured to extend itself beyond death were deposited in the sepulchres of their ancestors their me mory was justified and every consolation was bestowed on their ruined and afflicted families Among these consolations one of the most delicious was the punishment of the Delators the common enemies of their master of virtue and of their country Yet even in the inquisition of these legal assassins Pertinax proceeded with a steady temper which gave every thing to justice and nothing to popular prejudice and resentment The finances of the state demanded the most vigilant care of the emperor Though every measure of injustice and extortion had been adopted which could collect the property of the subject into the coffers of the prince the rapaciousness of Commodus had been so very inadequate to his extravagance that upon his death no more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted trea sury 5Â to defray the current expences of government and to dis charge the pressing demand of a_ liberal donative which the new emperor had been obliged to promise to the PrÃ torian guards Yet under these distressed circumstances Pertinax had the generous firm ness to remit all the oppressive taxes invented by Commodusj and to cancel all the unjust claims of tfeec treasury declaring in a decree of the senate  that he was better satisfied to administer a poor re  public with innocence than to acquire riches by the ways of ty  ranny and dishonour Oeconomy and industry he considered as the 7 pure OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE pure and genuine sources of wealth and from them he soon derived a copious supply for the public necessities The expence of the household was immediately reduced to one half All the instru ments of luxury Pertinax exposed to public auction gold and silver plate chariots of a singular construction a superfluous ward robe of silk and embroidery and a great number of beautiful staves of both sexes excepting only with attentive humanity those who were born in a state of freedom and had been ravished from the arms of their weeping parents At the fame time that he obliged the worthless favourites of the tyrant to resign a part of their ill gotten wealth he satisfied the just creditors of the state and dis charged the long arrears of honest services He removed the oppres sive restrictions which had been laid upon commerce and granted all the uncultivated lands in Italy and the provinces to those who would improve them with an exemption from all tribute during the term of ten years  Such an uniform conduct had already secured to Pertinax the no and popu blest reward of a sovereign the love and esteem of his people mr Those who remembered the virtues of Marcus were pleased to con template in their new emperor the features of that bright original and flattered themselves that they should long enjoy the benign influence of his administration A hasty zeal to reform the cor rupted stater accompanied with less prudence than might have beer expected from the years and experience of Pertinax was fatal to himself and to his country His honest indiscretion united against him the servile crowd who found their private benefit in the pub lic disorders and who preferred the favour of a tyrant to the inex orable equality of the laws Amidst the general joy the sullen and angry countenance of the Discontent of Praatorian guards

with a design to carry him to the camp and to invest him with the Imperial purple Instead of be ing dazzled by the dangerous honour the affrighted victim escaped from their violence and took refuge at the feet of Pertinax A short time afterwards Sosius Falco one of the consuls of the year a rash youth 54 but of an ancient and opulent family listened to the voice of ambition and a conspiracy was formed during a fliort absence of Pertinax which was crushed by his sudden return to Rome and his resolute behaviour Falco was on the point of be ing justly condemned to death as a public enemy had he not been saved by the earnest and sincere entreaties of the injured emperor who conjured the senate that the purity of his reign might not be stained by the blood even of a guilty senator These disappointments served only to irritate the rage of the Prae torian guards On the twenty eighth of March eighty six days only after the death of Commodus a general sedition broke out in the camp which the officers wanted either power or inclination to sup press Two or three hundred of the most desperate soldiers marched at noon day with arms in their hands and fury in their looks to wards the Imperial palace The gates were thrown open by their companions upon guard and by the domestics of the old court who had already formed a secret conspiracy against the life of the too virtuous emperor On the news of their approach Pertinax disdaining either flight or concealment advanced to meet his assassins and recalled to their minds his own innocence and the sanctity of their recent oath For a few moments they stood in silent suspence astiamed of their atrocious design and awed by the venerable aspect and majestic firmness of their sovereign till at length the despair of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE of pardon reviving their fury a barbarian of the country of Tongres51 levelled the first blow against Pertinax who was instantly dispatched with a multitude of wounds His head separated from his body

to assemble and those who had been the distinguished friends of Pertinax or the personal enemies of Julian found it necessary to affect a more than common share of satisfaction at this happy revo

performances of Pylades a celebrated dancer Yet it was observed that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed and left him to darkness solitude and terrible reflection he passed a sleepless night revolving most probably in his mind his own rash folly the fate of his virtuous predecessor and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire which had not been deserved by merit but purchased by money The public He had reason to tremble On the throne of the world he found discontent jjjmfe f without a friend and even without an adherent The guards themselves were ashamed of the prince whom

secure in their numbers and obscurity gave a free vent to their paffions The streets and public places of Rome resounded with clamours and imprecations The enraged multitude affronted the person of

generals of the respective armies Clodius Albinus Pescennius Niger and Septimius Severus were still more anxious to succeed than to revenge the murdered Pertinax Their forces were exactly balanced Each of them was at the head of three legions  with a numerous train of auxiliaries and however different in their characters they were all soldiers of experience and capacity Clodius Albinus governor of Britain surpassed both his compe ciodius Al titors in the nobility of his extraction which he derived from some bi 0US in Bri tain of the most illustrious names of the old republic 6 But the branch

bad acquired with the father is a proof at least that he was possessed of a very flexible disposition The favour of a tyrant does not always sup pose a want of merit in the object of it he may without in tending it reward a man of worth and ability or he may find such a man useful to his own service It does not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus either as the minister of his cruelties or even as the associate of his pleasures He was employed in a dis tant honourable command when he received a confidential letter from the emperor acquainting him of the treasonable designs of some discontented generals and authorizing him to declare himself the guardian and successor of the throne by assuming the title and ensigns of CÃ sar 8 The governor of Britain wisely declined the

the consular government and declared his firm resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal authority This popular harangue was answered by the loud accla mations of the British legions and received at Rome with a secret murmur of applause Safe in the possession ofihis little world and in the command of an army less distinguished indeed for discipline than for numbers and valour  Albinus braved the menaces of Commodus OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 113 Commodus maintained towards Pertinax a stately ambiguous reserve and instantly declared against the usurpation of Julian The convul sions of the capital added new weight to his sentiments or rather to his professions of patriotism A regard to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus and Emperor and he imitated perhaps the example of Galba who on a similar occasion had styled himself the Lieutenant of the senate and people Personal merit alone had raised Pescennius Niger from an obscure Pescennius birth and station to the government of Syria a lucrative and im sy fj m portant command which in times of civil confusion gave him a near prospect of the throne Yet his parts seem to have been better suited to the second than to the first rank he was an unequal rival though he might have approved himself an excellent lieutenant to Severus who had sufficient greatness of mind to adopt several useful institutions from a vanquished enemy In his government Niger acquired the esteem of the soldiers and the love of the pro vincials His rigid discipline fortified the valour and confirmed the obedience of the former whilst the voluptuous Syrians were less delighted with the mild firmness of his administration than with the affability of his manners and the apparent pleasure with which he attended their frequent and pompous festivals  As soon as the intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached Antioch the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial purple and revenge his death The legions of the eastern frontier embraced his cause the opulent but unarmed provinces from the frontiers of Ã thiopia  to the Hadriatic cheerfully submitted to his power and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates congratulated his election and offered him their homage and services The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this sudden tide of fortune he flattered himself that his

during the whole march Advancing with a steady and rapid course he passed without difficulty the defiles of the Apennine received into his party the troops and ambassadors sent to retard his progress and made a short halt at Interamnia about seventy miles from Rome His victory was already secure but the despair of the PrÃ torians might have rendered it bloody and Severus had the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing the sword 5 His emissaries dispersed in the capital assured the guards that provided they would abandon their worthless prince and the perpetrators of the murder of Pertinax to the justice of the conqueror he would no longer consider that melancholy event as the act of the whole body The faithless PrÃ torians whose re sistance was supported only by sullen obstinacy gladly complied with the easy conditions seized the greatest part of the assassins and signified to the senate that they no longer defended the cause of Julian That assembly convoked by the consul unanimously acknowledged Severus as lawful emperor decreed divine honours to Pertinax and pronounced a sentence of deposition and death against his unfortunate successor Julian was conducted into a private apart and con demned and ment of the baths of the palace and beheaded as a common criminal executed by after having purchased with an immense treasure an anxious and senate

temper of the provinces 7 Disgrace of The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures the guards 10 one dictated by policy the other by decency the revenge and the honours due to the memory of Pertinax Before the new emperor entered Rome he issued his commands to the PrÃ torian guards directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the city without arms but in the habits of ceremony in which they were accustomed to attend their sovereign He was obeyed by those haughty troops whose contrition was the effect of their just terrors A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with levelled spears Incapable of flight or resistance they ex pected their fate in silent consternation Severus mounted the tribunal sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice dismissed them with ignominy from the trust they had betrayed despoiled them of their splendid ornaments and banished them on pain of death to the distance of an hundred miles from the capital During the transaction another detachment had been sent to seize their arms occupy their camp and prevent the hasty consequences of their despair 38 Funeral and yjjg funeral and consecration of Pertinax was next solemnized apotheosis or Pertinax with every circumstance of fad magnificence 39 The senate with a melancholy pleasure performed the last rites to that excellent prince whom they had loved and still regretted The concern of his successor was probably less sincere He esteemed the virtues of Pertinax but those virtues would for ever have confined his ambition to a private station Severus pronounced his funeral oration with studied eloquence inward satisfaction and well acted sorrow and by this pious regard to his memory convinced the credulous mul titude that he alone was worthy to supply his place Sensible however that arms not ceremonies must assert his claim to the empire OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ir9 193â 197 empire he left Rome at the end of thirty days and without suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory prepared to en counter his more formidable rivals The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an Success of oeverus elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the against Ni 0 ger and a CÃ sars  The parallel is at least imperfect Where shall we gainst Aibi find in the character of Severus the commanding superiority of soul the generous clemency and the various genius which could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure the thirst of knowledge and the fire of ambition 1 In one instance only they may be com pared with some degree of propriety in the celerity of their mo tions and their civil victories In less than four years  Severu6 A D subdued the riches of the east and the valour of the west He vanquished two competitors of reputation and ability and defeated numerous armies provided with weapons and discipline equal to his own In that age the art of fortification and the principles of tactics were well understood by all the Roman generals and the constant superiority of Severus was that of an artist who uses the fame instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals I fliall not however enter into a minute narrative of these mili tary operations but as the two civil wars against Niger and against Albinus were almost the fame in their conduct event and consequences I shall collect into one point of view the most striking circumstances tending to develope the character of the con queror and the state of the empire Falsehood and insincerity unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of public transactions offend us with a less degrading idea of mean ness than when they are found in the intercourse of private life In the latter they discover a want of courage in the other only a defect of power and as it is impossible for the most able statesmen to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength the world under the name of policy seems to have granted Conduct of the two civil wars Ar s of Several THE DECLINE AND FALL granted them a very liberal indulgence of craft a nd dissimulation Yet the arts of Severus cannot be justified by the most ample pri vileges of state reason He promised only to betray he flattered only to ruin and however he might occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties his conscience obsequious to his interest always released him from the inconvenient obligation 4 If these two competitors reconciled by their common danger had advanced upon him without delay perhaps Severus would have funk under their united effort Had they even attacked him at the fame time with separate views and separate armies the contest might have been long and doubtful But they fell singly and suc cessively an easy prey to the arts as well as arms of their subtle enemy lulled into security by the moderation of his professions and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action He first marched against Niger whose reputation and power he the most dreaded but he declined any hostile declarations suppressed the name of his antagonist and only signified to the senate and people his intention of regulating the eastern provinces In private he spoke of Niger his old friend and intended successor 4 with the most affectionate regard and highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of Pertinax To punish the vile usurper of the throne was the duty of every Roman general To persevere in arms and to resist a lawful emperor acknowledged by the senate would alone render him criminal4J The sons of Niger had fallen into his hands among the children of the provincial governors detained at Rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents 6 As long as the power of Niger inspired terror or even respect they were educated with the most tender care with the children of Severus himself but they were soon involved in their father s ruin and removed first by exile and afterwards by death from the eye of public compassion 1 1 Whilst OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE izt Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war he had reason to swards Al Dill US apprehend that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the Alps occupy the vacant feat of empire and oppose his return with the authority of the senate and the forces of the west The ambiguous conduct of Albinus in not assuming the Imperial title left room for negociation Forgetting at once his professions of patriotism and the jealousy of sovereign power he accepted the precarious rank of Caesar as a reward for his fatal neutrality Till the first contest was decided Severus treated the man whom he had doomed to destruction with every mark of esteem and re gard Even in the letter in which he announced his victory over Niger he styles Albinus the brother of his soul and empire fends him the affectionate salutations of his wife Julia and his young family and intreats him to preserve the armies and the republic faithful to their common interest The messengers charged with this letter were instructed to accost the CÃ sar with respect to de sire a private audience and to plunge their daggers into his heart s The conspiracy was discovered and the too credulous Albinus at length passed over to the continent and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival who rushed upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army The military labours of Severus seem inadequate to the import Event of the ance of his conquests Two engagements the one near the Helles civi1 warfÂ pont the other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia decided the fate of his Syrian competitor and the troops of Europe asserted their usual ascendant over the effeminate natives of Asia 49 The battle of Lyons where one hundred and fifty thousand Romans s were engaged was equally fatal to Albinus The valour of the British army maintained indeed a sharp and doubtful contest with the hardy discipline of the lllyrian legions The fame and person of Severus appeared during a few moments irrecoverably lost till  that warlike prince rallied his fainting troops and led them on to a Vol I R decisive THE DEC LINE AND FALL decisive victoryThe war was finished by that memorable day decided by The civil wars of modern Europe have been distinguished not battles only by the fierce animosity but likewise by the obstinate perseve rance of the contending factions They have generally been jus tified by some principle or at least coloured by some pretext of religion freedom or loyalty The leaders Were nobles of indepen dent property and hereditary influence The troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused throughout the whole com munity a vanquished chief was immediately supplied with new adherents eager to shed their blood in the same cause But the Romans after the fall of the republic combated only for the choice of masters Under the standard of a popular candidate for empire a few inlisted from affection some from fear many from interest none from principle The legions uninflamed by party zeal were allured into civil war by liberal donatives and still more liberal promises A defeat by disabling the chief from the performance of his engagements dissolved the mercenary allegi ance of his followers and left them to consult their own safety by a timely desertion of an unsuccessful cause It was of little moment to the provinces under whose name they were oppressed or governed they were driven by the impulsion of the present power and as soon as that power yielded to a superior force they hastened to implore the clemency of the conqueror who as he had an im mense debt to discharge was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers In the vast extent of the Roman empire there were few fortified cities capable of protecting a routed army nor was there any person or family or order of inen whose natural interest unsupported by the powers of govern ment was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party 5 Yet OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 1 3 Yet in the contest between Niger and Severus one city deserves an sie2e of Byzantium honourable exception As Byzantium was one of the greatest passages from Europe into Asia it had been provided with a strong garrison and a fleet of five hundred vessels anchored in the harbour The impetuosity of Severus disappointed this prudent scheme of defence he left to his generals the siege of Byzantium forced the less guarded passage of the Hellespont and impatient of a meaner enemy pressed forward to encounter his rival Byzantium attacked by a numerous and increasing army and afterwards by the whole naval power of the empire sustained a siege of three years and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger The citizens and soldiers we know not from what cause were animated with equal fury se veral of the principal officers of Niger who despaired of or who disdained a pardon had thrown themselves into this last refuge the fortifications were esteemed impregnable and in the defence of the place a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic powers known to the ancients s Byzantium at length surrendered to famine The magistrates and soldiers were put to the sword the walls demolished the privileges suppressed and the destined capital of the east subsisted only as an open village subject to the insulting jurisdiction of Perinthus The historian Dion who had admired the flourishing and lamented the desolate state of Byzantium ac cused the revenge of Severus for depriving the Roman people of the strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia 5 The truth of this observation was but too well justified in the succeeding age when the Gothic fleets covered the Euxine and passed through the undefended Bosphorus into the center of the Me diterranean Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in Deaths of their flight from the field of battle Their fate excited neither Jgd surprise nor compassion They had staked their lives against the Cruel conse_   Â quenccs of chance of empire and suffered what they would have inflicted the civil wars R 2 nor THE DECLINE AND FALL nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a private station But his unforgiving temper stimulated by avarice indulged a spirit of revenge where there was no room for apprehension The most considerable of the pro vincials who without any dislike to the fortunate candidate had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were accidentally placed were punished by death exile and especially by the con fiscation of their estates Many cities of the east were stript of their ancient honours and obliged to pay into the treasury of Severus four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for the ser vice of Niger S Till the final decision of the war the cruelty of Severus was in some measure restrained by the uncertainty of the event and his pretended reverence for the senate The head of Albinus accom panied with a menacing letter announced to the Romans that he was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate com petitors He was irritated by the just suspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the senate and he concealed his old male volence under the recent discovery of some treasonable correspond ences Thirty five senators however accused of having favoured the party of Albinus he freely pardoned and by his subsequent behaviour endeavoured to convince them that he had forgotten as well as forgiven their supposed offences But at the fame time he condemned forty one 57 other senators whose names history has recorded their wives children and clients attended them in death and the noblest provincials of Spain and Gaul were in volved in the fame ruin Such rigid justice for so he termed it was in the opinion of Severus the only conduct capable of ensur ing peace to the people or stability to the prince and he con descended slightly to lament that to be mild it was necessary that he should first be cruel s The OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 125 The true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with The wisdom Â  and just ce of that of his people Their numbers their wealth their order and hi their security are the best and only foundations of his real greatness j and were he totally devoid of virtue prudence might supply its place and would dictate the fame rule of conduct Severus con sidered the Roman empire as his property and had no sooner se cured the possession than he bestowed his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition Salutary laws executed with inflexible firmness soon corrected most of the abuses with which since the death of Marcus every part of the govern ment had been infected In the administration of justice the judge ments of the emperor were characterized by attention discern ment and impartiality and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity it was generally in favour of the poor and oppressed not so much indeed from any sense of humanity as from the natural propensity of a despot to humble the pride of greatness and to fink all his subjects to the fame common level of absolute depend ence His expensive taste for building magnificent shows and above all a constant and liberal distribution of corn and provisions were the surest means of captivating the affection of the Roman people59 The misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated The General calm of peace and prosperity was once more experienced in the pro prosperity vinces and many cities restored by the munificence of Severus assumed the title of his colonies and attested by public monuments their gratitude and felicity The fame of the Roman arms was revived by that warlike and successful emperor 6 and he boasted with a just pride that having received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic wars he left it established in profound univer sal and honourable peace Although the wounds of civil war appeared completely healed its Relaxation of mortal poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution Severus j n 7 d su possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability j but the daring foul â I26 THE DECLINE AND FALL soul of the first CÃ sar or the deep policy of Augustus were scarcely equal to the task of curbing the insolence of the victorious legions By gratitude by misguided policy by seeming necessity Severus was induced to relax the nerves of discipline 6 The vanity of his soldiers was flattered with the honour of wearing gold rings their ease indulged in the permission of living with their wives in the idleness of quarters He increased their pay beyond the example of former times and taught them to expect and soon to claim ex traordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or fes tivity Elated by success enervated by luxury and raised above the level of subjects by their dangerous privileges they soon be came incapable of military fatigue oppressive to the country and impatient of a just subordination Their officers asserted the supe riority of rank by a more profuse and elegant luxury There is still extant a letter of Severus lamenting the licentious state of the army and exhorting one of his generals to begin the necessary re formation from the tribunes themselves since as he justly observes the officer who has forfeited the esteem will never command the obedience of his soldiers 6f Had the emperor pursued the train of reflection he would have discovered that the primary cause of this general corruption might be ascribed not indeed to the example but to the pernicious indulgence however of the commander in chief New

was soon re stored on a new model by Severus and increased to four times the ancient number Formerly these troops had been recruited in Italy and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the softer manners of Rome the levies were extended to Macedonia Noricum and Spain In the room of these elegant troops better adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war it was established by 3 Severus OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE J27 Severus that from all the legions of the frontiers the soldiers most distinguished for strength valour and fidelity should be occasionally draughted and promoted as an honour and reward into the more eligible service of the guards 67 By this new institution the Italian youth were diverted from the exercise of arms and the capital was terrified by the strange aspect and manners of a multitude of bar barians But Severus flattered himself that the legions would con sider the chosen PrÃ torians as the representatives of the whole mili tary order and that the present aid of fifty thousand men superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be brought into the field against them would for ever crush the hopes of rebellion and secure the empire to himself and

torian prÃ fect who in his origin had been a simple captain of the guards was placed not only at the head of the army but of the finances and even of the law In every department of administration he represented the person and exercised the authority of the emperor The first prÃ fect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus the favou rite minister of Severus His reign lasted above ten years till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the emperor which seemed to assure his fortune proved the occasion of his ruin68 The animosities of the palace by irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus threatened to produce a revolution and obliged the emperor who still loved him to consent with reluctance to his death 69 After the fall of Plautianus an

instituted by Augustus But the youth of Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps and his riper years spent in the despotism of military command His haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover or would not acknowledge the advantage of preserving an intermediate power however imaginary between the emperor and the army He disdained to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his person and trembled at his frown he issued his commands where his request would have proved as effectual assumed the conduct and style of a sovereign and a conqueror and

its declining authority on the frail and crumbling basis of ancient opinion The sine theory of a republic insensibly vanished and made way for the more natural and sub stantial feelings of monarchy As the freedom and honours of Rome were successively communicated to the provinces in which the old government had been either unknown or was remembered with abhorrence the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obli terated The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines 70 ob serve with a malicious pleasure that although the sovereign of Rome in compliance with an obsolete prejudice abstained from the name of king he possessed the full measure of regal power In the reign of Severus the senate was silled with polished and eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces who justified personal flattery by specu lative principles of servitude These new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the court and with patience by the people when they inculcated the duty of passive obedience and des canted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom The lawvers and the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the historians concurred in teaching that the Imperial authority was held not by the delegated

favourite virtue of the empress Julia 8   Two sons Caracalla 9 and Geta were the fruit of this marriage Their two and the destined heirs of the empire The fond hopes of the father Genu and of the Roman world were soon disappointed by these vain youths who displayed the indolent security of hereditary princes  and a presumption that fortune would supply the place of merit and application Without any emulation of virtue or talents they dis covered almost from their infancy a fixed and implacable antipa thy for each other Their aversion confirmed by years and so Their mutual mented by

Caledo In these circumstances the intelligence of a war in Britain and of A D 208 an invasion of the province by the barbarians of the North was re ceived with pleasure by Severus Though the vigilance of his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant enemy he resolved to embrace the honourable pretext of withdrawing his sons from the luxury of Rome which enervated their minds and irritated their passions and of inuring their youth to the toils of war and government Notwithstanding his advanced age for he was above three score and his gout which obliged him to be carried in a litter he transported himself in person into that remote island attended by his two sons his whole court and a formidable army He immediately passed the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus and entered the enemy s country with the design of completing the long attempted conquest of Britain He penetrated to the northern extremity of the island without meeting an enemy But the concealed ambuscades of the Caledonians who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army the coldness of the climate and the severity of a winter march across the hills and morasses of Scotland are reported to have cost the Romans above fifty thousand men The Caledonians at length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack sued for peace and sur rendered a part of their arms and a large tract of territory But their apparent submission lasted no longer than the present terror As soon as the Roman legions had retired they resumed their hostile inde OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE i I independence Their restless spirit provoked Severus to fend a new army into Caledonia with the most bloody orders not to subdue but to extirpate the natives They were saved by the death of their haughty enemy  This Caledonian war neither marked by decisive events nor at Fingal and tended with any important consequences would ill deserve our at tention but it is supposed not without a considerable degree of probability that the invasion of Severus is connected with the most shining period of the British history or fable Fingal whose fame with that of his heroes and bards has been revived in our language by a recent publication is said to have commanded the Caledonians at that memorable juncture to have eluded the power of Severus and to have obtained a signal victory on the banks of the Carun in which the son of the King of the World Caracul fled from his arms along the fields of his pride Something of a doubtful mist still hangs over these Highland traditions nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most ingenious researches of modern criticism  but if we could with Contrast of safety indulge the pleasing supposition that Fingal lived and that Oslian niau and the sung the striking contrast of the situation and manners of the con Romans tending nations might amuse a philosophic mind The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more civilized people if we compared the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla with the bravery the tenderness the elegant genius of Oslian the mercenary chiefs who from motives of fear or interest served under the Imperial stand ard with the freeborn warriors who started to arms at the voice of the king of Morven if in a word we contemplated the untutored Cale donians glowing with the

the rigour of a judge dissolves away in the tenderness of a parent He deliberated he threatened but he could not punish t and this last and only instance of mercy was more fa tal to the empire than a long series of cruelty 5 The disorder of his mind irritated the pains of his body he wished impatiently for death and hastened the instant of it by his impatience He ex pired at York in the sixty

heart or even the understanding of the impetuous youths but the more obedient troops mindful of their oath of allegiance and of the authority of their deceased master resisted the solicitations of

innocent victim of his brother s ambition without recollecting that he himself wanted power rather than in clination to consummate the same attempts of revenge and murder The crime went not unpunished Neither business nor pleasure Remorse and cruelty of nor flattery could defend Caracalla from the stings of a guilty con Caracalia science and he confessed in the anguish of a tortured mind that his disordered fancy often beheld the angry forms of his father and his brother rising into life to threaten and upbraid him s The consciousness of his crime should have induced him to convince mankind by the virtues of his reign that the bloody deed had been the involuntary effect of fatal necessity But the repentance of Cara calla only prompted him to remove from the world whatever could remind him of his guilt or recall the memory of his murdered bro ther On his return from the senate to the palace he found his mother in the company of several noble matrons weeping over the untimely fate of her younger son The jealous emperor threatened them with instant death the sentence was executed against Fadilla the last remaining daughter of the emperor Marcus and even the afflicted Julia was obliged to silence her lamentations to suppress her sighs and to receive the assassin with smiles of joy and appro bation It was computed that under the vague appellation of the friends of Geta above twenty thousand persons of both sexes suf fered death His guards and freedmen the ministers of his seri ous business and the companions of his looser hours those who by his interest had been promoted to any commands in the army or provinces with the long connected chain of their dependants were included in the proscription which endeavoured to reach every one who had maintained the smallest

able witticism 17 It was a sufficient crime of Thrasea Priscus to be descended from a family in which the love of liberty seemed an hereditary quality 4 The particular causes of calumny and suspi cion were at length exhausted and when a senator was accused of being a secret enemy to the government the emperor was satisfied with the general proof that he was a man of property and virtue From this well grounded principle he frequently drew the most bloody inferences Death of The execution of so many innocent citizens was bewailed by the Pap man secret tears Qf their friends and families The death of Papinian the PrÃ torian praefect was lamented as a public calamity During the last seven years of Severus he had exercised the most important office of the state and by his salutary influence guided the empe ror s steps in the paths of justice and moderation In full assurance of his virtue and abilities Severus on his death bed had conjured him to watch over the prosperity and union of the Imperial family 19 The honest labours of Papinian served only to inflame the hatred which Caracalla had already conceived against his father s minister After the murder of Geta the praefect was commanded to exert the powers of his skill and eloquence in a studied apology for that atrocious deed The philosophic Seneca had condescended to compose a simi lar epistle to the senate in the name of the son and assassin of Agrip pina 30  That it was easier to commit than to justify a parricide was the glorious reply of Papinian Jl who did not hesitate between the loss of life and that of honour Such intrepid virtue which had escaped pure and unsullied from the intrigues of courts the habits of business and the arts of his profession reflects more lustre on the memory of Papinian than all his

drian and Marcus visited their extensive dominions in person and their progress was marked by acts of wisdom and beneficence The tyranny of Tiberius Nero and Domitian who resided almost constantly at Rome or in the adjacent villas was confined to the senatorial and equestrian orders But Caracalla was the com mon enemy of mankind He left the capital and he never returned to it about a year after the murder of Geta The rest of his reign A D 213 was spent in the several provinces of the empire particularly those of the East and every province was by turns the scene of his rapine and cruelty The senators compelled by fear to attend his capricious motions were obliged to provide daily entertainments at an immense expence which he abandoned with contempt to his guards and to erect in every city magnificent palaces and theatres which he ei ther disdained to visit or ordered to be immediately thrown down The most wealthy families were ruined by partial fines and confis cations and the great body of his subjects oppressed by ingenious and aggravated taxes  In the midst of peace and upon the slightest provocation he issued his commands at Alexandria in Egypt for a general massacre From a secure post in the temple of Serapis he viewed and directed the slaughter of many thousand citizens as well as strangers without distinguishing either the num ber or the crime of the sufferers since as he coolly informed the senate all the Alexandrians those who had perished and those who had escaped were alike guilty 5 5  The wise instructions of Severus never made any lasting impres R aÂ tion

7 But the liberality of the father had been restrained by prudence and his indulgence to the troops tempered by firmness and autho rity The careless profusion of the son was the policy of one reign and the inevitable ruin both of the army and of the empire The vi gour of the soldiers instead of being confirmed by the severe disci pline of camps melted away in the luxury of cities The exces sive increase of their pay and donatives58 exhausted the state to enrich the military order whose modesty in peace and service in war is best secured by an honourable poverty The demeanor of Caracalla was haughty and full of pride but with the troops lie forgot even the proper dignity of his rank encouraged their inso lent familiarity and neglecting the essential duties of a general af fected to imitate the dress and manners of a common soldier It was impossible that such a character and such a conduct aa that of Caracalla could inspire either love or efleem but as long as his vices were beneficial to the armies he was secure from the danger of rebellion A secret conspiracy provoked by his own jea lousy was fatal to the tyrant The PrÃ torian prÃ fecture was di vided between two ministers The military department was in trusted to Adventus an experienced rather than an able soldier and the civil affairs were transacted by Opilius Macrinus who by his dexterity in business had raised himself with a fair character to that high office But his favour varied with the caprice of the emr peror and his life might depend on the slightest suspicion or the most casual circumstance Malice or fanaticism had suggested to an African deeply skilled in the knowledge of futurity a very dan gerous prediction that Macrinus and his son were destined to reign over the empire The report was soon diffused through the pro vince and when the man was sent in chains to Rome he still asserted in the presence of the prÃ fect of the city the faith of his prophecy That magistrate who had received the most pressing instructions OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 141 instructions to inform himself of the successors of Caracalla imme diately communicated the examination of the African to the Impe rial court which at that time resided in Syria But notwithstand ing the diligence of the public messengers a friend of Macrinus found means to apprize him of the approaching danger The em peror received the letters from Rome and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot race he delivered them unopened to the PrÃ torian praefect directing him to dispatch the ordinary affairs and to report the more important business that might be contained in them Macrinus read his fate and resolved to prevent it He inflamed the discontents of some inferior officers and employed the hand of Martialis a desperate soldier who had been refused the rank of centurion The devotion of Caracalla had prompted him to make a pilgrimage from Edessa to the celebrated temple of the Moon at CarrhÃ He was attended by a body of cavalry but having stopped on the road for some necessary occasion his guards preserved a respectful distance and Martialis approaching his person under a pretence of duty stabbed him with a dagger The bold assassin was instantly killed by a Scythian archer of the Imperial guard Such was the end of a monster whose life disgraced human nature and whose reign accused the patience of the Romans  The grateful soldiers forgot his vices remembered only his partial libe rality and obliged the senate to prostitute their own dignity and that of religion by granting him a place among the gods Whilst he Imitation of was upon earth Alexander the Great was the only hero whom this Alexander god deemed worthy his admiration He assumed the name and en iigns of Alexander formed a Macedonian

Mace donian hero except in the murder of a great number of his own and of hi3 father s friends  After the extinction of the house of Severus the Roman world remained three days without a master The choice ot the army for the authority of a distant and feeble senate was little regarded hung in anxious suspense as no candidate presented himself whose distin guished birth and merit could engage their attachment and unite their suffrages The decisive weight of the PrÃ torian guards ele vated the hopes of their prefects and these powerful ministers be gan to assert their legal claim to fill the vacancy of the Imperial throne Adventus however the senior praefect conscious of his age and infirmities of his small reputation and his smaller abili ties resigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his Colleague Macrinus whose well dissembled grief removed all sus picion of his being accessary to his master s death  The troops neither loved nor esteemed his character They cast their eyes around in search of a competitor and at last yielded with reluctance to his promises of unbounded liberality and indulgence A short time after his accession he conferred on his son Diadumenianus at the age of only ten years the Imperial title and the popular name of Antoninus The beautiful figure of the youth assisted by an additional donative for which the ceremony furnished a pretext might attract it was hoped the favour of the army and secure the doubtful throne of Macrinus The authority of the new sovereign had been ratified by the cheer ful submission of the senate and provinces They exulted in their unexpected deliverance from a hated tyrant and it seemed of little consequence to weigh the virtues of the successor of Caracalla But as soon as the first transports of joy and surprise had subsided they began to scrutinize the merits of Macrinus with a critical severity 2 and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 143 and to arraign the hasty choice of the army It had hitherto been considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitution that the emperor must be always chosen in the senate and the sovereign power no longer exercised by the whole body was always delegated to one of its members But Macrinus was not a senator  The sudden elevation of the PrÃ torian prefects betrayed the meanness of their origin and the equestrian order was still in possession of that great office which commanded with arbitrary sway the lives and fortunes of the senate A murmur of indignation was heard that a man whose obscure 41 extraction had never been illustrated by any signal service should dare to invest himself with the purple instead of bestowing it on some distinguished senator equal in birth and dignity to the splendour of the Imperial station As soon a6 the cha racter of Macrinus was surveyed by the sharp eye of discontent some vices and many defects were easily discovered The choice of his ministers was in several instances justly censured and the dis satisfied people with their usual candor accused at once his indolent tameness and his excessive severity 44 His rash ambition had climbed a height where it was difficult to and thearmy stand with firmness and impossible to fall without instant destruc tion Trained in the arts of courts and the forms of civil business he trembled in the presence of the fierce and undisciplined multitude over whom be had assumed the command his military talents were despised and his personal courage suspected a whisper that circu lated in the camp disclosed the fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy and heightened contempt by detestation To alienate the soldiers and to provoke inevitable destruction the character of a reformer was only wanting and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate that Macrinus was compelled to exercise that odious office The prodigality of Caracalla had left behind it a long train of ruin and disorder j and if that worthless tyrant had been capable of re flecting 144 THE DECLINE AND FALL flecting on the sure consequences of his own conduct he would perhaps have enjoyed the dark prospect of the distress and calamities which he bequeathed to his successors Macrinus at In the management of this necessary reformation Macrinus pro foraation of ceeded with a cautious prudence which would have restored health the army vigour to the Roman army in an easy and almost imperceptible manner To the soldiers already engaged in the service he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and extravagant pay given by Caracalla  but the new recruits were received on the libe ral but more moderate establishment of Severus and gradually formed to modesty and obedience J One fatal error destroyed the salutary effects of this judicious plan The numerous army as sembled in the East by the late emperor instead of being imme diately dispersed by Macrinus through the several provinces was suffered to remain united in Syria during the winter that followed his elevation In the luxurious idleness of their quarters the troops viewed their strength and numbers communicated their complaints and revolved in their minds the advantages of another revolution The veterans instead of being flattered by the advantageous distinc tion were alarmed by the first steps of the emperor which they considered as the presage of his future intentions The recruits with sullen reluctance entered on a service whose labours were in creased while its rewards were diministied by a covetous and unwar like sovereign The murmurs of the army swelled with impunity into seditious clamours and the partial mutinies betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection that waited only for the slightest occa

numerous body of troops was stationed at Emesa and as the severe discipline of Macrinus had constrained them to pass the winter encamped they were eager to reyenge the cruelty of such unaccustomed hardships The soldiers who resorted in crowds to the temple of the Sun beheld with veneration and delight the elegant dress and figure of the young pontiff they re cognised or they thought that they

Augustus he should ever consider as the great rule of his administration and he affected to dwell with pride on the striking resemblance of his own age and fortunes with those of Augustus who in the earliest youth had revenged by a successful war the murder of his father By adopting the style of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus son of Antoninus and grandson of Severus he tacitly asserted his here ditary claim to empire but by assuming the tribunitian and pro consular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree of the senate he offended the delicacy of Roman prejudice This new and

fashion of the Medes and PhÅ nicians his head was covered with a lofty tiara his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of an inestimable value His eye brows were tinged with black and his cheeks painted with an artificial red and white 5V The grave sena tors confessed with a sigh that after having long experienced the stern tyranny of their own countrymen Rome was at length hum

universally believed had fallen from heaven on that sacred place To this protecting deity Antoninus not without some reason ascribed his elevation to the throne The display of supersti tious gratitude was the only serious business of his reign The triumph of the god of Emesa over all the religions of the earth was the great object of his zeal and vanity and the appellation of Elagabalus for he presumed as pontiff and favourite to adopt that sacred name was dearer to him than all the titles of Imperial great ness In a solemn procession through the streets of Rome the way was strewed with gold dust the black stone set in precious gems was placed on a chariot drawn by six milk white horses richly ca parisoned The pious emperor held the reins and supported by his ministers moved lowly backwards that he might perpetually enjoy the felicity of the divine presence In a magnificent temple raised on the Palatine Mount the sacrifices ofj the god Elagabalus were cele brated OF THE ROMAN

subvert every law of nature and decency were in the number of his most delicious amuse ments A long train of concubines and a rapid succession of wives among whom was a vestal virgin ravished by force from her sacred asylum 58 were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions The master of the Roman world affected to copy the dress and manners of the female sex preferred the distaff to the scepter and dishonoured the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers one of whom was publickly in vested with the title and authority of the emperor s or as he rather styled himself of the empress s husband S9 Contempt The vices and follies of Elagabalus have most probably been which distin adorned by fancy and blackened by prejudice 6o Yet confining guiihed the Roman ty ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people and attested by grave and contemporary historians their inexpres sible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country The licence of an eastern monarch is secluded from the eye of curiosity by the inaccessible walls of his seraglio The sentiments of honour and gallantry have introduced a refinement of pleasure a regard for de cency and a respect for the public opinion into the modern courts of Europe but the corrupt and opulent nobles of Rome gratified every vice that could be collected from the mighty

with pleasure the opening virtues of his cousin Alex ander the son of MamÃ a The crafty MÃ sa sensible that her grand son Elagabalus must inevitably destroy himself by hia own vices had provided another and surer support of her family Embracing a favourable moment of fondness and devotion she had persuaded the young emperor to adopt Alexander and to invest him with the title of CÃ sar that

were constantly discovered by his own loquacious folly and disappointed by those virtuous and faithful servants whom the prudence of MamÃ a had placed about the person of her son In a hasty sally of passion Elagabalus resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to compass by fraud and by a despotic sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and honours of CÃ sar The message was received in the senate with silence and in the camp with fury The PrÃ torian guards swore to protect Alexander and5 to revenge the dishonoured majesty of the throne The tears and promises of the trembling

attempted by a dangerous experiment to try the temper of the soldiers The report of the death of Alexander and the natural suspicion that he had been murdered inflamed their passions into fury and the tempest of the camp could only be appeased by the presence and authority of the popular youth Provoked at this new instance of their affection for his cousin and their contempt for his person the emperor ventured to punish some of the leaders of the mutiny His unsea sonable severity proved instantly fatal to his minions his mother and himself Elagabalus was massacred by the indignant PrÃ to rians his mutilated corpse dragged through the streets of the city and thrown into the Tyber His memory was branded with eternal infamy by the senate the justice of whose decree has been ratified by posterity In the room of Elagabalus his cousin Alexander was raised to the throne by the PrÃ torian guards His relation to the family of Severus whose name he assumed was the fame as that of his pre decessor his virtue and his danger had already endeared him to the Romans and the eager liberality of the senate conferred upon him in one day the various titles and powers of the Imperial dignity 6j But as Alexander was a modest and dutiful youth of only seventeen years of age the reins of government were in the hands of two women of his mother MamÃ a and of MÃ sa his grandmother After the death of the latter who survived but a short time the elevation of Alexander MamÃ a remained the sole regent of her son and the empire In every age and country the wiser or at least the stronger of the two sexes has usurped the powers of the state and confined the other OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE other to the cares and pleasures of private life In hereditary mo narchies however and especially in those of modern Europe the gallant spirit of chivalry and the law of succession have accustomed us to allow a singular exception and a woman is often acknow ledged the absolute sovereign of a great kingdom in which she would be deemed incapable of exercising the smallest employment civil or military But as the Roman emperors were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the republic their wives and mothers although distinguished by the name of Augusta were never associated to their personal honours and a female reign would have ap peared an inexplicable prodigy in the eyes of those primitive Romans who married without love or loved without delicacy and respect64 The haughty Agrippina aspired indeed to share the honours of the empire which she had conferred on her son but her mad am bition detested by every citizen who felt for the dignity of Rome was disappointed by the artful firmness of Seneca and Burrhus 6 The good fense or the indifference of succeeding princes restrained them from offending the prejudices of their subjects and it was reserved for the profligate Elagabalus to disgrace the acts of the senate with the name of his mother Sosemias who was placed by the fide of the consuls and subscribed as a regular member the decrees of the legislative assembly Her more prudent sister Ma mÃ a declined the useless and odious prerogative and a solemn law was enacted excluding women for ever from the senate and de voting to the infernal gods the head of the wretch by whom this sanction should be violated6S The substance not the pageantry of power was the object of MamÃ a s manly ambition She main tained an absolute and lasting empire over the mind of her son and in his affection the mother could not brook a rival Alexander â if with her consent married the daughter of a Patrician but his respect for his father in law and love for the empress were incon sistent with the tenderness or interest of MamÃ a The Patrician was Vol I X executed 54 THE DECLINE AND FALL Wise

the palace and banished into Africa 6 Notwithstanding this act of jealous cruelty as well as some instances of avarice with which MamÃ a is charged the ge neral tenour of her administration was equally for the benefit of her son and of the empire With the approbation of the senate she chose sixteen of the wisest and most virtuous senators as a per petual council of state before whom every public business of mo ment was debated and determined The celebrated Ulpian equally distinguished by his knowledge ofr and his respect for the laws of Rome was at their head and the prudent firmness of this aristo qracy restored order and authority to the government As soon as they had purged the city from foreign superstition and luxury the remains of the capricious tyranny of Elagabalus they applied them selves to remove his worthless creatures from every department of pub lic administration and to supply their places with men of virtue and ability Learning and the love of justice became the only recom mendations for civil offices Valour and the love of discipline thf only qualifications for military employments 6S But the most important care of IVfamsea and her wife counsellors was to form the character of the young emperor on whose personal qualities the happiness or misery of the Roman world must ulti mately depend The fortunate soil assisted and even prevented the hand of cultivation An excellent understanding soon convinced Alexander of the advantages of virtue the pleasure of knowledge and the necessity of labour A natural mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the assaults of pastlon and the allure ments of vice His unalterable regard for his mother and his esteem for the wife Ulpian guarded his unexperienced youth from the poison of flattery The simple journal of his ordinary occupations exhibits a pleasing picture of an accomplished emperor6 and with some allowance â for OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE for the difference of manners might well deserve the imitation of modern princes Alexander rose early the first moments of the day were consecrated to private devotion and his domestic chapel was filled with the images of those heroes who by improving or reforn irig human life had deserved the grateful reverence of posterity But as he deemed the service of mankind the most acceptable worship of the gods the greatest part of his morning hours waS employed in his council where he discussed public affairs and determined private causes with a patience and discretion above his years The dryness of business was relieved by the charms of literature and a portion of time was always set apart for his fa vourite studies of poetry history and philosophy The works of Virgil and Horace the republics of Plato and Cicero formed his taste enlarged his understanding and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government The exercises of the body succeeded to those of the mind and Alexander who was tall active and ro bust surpassed most of his equals in the gymnastic arts Refreshed by the use of the bath and a flight dinner he resumed with new vigour the business of the day and till the hour of supper the principal meal of the Romans he was attended by his secretaries with whom he read and answered the multitude of letters memo rials and petitions that must have been addressed to the master of the greatest part of the world His table was served with the most frugal simplicity and whenever he was at liberty to consult his own inclination the company consisted of a few select friends men of learning and virtue amongst whom Ulpian was con stantly invited Their conversation was familiar and instructive and the pauses were occasionally enlivened by the recital of some pleas ing composition which supplied the place of the dancers

proof of the wisdom and justice of Alexander s A D 222â government than all the trifling details preserved in the compila tion of Lampridius Since the accession of Commodus the Roman world had experienced during a term of forty years the successive and various vices of four tyrants From the death of Elagabalus it enjoyed an auspicious calm of thirteen years The provinces relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by Caracalla and his pretended son flourished in peace and prosperity under the ad ministration of magistrates who were convinced by experience that to deserve the love of the subjects was their best and only method of obtaining the favour of their sovereign While some gentle restraints were imposed on the insolent luxury of the Roman peo ple the price of provisions and the interest of money were re duced by the paternal care of Alexander whose prudent liberality without distressing the industrious supplied the wants and amuse ments of the populace The dignity the

administration of Alexander wisdom was enforced He attempts hy power and the people sensible of the public felicity repaid army their benefactor with their love and gratitude There still remained a greater a more necessary but a more difficult enterprise the refor mation of the military order whose interest and temper confirmed by long impunity rendered them impatient of the restraints of dis cipline and careless of the blessings of public tranquillity In the execution of his design the emperor affected to display his love and to conceal his fear of the army The most rigid Å conomy in every other branch of the administration supplied a fund of gold and silver for the ordinary pay and the extraordinary rewards of the troops In their marches he relaxed the severe obligation of carrying seventeen days provision on their shoulders Ample magazines were formed along the public roads and as soon as they entered the enemy s country a numerous train of mules and camek waited on their haughty laziness As Alexander despaired of correcting the luxury of his soldiers he attempted at least to di rect it to objects of martial pomp and ornament fine horses fplenr did armour and shields enriched with silver and gold He shared whatever fatigues he was obliged to impose visited in person the sick and wounded preserved an exact register of their services and his own gratitude and expressed on every occasion the warmest regard for a body of men whose welfare as he affected to declare was so closely connected with that of the state 7 By the most gentle arts he laboured to inspire the fierce multitude with a sense of duty and to restore at least a faint image of that discipline to which the Romans owed their empire over so many other nations as warlike and more powerful than themselves But his prudence was vain his courage fatal and the attempt towards a reformation served only to inflame the ills it was meant to cure The j5g THE DECLINE AND FALL Seditions of The PrÃ torian guards were attached to the youth of Alexander the PiÃ torian m  1 j  â e guard and They loved him as a tender pupil whom they had saved from uÂ pfan Â f  tyrant s fury and placed on the Imperial throne That amiable prince was sensible of the obligation but as his gratitude was re strained within the limits of reason and justice they soon were more dissatisfied with the virtues of Alexander than they had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus Their prÃ fect the wife Ulpian was the friend of the laws and of the people he was considered as the enemy of the soldiers and to his pernicious councils every scheme of reformation was imputed Some trifling accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny and a civil war raged during three days in Rome whilst the life of that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people Terrified at length by the sight of some houses in flames and by the threats of a general conflagration the people yielded with a sigh and left the virtuous but unfortunate Ulpian to his fate He was pursued into the Imperial palace and massacred at the feet of his master who vainly strove to cover him with the purple and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers Such was the deplorable weakness of government that the emperor was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his insulted dignity without stooping to the arts of patience and dissimulation Epagathus the principal leader of the mutiny was removed from Rome by the honourable employment of prÃ fect of Egypt from that high rank he was gently degraded to the government of Crete and when at length his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and ab sence Alexander ventured to inflict the tardy but deserved punish ment of his crimes 7 Under the reign of a just and virtuous prince the tyranny of the army threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers who were suspected of an intention to  correct their intolerable disorders The historian Dion Cassius had Ditigcr ot Dion Caflius commanded the Pannonian legions with the spirit of ancient dis cipline â  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE i 9 cipline Their brethren of Rome embracing the common cause of military licence demanded the head of the reformer Alexander however instead of yielding to their seditious clamours shewed a just fense of his merit and services by appointing him his colleague in the consulship and defraying from his own treasury the expence of that vain dignity but as rt was justly apprehended that if the soldiers beheld him with the ensigns of his office they would re venge the insult in his blood the nominal first magistrate of the state retired by the emperor s advice from the city and spent the greatest part of his consulship at his villas in Campania7  The lenity of the emperor confirmed the insolence of the troops Tumults of the legions imitated the example of the guards and defended their thc leg on prerogative of licentiousness with the fame furious obstinacy The administration of Alexander was an unavailing struggle against the corruption of his age In Illyricum in Mauritania in Armenia in Mesopotamia in Germany fresh mutinies perpetually broke out  his officers were murdered his authority was insulted and his life at last sacrificed to the fierce discontents of the army 6 One par ticular fact well deserves to be recorded as it illustrates the manners Se of the troops and exhibits a singular instance of their return to a fense of duty and obedience Whilst the emperor lay at Antioch in his Persian expedition the punishment of some soldiers who had been discovered in the baths of women excited a sedition in the Â legion to which they belonged Alexander ascended his tribunal and with a modest firmness represented to the armed multitude the absolute necessity as well as his inflexible resolution of correcting the vices introduced by his impure predecessor and of maintaining the discipline which could not be relaxed without the ruin of the Roman name and empire Their clamours interrupted his mild ex postulation Reserve your shouts said the undaunted emperor till you take the field against the Persians the Germans and the Â â

their brandished arms already threatened his person Your courage resumed the intrepid Alexander  would be more nobly displayed in a field of battle me you may destroy you cannot intimidate and the severe justice of the republic would punisli your crime and revenge my death The legion still persisted in clamorous sedition when the emperor pronounced with a loud voice the decisive sentence Citizens lay down your arms and depart in peace to your re spective habitations The tempest was instantly appeased the soldiers filled with grief and shame silently confessed the justice of their punishment and the power of discipline yielded up their arms and military ensigns and retired in confusion not to their camp but to the several inns of the city Alexander enjoyed during thirty days the edifying spectacle of their repentance nor did he restore them to their former rank in the army till he had punished with death those tribunes whose connivance had occasioned the mutiny The grateful legion served the emperor whilst living and revenged him when dead 7i Defects of h Â The resolutions of the multitude generally depend on a moment character and the caprice of passion might equally determine the seditious legion to lay down their arms at the emperor s feet or to plunge them into his breast Perhaps if the singular transaction had been investigated by the penetration of a philosopher we should discover the secret causes that authorized the boldness of the prince and com manded the obedience of the troops and perhaps if it had been related by a judicious historian we should find this action worthy of CÃ sar himself reduced nearer to the level of probability and the common standard of the character of Alexander Severus The abi lities OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE titles of that amiable prince seem to have been inadequate to the difficulties of his situation the firmness of his conduct inferior to the purity of his intentions His virtues as well as the vices of Elagabalus contracted a tincture of weakness and effeminacy from the soft climate of Syria of which he was a native though he blushed at his foreign origin and listened with a vain complacency to the flattering genealogists who derived his race from the ancient flock of Roman nobility The pride and avarice of his mother cast a shade on the glories of his reign and by exacting from his riper years the fame dutiful obedience which she had justly claimed from his unexperienced youth Mamaea exposed to public ridicule both her son s character and her own 8o The fatigues of the Persian war irritated the military discontent the unsuccessful event de graded the reputation of the emperor as a general and even as a soldier Every cause prepared and every circumstance hastened a revolution which distracted the Roman empire with a long series of civil discord The dissolute tyranny of Commodus the civil wars occasioned Digression on by his death and the new maxims of policy introduced by the house of the empire of Severus had all contributed to increase the dangerous power of the army and to obliterate the faint image of laws and liberty that was still impressed on the minds of the Romans This internal change which undermined the foundations of the empire we have endeavoured to explain with some degree of order and perspicuity The personal characters of the emperors their victories laws follies and fortunes can interest us no farther than as they are connected with the general history of the Decline and Fall of the monarchy Our constant attention to that great object will not suffer us to over look a most important edict of Antoninus Caracalla which com municated to all the free inhabitants of the empire the name and privileges of Roman citizens His unbounded liberality flowed not however from the sentiments of a generous mind it was the Vol I Y sordid l62 THE DECLINE AND FALL sordid result of avarice and will naturally be illustrated by some  observations on the finances of that state from the victorious ages of the commonwealth to the reign of Alexander Severus Establishment The siege of Veii in Tuscany the first considerable enterprise of the Romans was protracted to the tenth year much less by the strength of the place than by the unfkilfulneso of the besiegers The unaccustomed hardships of so many winter campaigns at the distance of near twenty miles from home 8l required more than common encouragements and the senate wisely prevented the cla mours of the people by the institution of a regular pay for the soldiers which was levied by a general tribute assessed according to an equitable proportion on the property of the citizens  During more than two hundred years after the conquest of Veii the victo ries of the republic added less to the wealth than to the power of Rome The states of Italy paid their tribute in military service only and the vast force both by sea and land which was exerted in the Punic wars was maintained at the expence of the Romans them selves That high spirited people such is often the generous en thusiasm of freedom cheerfully submitted to the most excessive but voluntary burdens in the just confidence that they should speedily enjoy the rich harvest of their labours Their expectations were not disappointed In the course of a few years the riches of Syra cuse of Carthage of Macedonia and of Asia were brought in tri and abolition umph to Rome The treasures of Perseus alone amounted to near on RomantC two millions sterling and the Roman people the sovereign of so cmzens many nations was for ever delivered from the weight of taxes 85 The increasing revenue of the provinces was found sufficient to defray the ordinary establishment of war and government and the superfluous mass of gold and silver was deposited in the temple of Saturn and reserved for any unforeseen emergency of the state 4 Tributes of History has never perhaps suffered a greater or more irreparable the provinces

the Roman empire Ss De prived of this clear and comprehensive estimate we are reduced to collect a few imperfect hints from such of the ancients as have acci dentally turned aside from the splendid to the more useful parts of history We are informed that by the conquests of Pompey the tributes of Asia were raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty of Ada five millions of drachms or about four millions and a half ster ling 8S Under the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies the re of Egypt venue of Egypt is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five hundred talents a sum far inferior to what was afterwards pro duced by the more exact ceconomy of the Romans and the increase of the trade of Ã thiopia and India 7 Gaul was enriched by rapine of Gaul as Egypt was by commerce and the tributes of those two great pro vinces have been compared as nearly equal to each other in value The ten thousand Euboic or PhÅ nician talents about four millions of Africa sterling which vanquished Carthage was condemned to pay within the term of fifty years were a flight acknowledgment of the supe riority of Rome 9Â and cannot bear the least proportion with the taxes afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the inhabitants when the fertile coast of Africa was reduced into a province Spain by a very singular fatality was the Peru and Mexico of of Spain the old world The discovery of the rich western continent by the PhÅ nicians and the oppression of the simple natives who were compelled to labour in their own mines for the benefit of strangers form an exact type of the more recent history of Spanish America 9 The PhÅ nicians were acquainted only with the sea coast of Spain avarice as well as ambition carried the arms of Rome and Carthage into the heart of the country and almost every part of the soil was found pregnant with copper silver and gold Mention is made of a mine near Carthagena which yielded every day twenty five thousand Y 2 drachms THE DECLINE AND FALL drachms of silver or about three hundred thousand pounds a year Twenty thousand pound weight of gold was annually re ceived from the provinces of Asturia Gallicia and Luiitania94  â of the isle of  We want both leisure and materials to pursue this curious inquiry 53 through the many potent states that were annihilated in the Roman empire Some notion however may be formed of the revenue of the provinces where considerable wealth had been deposited by na ture or collected by man if we observe the severe attention that was directed to the abodes of solitude and sterility Augustus once received a petition from the inhabitants of Gyarus humbly praying that they might be relieved from one third of their exceffive impo sitions Their whole tax amounted indeed to no more than one hundred and fifty drachms or about five pounds but Gyarus was a little island or rather a rock of the Ã gean sea destitute of frestv water and every neceflary of life and inhabited only by a few wretched fishermen95 Amount of From the faint glimmerings of such doubtful and scattered lights the revenue wg n d incline to believe ist That with every fair allowance for the difference of times and circumstance the general income of the Roman provinces could seldom amount to less than fifteen or twenty millions of our money9 s and 2dly That so ample a revenue must have been fully adequate to all the expences of the moderate go vernment instituted by Augustus whose court was the modest family of a private senator and whose military establishment was calcu lated for the defence of the frontiers without any aspiring views of conquest or any serious apprehension of a foreign invasion Taxes on Ro Notwithstanding the seeming probability of both these conclusion nst t edeby e ter Â f them at least is positively disowned by the language Augustus and conduct of Augustus It is not easy to determine whether on this occasion he acted a the common father of the Roman world or as the oppressor of liberty whether he wished to relieve the pro vinces or to impoverish the senate and the equestrian order But 4 no OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE no sooner had he assumed die reins of government than he fre quently intimated the insufficiency of the tribute and the necessity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon Rome and Italy In the prosecution of this unpopular design he advanced however by cautious and well weighed steps The in troduction of customs was followed by the establishment of an ex eise and the scheme of taxation was completed by an artful assessment on the real and personal property of the Roman citizens who had been exempted from any kind of coutribution above a century and a half J In a great empire like that of Rome a natural balance of money The customs must have gradually established itself It has been already observed that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the strong hand of conquest and power a considerable part of it was restored to the industrious provinces by the gentle influence of com merce and arts In the reign of Augustus and his successors duties were imposed on every kind of merchandise which through a thou sand channels flowed to the great center of opulence and luxury  and in whatsoever manner the law was expressed it was the Roman purchaser and not the provincial merchant who paid the tax i The rate of the customs varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity and we have a right to suppose that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those of necessity and that the productions raised or manufactured by the labour of the subjects of the empire were treated with more in dulgence than was shewn to the pernicious or at least the unpopular commerce of Arabia and India 9 There is still extant a long but imperfect catalogue of eastern commodities which about the time of Alexander Severus were subject to the payment of duties cinna mon myrrh pepper ginger and the whole tribe of aromatics a great variety of precious stones among which the diamond was the most remarkable for its price and the emerald for its beauty99 Parthian THE DECLINE AND FALL Parthian and Babylonian leather cottons silks both raw and manu factured ebony ivory and eunuchs co We may observe that the use and value of those effeminate slaves gradually rose with the decline of the empire The excise TC The excise introduced by Augustus after the civil wars was extremely moderate but it was general It seldom exceeded one per cent but it comprehended whatever was fold in the markets or by public auction from the most considerable purchases of lands and houses to those minute objects which can only derive a value from their infinite multitude and daily consumption Such a tax as it affects the body of the people has ever been the occasion of clamour and discontent An emperor well acquainted with the wants and resources of the state was obliged to declare by a public edict that the support of the army depended in a great measure on the produce of the excise Tax on lega III When Augustus resolved to establish a permanent military riuncei nhe force for the defence of his government against foreign and domestic enemies he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay of the soldiers the rewards of the veterans and the extraordinary expences of war The ample revenue of the excise though peculiarly appro priated to those uses was found inadequate To supply the defi ciency the emperor suggested a new tax of five per cent on all legacies and inheritances But the noble6 of Rome were more tena cious of property than of freedom Their indignant murmurs were received by Augustus with his usual temper He candidly referred the whole business to the senate and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other expedient of a less odious nature They were divided and perplexed He insinuated to them that their obstinacy would oblige him to propose a general land tax and capitation They acquiesced in silence  The new imposition on legacies and inheritances was however mitigated by some restric tions It did not take place unless the object was of a certain value most OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 167 most probably of fifty or an hundred pieces of gold IO nor could it be exacted from the nearest of kin on the father s side lo When the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured it seemed reasonable that a stranger or a distant relation who acquired an unexpected accession of fortune should cheerfully resign a twentieth part of it for the benefit of the state 0S   Such a tax plentiful as it must prove in every wealthy com Suited to thÂ munity was most happily suited to the situation of the Romans manner 1 who could frame their arbitrary wills according to the dictates of reason or caprice without any restraint from the modern fetters of entails and settlements Even the partiality of paternal affection often lost its influence over the stern patriots of the commonwealth and the dissolute nobles of the empire and if the father bequeathed to his son the fourth part of his estate he removed all ground of legal complaint oS But a rich childless old man was a do mestic tyrant and his power increased with his years and in firmities A servile crowd in which he frequently reckoned prÃ tors and consuls courted his smiles pampered his avarice ap plauded his follies served his passions and waited with impatience for his death The arts of attendance and flattery were formed into a most lucrative science those who professed it acquired a peculiar appellation and the whole city according to the lively descripi tions of satire was divided between two parties the hunters and their game 07 Yet while so many unjust and extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning and subscribed by folly a few were the result of rational esteem and virtuous gratitude Cicero who had so often defended the lives and fortunes of his fellow citizens was rewarded with legacies to the amount of an hundred and seventy thousand pounds 108 nor do the friends of the younger Pliny seem to have been less generous to that amiable orator 0 Whatever was the motive of the testator the treasury claimed with out distinction the twentieth part of his estate and in the course of i68 THE DECLINE AND FALL of two or three generations the whole property of the subject must have gradually passed through the coffers of the state In the first and golden years of the reign of Nero that prince from a desire of popularity and perhaps from a blind impulse of benevolence conceived a wish of abolishing the oppression of the Regulations customs and excise The wisest senators applauded his magnanimity e m but they diverted him from the execution of a design which would have dissolved the strength and resources of the republic Â Had it indeed been possible to realize this dream of fancy such princes as Trajan and the Antonines would surely have embraced with ardour the glorious opportunity of conferring so signal an obli gation on mankind Satisfied however with alleviating the pub lic burden they attempted not to remove it The mildness and precision of their laws ascertained the rule and measure of taxation and protected the subject of every rank against arbitrary interpret ations antiquated claims and the insolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue For it is somewhat singular that in every age the best and wisest of the Roman governors persevered in this per nicious method of collecting the principal branches at least of the excise and customs Edict of The sentiments and indeed the situation of Caracalla were very Caracalla different from those of the Antonines Inattentive or rather averse to the welfare of his people he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the insatiate avarice which he had excited in the army Of the several impositions introduced by Augustus the twentieth on inheritances and legacies was the most fruitful as well as the most comprehensive As its influence was not con fined to Rome or Italy the produce continually increased with the gradual extension of the Roman City The new citizens though charged oft equal terms J with the payment of new taxes which had not affected them as subjects derived an ample compensation from the rank they obtained the privileges they acquired and the fair OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE rfy fair prospect of honours and fortune that was thrown open to their ambition But the favour which implied a distinction was lost in the prodigality of Caracalla and the reluctant provincials Thefreedom were compelled to assume the vain title and the real obliga given to all _ _ â ž the provin tions of Roman citizens Nor was the rapacious Ion or oe ciais for the verus contented with such a measure of taxation as had appeared ion sufficient to his moderate predecessors Instead of a twentieth he exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances and during his reign for the ancient proportion was restored after his death he crushed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter V  â I i When all the provincials became liable to the peculiar impositions Temporary of Roman citizens they seemed to acquire a legal exemption from the heuibute 0 tributes which they had paid in their former condition of subjects Such were not the maxims of government adopted by Caracalla and his pretended son The old as well as the new taxes were at the fame time levied in the provinces It was reserved for the virtue of Alexan der to relieve them in a great measure from this intolerable grievance by reducing the tributes to a thirtieth part of the sum exacted at the time of his accession s It is impossible to conjecture the motive that engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil but the noxious weed which had not been totally eradicated again sprang up with the most luxuriant growth and in the succeeding age darkened the Roman world with its deadly shade In the course of this history we shall be too often summoned to explain the land tax the capitation and the heavy contributions of corn wine oil and meat that were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court the army and the capital As long as Rome and Italy were respected as the center of govern Consequences ment a national spirit was preserved by the ancient and insensibly a freedomTf imbibed by the adopted citizens The principal commands of the

But when the last enclosure of the Roman constitution was tram pled down by Caracalla the separation of professions gradually â succeeded to the distinction of ranks The more polished citizens of the internal provinces were alone qualified to act as lawyersand ma gistrates The rougher trade of arms was abandoned to the peasants and barbarians of the frontiers who knew no country but their camp no

soon as the fortunate candidate has removed his brethren by the sword and the bow string he no longer enter tains any jealousy of his meaner subjects But the Roman empire after the authority of the senate had sunk into contempt was a vast scene of confusion The royal and even noble families of the provinces had long since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans The ancient families of Rome had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Caesars and whilst  those OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth and disappointed by the repeated failure of their posterity  it was im possible that any idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds of their subjects The right to the throne which none could claim from

raised by valour and fortune to a rank in the army in which a single crime would enable him to wrest the scepter of the world from his feeble and unpopular master After the murder of Alexander Severus and the elevation of Maximin no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne and every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that august but dangerous station About thirty two years before that event the emperor Severus Birth and returning from an eastern expedition halted in Thrace to cele Maximin brate with military games the birth day of his younger son Geta The country

pride of discipline would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thracian peasant he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground His victory was rewarded by some trifling gifts and a permission to insist in the troops The next day the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits dancing and exulting after the fashion of his country As soon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor s notice he instantly ran up to his horse and followed him on foot without the least appearance of fatigue in

father was a Goth and his mother of the nation of the Alani He displayed on every occasion a valour equal to his strength and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the knowledge of the world Under the reign of Severus and his son he obtained the rank of centurion with the favour and esteem of both those princes the former of whom was an excellent judge of merit Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the assassin of Caracalla Honour taught him to decline the effeminate insults of Elagabalus On the accession of Alexander he returned to court and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service and honourable to himself The fourth legion to which he was appointed tribune soon became under his care the best disciplined of the whole army With the general applause of the soldiers who bestowed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and Hercules he was successively promoted to the first military com mandand had not he still retained too much of his savage

their poison on the administration of the best of princes and to accuse even their virtues by artfully confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity The troops listened with pleasure to the emifiaries of Maximin They blushed at their own ignominious patience which during thirteen years had supported the vexatious discipline imposed by an effemi nate Syrian the timid slave of his mother and of the senate It was time they cried to cast away that useless phantom of the civil power and to elect for their prince and general a real soldier edu cated in camps exercised in war who would assert the glory and distribute among his companions the treasures of the empire A great army commanded by the emperor in person was at that â lime assembled on the banks of the Rhine against the Germans and the important care of training and reviewing the new levies was intrusted to Maximin One day as he entered the field of exer cise the troops either from a sudden impulse or a

virtuous and unsuspecting prince5 If we credit another and indeed a more probable account Maximin was invested with the purple by a nu merous detachment at the distance of several miles from the headV quarters and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army Alexander had suffi cient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among his troops but their reluctant professions of fidelity quickly vanished on the ap 3 pearance 176 THE DECLINE AND FALL pearance of Maximin who declared himself the friend and advo cate of the military order and was unanimously acknowledged em peror of the Romans by the applauding legions The son of MamÃ a betrayed and deserted withdrew into his tent desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multi tude He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions the ministers of death but instead of receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke his unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his life and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire His mother MamÃ a whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of his ruin perished with her son The most faithful of his friends were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers Others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper and those who experienced the mildest treatment were stripped of their employments and ignominioufly driven from the court and army  Tyranny of The former tyrants Caligula and Nero Commodus and Caracalla were all dissolute and unexperienced youths7 educaced in the pur ple and corrupted by the pride of empire the luxury of Rome and the perfidious voice of flattery The cruelty of Maximin was derived from a different source the fear of contempt Though he depended on the attachment of the soldiers who loved him for vir tues like their own he was conscious that his mean and barbarian origin his savage appearance and his total ignorance of â the ajjts and institutions of civil life 8 formed a very unfavourable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander He remem bered that in his humbler fortune he had often waited before the doors of the haughty nobles of Rome and had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves He recollected too the friendship of a sew who had relieved his poverty and assisted his rising hopes But those who had spurned and those who had protected the Thra  cian OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE cian were guilty of the same crime the knowledge of his original obscurity For this crime many were put to death  and by the exe cution of several of his benefactors Maximin published in charac ters of blood the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude9 The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most dis tinguished by their birth or merit Whenever Tie was alarmed with the sound of treason his cruelty was unbounded and unrelenting A conspiracy against his life was either discovered or imagined and Magnus a consular senator was named as the principal author of it Without a witness without a trial and without an opportunity of defence Magnus with four thousand of his supposed accom plices were put to death Italy and the whole empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers On the slightest accusation the first of the Roman nobles who had governed provinces com manded armies and been adorned with the consular and triumphal ornaments were chained on the public carriages and hurried away to the emperor s presence Confiscation exile or simple death were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity Some of the un fortunate sufferers he ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaugh tered animals others to be exposed to wild beasts others again to be beaten to death with clubs During the three years of his reign he disdained to visit either Rome or Italy His camp occasionally removed from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Danube was the feat of his stern despotism which trampled on every principle of law and justice and was supported by the avowed power of the sword No man of noble birth elegant accomplishments or know ledge of civil business was suffered near his person and the court of a Roman emperor revived the idea of those ancient chiefs of slaves and gladiators whose savage power had left a deep impression of terror and detestation V Vol I A a As 178 THE DECLINE AND FALL Oppreffion of As ionpr a9 the cruelty of Maximin was confined to the illustrious the provin 0 cci senators or even to the bold adventurers who in the court or army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune the body of the people viewed their sufferings with indifference or perhaps with pleasure But the tyrant s avarice stimulated by the insatiate desires of the soldiers at length attacked the public property Every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue destined to pur chafe corn for the multitude and to supply the expences of the games and entertainments By a single act of authority the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for the use of the Imperial treasury The temples were stripped of their most valuable offer ings of gold and silver and the statues of gods heroes and empe lors were melted down and coined into money These impious or ders could not be executed without tumults and massacres as in many places the people chose rather to die in the defence of their altars than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the ra pine and cruelty of war The soldiers themselves among whom this sacrilegious plunder was distributed received it with a blush and hardened as they were in acts of violence they dreaded the juft reproaches of their friends and relations Throughout the Roman world a general cry of indignation was heard imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind and at length by an act of private oppreslion a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against him  Revolt in The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy of such a master A D 237 who considered the fines and confiscations of the nobles as one of ApnI the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue An iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that country the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony In this extremity a resolution that must either complete or prevent their ruin was dictated by despair 1 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE If9 despair A respite of three days obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the com mands of their lords and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes The leaders of the conspiracy as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments and by the assistance of their tu multuary train seized on the little town of Thysdrus and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman em pire They rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against Maximin and they judiciously resolved to set up in opposition to that detested tyrant an emperor whose mild virtues had already ac quired the love and esteem of the Romans and whose authority over the province would give weight and stability to the enterprise CrOrdianus their proconsul and the object of their choice re fused with unfeigned reluctance the dangerous honour and begged With tears that they would suffer him to terminate in peace along and innocent life without staining his feeble age with civil blood Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of Maximin since according to the reasoning of tyrants those who have been esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death and those who deliberate have already rebelled  The family of Gordianus was one of the most illustrious of the charafierand Roman senate On the father s side he was descended from the the two Gor  Gracchi onlus mother s from the emperor Trajan A great estate d anS enabled him to support the dignity of his birth and in the enjoy ment of it he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent disposition The palace in Rome formerly inhabited by the great Pompey had beenr during several generations in the post slion of Gordian s fa mily  h Was distinguished by ancient trophies of naval victories and decorated with the works of modern painting His villa on the A a 2 road THE DECLINE AND FALL road to PrÃ neste was celebrated for baths of singular beauty and extent for three stately rooms of an hundred feet in length and for a magnifi cent portico supported by two hundred columns of the four most curious and costly sorts of marble 5 The public hows exhibited at his expence and in which the people were entertained with many hun dreds of wild beasts and gladiators 6 seem to surpass the fortune of a subject and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was confined to a few solemn festivals in Rome the magnificence of Gordian was re peated when he was Ã dile every month in the year and extended during his consulship to the principal cities of Italy He was twice elevated to the last mentioned dignity by Caracalla and by Alexander for he possessed the uncommon advantage of deserving the esteem of virtuous princes without alarming the jealousy of tyrants His long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peace ful honours of Rome and till he was named proconsul of Africa by the voice of the senate and the approbation of Alexander 7 he appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the government of provinces As long as that emperor lived Africa was happy under the administration of his worthy representative after the barbarous Maximin had usurped the throne Gordianus alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent When he reluctantly accepted the purple he was above fourscore years old a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines whose virtues he revived in his own conduct and celebrated in an elegant poem of thirty books With the venerable proconsul his son who had accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant was likewise declared emperor His manners were less pure but his character was equally amiable with that of his father Twenty two acknowledged concubines and a library of sixty two thousand vo lumes attested the variety of his inclinations and from the pro ductions which he left behind him it appears that both the one and the other were designed for use rather than for ostentation 8 The Roman OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Roman people acknowledged in the features of the younger Gordian the resemblance of Scipio Africanus recollected with pleasure that his mother was the granddaughter of Antoninus Pius and rested the public hope on those latent virtues which had hitherto as they fondly imagined lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of a private life As soon as the Gordians had appeased the first tumult of a popu They solicit  theconfirma lar election they removed their court to Carthage They were re tion of their ceived with the acclamations of the Africans who honoured their aut onty virtues and who since the visit of Hadrian had never beheld the majesty of a Roman emperor But these vain acclamations neither strengthened nor confirmed the title of the Gordians They were induced by principle as well as interest to solicit the approbation of the senate and a deputation of the noblest provincials was sent without delay to Rome to relate and justify the conduct of their countrymen who having long suffered with patience were at length resolved to act with vigour The letters of the new princes were modest and respectful excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the Imperial title j but submitting their election and their fate to the supreme judgment of the senate 9 â The inclinations of the senate were neither doubtful nor divided Thesemte ratifies their The birth and noble alliances of the Gordians had intimately election osthe Gordian 5 connected them with the most illustrious houses of Rome Their fortune had created many dependants in that assembly their merit had acquired many friends Their mild administration opened the flattering prospect of the restoration not only of the civil but even of the republican government The terror of military vio lence which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder of Alexander and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant Â now produced a contrary effect and provoked them to assert the injured rights of freedom and humanity The hatred of Maximin towards the senate was declared and implacable the tamest submission had not appeased his fury the most cautious innocence would not re 7 move THE DECLINE AND FALL  move his suspicions and even the care of their own safety urged them to share the fortune of an enterprise of which if unsuccessful they were sure to be the first victims These considerations and perhaps others of a more private nature were debated in a previous conference of the consuls and the magistrates As soon as their resolution was decided they convoked in the temple of Castor the whole body of the senate according to an ancient form of secrecy calculated to awaken their attention and to conceal their decrees Conscript fathers said the consul Syllanus  the two Gordians both of consular dignity the one your proconsul the other your lieutenant

him and c may we long enjoy the prudence and felicity of Gordian the fa Â ther the valour and constancy of Gordian the son The noble ardour of the consul revived the languid spirit of the senate and declares By an unanimous decree the election of the Gordians was ratified Maximin a  publicenemy Maximin his son and his adherents were pronounced enemies of their country and liberal rewards were offered to whosoever had the courage and good fortune to destroy them Assumes the During the Emperor s absence a detachment of the PrÃ torian RomTand0 guards remained at Rome to protect or rather to command the Iul capital The prÃ fect Vitalianus had signalized his fidelity to Maxi min by the alacrity with which he had obeyed and even prevented the cruel mandates of the tyrant His death alone could rescue the authority of the senate and the lives of the senators from a state of danger and sufpence Before their resolves had transpired a quÃ stor and some tribunes were commiflioned to take his devoted life  They OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 1 3 for a civil war They executed the order with equal boldness and success and with their bloody daggers in their hands ran through the streets pro claiming to the people and the soldiers the news of the happy re volution The enthusiasm of liberty was seconded by the promise of a large donative in lands and money the statues of Maximin were thrown doWnj the capital of the empire acknowledged with transport the authority of the two Gordians and the senate1 and the example of Rome was followed by the rest of Italy A new spirit had arisen in that assembly whose long patience had and prepare been insulted by wanton despotism and military licence The senate assumed the reins of government and with a calm intre pidity prepared to vindicate by arms the cause of freedom Among the consular senators recommended by their merit and services to the favour of the emperor Alexander it was easy to select twenty not unequal to the command of an army and the conduct of a war To these was the defence of Italy intrusted Each was ap pointed to act in his respective department authorized to enrol and discipline the Italian youth and instructed to fortify the ports and highways against the impending invasion of Maximin A number of deputies chosen from the most illustrious of the scnatorian and equestrian orders were dispatched at the same time to the governors of the several provinces earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of their country and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of friendship with the Roman senate and people The general respect with which these deputies were received and the zeal of Italy and the provinces in favour of the senate sufficiently prove that the subjects of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon distress in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression than from resistance The consciousness of that melan choly truth inspires a degree of persevering fury seldom to be found in thpse civil wars artificially supported for the benefit of a few factious and designing leaders 4  But THE DECLINE AND FALL D feat and But while the cause of the Gordians was embraced with such death of the twoGordianÂ diffusive ardour the Gordians themselves were no more The A D 237 3d July feeble court of Carthage was alarmed with the rapid approach of Capelianus governor of Mauritania who with a small band of Veterans and a fierce host of barbarians attacked a faithful but unwarlike province The younger Gordian sallied out to meet the enemy at the head of a few guards and a numerous undisciplined multitude educated in the peaceful luxury of Carthage His use less valour served only to procure him an honourable death in the field of battle His aged father whose reign had not exceeded thirty six days put an end to his life on the first news of the de feat Carthage destitute of defence opened her gates to the con queror and Africa was exposed to the rapacious cruelty of a slave obliged to satisfy his unrelenting master with a large account of blood and treasure 15 Election of The fate of the Gordians filled Rome with just but unexpected bl nug by terror The senate convoked in the temple of Concord affected to the senate transact the common business of the day  and seemed to decline 9thJuly  with trembling anxiety the consideration of their own and the public danger A silent consternation prevailed on the assembly till a senator of the name and family of Trajan awakened his brethren from their fatal lethargy He represented to them that the choice of cautious dilatory measures had been long since out of their power that Maximin implacable by nature and exasperated by injuries was advancing towards Italy at the head of the military force of the empire and that their only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the field or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful re bellion We have lost continued he two excellent princes but unless we desert ourselves the hopes of the republic have not  perished with the Gordians Many are the senators whose vir  tues have deserved and whose

to direct the civil administration I cheerfully expose myself to the danger and envy of the nomination and give my vote in favour of Maximus and Balbinus Ratify my choice conscript fathers or appoint in their place others more worthy of the empire The general apprehension silenced the whispers of jealousy the merit of the candidates was universally acknowledged and the house resounded with the sincere acclama tions of  long life and victory to the emperors Maximus and Balbinus You are happy in the judgment of the senate may the republic be happy under your administration 46 The virtues and the reputation of the new emperors justified the Their cha P   racters most sanguine hopes of the Romans The various nature of their talents seemed to appropriate to each his peculiar department of peace and war without leaving room for jealous emulation Bal binus was an admired orator a poet of distinguished fame and a wife magistrate who had exercised with innocence and applause the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of the empire His birth was noble 7 his fortune affluent his manners liberal and affable In him the love of pleasure was corrected by a fense of dignity nor had the habits of ease deprived him of a capacity for business The mind of Maximus was formed in a rougher mould By his valour and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments of the state and army His victories over the Sarmatians and the Germans the austerity of his life and the rigid impartiality of his justice whilst he was prÃ fect of the city commanded the esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Bal binus The two colleagues had both been consuls Balbinus had twice enjoyed that honourable office both

maturity of age and experience Tumult at After the senate had conferred on Maximus and Balbinus an younger Gcr equal portion of the consular and trihunitian powers the title of Fa ciÂ edC Cir triers Â t ie r Country and the joint office of Supreme Pontiff they ascended to the Capitol to return thanks to the gods protectors of Rome The solemn rites of sacrifice were disturbed by a sedi tion of the people The licentious multitude neither loved the rigid Maximus nor did they sufficiently fear the mild and humane Balbinus Their increasing numbers surrounded the temple of Jupiter with ob stinate clamours they asserted their inherent right of consenting to the election of their sovereign and demanded with an apparent moderation that besides the two emperors chosen by the senate a third should be added of the family of the Gordians as a just reâ turn of gratitude to those princes who had sacrificed their lives for th e republic At the head of the city guards and the youth of the equestrian order Maximus and Balbinus attempted to cut their way through the seditious multitude The multitude armed with sticks and stories drove them back into the Capitol It is prudent to yield â when the contest whatever may be the issue of it must be fatal to both parties A boyt only thirteen years of age the grandson of the elder and nephew of the younger Gordian was produced to the people invested with the ornaments and title of CÃ sar The tuinujt was appeased by this easy condescension and the two emperors when they were peaceably acknowledged in Rome pre pared to defend Italy against the common enemy Maximin p e Whilst in Rome and Africa revolutions succeeded each other with uc the se inconceivable rapidity the mind of Maximin was agitated by the nae and their moA furious passions He is said to have received the news of the emperors ir _ m 1 â rebellion of the GordianSa apd of the decree of the senate against hjm not with the terpper of a man but the rage of a wild beast j which as it could not discharge itself on the distant senate threat enedi OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE i ened the life of his son and of his friends and of all who ven tured to approach his person The grateful intelligence of the death of the Gordiaris was quickly followed By the assurance that the senate laying aside all hopes of pardon or accommodation had substituted in their room two emperors with whose merit he could not be unacquainted Revenge was the Only consolation left to Maximin and revenge could only be obtained by arms The strength of the legions had been assembled by Alexander from all parts of the empire Three successful campaigns against the Germans and the Sarmatians had raised heir fame confirmed their discipline and even increased their numbers by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian youth The life of Maximin had been spent in War and the candid severity of history cannot refuse him the valour of a soldier or even the abilities of an experienced general 0 It might naturally be expected that a prince of such a cha racter instead of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay mould immediately have maYched from the banks of the Danube to thole of the Tyber and that his victorious army instigated by contempt for the senate and eager to gather the spoils of Italy should have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative conquest Yet as far as we can trust to the obscure chronology of that period it appears that the Operations of some foreign war deferred the Italian expedition to the ensuing spring From the prudent con duct of Maximin we may learn that the savage features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of party that his passions however impetuous submitted to the force of reason and that the barbarian possessed something of the generous spirit of Sylla who subdued the enemies of Rome before he suffered himself to reverige his private injuries When the troops of Maximin advancing in excellent order Marches nto Italy arrived at the foot of the Julian Alps they were terrified by the a d 238 silence and desolation that reigned on the frontiers of Italy The Febraary B b 2 villages i88 THE DECLINE AND FALL villages and open towns had been deserted on their approach by the inhabitants the cattle was driven away the provisions removed or destroyed the bridges broke down nor was any thing left which could afford either shelter or subsistence to an invader Such had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate whose de sign was to protract the war to ruin the army of Maximin by the flow operation of famine and to consume his strength in the sieges of the principal cities of Italy which they had plentifully AquLll stored with men and provisions from the deserted country Aquileia received and withstood the first shock of the invasion The streams that issue from the head of the Hadriatic gulf swelled by the melting of the winter snows opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms of Maximin At length on a singular bridge constructed with art and difficulty of large hogsheads he transported his army to the opposite bank rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neigh bourhood of Aquileia demolished the suburbs and employed the timber of the buildings in the engines and towers with which on every side he attacked the city The walls fallen to decay during the security of a long peace had been hastily repaired on this sud den emergency but the firmest defence of Aquileia consisted in the constancy of the citizens all ranks of whom instead of being dismayed were animated by the extreme danger and their know ledge of the tyrant s unrelenting temper Their courage was supported and directed by Crispinus and Menophilus two of the twenty lieutenants of the senate who with a small body of regular troops had thrown themselves into the besieged place The army of Maximin was repulsed in repeated attacks his machines de stroyed by showers of artificial fire and the generous enthusiasm of the Aquileians was exalted into a confidence of success by the opinion that Belenus their tutelar deity combated in person in the defence of his distressed worshippers The 4 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 189 The emperor Maximus who had advanced as far as Ravenna Â a sof to secure that important place and to hasten the military prepa rations beheld the event of the war in the more faithful mirror of reason and policy He was too sensible that a single town could not resist the persevering efforts of a great army and he dreaded lest the enemy tired with the obstinate resistance of Aquileia should on a sudden relinquish the fruitless siege and march directly towards Rome The fate of the empire and the cause of freedom must then be committed to the chance of a battle and what arms could he oppose to the veteran legions of the Rhine and Danube Some troops newly levied among the generous but enervated youth of Italy and a body of German auxiliaries on whose firmness in the hour of trial it was dangerous to depend In the midst of these just alarms the stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes of Maximin and delivered Rome and the senate from the calamities that would surely have attended the victory of an enraged barba rian The people of Aquileia had scarcely experienced any of the Murder of common miseries of a siege their magazines were plentifully sup Msason 10 8nd plied and several fountains within the walls assured them an in A Lri exhaustible resource of fresh water The soldiers of Maximin were on the contrary exposed to the inclemency of the season and the horrors of famine The naked country was ruined the river3 filled with the slain and polluted with blood A spirit of despair and disaffection began to diffuse itself among the troops and as they were cut off from all intelligence they easily believed that the whole empire had embraced the cause of the senate and that they were left as devoted victims to perish under the impregnable walls of Aquileia The fierce temper of the tyrant was exasperated by disappointments which he imputed to the cowardice of his army and his wanton and ill timed cruelty instead of striking terror inspired hatred and a just desire of revenge A party of PrÃ torian THE DECLINE AND FALL PrÃ torian guards who trembled for their wives and children in the camp of Alba near Rome executed the sentence of the senate Maximin abandoned by his guards was flain in his tent with his son whom he had associated to the honours of the purple Anu linus the prÃ fect and the principal ministers of hi3 tyranny fc Their heads borne on the point of spears convinced the citizens of Aquileia that the siege was at an end the gates of the city were thrown open a liberal market was provided for the hungry troops of Maximin and the whole army joined in solemn protesta tions of fidelity to the senate and people of Rome and to their portrait iawfui emperors Maximus and Balbinus Such was the deserved fate of a brutal savage destitute as he has generally been re presented of every sentiment that distinguishes a civilized or even a human being The body was suited to the foul The sta ture of Maximin exceeded the measure of eight feet and circum stances almost incredible are related of his matchless strength and appetite 6 Had he lived in a less enlightened age tradition and poetry might well have described him as one of those monstrous giants whose supernatural power was constantly exerted for the destruction of mankind the It is easier to conceive than to describe the universal joy of the Roman world on the fall of the tyrant the news of which is said to have been carried in four days from Aquileia to Rome The re turn of Maximus was a triumphal procession his colleague and young Gordian went out to meet him and the three princes entered the capi tal attended by the ambassadors of almost all the cities of Italy saluted with the splendid offerings of gratitude and superstition and re ceived with the unfeigned acclamations of the senate and people who persuaded themselves that a golden age would succeed to an age of iron57 The conduct of the two emperors corresponded with these expectations They administered justice in person and the rigour of the one was tempered by the other s clemency The oppressive 2 taxes OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE rcjr taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and focceffion were repealed or at least moderated Discipline was revived and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were en acted by their imperial ministers who endeavoured to restore a civiF constitution on the ruins of military tyranny â What reward may we expect for delivering Rome from a monster was the question asked by Maximus in a moment of freedom and confidence Bal binus answered it without hesitation  The love of the senate or  the people and of all mankind Alas replied his more penetrating colleague Alas I dread the hatred of the soldiers and the fatal effects of their resentment His apprehensions were but too well justified by the event Whilst Maximus was preparing to defend Italy against the com Seditions w mon foe Balbinus who remained at Rome had been engaged in Rome scenes of blood and intestine discord Distrust and jealousy reigned in the senate and even in the temples where they assembled every senator carried either open or concealed arms In the midst of their deliberations two veterans of the guards actuated either by curiosity or a sinister motive audacioufly thrust themselves into the house and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of Victory Gallicanus a consular and MÃ cenas a PrÃ torian senator viewed with indigna tion their insolent intrusion drawing their daggers they laid the spies for such they deemed them dead at the foot of the altar and then advancing to the door of the senate imprudently exhorted the multitude to massacre the PrÃ torians as the secret adherents of the tyrant Those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp which they defended with superior advantage against the reiterated attacks of the people assisted by the numerous bands of gladiators the property of opulent nobles The civil war lasted many days with infinite loss and confusion on both sides When the pipes were broken that supplied the camp with water the PrÃ torians were reduced to intolerable distress j but in their turn they made 192 THE DECLINE AND FALL made desperate sallies into the city set fire to a great number of houses and filled the streets with the blood of the inhabitants The emperor Balbinus attempted by ineffectual edicts and precarious truces to reconcile the factions at Rome But their animosity though smothered for a while burnt with redoubled violence The soldiers detesting the senate and the people despised the weakness of a prince who wanted either the spirit or the power to command the obedience of his subjects19 Discontent of After the tyrant s death his formidable army had acknowledged guards 0 2 from necessity rather than from choice the authority of Maximus who transported himself without delay to the camp before Aquileia As soon as he had received their oath of fidelity he addressed them in terms full of mildness and moderation lamented rather than arraigned the wild disorders of the times and assured the soldiers that of all their past conduct the senate would remember only their generous desertion of the tyrant and their voluntary return to their duty Maximus enforced his exhortations by a liberal donative purified the camp by a solemn sacrifice of expiation and then dis missed the legions to their several provinces impressed as he hoped with a lively fense of gratitude and obedience 4Â But nothing could reconcile the haughty spirit of the PrÃ torians They attended the emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into Rome but amidst the general acclamations the sullen dejected countenance of the guards sufficiently declared that they considered themselves as the object rather than the partners of the triumph When the whole body was united in their camp those who had served under Maximin and those who had remained at Rome began to mingle their complaints and apprehensions The emperors chosen by the army had perished with ignominy those elected by the senate were seated on the throne 41 The long discord between the civil and military powers was decided by a war in which the former had obtained a complete victory The soldiers must now learn a new OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 193 new doctrine of submission to the senate  and whatever clemency was affected by that politic assembly they dreaded a flow revenge coloured by the name of discipline and justified by fair pretences of the public good But their fate was still in their own hands and if they had courage to despise the vain terrors of an impotent republic it was easy to convince the world that those who were masters of the arms were masters of the authority of the state When the senate elected two prinees it is probable that besides Massacre of the declared reason of providing for the various emergencies of BaibinuÂ peace and war they were actuated by the secret desire of weakenr ing by division the despotism of the supreme magistrate Their policy was effectual but it proved fatal both to their emperors and to themselves The jealousy of power was soon exasperated by the difference of character Maximus despised Balbinus as a luxurious noble and was in his turn disdained by his colleague as an obseure soldier Their silent discord was understood rather than seen 41 but the mutual consciousness prevented them from uniting in any vigorous measures of defence against their common enemies of the Praetorian camp The whole city was employed in the Capkoline A D t S games ami the emperors were left almost alone in the palace On July Â 5Â a sudden they were alarmed by the approach of a troop of desperate afiaflins Ignorant of each other s situation or designs for they al ready occupied very distant apartments afraid to give or to receive assistance they wasted the important moments in idle debates and fruitless recriminations The arrival of the guards put an end to the vain strife They seized on these emperors of the senate for such they called them with malicious contempt stripped rhem of their garments and

mangled with a thousand wounds were left exposed to the insults or to the pity of the populace In the space of a few months six princes had been cut off by the sword Gordian who had already received the title of CÃ sar was the only person that occurred to the soldiers as proper to sill the vacant throne  They carried him to the camp and unani mously saluted him Augustus and emperor His name was dear to the senate and people his tender age promised a long impunity of military licence and the submission of Rome and the provinces to the choice of the PrÃ torian guards saved the republic at the ex pence indeed of its freedom and dignity from the horrors of a new civil war in the heart of the capital s As the third Gordian was only nineteen years of age at the time of his death the history of his life were it known to us with greater accuracy than it really is would contain little more than the account of his education and the conduct of the ministers who by turns abused or guided the simplicity of his unexperienced youth Immediately after his accession he fell into the hands of his mo ther s eunuchs that pernicious vermin of the East who since the days of Elagabalus had infected the Roman palace By the artful conspiracy of these wretches an impenetrable veil was drawn be tween an innocent prince and his oppressed subjects the virtuous disposition of Gordian was deceived and the honours of the empire sold without his knowledge though in a very public manner to the most worthless of mankind We are ignorant by what fortu nate accident the emperor escaped from this ignominious slavery and devolved his confidence on a minister whose wise councils had no object except the glory of his sovereign and the happiness of the people It should seem that love and learning introduced Misi theus to the favour of Gordian The young prince married the daughter of his master of rhetoric and promoted his father in law OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE to the first offices of the empire Two admirable letters that passed between them are stil extant The minister with the conscious dignity of virtue congratulates Gordian that he is delivered from the tyranny of the eunuchs 6 and still more that he is sensible of his deliverance The emperor acknowledges with an amiable con fusion the errors of his past conduct and laments with singular propriety the misfortune of a monarch from whom a

that great man a b 242 that when he was appointed PrÃ torian prÃ fect he discharged the military duties of his place with vigour and ability The Persians had invaded Mesopotamia and threatened Antioch By the per suasion of his father in law the young emperor quitted the luxury of Rome opened for the last time recorded in history the temple of Janus and marched in person into the East On his approach with a great army the Persians withdrew their garrisons from the cities which they had already taken and retired from the Euphrates to the Tigris Gordian enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the senate the first success of his arms which he ascribed with a becom ing modesty and gratitude to the wisdom of his father and prÃ fect During the whole expedition Misitheus watched over the safety and discipline of the army  whilst he prevented their dangerous murmurs by maintaining a regular plenty in the camp and by esta blishing ample magazines of vinegar bacon straw barley and wheat in all

the military government of the Roman empire  What ist that age was called the Roman empire was only an n irregular republic not unHke the Aristocracy51 of Algiers where the militia possessed of the sovereignty creates and deposes a magistrate who is styled a Dey Perhaps indeed it may be laid  down as a general rule that a military government is in some  respects more republican than monarchical Nor can it be said â that the soldiers only partook of the government by their dis 41 obedience and rebellions The speeches made to them by the emperors were they not at length of the fame nature as those 4 formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the tri â bunes And although the armies had no regular place or forms â of assembly though their debates were short their action sudden  and their resolves seldom the result of cool reflection did they not â dispose with absolute sway of the public fortune What was the emperor except the minister of a violent government elected 44 for

memory of his erimes and of captivating the affections Phll p of the people solemnized the secular games with infinite pomp and magnificence Since their institution or revival by Au gustus they had been celebrated by Claudius by Domitian and by Severus and were now renewed the fifth time on the ac complishment of the full period of a thousand years from the foun dation of Rome Every circumstance of the secular games was SecuIar J  games skilfully adapted to inspire the superstitious mind with deep and A P solemn reverence The long interval between them50 exceeded1 the term of human life and as none of the spectators had already seen them none could flatter themselves with the expectation of be holding them a second time The mystio sacrifices were performed during three nights on the banks of the Tyber  and the Campus Martius resounded with music and dances and was illuminated with innumerable lamps and torches Slaves and strangers were excluded from the peculiar ceremonies of the republic A chorus xg8 THE DECLINE AND FALL chorus of twenty seven youths and as many virgins of noble fa milies and whose parents were both alive implored the propitious gods in the favour of the

their anxious minds the past history and the future fate of the empire Decline ofthe Since Romulus with a small band of shepherds and outlaws for Roman cm jjggj himself Qn the hills near the Tyber ten centuries had already elapsed5 During the four first ages the Romans in the laborious school of poverty had acquired the virtues of war and government By the vigorous exertion of those virtues and by the assistance of fortune they had obtained in the course of the three succeeding centuries an absolute empire over many countries of Europe Asia and Africa The last three hundred years had been consumed in apparent prosperity and internal decline The nation of soldiers magistrates and legiflators who composed the thirty five tribes of the Roman people was dissolved into the common mass of mankind and confounded with the millions of servile provin cials who had received the name without adopting the spirit of Romans A mercenary army levied among the subjects and barbarians of the frontier was the only order of men who pre served and abused their independence By their tumultuary elec tion a Syrian a Goth or an Arab was exalted to the throne of Rome and invested with despotic power over the conquests and over the country of the Scipios  The limits of the Roman empire still extended from the Western Ocean to the Tigris and from Mount Atlas to the Rhine and the Danube To thÂ undiscerning eye of the vulgar Philip appeared a monarch OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE a monarch no less powerful than Hadrian or Augustus The form was still the fame but the animating health and vigour were fled The industry of the people was discouraged and exhausted by a long series of oppression The discipline of the legions which alone after the extinction of every other virtue had propped the greatness of the state was corrupted by the ambition or relaxed by the weakness of the emperors The strength of the frontiers which had always consisted in arms rather than in fortifications was insensibly undermined and the fairest provinces were left ex posed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbarians who sooa discovered the decline of the Roman power  CHAP 8oo THE DECLINE AND FALL CHAP VIII The barba rians of the East and of the North Revolutions of Alia Of the state of Persia after the restoration of the mo narchy by Artaxerxes WHENEVER Tacitus indulgea himself b these beautiful episodes in which he relates some domestic transaction of the Germans or of the Parthians his principal object is to relieve the attention of the reader from a uniform scene of rice and misery From the reign of Augustus to the time of Alexander Severus the enemies of Rome were in her bosom the tyrants and the soldiers and her prosperity had a very distant and feeble interest in tbe revo lutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates But when the military order had levelled in wild anarchy the power of the prince the laws of the senate and even the discipline of the camp the barbarians of the north and of the east who had long hovered on the frontier boldly attacked the provinces of a declin ing monarchy Their vexatious inroads became formidable inva sions and after a long vicissitude of mutual calamities many tribes of the victorious invaders established themselves in the provinces of the Roman empire To obtain a clearer knowledge of these great events we hall endeavour to form a previous idea of the character forces and designs of those nations who avenged the cause of Hannibal and Mithridates In the more early ages of the world whilst the forests that covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages the inha bitants of Asia were already collected into populous cities and re duced under extensive empires the seat of the arts of luxury and df aWpOtlfrn The Assyrians reigned over the Easttill the scepter of Ninus and Semiramis dropt from the hands of their enervated successors OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 201 successors The Medes and the Babylonians divided their power and were themselves swallowed up in the monarchy of the Persians whose arms could not be confined within the narrow limits of Asia Followed as it is said by two millions of men Xerxes the descendant of Cyrus invaded Greece Thirty thousand soldiers under the command of Alexander the son of Philip who was intrusted by the Greeks with their glory and revenge were sufficient to subdue Persia The princes of the house of Seleucus usurped and lost the Macedonian command over the East About the same time that by an ignominious treaty they resigned to the Romans the country on this side Mount Taurus they were driven by the Parthians an obscure horde of Scythian origin from all the provinces of Upper Asia The formidable power of the Parthians which spread from India to the frontiers of Syria was in its turn subverted by Ardstiir or Artaxerxes the founder of a new dynasty which under the name of Sassanides governed Persia till the invasion of the Arabs This great revolution whose fatal influence was soon experienced by the Romans happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus two hundred and twenty six years after the Christian sera  Artaxerxes had served with great reputation in the armies of ThePe ian Â x monarchy Artaban the last king of the Parthians and it appears that he was estÂ red by it â â Artaxerxes driven into exile and rebellion by royal ingratitude the customary reward for superior merit His birth was obscure and the obscurity equally gave room to the aspersions of his enemies and the flattery of his adherents If we credit the scandal of the former Arta xerxes sprang from the illegitimate commerce of a tanner s wife with a common soldier  The latter represent him as descended from a branch of the ancient kings of Persia though time and misfortune had gradually reduced his ancestors to the humble station of private citizens 4 As the lineal heir of the monarchy he asserted his right to the throne and challenged the noble taste of delivering the Persians from the oppression under which they uVol I D d groaned BO THE DECLINE AND FALL groaned above five centuries since the death of Dariu6 The Par thians were defeated in three great battles In the last of these their king Artaban was flain and the spirit of the nation wa6 for ever brokenJ The authority of Artaxerxes was solemnly acknow ledged in a great assembly held at Balch in Khorasan Two younger branches of the royal house of Arsaces were confounded among the prostrate satraps A third more mindful of ancient grandeur than of present necessity attempted to retire with a numerous train of vassals towards their kiniftnan the king of Armenia j but this little army of deserters was intercepted and cut off by the vigilance of the conqueror 6 who boldly assumed the double diadem and the title of King of Kings which had been enjoyed by his predecessor But these pompous titles instead of gratifying the vanity of the Persian served only to admonisli him of his duty and to inflame in his foul the ambition of restoring in their full splendour the religion and empire of Cyrus Reformation j During the long servitude of Persia under the Macedonian â f ihe Magian Â religion and the Parthian yoke the nations of Europe and Asia had mu tually adopted aud corrupted each other s superstitions The Arsacides indeed practised the worship of the Magi  but they disgraced and polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry The memory of Zoroaster the ancient prophet and philosopher of the Persians 7 was still revered in the East  but the obsolete and mysterious language in which the Zendavesta was composed  opened a field of dispute to seventy sects which had arisen in his religion and were all equally derided by a crowd of infi dels who rejected the divine mission and miracles of the prophet To suppress the idolaters reunite the schismatics and confute the unbelievers by the infallible decision of a general council the pious Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all parts of his dominions These priests who had so long sighed in contempt and obscurity obeyed the welcome summons j and on the appointed day appeared i to OF THE ROMAN EMPIRL i to the number of about eighty thousand But as neither reason nor enthusiasm could have guided so tumultuary an aflembly it was reduced by successive operations to forty thousand to four thousand to four hundred to forty and at last to seven Magi the most respected for their learning and piety One of these Erdaviraph a young but holy prelate received from the hands of his brethren three cups of soporiferous wine He drank them off and instantly fell into a long and profound sleep As soon as he waked he related to the king and to the believing multi tude his journey to Heaven and his intimate conferences with the Deity Every doubt was silenced by this supernatural evidenceÂ and the articles of the faith of Zoroaster were fixed with equal authority and precision 9 A short delineation of that celebrated system will be found useful not only to display the character of the Persian nation but to illustrate many of their most important trans actions both in peace and war with the Roman empire io The ereat and fundamental article of the system was the ce P ersian â lebrated doctrine of the two principles a bold and injudicious principles attempt of Eastern philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral and physical evil with the attributes of a beneficent Creator and governor of the world The first and original Being in whom or by whom the universe exists is denominated in the writings of Zoroaster Time without bounds but it must be confessed that this infinite substance seems rather a metaphysical abstraction of the mind than a real object endowed with self consciousness or possessed of moral perfections From either the blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite Time which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the Greeks the two secondary but active prin ciples of the universe were from all eternity produced Ormusd and Ahriman each of them possessed of the powers of creation but each disposed by his invariable nature to exercise them with dif ferent designs The principle of good is eternally absorbed in light D d z the THE DECLINE AND FALL the principle of evil eternally buried in darkness The wife benevo lence of Ormusd formed man capable of virtue and abundantly pro vided his fair habitation with the materials of happiness By his vigilant providence the motion of the planets the order of the seasons and the temperate mixture of the elements are preserved But the malice of Ahriman has long since pierced Ormusd s egg t or in other words has violated the harmony of his works Since that fatal irruption the most minute particles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated together the rankest poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants deluges earth quakes and conflagrations attest the conflict of Nature and the little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune Whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chains of their infernal enemy the faithful Persian alone reserves his religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd and sights under his banner of light in the full confidence that he shall in the last day mare the glory of his triumph At that decisive period the enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power of Ormusd superior to the furious malice of his rival Ahriman and his followers disarmed and subdued will sink into their native darkness and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the universe The theology of Zoroaster was darkly comprehended by foreigners and even by the far greater number of his disciples but the most careless observers were struck with the philosophic simplicity of the Persian worship That people says Herodotus rejects the use of temples of altars and of statues and smiles at the folly of  those nations who imagine that the gods are sprung from or bear any affinity with the human nature The tops of the highest mountains are the places chosen for sacrifices Hymns  and prayers are the principal worship the Supreme God who  fills the wide circle of Heaven is the object to whom they are 6 addressed OF T H E R O M A N EMPIRE 20  addressed Yet at the same time in the true spirit of a polytheist he accuses them of adoring Earth Water Fire the Winds and the Sun and Moon But the Persians of every age have denied the charge and explained the equivocal conduct which might appear to give a colour to it The elements and more particu larly Fire Light and the Sun whom they called Mithra were the objects of their religious reverence because they considered them as the purest symbols the noblest productions and the most powerful agents of the Divine Power and Nature   â Every mode of religion to make a deep and lasting impression on the human mind must exercise our obedience by enjoining practices precept of devotion for which we can assign no reason  and must acquire our esteem by inculcating moral duties analogous to the dictates of our own hearts The religion of Zoroaster was abundantly provided with the former and possessed a sufficient portion of the latter Ar the age of puberty the faithful Persian was invested with a mys terious girdle the badge of the divine protection and from that moment all the actions of his life even the most indifferent or the most necessary were sanctified by their peculiar prayers ejaculations or genuflexions the omission of which under any circumstances was a grievous sin not inferior in guilt to the vio lation of the moral duties The moral duties however of justice mercy liberality c were in their turn required of the disciple of Zoroaster who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman and to live with Ormusd in a blissful eternity where the degree of felicity is exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety  But there are some remarkable instances in which Zoroaster lays Encourage aside the prophet assumes the legislator and discovers a liberal g concern for private and public happiness seldom to be found among the groveling or visionary schemes of superstition Fasting and celibacy the common means of purchasing the divine favour he condemns with abhorrence as a criminal rejection of the best gifts 3oÂ THE DECLINE AND FALL gifts of providence The faint in the Magian religion h obliged to beget children to plant useful trees to destroy noxious animals to convey water to the dry lands of Persia and to work out his salvation by pursuing all the labours of agrrcultuTe We may quote from the Zendavesta a wife and benevolent maxim which com pensates for many an absurdity He who sows the ground with care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than M he could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers V In the spring of every year a festival was celebrated destined to represent the primitive equality and the present connexion of man kind The stately kings of Persia exchanging their vain pomp for more genuine greatness freely mingled with the humblest but most useful of their subjects On that day the husbandmen were admitted without distinction to the table of the king and his satraps The monarch accepted their petitions inquired into their grievances and conversed with them on the most equal terms From your labours was he accustomed to fay and to fay with truth if not with sincerity from your labours we receive our â subsistence you derive your tranquillity from our vigilance since therefore we are mutually necessary to each other let us live together like brothers in concord and love V Such a fes tival must indeed have degenerated in a wealthy and despotic empire into a theatrical representation  but it was at least a co medy well worthy of a royal audience and which might sometimes imprint a salutary lesson on the mind of a young prince Power of the Had Zoroaster in all his institutions invariably supported this ex Â alted character his name would deserve a place with those of Numa and Confucius and his system would be justly entitled to all the applause which it has pleased some of our Divines and even some of our philosophers to bestow on it But in that motley composi tion dictated by reason and passion by enthusiasm and by selfish motives some useful and sublime truths were disgraced by a mix ture r OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE sure of the most abject and dangerous superstition The Magi or sacerdotal order were extremely numerous since as we have already seen fourscore thou nd of them attended a general council Their forces were multiplied by discipline A regular hierarchy was diffused through all the provinces of Persia and the Archimagus who resided at Balch was respected as the visible head of the church and the lawful successor of Zoroaster 7 The property of the Magi was very considerable Besides the lese invidious posses sion of a large tract of the most fertile lands of Media s they levied a general tax on the fortunes and the industry of the Persians Though your good works fays the interested prophet exceed in number the leaves of the trees the drops of rain the stars in  the heaven or the sands on the sea shore they will all be un  profitable to you unless they are accepted by the deftour or priest To obtain the acceptation of this guide to salvation you must faithfully pay him tythes of all you possess of your goods of  your lands and of your money If the destour be satisfied your  foul will escape hell tortures you will secure praise in this world 41 and happiness in the next For the destours are the teachers of Â religion  they know all things and they deliver all men Â These convenient maxims of reverence and implicit faith were doubtless imprinted with care on the tender minds of youth since the Magi were the masters of education in Persia and to their hands the children even of the royal family were intrusted The Persian priests who were of a speculative genius preserved and investigated i the secrets of Oriental philosophy and acquired either by supe rior knowledge or superior art the Teputation of being well versed i in feme occult sciences which have derived their appellation from the Magi Those of more active dispositions mingled with the world in courts and cities and it is observed that the administra tion of Artaxerxes was in a great measure directed by the counsels of THE DECLINE AND FALL of the sacerdotal order whose dignity either from policy or devo tion that prince restored to its ancient splendour  Spirit of per The first counsel of the Magi was agreeable to the unsociable ge C i t nius of their faith14 to the practice of ancient kings 1J and even to the example of their legislator who had fallen a victim to a re ligious war excited by his own intolerant zeal l4 By an edict of Artaxerxes the exercise of every worship except that of Zoroaster was severely prohibited The temples of the Parthians and the sta tues of their deified monarchs were thrown down with ignominy 17 The sword of Aristotle such was the name given by the orientals to the polytheism and philosophy of the Greeks was easily broken 18 the flames of persecution soon reached the more stubborn Jews and Christians  nor did they spare the heretics of their own nation and religion The majesty of Ormusd who was jealous of a rival was seconded by the despotism of Artaxerxes who could not suffer a rebel and with the assistance of what his prelates no doubt called wholesome severities the schismatics within his vast empire were soon reduced to the inconsiderable number of eighty thousand J0 This spirit of persecution reflects dishonour on the religion of Zo roaster but as it was not productive of any civil commotion it served â to strengthen the new monarchy by uniting all the various

in their mountain and the Greek cities of Upper Asia JI within their walls scarcely acknowledged or at least obeyed any superior and the Parthian empire exhibited under other names a lively image of the feudal system 51 which has since prevailed in Europe But the active victor at the head of a numerous and disciplined army visited in person every province of Persia The defeat of the boldest rebels and the reduction of the strongest fortifications diffused the terror of his arms and prepared the way for the peaceful reception of his authority An obstinate resistance was fatal to the chiefs but their followers were treated with lenity  A cheerful submission was rewarded with honours and riches hut the prudent ArtaxerxCs suffering no person except himself to assume the title of king abo lished every intermediate power between the throne and the people His kingdom nearly equal in extent to modern Persia was on every Extent and  population of fide bounded by the sea or by great rivers by the Euphrates the Persia Tigris the Araxes the Oxus and the Indus by the Caspian sea and the gulph of Persia That country was computed to contain in the last century five hundred and fifty four cities sixty thousand villages and about forty millions of fouls If we compare the administration of the house of Sassan with that of the house of Sefi the political influence of the Magian with that of the Mahometan religion we shall probably infer that the kingdom of Artaxerxes contained at least as great a number of cities villages and inhabit ants But it must likewise be confessed that in every age the want of harbours on the sea coast and the scarcity of frefli water in the inland provinces have been very unfavourable to the com merce and agriculture of the Persians who in the calculation of their numbers seem to have indulged one of the meanest though most common artifices of national vanity As soon as the ambitious mind of Artaxerxes had triumphed over Recapitula te resistance of his vassals he began to threaten the neighbouring war between tv t 17 n thePaithian Vol I E e â states THE DECLINE AND FALL states who during the long slumber of his predecessors had insulted Perfia with impunity He obtained some easy victories over the wild Scythians and the effeminate Indians j but the Romans were an enemy who by their past injuries and present power deserved the utmost efforts of his arms A forty years tranquillity the fruit of valour and moderation had succeeded the victories of Trajan During the period that elapsed from the accession of Marcus to the reign of Alexander the Roman and the Parthian empires were twice engaged in war and although the whole strength of the Arsacides contended with a part only of the forces of Rome the event was most commonly in favour of the latter Macrinus indeed prompted by his precarious situation and pusillanimous temper purchased a peace at the expence of near two millions of our money 56 but the generals of Marcus the emperor Severus and his son erected many trophies in Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria Among their ex ploits the imperfect relation of which would have unseasonably in terrupted the more important series of domestic revolutions we shall only mention the repeated calamities of the two great cities of Se leucia and Ctesiphon Seleucia on the western bank of the Tigris about forty five miles to the north of ancient Babylon was the capital of the Mace donian conquest in Upper Asia 11 Many ages after the fall of their empire Seleucia retained the genuine characters of a Grecian colony arts military virtue and the love of freedom The independent republic was governed by a senate of three hundred nobles the people consisted of six hundred thousand citizens the walls were strong and as long as concord prevailed among the several orders of the state they viewed with contempt the power of the Parthian the madness of faction was sometimes provoked to implore the dan gerous aid of the common enemy who was posted almost at the gates of the colony 5 The Parthian monarchs like the Mogul sovereigns of Hindostan delighted in the pastoral life of their Scythian ances tors OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tors and the imperial camp was usually pitched in the plain of Ctefiphon on the eastern bank of the Tigris at the distance of only three miles from Seleucia The innumerable attendants on luxury and despotism resorted to the court and the little village of Ctefi phon insensibly swelled into a great city 40 Under the reign of Marcus the Roman generals penetrated as far as Ctefiphon and Se leucia They were received as friends by the Greek colony they A D 165 attacked as enemies the feat of the Parthian kings  yet both cities experienced the fame treatment The sack and conflagration of Seleucia with the massacre of three hundred thousand of the inha bitants tarnished the glory of the Roman triumph Seleucia already exhausted by the neighbourhood of a too powerful rival sunk under the fatal blow but Ctefiphon in about thirty three A D 198  years had sufficiently recovered its strength to maintain an obsti nate siege against the emperor Severus The city was however taken by assault the king who defended it in person escaped with precipitation an hundred thousand captives and a rich booty re warded the fatigues of the Roman soldiers 41 Notwithstanding these misfortunes Ctefiphon succeeded to Babylon and to Seleucia as one of the great capitals of the East In summer the monarch of Persia enjoyed at Ecbatana the cool breezes of the mountains of Media but the mildness of the climate engaged him to prefer Ctefiphon for his winter residence From these successful inroads the Romans derived no real or Conquest of Oirhoene by lasting benefit nor did they attempt to preserve such distant con the Romans quests separated from the provinces of the empire by a large tract of intermediate desert The reduction of the kingdom of Osrhoene was an acquisition of less splendour indeed but of a far more solid advantage That little state occupied the northern and most fertile part of Mesopotamia between the Euphrates and the Tigris Edessa its capital was situated about twenty miles beyond the former of those rivers and the inhabitants since the time of Alexander were 1 E e 2 a mixed 212 THE DECLINE AND FALL A D 216 Artaxerxes claimi the provinces of Asia and

inclination to the Par thian cause but the superior power of Rome exacted from them a reluctant homage which is still attested by their medals After the conclusion of the Parthian war under Marcus it was judged pru dent to secure some substantial pledges of their doubtful fidelity Forts were constructed in several parts of the country and a Roman garrison was fixed in the strong town of Nisibis During the trou bles that followed the death of Commodus the princes of Osrhoene attempted to shake off the yoke but the stern policy of Severus confirmed their dependence44 and the perfidy of Caracalla com pleted the easy conquest Abgarus the last king of Edessa was sent in chains to Rome his dominions reduced into a province and his capital dignified with the rank of colony and thus the Romans about ten years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy obtained a firm and permanent establishment beyond the Euphrates45 Prudence as well as glory might have justified a war on the side of Artaxerxes had his views been confined to the defence or the acqui sition of a useful frontier But the ambitious Persian openly avowed a far more extensive design of conquest and he thought himself able to support his lofty pretensions by the arms of reason as well as by those of power Cyrus he alleged had first subdued and his suc cessors had for a long time possessed the whole extent of Asia as far as the Propontis and the Ã gaean sea the provinces of Caria and Ionia under their empire had been governed by Persian satraps and all Egypt to the confines of Ã thiopia had acknowledged their sovereignty46 Their rights had been suspended but not destroyed by a long usurpation j and as soon as he received the Persian dia dem which birth and successful valour had placed upon his head the first great duty of his station called upon him to restore the an cient limits and splendour of the monarchy The Great King there fore OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE fore such was the haughty style of his embassies to the emperor Alexander commanded the Romans instantly to depart from all the provinces of his ancestors and yielding to the Persians the em pire of Asia to content themselves with the undisturbed possession of Europe This haughty mandate was delivered by four hundred of the tallest and most beautiful of the Persians who by their fine horses splendid arms and rich apparel displayed the pride and greatness of their master 47 Such an embassy was much less an offer of negociation than a declaration of war Both Alexander Severus and Artaxerxes collecting the military force of the Roman and Persian monarchies resolved in this important contest to lead their armies in person If we credit what should seem the most authentic of all records Ps tcndcd victory of an oration still extant and delivered by the emperor himself to the Alexander Severus senate we must allow that the victory of Alexander Severus was A D iy not inferior to any of those formerly obtained over the Persians by the son of Philip The army of the Great King consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse clothed in complete armour of steel of seven hundred elephants with towers filled with ar chers on their backs and of eighteen hundred chariots armed with scythes This formidable host the like of which is not to be found in eastern history and has scarcely been imagined in eastern romance 4 was discomfited in a great battle in which the Roman Alexander ap proved himself an intrepid soldier and a skilful general The Great King fled before his valour  an immense booty and the conquest of Mesopotamia were the immediate fruits of this signal victory Such are the circumstances of this ostentatious and improbable relation dictated as it too plainly appears by the vanity of the monarchy composed by the unblushing servility of his flatterers and received without contradiction by a distant and obsequious senate Far from being inclined to believe that the arms of Alexander obtained so memorable a victory over the Persians we are induced to suspect that 2I4 THE DECLINE AND FALL that all this blaze of imaginary glory was designed to conceal some real disgrace More proba Our suspicions are confirmed by the authority of a contemporary If thewar historian who mentions the virtues of Alexander with respect and his faults with candour He describes the judicious plan which had been formed for the conduct of the war Three Roman armies were destined to invade Persia at the fame time and by different roads But the operations of the campaign though wisely con certed were not executed either with ability or success The first of these armies as soon as it had entered the marflvy plains of Ba bylon towards the artificial conflux of the Euphrates and the Tigris 5Â was encompassed by the superior numbers and destroyed by the arrows of the enemy The alliance of Chosroes king of Armenia s and the long tract of mountainous country in which the Persian cavalry was of little service opened a secure entrance into the heart of Media to the second of the Roman armies These brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces and by several success ful actions against Artaxerxes gave a faint colour to the emperor s vanity But the retreat of this victorious army was imprudent or at least unfortunate In repasting the mountains great numbers of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads and the severity of the winter season It had been resolved that whilst these two great detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the Per sian dominions the main body under the command of Alexander himself should support their attack by invading the center of the kingdom But the unexperienced youth influenced by his mother s counsels and perhaps by his own fears deserted the bravest troops and the fairest prospect of victory and after consuming in Meso potamia an inactive and inglorious summer he led back to Antioch an army diminished by sickness and provoked by disappointment The behaviour of Artaxerxes had been very different Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the marshes of the Euphrates he OF T HE ROMAN EMPIRE 215 1 he had every

emperor s death presented themselves ire vain to his ambition Instead of expelling the Romans as he pre tended from the continent of Asia he found himself unable to wrest from their hands the little

the East and even in that of Rome His character seems A D 2 Â to have been marked by those bold and commanding features tha generally distinguish the princes who conquer from those who inherit an empire Till the last period of the Persian monarchy his code of laws was respected as the ground work of their civil and religious policy53 Several of his sayings are preserved One of them in particular discovers a deep insight into the constitution of government  The authority of the prince said Artaxerxes  must  be defended by a military force that force can only be main u tained by taxes all taxes must at last fall upon agriculture and  agriculture can never flourish except under the protection of justice and moderation JV Artaxerxes bequeathed his new em pire and his ambitious designs against the Romans to Sapor a son not unworthy of his great father but those designs were too extensive for the power of Persia and served only to involve both nations in a long series of destructive wars and reciprocal calamities The Persians long since civilized and corrupted were very far Military from possessing the martial independence and the intrepid hardi ness both of mind and body which have rendered the northern barbarians masters of the world The science of war that con stituted the more rational force of Greece and Rome as it now does 8 of THE DECLINE AND FALt of Europe never made any considerable progress in the East Those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and animate a confused multitude were unknown to the Persians They were equally un stcilled in the arts of constructing besieging or defending regular fortifications They trusted more to their numbers than to their t vee t â t c HiraSe 5 more to their courage than to their discipline The infantry jble  was a half armed spiritless crowd of peasants levied in haste by the allurements of plunder and as easily dispersed by a victory as by a defeat The monarch and his nobles transported into the camp the pride and luxury of the seraglio Their military operations were impeded by a useless train of women eunuchs horses and ca mels and in the midst of a successful campaign the Persian host was often separated or destroyed by an unexpected famine Their cavalry But the nobles of Persia in the bosom of luxury and despotism preserved a strong sense of personal gallantry and national honour From the age of seven years they were taught lo speak truth to shoot with the bow and to ride and it was universally confessed that in the two last of these arts they had made a more than com mon proficiency s6 The most distinguished youth were educated under the monarch s eye practised their exercises in the gate of his palace and were severely trained up to the habits of temperance and obedience in their long and laborious parties of hunting In every province the satrap maintained a like school of military virtue The Persian nobles so natural is the idea of feudal tenures received from the king s bounty lands and houses on the condition of their service in war They were ready on the first summons to mount on horseback with a martial and splendid train of follow ers and to join the numerous bodies of guards who were care fully selected from among the most robust slaves and the bravest ad venturers of Asia These armies both of light and of heavy cavalry equally formidable by the impetuosity of their charge and the rapidity of their motions threatened as an impending cloud the pastern provinces of the declining empire of Rome CHAP OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE CHAP IXr The State of Germany till the invasion of the Barhariam in the time of the Emperor Decius TT HE government and religion of Persia have deserved some â notice from their connexion with the decline and fall of the Roman empire We shall occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian tribes that with their arms and horses their flocks and herds their wives and families wandered over the immense plains which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula from the confines of Persia to those of Germany But the warlike Ger mans who first resisted then invaded and at length overturned the western monarchy of Rome will occupy a much more im portant place in this history and pofless a stronger and if we may use the expression a more domestic claim to our attention and regard The most civilized nations of modern Europe issued from the woods of Germany and in the rude institutions of those harha rians we may still distinguish the original principles of our pre sent laws and manners In their primitive state of simplicity and independence the Germans were surveyed by the discerning eye and delineated by the masterly pencil of Tacitus the first of his torians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts In his incomparable treatise which contains perhaps more ideas than words he has comprehended a description of the German manners that has formerly exercised the diligence of innumerable antiquarians and employed the genius and penetration of the philo sophic historians of our own times The subject however various and important has already been so frequently so ably and so  Vol I F f sue ai8 THE DECLINE AND FALL successfully discussed that it is now grown familiar to the reader and difficult to the writer We shall therefore content ourselves with observing and indeed with repeating some of the most im portant circumstances of climate of manners and of institutions which rendered the wild barbarians of Germanyj such formidable enemies to the Roman power Extent of Ancient Germany excluding from its independent limits the pro vince westward of the Rhine which had submitted to the Roman yoke extended itself over a third part of Europe Almost the whole of mo dern Germany Denmark Norway Sweden Finland Livonia Prussia and the greater part of Poland were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation whose complexion manners and language denoted a common origin and preserved a striking resemblance On the west ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallic and on the south by the Danube from the lllyrian provinces of the empire A ridge of hills rising from the Danube and called the Carpathian Mountains covered Germany on the side of Dacia or Hungary The eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mu tual fears of the Germans and the Sarmatians and was often con founded by the mixture of warring and confederating tribes of the two nations In the remote darkness of the north the ancients im perfectly descried a frozen ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea and beyond the Peninsula or islands 1 of Scandinavia Climate Some ingenious writers 1 have suspected that Europe was much colder formerly than it is at present and the most ancient descrip tions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to confirm their theory The general complaints of intense frost and eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded since we have no method of re ducing to the accurate standard of the thermometer the feelings or the expressions of an orator born in the happier regions of Greece or Asia But I shall select two strong and incontestible proofs of a less equivocal nature I The great rivers which covered the â Roman OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 2 Roman provinces the Rhine and the Danube were frequently frozen over and capable of supporting the most enormous weights The barbarians who often chose that severe season for their inroads transported without apprehension or danger their numerous armies their cavalry and their heavy waggons over a vast and solid bridge of ice  Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phÃ nomenon 2 The rein deer that useful animal from whom the savage of the North derives the best comforts of his dreary life is of a constitution that supports and even requires the most intense cold He is found on the rock of Spitzberg within ten degrees of the pole he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and Siberia but at present he cannot subsist much less multiply in any country to the South of the Baltic  In the time of CÃ sar the rein deer as well as the elk and the wild bull was a native of the Hercynian forest which then overshadowed a great part of Germany and Poland  The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes of the dimunition of the cold These immense woods have been gradually cleared which intercepted from the earth the rays of the fun 6 The morasses have been drained and in proportion as the foil has been cultivated the air has become more temperate Canada at this day is an exact picture of an cient Germany Although situated in the same parallel with the finest provinces of France and England that country experiences the most rigorous cold The rein deer are very numerous the ground is covered with deep and lasting snow and the great river of St Lawrence is regularly frozen in a season when the waters of the Seine and the Thames are perfectly free from ice 7 It is difficult to ascertain and easy to exaggerate the influence of Its effects on the climate of ancient Germany over the minds and bodies of the natives Many writers have supposed and most have allowed though as it should seem without any adequate proof that the rigorous cold of the North was favourable to long life and genera F f 2 tive jzc THE DECLINE AND PALL tive vigour that the women were more fruitful and the human species more prolific than in warmer or more temperate climates  We may assert with greater confidence that the keen air of Ger many formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives who were iri general of a more lofty stafture than the people of the South 9 gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent ex ertions than to patient labour and inspired them with constitu tional bravery which is the result 6f nerves and spirits The severity of a winter campaign that chilled the courage of the Roman troops was scarcely felt by these hardy children of the North  Who in their turn were Unable to resist the summer heats and dissolved away in languor and sickness under the beams of an Italian fun  Gwmanf he There is not any where upon the globe a large tract of country which we have discovered destitute of inhabitants or whose first population can be fixed with any degree of historical certainty And yet as the most philosophic minds can seldom refrain from in vestigating the infancy of great nations our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed efforts When Tacitus considered the purity of the German blood and the forbidding aspect of this country he was disposed to pronounce those barbarians Indigent or Natives of the foil We may allow with safety and perhaps with truth that ancient Germany was not originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a political society  but that the name and nation received their existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages of the Hercynian woods To assert those sa vages to have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be a conclusion condemned by religion and unwarranted by reason fo eauref Such rational doubt is but ill suited with the genius of popular vanity Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of the world the ark of Noah has been of the fame use as was formerly to OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 22X to the Greeks aud Romans the siege of Troy On a narrow baÃ s of acknowledged truth an immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected and the wild Irishman as well as the wild Tartar 4 could point out the individual son of Japhet from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended The last century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy faith who by the dim light of legends and traditions of conjecture and etymologies led the great grandchildren of Noah from the Tower of Babel to the extremities of the globe Of these judicious critics one of the most entertaining was Olaus Rudbeck professor in the university of Upsal  Whatever is celebrated either in his tory or fable this zealous patriot ascribes to his country From Sweden which formed so considerable a part of ancient Germany the Greeks themselves derived their alphabetical characters their astronomy and their religion Of that delightful region for such it appeared to the eyeÂ of a native the Atlantis of Plato the coun try of the Hyperboreans the gardens of the Hesperides the For tunate Iflands and even the Elysian Fields were all but faint and imperfect transcripts A clime so profusely favoured by Nature could not long remain desert after the flood The learned Rudbeck allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to about twenty thousand persons He then disperses them into small colonies to replenish the earth and to propagate the human species The German or Swedilh detachment which marched if I am not mistaken under the command of Astcenaz the son of Gomer the son of Japhet distinguistied itself by a more than common dili gence in the prosecution of this great work The northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe Africa and Asia and to use the author s metaphor the blood circulated back from the extremities to the heart But all this well laboured system of German antiquities is anni The Germans Dilated by a single fact too well attested to admit of any doubt Utters Â 8 â and 222 THE DECLINE AND FALL and of too decisive a nature to leave room for any reply The Ger mans in the age of Tacitus were unacquainted with the use of let ters 16 i and the use of letters is the principal circumstance that distin guishes a civilized people from a herd of savages incapable of know ledge or reflection Without that artificial help the human me mory soon diflipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted to her charge and the nobler faculties of the mind no longer supplied with mo dels or with materials gradually forget their powers the judge ment becomes feeble and lethargic the imagination languid or irre gular Fully to apprehend this important truth let us attempt in an improved society to calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and the illiterate peasant The former by reading and reflection multiplies his own experience and lives in distant ages and remote countries whilst the latter rooted to a single spot and confined to a few years of existence surpasses but very little his fellow labourer the ox in the exercise of his mental faculties The fame and even a greater difference will be found between nations than between individuals and we may safely pronounce that without some species of writing no people has ever preserved the faithful annals of their history ever made any considerable pro gress in the abstract sciences or ever possessed in any tolerable de gree of perfection the useful and agreeable arts of life Of am and Of these arts the ancient Germans were wretchedly destitute agriculture fhey passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty which it has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of vir tuous simplicity Modern Germany is said to contain about two thousand three hundred walled towns 7 In a much wider extent of country the geographer Ptolemy could discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the name of cities 18 though according to our ideas they would but ill deserve that splendid title We can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications constructed in the center of the woods and designed to secure the women OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 223 women children and cattle whilst the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion 9 But Tacitus asserts as a well known fact that the Germans in his time had no cities Â and that they affected to despise the works of Roman industry as a places of confinement rather than of security Their edifices were not even contiguous or formed into regular villages 12 each bar barian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain a wood or a stream of fresh water had induced him to give the pre ference Neither stone nor brick nor tiles were employed in these flight habitations They were indeed no more than low huts of a circular figure built of rough timber thatched with straw and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke In the most inclement winter the hardy German was satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal The nations who dwelt towards the North clothed themselves in furs and the women ma nufactured for their own use a coarse kind of linen  The game of various forts with which the forests of Germany were plenti fully stocked supplied its inhabitants with food and exercise J Their numerous herds of cattle less remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utilitylS formed the principal object of their wealth A small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the earth artificial meadows and orchards were unknown to the Germans nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people whose property every year experienced a general change by a new division of the arable lands and who in that strange operation avoided disputes by suffering a great part of their terri tory to lie waste and without tillage 7 Gold silver and iron were extremely scarce in Germany Its and of the use barbarous inhabitants wanted both Ikill and patience to investigate m S those rich veins of silver which have so liberally rewarded the at tention of the princes of Brunswick and Saxony Sweden which now supplies Europe with iron was equally ignorant of its own 2 riches THE DECLINE AND FALL  riches and the appearance of the arms of the Germans furnished a sufficient proof how little iron the were able to bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal The various transactions of peace and war had introduced some Roman coins chiefly silver among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the use of money carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities and prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases the presents of Rome to their princes and am bastadors  To a mind capable of reflection such leading facts convey more instruction than a tedious detail of subordinate circum stances The value of money has been settled by general consent to express our wants and our property as letters were invented to express our ideas and both these institutions by giving a more active energy to the powers and passions of human nature have contributed to muhiply the objects they were designed to represent The use of gold and silver is in a great measure factitious but it would be impossible to enumerate the important and various services which agriculture and all the arts have received from iron when tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire and the dexterous hand of man Money in a word is the most universal incitement iron the most powerful instrument of human industry and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people neither actuated by the one nor seconded by the other could emerge from the grossest barbarism  If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe a supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to con stitute their general character In a civilized state every faculty of man is expanded and exercised and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of society The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant and useful labour The select few placed by fortune above that necessity can OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE can however fill up their time by the pursuits of interest or glory by the improvement of their estate or of their understanding by the duties the pleasures and even the follies of social life The Germans were not possessed of these varied resources The care of the house and family the management of the land and cattle were delegated to the old and the infirm to women and slaves The lazy warrior destitute of every art that might employ his leisure hours consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of fleep and food And yet by a wonderful diversity of Nature ac cording to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses the fame barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless of mankind They delight in floth they detest tran quillity 5Â The languid foul oppressed with its own weight anxi ously required some new and powerful sensation and war and dan ger were the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper The found that summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy gave him an active pursuit and by strong exercise of the body and violent emotions of the mind restored him to a more lively fense of his existence In the dull intervals of peace these barbarians were immoderately ad dicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking both of which by different means the one by inflaming their passions the other by extinguishing their reason alike relieved them from the pain of thinking They gloried in passing whole days and nights at table and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous and drunken assemblies3 Their debts of honour for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play they discharged with the most romantic fidelity The desperate gamester who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice patiently submitted to the decision of fortune and suffered himself to be bound chas tised and sold into remote flavery by his weaker but more lucky antagonist Vol I G g Strong 2 6 THE DECLINE AND FALL Theiruttesor Strong beer a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or strong liquors Â   barley and corrupted as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus into a certain semblance of wine was sufficient for the grose purposes of German debauchery But those who had tasted the rich wines of Italy and afterwards of Gaul sighed for that more delicious species of intoxication They attempted not however as has since been executed with so much success to naturalise the vine on the banks â of the Rhine and Danube nor did they endeavour to procure by industry the materials of an advantageous commerce To solicit by labour what might be ravished by arms was esteemed un worthy of the German spirit  The intemperate thirst of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied presents The Tuscan who betrayed his country to the Celtic nations attracted them into Italy by the prospect of the rich fruits and delicious â wines the productions of a happier climate 3 And in the fame manner the German auxiliaries invited into France during the civil wars of the sixteenth century were allured by the pro mise of plenteous quarters in the provinces of Champagne and Bur gundy 5S Drunkenness the most illiberal but not the most dangerous of our vices had power in a less civilized state of mankind to occa sion a battle a war or a revolution Stateospopa The climate of ancient Germany has been mollified and the foil lation fertilized by the labour of ten centuries from the time of Charle magne The fame extent of ground which at present maintains in ease and plenty a million of husbandmen and artificers was un able to supply an hundred thousand lazy warriors with the simple necessaries of life 6 The Germans abandoned their immense forests to the exercise of hunting employed in pasturage the most consider able part of their lands bestowed on the small remainder a rude and careless cultivation and then accused the scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to maintain the multitude of its inhabi â 5 tants OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tants When the return of famine severely admonished them of the importance of the arts the national distress was sometimes allevi ated by the emigration of a third perhaps or a fourth part of their youth 7 The possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which bind a civilized people to an improved country But the Germans who carried with them what they most valued their arms their cattle and their women cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and con quest The innumerable swarms that issued or seemed to issue from the great storehouse of nations were multiplied by the fears of the vanquished and by the credulity of succeeding ages And from facts thus exaggerated an opinion was gradually established and has been supported by writers of distinguished reputation that in the age of CÃ sar and Tacitus the inhabitants of the North were far more numerous than they are in our days3 A more serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have convinced mo dern philosophers of the falsehood and indeed the impossibility of the supposition To the names of Mariana and of Machiavel we can oppose the equal names of Robertson and of Hume Â A warlike nation like the Germans without either cities letters German arts or money found some compensation for this savage state in freedom the enjoyment of liberty Their poverty secured their freedom since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of des potism Among the Suiones fays Tacitus riches are held in  honour They are therefore subject to an absolute monarch who instead of intrusting his people with the free use of arms as i6 practised in the rest of Germany commits them to the safe cus M tody not of a citizen or even of a freedman but of a stave The neighbours of the Suiones the Sitones are funk even below servitude they obey a woman In the mention of these ex ceptions the great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of government We are only at a loss to conceive by what G g 2 mean Â T28 THE DECLINE AND FALL means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the North and extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the Roman provinces or how the an cestors of those Danes and Norwegians so distinguished in later ages by their unconquered spirit could thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty  Some tribes however on the coast of the Baltic acknowledged the authority of kings though without relinquishing the rights of men but in the far greater part of Germany the form of government was a democracy tempered in deed and controuled not so much by general and positive laws as by the occasional ascendant of birth or valour of eloquence or su perstition  Assemblies of Civil governments in their first institutions are voluntary asso the people ciations for mutual defence To obtain the desired end it is abso lutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself obliged to submit his private opinion and actions to the judgment of the greater number of his associates The German tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of political society As soon as a youth born of free parents had attained the age of manhood he was introduced into the general council of his countrymen solemnly invested with a shield and spear and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth The assembly of the war riors of the tribe was convened at stated seasons or on sudden emer gencies The trial of public offences the election of magistrates and the great business of peace and war were determined by its inde pendent voice Sometimes indeed these important questions were previoufly considered and prepared in a more select council of the principal chieftains45 The magistrates might deliberate and per suade the people only could resolve and execute and the resolu tions of the Germans were fbr the most part hasty and violent Barbarians accustomed to place their freedom in gratifying the present passion and their courage in overlooking all future conse quences OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE a quences turned away with indignant contempt from the remon strances of justice and policy and it was the practice to signify by a t hollow murmur their dislike of such timid councils But whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury whenever the called upon his fel low countrymen to assert the national honour or to pursue some enterprise full of danger and glory a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the eager applause of the assembly For the Ger mans always met in arms and it was constantly to be dreaded lest an irregular multitude inflamed with faction and strong liquors should use those arms to enforce as well as to declare their furious resolves We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have been polluted with blood and the more numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious 6 A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger and if princetand the danger was pressing and extensive several tribes concurred in magistrates the choice of the fame general The bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field by his example rather than by his commands But this power however limited was still invi dious It expired with the war and in time of peace the German tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief 7 Princes were how ever appointed in the general assembly to administer justice or rather to compose differences 48 in their respective districts In the choice of these magistrates as much regard was shewn to birth as to merit 9 To each was given by the public a guard and a council of an hundred persons and the first of the princes appears to have enjoyed a pre eminence of rank and honour which sometimes tempted the Romans to compliment him with the regal title 5Â The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates in two more absolute over the pro remarkable instances is alone sufficient to represent the  whole perty than mi r r t over the per system of German manners The disposal of the landed property son of the    Germans within 2jo THE DECLINE AND FALL within their district was absolutely vested in their hands and they distributed it every year according to a new division r At the same time they were not authorized to punish with death to imprison or even to strike a private citizen A people thus jealous of their persons and careless of their possessions must have been totally destitute of industry and the arts but animated with a high fense of honour and independence Voluntary The Germans respected only those duties which they imposed on engagements themselves The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the magistrates The noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chief to whom they devoted their arms and service A noble  emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief amongst the chiefs to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions To be ever fur rounded by a band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs their ornament in peace their defence in war  The glory of such distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe Presents and embassies solicited  their friendship and the fame of their arms often ensured victory to the party which they espoused In the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valour by his u companions shameful for the companions not to equal the â valour of their chief To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy To protect his person and to adorn his glory with the  trophies of their own exploits were the most sacred of their H duties The chiefs combated for victory the companions for the chief The noblest warriors whenever their native country was funk in the laziness of peace maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action to exercise their restless spirit and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers Gifts worthy of  soldiers the warlike steed the bloody and ever victorious lance 1Â were OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief The rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that he could bestow or they would accept War rapine and the free will offerings of his friends supplied the materials of this munificence This institution however it might accidentally weaken the several republics invigorated the general character of the Germans and even ripened amongst them all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible the faith and valour the hospitality and the courtesy so conspicuous long after wards in the ages of chivalry The honourable gifts bestowed by the chief on his brave companions have been supposed by an in genious writer to contain the first rudiments of the fiefs distributed after the conquest of the Roman provinces by the barbarian lords among their vassals with a similar duty of homage and military service 5V These conditions are however very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient Germans who delighted in mutual presents i but without either imposing or accepting the weight of obliga tions  In the days of chivalry or more properly of romance all the â ty u men were brave and all the women were chaste and notwith standing the latter of these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the former it is ascribed almost without exception to the wives of the ancient Germans Polygamy was  not in use except among the princes and among them only for the fake of multiplying their alliances Divorces were prohibited by manners rather than by laws Adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable crimes nor was seduction justified by example and fashion s6 We may easily discover that Tacitus indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute con duct of the Roman ladies yet there are some striking circumstances  that give an air of truth or at least of probability to the conjugal faith and chastity of the Germans Although THE DECLINE AND FALL caufesÂ bable Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly contributed to asswage the fiercer passions of human nature it seems to have been less favourable to the virtue of chastity whose most dangerous enemy is the softness of the mind The refinements of life cor rupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes The gross ap petite of love becomes most dangerous when it is elevated or rather indeed disguised by sentimental passion The elegance of dress of motion and of manners give a lustre to beauty and in flame the senses through the imagination Luxurious entertain ments midnight dances and licentious spectacles present at once temptation and opportunity to female frailty From such dangers the unpolissied wives of the barbarians were secured by poverty solitude and the painful cares of a domestic life The German huts open on every side to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy were a better safe guard of conjugal fidelity than the walls the bolts and the eunuchs of a Persian haram To this reason another may be added of a more honourable nature The Germans treated their women with esteem and confidence consulted them on every occa sion of importance and fondly believed that in their breasts re sided a sanctity and wisdom more than human Some of these interpreters of fate such as Velleda in the Batavian war governed in the name of the deity the fiercest nations of Germany s8 The rest of the sex without being adored as goddesses were respected as the free and equal companions of soldiers associated even by the marriage ceremony to a life of toil of danger and of glory 59 In their great invasions the camps of the barbarians were filled with a multitude of women who remained firm and undaunted amidst the sound of arms the various forms of destruction and the ho nourable wounds of their sons and husbands 6o Fainting armies of Germans have more than once been driven back upon the enemy by the generous despair of the women who dreaded death much less than servitude If the day was irrecoverably lost they well knew OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE knew how to deliver themselves and their children with their own hands from an insulting victor Heroines of such a cast may claim our admiration but they were most assuredly neither lovelyt nor very susceptible of love Whilst they affected to emulate the stern virtues of many they must have resigned that attractive softness in which principally consist the charm and weakness of woman Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress every tender emotion that stood in competition with honour and the first honour of the sex has ever been that of chastity The sentiments and conduct of these high spirited matrons may at once be considered as a cause as an effect and as a proof of the general character of the nation Female courage however it may be raised by fanaticism or confirmed by habit can be only a faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valour that distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found The religious system of the Germans if the wild opinions of fa ReFgion vages can deserve that name was dictated by their wants their fears and their ignorance 6 They adored the great visible objects and agents of Nature the Sun and the Moon the Fire and the Earth together with those imaginary deities who were supposed to pre side over the most important occupations of human life They were persuaded that by some ridiculous arts of divination they could discover the will of the superior beings and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering to their altars Some applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion enter tained by that people of the Deity whom they neither confined within the walls of a temple nor represented by any human figure â but when we recollect that the Germans were unskilled in archi tecture and totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture we shall readily assign the true reason of a scruple which arose not so much from a superiority of reason as from a want of ingenuity The only temples in Germany were dark and ancient groves consc Vo l I H h crated THE DECLINE AND FALL crated by the reverence of succeeding generations Their secret gloom the imagined residence of an invisible power by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror6t and the priests rude and illiterate ajs they were had been taught by experience the use of every ajtifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest Its effeas in The fame ignorance which renders barbarians incapable of con peace cei ving or embracing the useful restraints of laws exposes them naked and unarmed to the blind terrors of superstition The German priests improving this favourable temper cf their countrymen had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns which the magistrate could not venture to exercise and the haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lasli of correction when it was inflicted not by any human power but by the immediate order of the god of war 6 The defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority The latter was con stantly exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular assemblies and was sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare A solemn procession was occasionally ce lebrated in the present countries of Mecklenburg and Pomerania The unknown symbol of the Earth covered with a thick veil was placed on a carriage drawn by cows and in this manner the goddess whose common residence was in the ifle of Rugen visited ieveral adjacent tribes of her worshippers During her progress the found of war was hushed quarrels were suspended arms laid aside and the restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and harmony 6s The truce of God so often and so in effectually proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century was an obvious imitation of this ancient custom 66 in war But the influence of religion was far more powerful to inflame than to moderate the fierce passions of the Germans Interest and fanaticism 5 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most daring and the most unjust enterprises by the approbation of Heaven and full assurances of success The consecrated standards long revered in the groves of superstition were placed in the front of the battle 67 and the hostile army was devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder 6 In the faith of soldiers and such were the Germans cowardice is the most unpardonable of fins A brave man was the worthy favourite of their martial deities the wretch who had lost his shield was alike banislied from the religious and the civil assemblies of his countrymen Some tribes of the north seem to have embraced the doctrine of transmigration6 others imagined a gross paradise of immortal drunkenness 7Â All agreed that a life spent in arms and a glorious death in battle were the best preparations for a happy futurity either in this or in another world The immortality so vainly promised by the priests was in some The bards degree conferred by the bards That singular order of men has most deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to investigate the antiquities of the Celts the Scandinavians and the Germans Their genius and character as well as the reverence paid to their important office have been sufficiently illustrated But we cannot so easily express or even conceive the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breast of their au dience Among a polished people a taste for poetry is rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul And yet when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by Homer or Taflb we are insensibly seduced by the fiction and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour But how faint how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary study It was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but ani H h 2 mated 236 THE DECLINE AND FALL mated strains The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song and the passions which it tended to excite the desire of fame and the contempt of death were the ha bitual sentiments of a German mind Causes wh ch Such was the situation and such were the manners of the ancient checked the progress at Germans Their climate their want of learning of arts and of the Germans   laws their notions of honour of gallantry and of religion their fense of freedom impatience of peaee and thirst of enterprise alj contributed to form a people of military heroes And yet we find that during more than two hundred and fifty years that elapsed from the defeat of Varus to the reign of Decius these formidable barbar rians made few considerable attempts and not any material impres sion on the luxurious and enstaved provinces of the empire Their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline and their fury was diverted by the intestine divisions of ancient Germany Want of arms I It has been observed with ingenuity and not without truth that the command of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold But the rude tribes of Germany alike destitute of both those valuable metals were reduced slowly to acquire by their unassisted strength the possession of the one as well as the other The face of a German army displayed their poverty of iron Swords and the longer kind of lances they could seldom use Their frames as they called them in their own language were long spears headed with a sharp but narrow iron point and which as occasion ver quired they either darted from a distance or pussied in close onset With this spear and with a shield their cavalry was contented A multitude of darts scattered 71 with incredible force were an addi tional resource of the infantry Their military dress when they wore any was nothing more than a loose mantle A variety of colours was the only ornament of their wooden or their osier ssiields Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses scarce any by 4 helmets OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 237 helmets Though the horses of Germany were neither beautiful swift nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the Roman manage several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry but in general the principal strength of the Germans consisted in their in fantry 7I which was drawn up in several deep columns according andofdisci to the distinction of tribes and families Impatient of fatigue or plmc delay these half armed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks and sometimes by the effort of native valour prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of the Roman mercenaries But as the barbarians poured forth their whole fouls on the first onset they knew not how to rally or to retire A repulse was a sure defeat and a defeat was most com monly total destruction When we recollect the complete armour of the Roman soldiers their discipline exercises evolutions fortified camps and military engines it appears a just matter of surprise how the naked and unassisted valour of the barbarians could dare to encounter in the field the strength of the legions and the various troops of the auxiliaries which seconded their operations The contest was too unequal till the introduction of luxury had ener vated the vigour and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the discipline of the Roman armies The introduction of barbarian auxiliaries into those armies was a measure attended with very obvious danger as it might gradually instruct the Ger mans in the arts of war and of policy Although they were admitted in small numbers and with the strictest precaution the example of Civilis might convince the Romans that the danger was not imaginary and that their precautions were not always suffi cient  During the civil wars that followed the death of Nero that artful and intrepid Batavian whom his enemies condescended to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius formed a great design of freedom and ambition Eight Batavian cohorts renowned in the wars of Britain and Italy repaired to his standard He introduced 1 an 238 THE DECLINE AND FALL an army of Germans into Gaul prevailed on the powerful cities of Treves and Langres to embrace his cause defeated the legions destroyed their fortified camps and employed against the Romans the military knowledge which he had acquired in their service When at length after an obstinate struggle he yielded to the power of the empire Civilis secured himself and his country by an ho nourable treaty The Batavians still continued to occupy the ifland of the Rhine 6 the allies not the servants of the Roman monarchy Civil dissen H The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable when we lions of Ger many consider the effects that might have been produced by its united effort The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a million of warriors as all who were of an age to bear arms were of a temper to use them But this fierce multitude incapable of concerting or executing any plan of national greatness was agi tated by various and often hostile intentions Germany was divided into more than forty independent states and even in each state the union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious The barbarians were easily provoked they knew not how to for give an injury much less an insult their resentments were bloody and implacable The casual disputes that so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking were sufficient to inflame the minds of whole nations the private feud of any considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and al lies To chastise the insolent or to plunder the defenceless were alike causes of war The most formidable states of Germany af fected to encompass their territories with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation The awful distance preserved by their neighbours attested the terror of their arms and in some measure defended them from the danger of unexpected incursions Fomented by The Bructeri it is Tacitus who now speaks were totally ex Rome 1 03 0 terminated by the neighbouring tribes78 provoked by their inso lence allured by the hopes of spoil and perhaps inspired by the tutelar OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 23 tutelar deities of the empire Above sixty thousand barbarians were destroyed not by the Roman arms but in our sight and for our entertainment May the nations enemies of Rome ever preserve this enmity to each other We have now attained the utmost verge of prosperity 79 and have nothing left to demand of Fortune except the discord of the barbarians 8Â These sen timents less worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of Tacitus express the invariable maxims of the policy of his coun trymen They deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to combat the barbarians from whose defeat they could derive nei ther honour nor advantage The money and negociations of Rome insinuated themselves into the heart of Germany and every art of seduction was used with dignity to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the Rhine or Danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most troublesome enemies Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most trifling presents which they received either as marks of distinction or as the instruments of luxury In civil distensions the weaker faction endeavoured to strengthen its interest by entering into secret connexions with the governors of the frontier provinces Every quarrel among the Ger mans was fomented by the intrigues of Rome and every plan of union and public good defeated by the stronger bias of private jea lousy and interest81 Transient The general conspiracy which terrified the Romans under the union against reign of Marcus Antoninus embraced almost all the nations of Marcu Ant0 Germany and even Sarmatia from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube81 It is impossible for us to determine whether this hasty confederation was formed by necessity by reason or by passion but we may rest assured that the barbarians were neither allured by the indolence or provoked by the ambition of the Roman monarch This dangerous invasion required all the firmness and vigilance of Marcus He fixed generals of ability in the several stations of attack and assumed in person the conduct of the most important nmus 240 THE DECLINE AND FALL important province on the Upper Danube After a long and doubt ful conflict the spirit of the barbarians was subdued TheQuadi and the MarcomanniS who had taken the lead in the war were the most severely punished in its catastrophe They were com manded to retire five miles s from their own banks of the Danube and to deliver up the flower of the youth who were immediately sent into Britain a remote island where they might be secure as hostages and useful as soldiers Ss On the frequent rebellions of the Quadi and Marcomanni the irritated emperor resolved to reduce their country into the form of a province His designs were dis appointed by death This formidable league however the only one that appears in the two first centuries of the imperial history was entirely dissipated without leaving any traces behind ia Germany Distinction of In the course of this introductory chapter we have confined our tribes selves to the general outlines of the manners of Germany without attempting to describe or to distinguish the various tribes which silled that great country in the time of CÃ sar of Tacitus or of Ptolemy As she ancient or as new tribes successively present them selves in the series of this history we shall concisely mention their origin their situation and their particular character Modern na tions are fixed and permanent societies connected among themselves by laws and government bound to their native foil by arts and agriculture The German tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers almost of savages The fame territory often changed its inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration The fame communities uniting in a plan of defence or invasion be stowed a new title on their new confederacy The dissolution of an ancient confederacy restored to the independent tribes their pecu liar but long forgotten appellations A victorious state often com municated its own name to a vanquistied people Sometimes crowds of voluntiers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favourite leader OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE leader his camp became their country and some circumstance of the enterprise soon gave a common denomination to the mixed mul titude The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were perpetually varied by themselves and confounded by the astonished subjects of the Roman empire86 Wars and the administration of public affairs are the principal Numbers subjects of history but the number of persons interested in these busy scenes is very different according to the different condition of mankind In great monarchies millions of obedient subjects pursue their useful occupations in peace and obscurity The atten tion of the Writer as well as of the Reader is solely confined to a court a capital a regular army and the districts which happen to be the occasional scene of military operations But a state of freedom and barbarism the season of civil commotions or the situation of petty re publics 8 raises almost every member of the community into action and consequently into notice The irregular divisions and the restless mo tions of the people of Germany dazzle our imagination and seem to multiply their numbers The profuse enumeration of kings and warriors of armies and nations inclines us to forget that the fame objects are continually repeated under a variety of appellations and that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished on the most inconsiderable objects Vol I CHAP 242 THE DECLINE AND FALL CHAP X The Emperors Decius Gallus Ã milianus Valerian and Gallienus â The

6 ef shame and misfortune During that calamitous period every instant of time was marked every province of the Roman world was afflicted by barbarous invaders and military tyrants and the ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution The confusion of the times and the scarcity of authen tic memorials oppose equal difficulties to the historian who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration Surrounded with imperfect fragments always concise often obscure and some times contradictory he is reduced to collect to compare and to conjecture and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts yet the knowledge of human nature and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions might on some occasions supply the want of historical materials The emperor There is not for instance any difficulty in conceiving that the Phiijp successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the ties of allegiance between the prince and people that all the generals of Philip were disposed to imitate the example of their master and that the caprice of armies long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions might every day raise to the throne the most obscure of their fellow soldiers History can only add that the first rebellion against the emperor Philip broke out in the summer of the year two hundred and forty nine among the legions of MÃ sia and that a sub OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 543 a subaltern officer named Marinus was the object of their sedi tious choice Philip was alarmed He dreaded lest the treason of the MÃ sian army should prove the first spark of a general confla gration Distracted with the consciousness of his guilt and of his danger he communicated the intelligence to the senate A gloomy silence prevailed the effect of fear and perhaps of disaffec tion till at length Decius one of the assembly assuming a spirit Service r worthy of his noble extraction ventured to discover more intre V3 t v ctÂ ov Â and reign of pidity than the emperor seemed to possess He treated the whole he emperor business with contempt as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult and a d 249 Philip s rival as a phantom of royalty who in a very few days would be destroyed by the fame inconstancy that had created him The speedy completion of the prophecy inspires Philip with a just esteem for so able a counsellor and Decius appeared to him the only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit had not entirely subsided after the murder of Ma rinus Decius who long resisted his own nomination seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the soldiers  and his prediction was again con firmed by the event The legions of Maesia forced their judge to become their accomplice They left him only the alternative of death  or the purple His subsequent conduct after that decisive measure was unavoidable He conducted or followed his army to the confines of Italy whither Philip collecting all his force to repel the for midable competitor whom he had raised up advanced to meet him The imperial troops were superior in number1 but the rebels formed an army of Veterans commanded by an able and experienced leader Philip was either killed in the battle or put to death a few days afterwards at Verona His son and associate in the em pire was massacred at Rome by the PrÃ torian guards and the vic torious Decius with more favourable circumstances than the ambi tion of that age can usually plead was universally acknowledged I i 2 by 244 THE DECLINE AND FALL by the senate and provinces It is reported that immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of Augustus he had assured Philip by a private message of his innocence and loyalty solemnly protesting that on his arrival in Italy he would resign the imperial ornaments and return to the condition of an obedient subject His professions might be sincere But in the situation where for tune had placed him it was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be forgiven 3 â st the e emPeror L ecius had employed a few months in the works Goths of peace and the administration of justice when he was summoned to the banks of the Danube by the invasion of the Goths This is the first considerable occasion in which history mentions that great people who afterwards broke the Roman power sacked the capitol and reigned in Gaul Spain and Italy So memorable was the part which they acted in the subversion of the Western empire that the name of Goths is frequently but inproperly used as a general appellation of rude and warlike barbarism hin of the jn the beginning of the sixth century and after the conquest of Scandinavia Italy the Goths in possession of present greatness very naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of future glory They wished to preserve the memory of their ancestors and to transmit to posterity their own atchievements The principal minister of the court of Ravenna the learned Cassiodorus gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a Gothic history which consisted of twelve books now reduced to the inperfect abridgment of Jornandes  These writers passed with the most artful conciseness over the mis fortunes of the nation celebrated its successful valour and adorned the triumph with many Asiatic trophies that more properly belonged to the people of Scythia On the faith of ancient songs the uncertain but the only memorials of barbarians they deduced the first origin of the Goths from the vast island or peninsula of Scan dinavia 5 That extreme country of the North was not unknown to OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 245 to the conquerors of Italy the ties of ancient consanguinity were strengthened by recent offices of friendship and a Scandinavian king cheerfully abdicated his savage greatness that he might pass the remainder of his days in the peaceful and polished court of Ra venna 6 Many vestiges which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity attest the ancient residence of the Goths in the countries beyond the Baltic From the time of the geographer Ptolemy the southern part of Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of the less enterprising remnant of the nation and a large territory is even at present divided into east and west Goth land During the middle ages from the ninth to the twelfth century whilst Christianity was advancing with a flow progress into the north the Goths and the Swedes composed two distinct and sometimes hostile members of the fame monarchy 7 The latter of these two names has prevailed without extinguishing the former The Swedes who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms have in every age claimed the ancient glory of the Goths In a moment of discontent against the court of Rome Charles the Twelfth insinuated that his victorious troops were not degenerated from their brave ancestors who had already subdued the mistress of the world 8 Till the end of the eleventh century a celebrated temple subsisted Religion of at Upsal the most considerable town of the Swedes and Goths It was enriched with the gold which the Scandinavians had acquired in their pyratical adventures and sanctified by the uncouth repre sentations of the three principal deities the god of war the goddess of generation and the god of thunder In the general festival that was solemnized every ninth year nine animals of every species without excepting the human were sacrificed and their bleeding bodies suspended in the sacred grove adjacent to the temple 9 The only traces that now subsist of this barbaric superstition are con tained in the Edda a system of mythology compiled in Iceland about the THE DECLINE AND FALL the thirteenth century and studied by the learned of Denmark and Sweden as the most valuable remains of their ancient traditions and death of Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity of the Edda we can Odin easily distinguish two persons confounded under the name of Odin the god of war and the great legislator of Scandinavia The latter the Mahomet of the north instituted a religion adapted to the climate and to the people Numerous tribes on either side of the Baltic were subdued by the invincible valour of Odin by his persuasive eloquence and by the fame which he acquired of a most skilful magician The faith that he had propagated during a long and prosperous life he confirmed by a voluntary death Apprehensive of the ignominious approach of disease and infirmity he resolved to expire as became a warriour In a solemn assembly of the Swedes and Goths he wounded himself in nine mortal places hastening away as he asserted with his dying voice to prepare the feast of heroes in the palace of the god of war Â Agreeable but The native and proper habitation of Odin is distinguished by hypothesis the appellation of As gard The happy resemblance of that name concerning s burg or As of  words of a similar signification has given rife to an historical system of so pleasing a contexture that we could almost wish to persuade ourselves of its truth It is supposed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake Maeotis till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with servitude That Odin yielding with in dignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist conducted his tribe from ihe frontiers of the Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden with the great design of forming in that inaccessible retreat of free dom a religion and a people which in some remote age might be subservient to his immortal revenge when his invincible Goths armed with martial fanaticism should issue in numerous swarms from the neighbourhood of the Polar circle to chastise the op pressors of mankind  If OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 247 If so many successive generations of Goths were capable of pre Ehm Â ra on cf serving a faint tradition of their Scandinavian origin we must not fromScaodi expect from such unlettered barbarians any distinct account of the p uffia Â time and circumstances of their emigration To cross the Baltic was an easy and natural attempt The inhabitants of Sweden were masters of a sufficient number of large vessels with oars  and the distance is little more than one hundred miles from Carlscroon to the nearest ports of Pomerania and Prussia Here at length we land on firm and historic ground At least as early as the Christian Ã ra and as late as the age of the Antonines IS the Goths were established towards the mouth of the Vistula and in that fertile province where the commercial cities of Thorn Elbing Koningsberg and Dantzick were long afterwards founded 6 Westward of die Goths the numerous tribes of the Vandals were spread along the banks of the Oder and the sea coast of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh A strik ing resemblance of manners complexion religion and language seemed to indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally one great people  The latter appear to have been subdivided into Ostrogoths Visigoths and GepidÃ 8 The distinction among the Vandals was more strongly marked by the independent names of HerulL Burgundians Lombards and a variety of other petty states many of which in a future age expanded themselves into powerful monarchies In the age of the Antonines the Goths were still seated in From Pmffiat Prussia About the reign of Alexander Severus the Roman pro Ukraine vince of Dacia had already experienced their proximity by frequent and destructive inroads 9 In this interval therefore of about seventy years we must place the second migration of the Goths from the Baltic to the Euxine but the cause that produced it lies concealed among the various springs of action incident to unsettled barbarians Either a pestilence or a famine a victory or a defeat 2 ana 2 l8 THE DECLINE AND FALL an oracle of the Gods or the eloquence of a daring leader were sufficient to impel the Gothic arms on the milder climates of the south Besides the influence of a martial religion the numbers and spirit of the Goths were equal to the most dangerous adven tures The use of round bucklers and fliort swords rendered them formidable in a close engagement the manly obedience which they yielded to hereditary kings gave uncommon unioa and stability to their councils and the renowned Amala the hero of that age and the tenth ancestor of Theodoric king of Italy enforced by the ascendant of personal merit the prerogative of his birth which he derived from the Anses or demigods of the Gothic nation The Gothic The fame of a great enterprise excited the bravest warriors from nation in 0 r ZTnh iW a an a c states of Germany many of whom are seen a few years afterwards combating under the common standard of the Goths  The first motions of the emigrants carried them to the banks of the Prypec a river universally conceived by the ancients to be the southern branch of the Borysthenes 1 The windings of that great stream through the plains of Poland and Russia gave a direction to their line of march and a constant supply of fresh wa ter and pasturage to their numerous herds of cattle They followed the unknown course of the river confident in their valour and careless of whatever power might oppose their progress The BastarnÃ and the Venedi were the first who presented themselves and the flower of their youth either from choice or compulsion increased the Gothic army The BastarnÃ dwelt on the northern side of the Carpathian mountains the immense tract of land that scperated the BastarnÃ from the savages of Finland was silled or rather wasted by the Venedi we have some reason to believe that the first cf these nations which distinguistied itself in the Macedonian war1 and was afterwards divided into the formidable tribes OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 249 1 tribes of the Peucini the Borani the Carpi c derived its origin from the Germans With better authority a Sarmatian extraction may be assigned to the Venedi who rendered themselves so famous in the middle ages l6 But the confusion of blood and manners on Dislinafcmof Germans and that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate ob Sarmatians servers 7 As the Goths advanced nearer the Euxine sea they encountered a purer race of Sarmatians the Jazyges the Alani and the Roxolani and they were probably the first Germans who saw the mouths of the Borysthenes and of the Tanais If we inquire into the characteristic marks of the people of Germany and of Sarmatia we shall discover that those two great portions of human kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or moveable tents by a close dress or flowing garments by the marriage of one or of several wives by a military force consisting for the most part either of infantry or of cavalry and above all by the use of the Teutonic or of the Sclavonian language the last of which has been diffused by conquest from the confines of Italy to the neigh bourhood of Japan The Goths were now in possession of the Ukraine a country of Description of considerable extent and uncommon fertility intersected with navi tbe kraine gable rivers which from either side discharge themselves into the Borysthenes and interspersed with large and lofty forests of oaks The plenty of game and fish the innumerable bee hives deposited in the hollow of old trees and in the cavities of rocks and forming even in that rude age a valuable branch of commerce the size of the cattle the temperature of the air the aptness of the soil for every species of grain and the luxuriancy of the vegetation all displayed the liberality of Nature and tempted the industry of man l8 But the Goths withstood all these temptations and still adhered to a life of idleness of poverty and of rapine The Scythian hords which towards the east bordered on the new TheGotlu settlements of the Goths presented nothing to their arms except the roÅ m p o Vol I K k doubtful viDCes THfi DECLINE AND FALL doubtful chance of an unprofitable victory But the prospect of the Roman territories was far more alluring  and the fields of Dacia were covered with rich harvests sown by the hands of an in dustrious and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike people It is probable that the conquests of Trajan maintained by his suc cessors less for any real advantage than for ideal dignity had contributed to weaken the empire on that side The new and un settled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to resist nor rich enough to satiate the rapaciousness of the barbarians As long as the remote banks of the Niester were considered as the boundary of the Roman power the fortifications of the Lower Da nube were more carelessly guarded and the inhabitants of MÃ sia lived in supine security fondly conceiving themselves at an inac cessible distance from any barbarian invaders The irruptions of the Goths under the reign of Philip fatally convinced them of their mistake The king or leader of that fierce nation traversed with contempt the province of Dacia and passed both the Niester and the Danube without encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops betrayed the most important posts where they were stationed and the fear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to inlist under the Gothic standard The various multitude of barba rians appeared at length under the walls of Marcianopolis a city built by Trajan in honour of his sister and at that time die capital of the second MÃ sia The inhabitants were glad to ran som their lives and property by the payment of a large sum of money and the invaders retreated back into their deserts animated rather than satisfied with the first success of their arms against an opulent but feeble country Intelligence was soon transmitted to the emperor Decius that Cniva king of the Goths bad passed the Danube a second time with more considerable forces that his numerous detachments scattered devastation over the province of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE of MÃ sia whilst the main body of the army consisting of seventy thousand Germans and Sarmatians a force equal to the most daring atchievements required the presence of the Roman monarch and the exertion of his military power Decius found the Goths engaged before Nicopolis on the Jatrus Various r  _    _   _   events of thÂ one or the many monuments or Trajan s victories  On his Gothic war approach they raised the siege but with a design only of marching A D SÂ away to a conquest of greater importance the siege of Philippopolis a city of Thrace founded by the father of Alexander near the foot of mount HÃ mus Decius followed them through a diffi cult country and by forced marches but when he imagined him self at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths Cniva turned with rapid fury on his pursuers The camp of the Romans was surprised and pillaged and for the first time their emperor fled in disorder before a troop of half armed barbarians After a long resistance Philippopolis destitute of succour was taken by storm An hundred thousand persons are reported to have been massacred in the sack of that great city Many prisoners of con sequence became a valuable accession to the spoil and Priscu6 a brother of the late emperor Philip blushed not to assume the purple under the protection of the barbarous enemies of Rome The time however consumed in that tedious siege enabled Decius to revive the courage restore the discipline and recruit the numbers of his troops He intercepted several parties of Carpi and other Germans who were hastening to share the victory of their country men  intrusted the passes of the mountains to officers of approved valour and fidelity  repaired and strengthened the fortifications of the Danube and exerted his utmost vigilance to oppose either the progress or the retreat of the Goths Encouraged by the return of fortune he anxiously waited for an opportunity to retrieve by a great and decisive blow his own glory and that of the Roman arms 6 â Kk

ofVSeriL war investigated the more general causes that since the age of the Antonines had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman greatness He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace that greatness on a permanent basis without restoring public virtue ancient principles and manners and the oppressed majesty of the laws To execute this noble but arduous design he first resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor an office which as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity had so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state  till it was usurped and gradually neglected by the Caesars Conscious that the favour of the sovereign may confer power but that the esteem of the people can alone bestow authority he submitted the choice of the censor to the unbiassed A D 251 voice of the senate By their unanimous votes or rather acclama 27 th October _  tions Valerian who was afterwards emperor and who then served with distinction in the army of Decius was declared the molt worthy of that exalted honour As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the emperor he assembled a great council in his camp and before the investiture of the censor

would have ap The design peared not so much the minister aa the colleague of his sovereign4I and wUhout Valerian justly dreaded an elevation so full of envy and of suspicion effect He modestly urged the alarming greatness of the trust his own in sufficiency and the incurable corruption of the times He artfully insinuated that the office of censor was inseparable from the impe rial dignity and that the feeble hands of a subject were unequal to the support of so immense a weight of cares and of power  The approaching event of war soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious but so impracticable and whilst it preserved Valerian from the danger saved the emperor Decius from the dis appointment which would most probably have attended it A cen sor may maintain he can never restore the morals of a state It is impossible for such a magistrate to exert his authority with bene fit or even with effect unless he is supported by a quick sense of honour and virtue in the minds of the people by a decent reve rence for the public opinion and by a train of useful prejudices com bating on the side of national manners In a period when these principles are annihilated the censorial jurisdiction must either sink into empty pageantry or be converted into a partial instrument of vexatious oppression 45 It was easier to vanquish the Goths than to eradicate the public vices yet even in the first of these enterprises Decius lost his army and his life The Goths were now on every side surrounded and pursued Defeat and a c  j i â death ofDe by the Roman arms The nower or their troops had pertfbied in cius and hit the long siege of Philippopoiis and the exhausted couatry could no son 6 longer THE DECLINE AND FALL longer afford subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious barbarians Reduced to this extremity the Goths would gladly have purchased by the surrender of all their booty and prisoners the permission of an undisturbed retreat But the emperor confident of victory and resolving by the chastisement of these invaders to strike a salutary terror into the nations of the North refused to listen to any terms of accommodation The high spirited barbarians preferred death to slavery An obscure town of MÃ sia called Forum Terebronii44 was the scene of the battle The Gothic army was drawn up in three lines and either from choice or accident the front of the third line was covered by a morass In the begin ning of the action the son of Decius a youth of the fairest hopes and already associated to the honours of the purple was slain by an arrow in the sight of his afflicted father who summoning all his fortitude admonished the dismayed troops that the loss of a single soldier was of little importance to the republic45 The conflict was terrible it was the combat of despair against grief and rage The first line of the Goths at length gave way in disorder the second advancing to sustain it ihared its fate and the third only remained entire prepared to dispute the passage of the morass which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the enemy Here the fortune of the day turned and all things became adverse to the Romans the place deep with ooze sinking under those who stood  slippery to such as advanced their armour heavy the waters deep nor could they wield in that uneasy situation their weighty jave lins The barbarians on the contrary were enured to encounters in the bogs their persons tall their spears long such as could  wound at a distance V In this morass the Roman army after an ineffectual struggle was

just regard for the memory of Decius the imperial title was conferred on Hostilianus his only surviving son but an equal rank with more effectual power was granted to Gallus whose experience and ability seemed equal to the great trust of guardian to the young prince and the distressed empire SÂ The first care of the new emperor was to deliver the Illyrian provinces A D 2jz from the intolerable weight of the victorious Goths He consented to leave in their hands the rich fruits of their invasion an immense booty and what was still more disgraceful a great number of pri soners of the highest merit and quality He plentifully supplied Retreat of the  Goths their camp with every convemency that could assuage their angry spirits or facilitate their so much wislied for departure and he even promised to pay them annually a large sum of gold on condition they should never afterwards infest the Roman territories by their incursions5 In the age of the Scipios the most opulent

as a debt But this stipulation of an annual payment to a victorious enemy appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed to accept such unequal laws from a tribe of barbarians and the prince who by a necessary concession had probably saved his country became the object of the general contempt and aversion The death of Hostilianus though it happened in the midst of a raging pestilence was interpreted as the personal crime of Gallus5 and even the defeat of the late emperor was ascribed by the voice of suspicion to the perfidious counsels of his hated suc cessor 5 The tranquillity which the empire enjoyed during the first year of his administration 56 served rather to inflame than to ap pease the public discontent and as soon as the apprehensions of war were removed the infamy of the peace was more deeply and more sensibly felt But the Romans were irritated to a still higher degree when they discovered that they had not even secured their repose though at the expence of their honour The dangerous secret of the wealth and weakness of the empire had been revealed to the world New swarms of barbarians encouraged by the success and not conceiving themselves bound by the obligation of their brethren spread devastation through the Illyrian provinces and terror as far as the gates of Rome The defence of the monarchy which seemed abandoned by the pusillani mous emperor was assumed by Ã milianus governor of Pannonia and MÃ sia who rallied the scattered forces and revived the faint ing spirits of the troops The barbarians were unexpectedly at tacked routed chaced and pursued beyond the Danube The vic torious leader distributed as a donative the money collected for the tribute and the acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed him emperor on the field of battle  Gallus who careless of the general wel fare OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE z57 fore indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy was almost in the fame instant informed of the success of the revolt and of the rapid approach of his aspiring lieutenant He advanced to meet him as far as the plains of Spoleto When the armies came in fight of each other the soldiers of Gallus compared the ignominious conduct of their sovereign with the glory of his rival They admired the valour of Ã milianus they were attracted by his liberality for he offered a considerable increase of pay to all deserters18 The mur Gallus abaa  doned and der of Gallus and of his son Volusianus put an end to the civil slain war and the senate gave a legal sanction to the rights of conquest May The letters of Ã milianus to that assembly were a mixture of mode ration and vanity He assured them that he should resign to their wisdom the civil administration and contenting himself with the quality of their general would in a short time assert the glory of Rome and deliver the empire from all the barbarians both of the North and of the EastS9 His pride was flattered by the applause of the senate and medals are still extant representing him with the name and attributes of Hercules the Victor and of Mars the Avenger 6 If the new monarch possessed the abilities he wanted the Valerian re time necessary to fulfil these splendid promises Less than four deaofofGal months intervened between his victory and his fall6 He had t vanquished Gallus he funk under the

61 to his aid Valerian executed that commission with zeal and fidelity and as he arrived too late to save his sovereign he resolved to revenge him The troops of Ã milianus who still lay encamped in the plains of Spoleto were awed by the sanctity of his character but much more by the supe rior strength of his army and as they were now become as inca pable of personal attachment as they had always been of consti tutional principle they readily imbrued their hands in the blood of A D 253 Vol I LI a prince Ausust 2S8 THE DECLINE AND FALL a prince who so lately bad been tbe object of their partial choice The guilt was theirs but the advantage of it was Valerian s who obtained the possession of the throne by the means indeed of a civil war but with a degree of innocence singular in that age of revo lutions since he owed neither gratitude nor allegiance to his pre decessor whom he dethroned Character of Valerian was about sixty years of age6 when he was invested Valerian y th the purple not by the caprice of the populace or the cla mours of the army but by the unanimous voice of the Roman world In his gradual ascent through the honours of the state he had deserved the favour of virtuous princes and had declared him self the enemy of tyrants6 His noble birth his mild but unble mished manners his learning prudence and experience were re vered by the senate and people and if mankind according to the observation of an ancient writer had been left at liberty to chuse a master their choice would most assuredly have fallen on Valerian 6j Perhaps the merit of this emperor was inadequate to his reputation perhaps his abilities or at least his spirit were affected by the lan guor and coldness of old age Perhaps the emergency of the times demanded the talents of a soldier as well as the virtues of a censor Gensrai mis But the whole reign of Valerian which together with that of Gal the reigns c f lienus his son his associate 66 and his successor lasted fifteen years Galiienus n was one uninterrupted period of confusion and calamity As the 268 253 RÂ man empire was at the fame time and on every side attacked by the blind fury of foreign invaders and the wild ambition of do mestic usurpers we shall consult order and perspicuity by pursu ing not so much the doubtful arrangement of dates as the more natural distribution of subjects The most dangerous enemies

emigra tions of ideal conquerors have acquiesced in a sentiment whose sim plicity persuades us of its truth 69 They suppose that about the year two hundred and forty 7 a new confederacy was formed under the name of Franks by the old inhabitants of the Lower Rhine and the Weser The present circle of Westphalia the Landgraviate of Hesse and the dutchies of Brunswick and Luneburgh were the ancient

the confederacy7S Tacit consent and mutual advantage dictated the first laws of the union it was gradually cemented by habit and experience The league of the Franks may admit of some comparison with

the thirst of rapine and a disre gard to the most solemn treaties disgraced the character of the Franks They invade â The Romans had long experienced the daring valour of the Gaul people of Lower Germany Their united strength threatened Gaul with a more formidable invasion and required the presence of Gallienus the heir and colleague of imperial power 75 Whilst that prince and his infant son Saloninus displayed in the court of Treves the majesty of the empire its armies were ably conducted by their general Posthumus who though he afterwards betrayed the family of Valerian was ever faithful to the great interest of the monarchy The treacherous language of panegyrics and medals darkly announces a long series of victories Trophies and titles attest if such evidence can attest the fame of Posthumus who is repeatedly styled The conqueror of the Germans and the saviour of Gaul 76 r wge Spain But a single fact the only one indeed of which we have any dis tinct knowledge erases in a great measure these monuments of vanity and adulation The Rhine though dignified with the title of Safe guard of the provinces was an imperfect barrier against the daring spirit of enterprise with which the Franks were actuated Their rapid devastations stretched from the river to ths foot of the Pyrenees nor were they stopped by those mountains Spain which had never dreaded was unable to resist the inroads of the Germans During twelve years the greatest part of the reign of Gallienus that opulent country was the theatre of unequal and destructive hostilities Tarragona the flourishing capital of a peace ful province was sacked and almost destroyed 77 and so late as the days of Orosius who wrote in the fifth century wretched cot tages scattered amidst the ruins of magnificent cities still

equally unknown on the coast of Africa 8Â II In that part of Upper Saxony beyond the Elbe which is at Â ri8 n and renown of present called the Marquisate of Lusace there existed in ancient the Suevi times a sacred wood the awful seat of the superstition of the Suevi None were permitted to enter the holy precincts without confessing by their servile bonds and suppliant posture the imme diate presence of the sovereign Deity Patriotism contributed aa well as devotion to consecrate the Sonnenwald or wood of the Sem nones  It was universally believed that the nation had received its first existence on that sacred spot At stated periods the numerous tribes who gloried in the Suevic blood resorted thither by their ambassadors  and the memory of their common extraction was perpetuated by Barbaric rites and human sacrifices The wide extended name of Suevi filled the interior countries of Germany from the banks of the Oder to those of the Danube They were distinguished from the other Germans by their peculiar mode of dressing their long hair which they gathered into a rude knot on the crown of the head and they delighted in an ornament that fliewed their ranks more lofty and terrible in the eyes of the ene my 8 Jealous as the Germans were of military renown they all confessed the superior valour of the Suevi and the tribes of the Usipetes and Tencteri who with a vast army

of Alemanni or All men to denote at once their various lineage and their common bravery S6 The latter was soon felt by the Romans in many a hostile inroad The Alemanni fought chiefly on horseback but their cavalry was rendered still more formidable by a mixture of light infantry selected from the bravest and most active of the youth whom frequent exercise had enured to accompany the horsemen in

they were dismayed by the arms of his successor a barbarian equal in valour and fierceness to themselves But still hovering on the frontiers of the empire they increased the general disorder that

Alemanni penetrated across the Danube and through the Rhsetian Alps into the plains of Lom bardy advanced as far as Ravenna and displayed the victorious banners of barbarians almost in fight of Rome 88 The insult and the danger rekindled in the senate some sparks of their ancient virtue Both the emperors were engaged in far distant wars Vale rian in the east and Gallienus on the Rhine All the

When Gallienus received the intelligence that his capital was de The senators   excluded by livered from the barbarians he was much less delighted than alarmed Gallienus with the courage of the senate since it might one day prompt them tury service to rescue the republic from domestic tyranny as well as from foreign invasion His timid ingratitude was published to his subjects in an edict which prohibited the senators from exercising any military employment and even from approaching the camps of the legions But his fears were groundless The rich and luxurious nobles sinking into their natural character accepted as a favour this dis graceful exemption from military service and as long as they were indulged in the enjoyment of their baths their theatres and their villas they cheerfully resigned the more dangerous cares of em pire to the rough hands of peasants and soldiers 90 Another invasion of the Alemanni of a more formidable aspect Gallienus contracts an but more glorious event is mentioned by a writer of the lower em alliance with c l i the Altmannv pire Three hundred thousand of that warlike people are said to have been vanquished in a battle near Milan by Gallienus in per son at the head of only ten thousand Romans 9 We may how ever with great probability ascribe this incredible victory either to the credulity of the historian or to some exaggerated exploits of one of the emperor s lieutenants It was by arms of a very different nature that Gallienus endeavoured to protect Italy from the fury of the Germans He espoused Pipa the daughter of a king of the Marcomanni a Suevic tribe which was often confounded with the Alemanni in their wars and conquests  To the father as the price of his alliance he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia The

Sarmatians but it was defended by the Romans with more than usual firmness and success The pro vinces that were the feat of war recruited the armies of Rome with an inexhaustible supply of hardy soldiers and more than one of these Illyrian peasants attained the station and displayed the abi lities of a general Though flying parties of the barbarians who incessantly hovered on the banks of the Danube penetrated some times to the confines of Italy and Macedonia  their progress was commonly checked or their return intercepted by the imperial lieutenants 9 But the great stream of the Gothic hostilities was diverted into a very different channel The Goths in their new settlement of the Ukraine soon became masters of the northern coast of the Euxine to the south of that inland sea were

lessness of temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence which is the just result of knowledge and experience Warriors of such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the

of the people ensued whilst the affrighted soldiers escaped through the opposite gates of the town The most holy temples and the most splendid edifices were involved in a common destruction The booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was immense the wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in Trebizond as in a secure place of refuge The number of captives was incredible as the

summoned them to hasten their return To navigate the Euxine before the month of May or after that of September is esteemed by the mo dern Turks the most unquestionable instance of rashness and folly 9 When we are informed that the third fleet equipped by the Goths Third navaI   K _ â â expedition of in the ports of Bosphorus consisted of five hundred sail of ships  the Goths our ready imagination instantly computes and multiplies the for midable armament j but as we are assured by the judicious Strabo that the pyratical vessels used by the barbarians of Pontus and the Lesser Scythia were not capable of containing more than twenty five or thirty men we may safely affirm that fifteen thousand war riors at the most embarked in this great expedition Impatient of the limits of the Euxine they steered their destructive course from the Cimmerian to the Thracian Bosphorus When they had almost gained the middle of the Straits they were suddenly driven back to the entrance of them till a

preparations for a vigorous defence Cleo damus one of the engineers employed by the emperor s orders to fortify the maritime cities against the Goths had already begun to repair the ancient walls fallen to decay since the time of Sylla The efforts of his skill were ineffectual and the barbarians be came masters of the native feat of the muses and the arts But while the conquerors abandoned themselves to the licence of plunder and intemperance their fleet that lay with a slender guard in the harbour of PirÃ us was unexpectedly attacked by the brave Dexip pus who flying with the engineer Cleodamus from the sack of i â Athens collected a hasty band of volunteers peasants as well as soldiers and in some measure avenged the calamities of his Country ravage But this exploit whatever lustre it might shed on the declining threa nluiy age or Athens served rather to irritate than to subdue the undaunted spirit of the northern invaders A general conflagration blazed out at the fame

their ruined fortifications The rage of war both by land and by sea spread from the eastern point of Suniam   tÂ the western coast of Epirus The Goths had already advanced within sight of Italy when the approach of such imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of pleasure The emperor appeared in arms and his presence seems to have checked the ardour and to have divided the

hardships of a tedious voyage broke into MÃ fia with a design of forcing their way over the Danube to their settlements in the Ukraine The wild attempt would have proved inevitable destruc tion if the disagreement of the Roman generals had not spared the barbarians at the expence of the common cause The small re mainder of this destroying host returned on board their vessels and measuring back their way through the Hellespont and the Bos phorus ravaged in their passage the shores of Troy whose fame immortalised by Homer will probably survive the memory of the Gothic conquests As soon as they found themselves in safety within the bason of the Euxine they landed at Anehialus in Thrace near the foot of Mount HÃ mus and after all their toils indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths What remained of the voyage was a short and easy â navigation 6 Such was the various fates of this third and greatest of their naval enterprises It may seem difficult to conceive 1 how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure But as their numbere were gradually wasted by the sword by shipwrecks and by the influehee of a warm climate they were perpetually renewed by troops of banditti and deserters who flecked to the standard of plunder and by a croud of fugitive staves often of German or Sarmatian extrac tion who eagerly seized the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge In these expeditions the Gothic nation claimed a superior share of honour and danger but the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners are sometimes distinguished and sometimes con founded in the imperfect histories of that age and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from the mouth of the Tanais the vague but familiar appellation of Scythians was frequently bestowed on the mixed multitude 7 In 272 THE DECLINE AND FALL  Mmpieo f6 n tne genera calamities of mankind the death of an individual Ephesus

from seven successive misfortunes l8 was finally burnt by the Goths in their third naval invasion The arts of Greece and the wealth of Asia had conspired to erect that sacred and magnificent structure It was supported by an hundred and twenty seven marble columns of the Ionic order They were the gifts of devout monarchs and each was sixty feet high The altar was adorned with the masterly sculptures of Praxiteles who had perhaps chosen from the favou rite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona the concealment of Apollo after the flaughter of the Cyclops and the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons 9 Yet the length of the temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty five feet about two thirds of the measure of the church of St Peter s at Rome Â In the other dimensions it was still more in ferior to rhat sublime production of modern architecture The spreading arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth than the oblong temples of the Pagans and the boldest artists of antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raising in the air a dome of the size and proportions of the pantheon The temple of Diana was however admired as one of the wonders of the world Successive empires the Persian the Macedonian and the Roman had revered its sanctity and enriched its splen dor 5 But the rude savages of the Baltic were destitute of a

a reluctant province of the great monarchy of Persia  Elated with this easy conquest and presuming on the distresses or the degeneracy of the Romans Sapor obliged the strong garrisons of CarrhÃ and

Sapor s ambition affected the East 0 0 Vol I N n Rome 274 THE DECLINE AND FALL Rome with a deep sense of the insult as well as of the danger Va lerian flattered himself that the vigilance of his lieutenants would sufficiently provide for the safety of the Rhine and of the Danube hut he resolved notwithstanding his advanced age to march in person to the defence of the Euphrates During his progress through Asia Minor the naval enterprises of the Goths were sus pended and the afflicted province enjoyed a transient and fallacious calm He passed the Euphrates encountered the Persian mo

light which is afforded i fof3 usÂ we mav discover a long series of imprudence of error and of deserved misfortunes on the side of the Roman emperor He re posed an implicit confidence in Macrianus his prÃ torian prÃ fect V That worthless minister rendered his master formidable only to the oppressed subjects and contemptible to the enemies of Rome S By his weak or wicked counsels the imperial army was betrayed into a situation where valour and military skill were equally un availing M7 The vigorous attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the Persian host was repulsed with great flaughter 1 8 j and Sapor who encompassed the camp with superior numbers patiently waited till the increasing rage of famine and pestilence had ensured his victory The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused Valerian as the cause of their calamities their seditious clamours demanded an instant capitulation An immense sum of gold was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat But the Persian conscious of his superiority refused the money with dis dain and detaining the deputies advanced in order of battle to the foot of the Roman rampart and insisted on a personal confer ence with the emperor Valerian was reduced tP the necessity of intrusting his life and dignity to the faith of an enemy The in terview ended as it was natural to expect The emperor was made 6 a prisoner OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE a prisoner and his astonished troops laid down their arms In such a momeht of triumph the pride and policy of Sapor prompted him to fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on his pleasure Cyriadea an obscure fugitive of Antioch stained with every vice was chosen to diflionour the Roman purple and the will of the Persian victor could not fail of being ratified by the acclamations however reluctant of the captive army 4Â The imperial Have was eager to secure the favour of his master S porover runs Syria by an act of treason to his native country He conducted Sapor Ciacia and over the Euphrates and by the way of Chalcis to the metropolis of PPadoC1 the East So rapid were the motions of the Persian cavalry that if We may credit a Very judicious historian 4 the city of Antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amuse ments of the theatre The splendid buildings of Antioch private as well as public were either pillaged or destroyed and the nume rous inhabitants were put to the sword or led away into captivity The tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes he ap â peared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants armed only with flings and defended his god and his property from the sacri legious hands of the followers of Zoroaster l J But the ruin of Tarsus and of many other cities furnilh a melancholy proof that except in this singular instance the conquest of Syria and Cilida scarcely interrupted the progress of the Persian arms The advantages of the narrow passes of mount Taurus were abandoned in which an invader whose principal force consisted in his cavalry would have been engaged in a very unequal combat and Sapor wa6 permitted to form the siege ofCÃ sarea the capital of Cappadocia a city though of the second rank which was supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants Demosthenes commanded in the place not so much by the commission of the emperor as in the voluntary defence of his country For a long time he deferred its N n 2 fate THE DECLINE AND FALL fate and when at last CÃ sarea was betrayed by the perfidy of a physician he cut his way through the Persians who had been or dered to exert their utmost diligence to take him alive This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who might either have honoured or punished his obstinate valour but many thousands of his fel low citizens were involved in a general massacre and Sapor is ac cused of treating his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cru elty Much should undoubtedly be allowed for national animo sity much for humbled pride and impotent revenge yet upon the whole it is certain that the fame prince who in Armenia had displayed the mild aspect of a legislator shewed himself to the Ro mans under the stern features of a conqueror He despaired of making any permanent establishment in the empire and sought only to leave behind him a wasted desert whilst he transported into Persia the people and the treasures of the provinces 4V Boldness and At the time when the East trembled at the name of Sapor he SdeSthus received a present not unworthy of the greatest kings a long train of â gainit Sapor cameis iac en with the most rare and valuable merchandises The rich offering was accompanied by an epistle respectful but not ser vile from Odenathus one of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra Who is this Odenathus said the haughty victor  and he commanded that the presents should be cast into the Eu phrates that thus insolently presumes to write to his lord If he entertains a hope of mitigating his punishment let him fall pro strate before the foot of our throne with his hands bound behind his back Should he hesitate swift destruction shall be poured on his head on his whole race and on his country 4V The desperate extremity to which the Palmyrenian was reduced called into action all the latent powers of his foul He met Sapor but he met him in arms Infusing his own spirit into a little army col lected from the villages of Syria 7 and the tents of the desert  he hovered round the Persian host harassed their retreat carried off part OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE part of the treasure and what was dearer than any treasure several of the women of the Great King who was at last obliged to repass the Euphrates with some marks of haste and confusion 9 By this exploit Odenathus laid the foundations of his future fame and for tunes The majesty of Rome oppressed by a Persian was protected by a Syrian or Arab of Palmyra The voice of history which is often little more than the organ Treatment of of hatred or flattery reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the Vakria11 rights of conquest We are told that Valerian in chains but in vested with the imperial purple was exposed to the multitude a con stant spectacle of fallen greatness and that whenever the Persian monarch mounted on horseback he placed his foot on the neck of a Roman emperor Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of hia allies who repeatedly advised him to remember the vicissitude of fortune to dread the returning power of Rome and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of peace not the object of insult Sapor still remained inflexible When Valerian sunk under the weight of shame and grief his sldn stuffed with straw and formed into the likeness of a human figure was preserved for ages in the most cele brated temple of Persia a more real monument of triumph than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so often erected by Roman vanity150 The tale is moral and pathetic but the truth of it may very fairly be called in question The letters still extant from the princes of the East to Sapor are manifest forgeries J nor is it natural to suppose that a jealous monarch should even in the person of a rival thus publickly degrade the majesty of kings Whatever treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia it is at least certain that the only emperor of Rome who ever fell into the hands of the enemy languished away his life in hopeless captivity The emperor Gallienus who had long supported with impatience Character and the censorial severity of his father and colleague received the in of QdSnS telligence 27 8 THE DECLINE AND FALL telligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed indifference I knew that my father was a mortal said he â and since he has acted as becomes a brave man I am satisfied Whilst Rome lamented the fate of her sovereign the savage cold ness of his son was extolled by the servile courtiers as the perfect firmness of a hero and a stoic s It is diffiicult to paint the light the various the inconstant character of Gallienus which he dis played without constraint as soon as he became sole possessor of the empire In every art that he attempted his lively genius enabled him to succeed and as his genius was destitute of judgment he attempted every art except the important ones of war and govern ment He was a master of several curious but useless sciences a rteady orator an elegant poet a skilful gardener an excellent cook and most contemptible prince When the great emergences of the state required his presence and attention he was engaged in con versation with the philosopher Plotinus s wasting his time in trifling dr KtetttidttB pleasures preparing his initiation to the Grecian mys teries or soliciting a place in the Areopagus of Athens His profuse magnificence insulted the general poverty the solemn ridicule of his triumphs impressed a deeper fense of the public disgrace The re peated intelligence of invasions defeats and rebellions he received with a careless smile and singling out with affected contempt some particular production of the lost province he carelessly asked whether Rome must be ruined unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt and Arras cloth from Gaul There were however a few short moments in the life of Gallienus when exasperated by some recent injury he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant till satiated with blood or fatigued by resistance he insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his character The thirty At a time when the reins of government were held with so loose tyrants  hand it is not surprising that a crowd of usurpers should start up in OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 279 in every province of the empire against the son of Valerian It was probably some ingenious fancy of comparing the thirty tyrants of Rome with the thirty tyrants of Athens that induced the writers of the Augustan history to select that celebrated number which has been gradually received into a popular appellation 56 But in every light the parallel is idle and defective What resem blance can we discover between a council of thirty persons the united oppressors of a single city and an uncertain list of independ ent rivals who rose and fell in irregular succession through the ex tent of a vast empire Nor can the number of thirty be completed unless we include in the account the women and children who were honoured with the imperial title The reign of Gallienus distracted Their real   number was as it was produced only nineteen pretenders to the throne Cy 00 m ve than riades Macrianus Balista Odenathus and Zenobia in the east nmeIeen in Gaul and the western provinces Postumus Lollianus Victo rinus and his mother Victoria Marius and Tetricus In Illyricum and the confines of the Danube Ingenuus Regillianus and Au reolus in Pontus S7 Saturninus in Isauria Trebellianus Piso in Thessaly Valens in Achaia Ã milianus in Egypt and Celsus in Africa To illustrate the obscure monuments of the life and death of each individual would prove a laborious task alike barren of instruction and of amusement We may content ourselves with investigating some general characters that most strongly mark the condition of the times and the manners of the men their preten sions their motives their fate and the destructive consequences of their usurpation j8 It is sufficiently known that the odious appellation of Tyrant was Characterand often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of tyrant supreme power without any reference to the abuse of it Several of the pretenders who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor Gallienus were shining models of virtue and almost all possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability Their merjt had THE DECLINE AND FALL had recommended them to the favour of Valerian and gradually promoted them to the most important commands of the empire The generals who assumed the title of Augustus were either respected by their troops for their able conduct and severe discipline er admired for valour and success in war or beloved for frankness and generosity The field of victory was often the scene of their election and even the armourer Marius the most contemptible of all the candidates for the purple was distinguished however by intrepid courage matchless strength and blunt honesty J9 His mean and recent trade cast indeed an air of ridicule on his eleva tion but his birth could not be more obscure than was that of the greater part of his rivals who were born of peasants and Their obscure inlisted in the army as private soldiers In times of confusion every active genius finds the place assigned him by Nature in a general state of war military merit is the road to glory and to greatness Of rhe nineteen tyrants Tetricus only was a senator Piso alone was a noble The blood of Numa through twenty eight successive generations ran in the veins of Calphurnius Piso 6Â who by female alliances claimed a right of exhibiting in his house the images of Crassus and of the great Pompey 6 His ancestors had been repeatedly dignified with all the honours which the common wealth could bestow and of all the ancient families of Rome the Calphurnian alone had survived the tyranny of the CÃ sars The personal qualities of Piso added new lustre to his race The usurper Valens by whose order he was killed confessed with deep remorse that even an enemy ought to have respected the sanctity of Piso and although he died in arms against Gallienus the senate with the emperor s generous permission decreed the triumphal ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel l6 The cause The lieutenants of Valerian were grateful to the father whom beilion they esteemed They disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of his unworthy son The throne of the Roman world was unsup ported OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ported by any principle of loyalty and treason against such a prince might easily be considered as patriotism to the state Yet if we examine with candour the conduct of these usurpers it will ap pear that they were much oftener driven into rebellion by their fears than urged to it by their ambition They dreaded the cruel suspicions of Gallienus they equally dreaded the capricious violence of their troops If the dangerous favour of the army had impru dently declared them deserving of the purple they were marked for sure destruction and even prudence would counsel them to secure a short enjoyment of empire and rather to try the fortune of war than to expect the hand of an executioner When the clamour of the soldiers invested the reluctant victims with the en signs of sovereign authority they sometimes mourned in secret their approaching fate You have lost said Saturninus on the day of his elevation  you have lost a useful commander and you have made a very wretched emperor 6 The apprehensions of Saturninus were justified by the repeated experience of revolutions Of the nineteen tyrants who started up under the reign of Gallienus there was not one who enjoyed a life of peace or a natural death As soon as they were invested with the bloody purple they inspired their adherents with the fame fears and ambition which had occasioned their own revolt Encompassed with domestic conspiracy military sedition and civil war they trembled on the edge of precipices in which after a longer or shorter term of anxiety they were inevitably lost These precarious monarchs received however such honours as the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could bestow but their claim founded on rebellion could never obtain the sanction of law or history Italy Rome and the senate constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus and he alone was considered as the sovereign of the empire That prince condescended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus who deserved the honourable distinc Vol I O o tion 282 THE DECLINE AND FALL tiom tion by the respectful conduct which he always maintained to wards the son of Valerian With the general applause of the Romans and the consent of Gallienus the senate conferred the title of Augustus on the brave Palmyrenian and seemed to intrust him with the government

from the cottage to the quences of t a  o tUese usurpa throne and from the throne to the grave might have amused an indifferent philosopher j were it possible for a philosopher to remain indifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind The election of these precarious emperors their power and their death were equally destructive to their subjects and adherents The price of their fatal elevation was instantly discharged to the troops by an immense donative drawn from the bowels of the exhausted people However virtuous was their character however pure their inten tions they found themselves reduced to the hard necessity of support ing their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty When they fell they involved armies and provinces in their fall There is still extant a most savage mandate from Gallienus to one of his ministers after the suppression of Ingenuus who had assumed the purple in Illyricum It is not enough fays that soft but in human prince  that you

ROMAN EMPIRE 283  forces of the state were dissipated in private quarrels the defence less provinces lay exposed to every invader The bravest usurpers were compelled by the perplexity of their situation to conclude ig nominious treaties with the common enemy to purchase with op pressive tributes the neutrality or services of the barbarians and to introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the Roman monarchy 161 Such were the barbarians and such the tyrants who under the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus dismembered the provinces and reduced the empire to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin from whence it seemed impossible that it should ever emerge As far as the barrenness of materials would permit we have attempted to trace with order and perspicuity the general events of that cala mitous period There still remain some particular facts I The disorders of Sicily II The tumults of Alexandria and III The rebel lion of the Isaurians which may serve to reflect a strong light on the horrid picture I Whenever numerous troops of banditti multiplied by success Disorders of and impunity publickly defy instead of eluding the justice of their y country we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the com munity The situation of Sicily preserved it from the barbarians nor could the disarmed province have supported an usurper The sufferings of that once flourishing and still fertile island were in flicted by baser hands A licentious crowd of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered country and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more ancient times 6S Devastations of which the husbandman was either the victim or the accomplice must have ruined the agriculture of Sicily and as the principal estates were the property of the opulent senators of Rome who often enclosed within a farm the territory of an old republic it is â O o 2 not 284 THE DECLINE AND FALL not improbable that this private injury might affect the capital more deeply than all the conquests of the Goths or the Persians Tumults of II The foundation of Alexandria was a noble design at once Alexandria conceived and exectlted by the son of Philip The beautiful and regular form of that great city second only to Rome itself compre hended a circumference of fifteen miles 169 it was peopled by three hundred thousand free inhabitants besides at least an equal number of staves 7Â The lucrative trade of Arabia and India flowed through the port of Alexandria to the capital and provinces of the empire Idleness was unknown Some were employed in blowing of glass others in weaving of linen others again manufacturing the papyrus Either sex and every age was engaged in the pur suits of industry nor did even the blind or the lame want occupa tions suited to their condition l7 But the people of Alexandria a various mixture of nations united the vanity and inconstancy of the Greeks with the superstition and obstinacy of the Egyptians The most trifling occasion a transient scarcity of flesh or lentils the neglect of an accustomed salutation a mistake of precedency in the public baths or even a religious dispute 7 were at any time sufficient to kindle a sedition among that vast multitude whose resentments were furious and implacable 7K After the captivity of Valerian and the indolence of his son had relaxed the authority of the laws the Alexandrians abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage of their passions and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil war that continued with a few short and suspicious truces above twelve years 7 All intercourse was cut off between the several quarters of the afflicted city every street was polluted with blood every building of strength converted into a citadel nor did the tumults subside till a considerable part of Alexandria was irre trievably ruined The spacious and magnificent district of Bruchion with its palaces and musÃ um the residence of the kings and philo sopher OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 28 sophers of Egypt is described above a century afterwards as already reduced to its present state of a dreary solitude 7S III The obscure rebellion of Trebellianus who assumed the Rebellion of purple in Isauria a petty province of Asia Minor was attended with strange and memorable consequences The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an officer of Gallienus but his followers de spairing of mercy resolved to shake off their allegiance not only to the emperor but to the empire and suddenly returned to the savage manners from which they had never perfectly been reclaimed Their craggy rocks a branch of the wide extended Taurus pro tected their inaccessible retreat The tillage of some fertile vallies 6 supplied them with the necessaries and a habit of rapine with the luxuries of life  In the heart of the Roman monarchy the Haurians ever continued a nation of wild barbarians Suc ceeding princes unable to reduce them to obedience either by arms or policy were compelled to acknowledge their weakness by sur rounding the hostile and independent spot with a strong chain of fortifications 77 which often proved insufficient to restrain the in cursions of these domestic foes The Isaurians gradually extending their territory to the sea coast subdued the western and mountainous â part of Cilicia formerly the nest of thole daring pyrates against whom the republic was obliged to exert its utmost force un der the conduct of the great Pompey 7S Our habits of thinking so fondly connect the order of the Famine an pcltilence universe with the fate of man that this gloomy period of history has been decorated with inundations earthquakes uncommon me teors preternatural darkness and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or exaggerated 79 Eut a long and general famine was a calamity of a more serious kind It was the inevitable consequence of rapine and oppression which extirpated the produce of the present and the hope of future harvests Famine is almost always followed by epi demical diseases the effect of scanty and unwholesome food Other causes 286 THE DECLINE AND FALL causes must however have contributed to the furious plague which from the year two hundred and fifty to the year two hundred and sixty five raged without interruption in every province every city and almost every family of the Roman empire During some time five thousand persons died daily in Rome and many townsj that had escaped the hands of the barbarians were entirely depopu lated Â Diminution We have the knowledge of a very curious circumstance of some use of the human species perhaps in the melancholy calculation of human calamities An exact register was kept at Alexandria of all the citizens entitled to receive the distribution of corn It was found that the ancient number of those comprised between the ages of forty and seventy had been equal to the whole sum of claimants from fourteen to fourscore years of age who remained alive after the reign of Gal lienus 8 Applying this authentic fact to the most correct tables of mortality it evidently proves that above half the people of Alexandria had perished and could we venture to extend the ana logy to the other provinces we might suspect that war pestilence and famine had consumed in a few years the moiety of the hu man species CHAP OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE CHAP XI Reign of Claudius â Defeat of the Goths â Victoriestri umphs and deaths of Aurelian UNDER the deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus the empire was oppressed and almost destroyed by the soldiers the tyrants and the barbarians It was saved by a series of great princes who derived their obscure origin from the martial provinces of Ulyricum Within a period of about thirty years Claudius Aurelian Probus Diocletian and his colleagues triumphed over the foreign and domestic enemies of the state re established with the military discipline the strength of the frontiers and deserved the glorious title of Restorers of the Roman world The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a succession of Aareolm in heroes The indignation of the people imputed all their calamities defeated and to Gallienus and the far greater part were indeed the consequence Milan 1 W of his dissolute manners and careless administration He wa6 even destitute of a fense of honour which so frequently supplies the ab sence of public virtue and as long as he was permitted to enjoy the possession of Italy a victory of the barbarians the loss of a pro vince or the rebellion of a general seldom disturbed the tranquil course of his pleasures At length a considerable army stationed A D 268 on the Upper Danube invested with the imperial purple their leader Aureolus who disdaining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of RhÅ tia passed the Alps occupied Milan threatened Rome and challenged Gallienus to dispute in the field the sove reignty of Italy The emperor provoked by the insult and alarmed by the instant danger suddenly exerted that latent vigour which sometimes broke through the indolence of his temper Forcing himself THE DECLINE AND FALL himself from the luxury of the palace he appeared in arms at the head of his legions and advanced beyond the Po to encounter his com petitor The corrupted name of Pontirolo 1 still preserves the memory of a bridge over the Adda which during the action must have proved an object of the utmost importance to both armies The RhÃ tian usurper after receiving a total defeat and a dangerous wound retired into Milan The siege of that great city was im mediately formed the walls were battered with every engine in use among the ancients and Aureolus doubtful of his internal strength and hopeless of foreign succours already anticipated the fatal consequences of unsuccessful rebellion His last resource was an attempt to seduce the loyalty of the besiegers He scattered libels through their camp inviting the troops to desert an unworthy master who sacrificed the public happiness to his luxury and the lives of his most valuable subjects to the slightest suspicions The arts of Aureolus diffused fears and discon tent among the principal officers of his rival A conspiracy was formed by Heraclianus the Praetorian PrÃ fect by Marcian a general of rank and reputation and by Cecrops who commanded a numerous body of Dalmatian guards The death of Gallienus was resolved and notwithstanding their desire of first terminating the siege of Milan the extreme danger which accompanied every mo ment s delay obliged them to hasten the execution of their daring purpose At a late hour of the night but while the emperor still protracted the pleasures of the table an alarm was suddenly given that Aureolus at the head of all his forces had made a desperate sally from the town Gallienus who was never deficient in personal bravery started from his silken couch and without allowing himself time either to put on his armour or to assemble his guards he mounted on horseback and rode full speed towards the supposed place of the attack Encompassed by his declared or concealed enemies he soon amidst the nocturnal tumult received a mortal dart OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE dart from an uncertain hand Before he expired a patriotic senti rj Â 9 ment riling in the mind of Gallienus induced him to name a Death of   Galhenus deserving successor and it was his last request that the imperial ornaments should he delivered to Claudius who then commanded a detached army in the neighbourhood of Pavia The report at least was diligently propagated and the order cheerfully obeyed by the conspirators who had already agreed to place Claudius on the throne On the first news of the emperor s death the troops ex pressed some suspicion and resentment till the one was removed and the other asswaged by a donative of twenty pieces of gold to each soldier They then ratified the election and acknowledged the merit of their new sovereign  The obscurity which covered the origin of Claudius though it Character and 6 Â elevation of might leave room for some flattering fictionssufficiently reveals the emperor the meanness of his birth We can only discover that he was a native of one of the provinces bordering on the Danube that his youth was spent in arms and that his modest valour attracted the favour and confidence of Decius The senate and people already â considered him as an excellent officer equal to the most important trusts and censured the inattention of Valerian who suffered him to remain in the subordinate station of a tribune But it was not long before that emperor distinguished the merit of Claudius by declaring him general in chief of the Illyrian frontier with the command of all the troops in Thrace MÃ sia Dacia Pannonia and Dalmatia the appointments of the prÃ fect of Egypt the establishment of the pro consul of Africa and the sure prospect of the consulship By his victories over the Goths he deserved from the senate the honour of a statue and excited the jealous apprehensions of Gallienus It was impossible that a soldier could esteem so dissolute a sovereign nor is it easy to conceal a just contempt Some unguarded expressions which dropt from Claudius were officioufly transmitted to the royal ear The emperor s answer to an officer of confidence betrays his own Vol I Pp character aj o THE DECLINE AND FALL character and that of the times  There is not any thing capable 44 of giving me more serious concern than the intelligence contained in your last dispatch 4 that some malicious suggestions have indis 4 posed towards us the mind of our friend and parent Claudius As you regard your allegiance use every means to appease his  resentment but conduct your negociation with secrecy let it  not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops they are already M provoked and it might inflame their fury I myself have sent him some presents be it your care that he accept them with plea  sure Above all let him not suspect that I am made acquainted with his imprudence The fear of my anger might urge him to desperate counsels5 The presents which accompanied this hum ble epistle such as a monarch has seldom addressed to a discontented subject consisted of a considerable sum of money a splendid wardrobe and a valuable service of silver and gold plate By such arts Gallienus softened the indignation and dispelled the fears of  his Illyrian general and during the remainder of that reign the formidable sword of Claudius Was always drawn in the cause of a master whom he despised At last indeed he received from the conspirators the bloody purple of Gallienus but he had been absent from their camp and councils and however he might applaud the deed we may candidly presume that he was innocent of the know ledge of it6 When Claudius ascended the throne he was about fifty four years of age Death of The siege of Milan was still continued and Aureolus soon dis covered that the success of his artifices had only raised up a more determined adversary He attempted to negociate with Claudius a treaty of alliance and partition Tell him replied the intrepid emperor  that such proposals should have been made to Gallienus 44 he perhaps might have listened to them with patience and ac 44 cepted a colleague as despicable as himself7 This stern refuses and a last unsuccessful effort obliged Aureolus to yield the city and himself OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE himself to the discretion of the conqueror The judgment of the army pronounced him worthy of death and Claudius after a feeble resistance consented to the execution of the sentence Nor was the zeal of the senate less ardent in the cause of their aew sovereiga They ratified perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal the election of Claudius and as his predecessor had shewn himself the personal enemy of their order they exercised under the name of justice a severe revenge against his friends and family The senate was per mitted to discharge the ungrateful office of punishment and the em peror reserved for himself the pleasure and merit of obtaining by his intercession a general act of indemnity  Such ostentatious clemency discovers less of the real character of Clemency and  justice ot Claudius than a trifling circumstance in which he seems to have Claudius obeyed the dictates of his heart The frequent rebellions of the provinces had involved almost every person in the guilt of treason almost every estate in the case of confiscation and Gallienus often displayed his liberality by distributing among his officers the pro perty of his subjects On the accession of Claudius an old woman threw herself at his feet and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony The gene ral was Claudius himself who had not entirely escaped the contagion of the times The emperor blushed at the reproach but deserved the confidence which she had reposed in his equity The confession of his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample restitution In the arduous talk which Claudius had undertaken of restoring the He under empire to its ancient splendor it was first necessary to revive among formation of his troops a fense of order and obedience With the authority of thcarnjy a veteran commander he represented to them that the relaxation of discipline had introduced a long train of disorders the effects of which were at length experienced by the soldiers themselves that a people ruined by oppression and indolent from despair could no longer supply a numerous army with the means of luxury Or even P p 2 of 202 THE DECLINE AND FALL of subsistence that the danger of each individual had increased with the despotism of the military order since princes who tremble on the throne will guard their safety by the instant sacrifice of every obnoxious subject The emperor expatiated on the mischiefs of a lawless caprice which the soldiers could only gratify at the ex pence of their own blood as their seditious elections had so fre quently been followed by civil wars which consumed the flower of the legions either in the field of battle or in the cruel abuse of vic tory He painted in the most lively colours the exhausted state of the treasury the desolation of the provinces the disgrace of the Roman name and the insolent triumph of rapacious barbarians It was against those barbarians he declared that he intended to point the first effort of their arms Tetricus might reign for a while over the West and even Zenobia might preserve the dominion of the East 0 These usurpers were his personal adversaries nor could he think of indulging any private resentment till he had saved an empire whose impending ruin would unless it was timely pre  vented crufli both the army and the people A D 269 The various nations of Germany and Sarmatia who fought under invLtethe tne Gothic standard had already collected an armament more for empire midable than any which had yet issued from the Euxina On the banks of the Niester one of the great rivers that discharge them selves into it they constructed a fleet of two thousand or even of six thousand vessels numbers which however incredible they may seem would have been insufficient to transport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty thousand barbarians Whatever might be the real strength of the Goths the vigour and success of the expedition were not adequate to the greatness of the prepara tions In their passage through the Bosphorus the unskilful pilots were overpowered by the violence of the current and while the multitude of their ships were crowded in a narrow channel many were dashed against each other or against the shore The barba rians OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 295 rians made descents on various coasts both of Europe and Asia but the open country was already plundered and they were repulsed with shame and loss from several of the fortified cities A spirit of discouragement and division arose in the fleet and some of their chiefs sailed away towards the islands of Crete and Cyprus but the main body pursuing a more steady course anchored at length near the foot of mount Athos and assaulted the city of Thessalonica the wealthy capital of all the Macedonian provinces Their attacks in which they displayed a fierce but artless bravery were soon in terrupted by the rapid approach of Claudius hastening to a scene of action that deserved the presence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire Impatient for battle the Goths

shall perform will be sufficiently great11 The melancholy firmness of this epistle announces a hero careless of his fate conscious of his danger but still deriving a well grounded hope from the resources of his own mind The s94 THE DECLINE AND FALL His victory The event surpassed his own expectations and those of the world over ie 11 â Gothi By the most signal victories he delivered the empire from this bar baric host and was distinguished by posterity under the glorious appellation of the Gothic Claudius The imperfect historians of an irregular war do not enable us to describe the order and circum stances of his exploits but if we could be indulged in the allu sion we might distribute into three acts this memorable tragedy I The decisive battle was fought near Naissus a city of Dardania The legions at first gave way oppressed by numbers and dismayed by misfortunes Their ruin was inevitable had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief A large detachment rising out of the secret and difficult passes of the mountains which by his order they had occupied suddenly assailed the rear of the victo rious Goths The favourable instant was improved by the activity of Claudius He revived the courage of his troops restored their ranks and pressed the barbarians on every side Fifty thousand men are reported to have been flain in the battle of Naissus Several large bodies of barbarians covering their retreat with a moveable fortification of waggons retired or rather escaped from the field of flaughter II We may presume that some insurmountable dif ficulty the fatigue perhaps or the disobedience of the conquerors prevented Claudius from completing in one day the destruction of the Goths The war was diffused over the provinces of MÃ fia Thrace and Macedonia and its operations drawn out into a variety of marches surprises and tumultuary engagements as well by sea as by land When the Romans suffered any loss it was commonly occasioned by their own cowardice or rashness but the superior talents of the emperor his perfect knowledge of the country and his judicious choice of measures and officers assured on most occasions the success of his arms The immense booty the fruit of so many victories consisted for the greater part of cattle and flaves A select body of the Gothic youth was received among the imperial troops the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 295 the remainder was fold into servitude and so considerable was the number of female captives that every soldier obtained to his share two or three women A circumstance from which we may con clude that the invaders entertained some designs of settlement as well as of plunder since in a naval expedition they were accom panied by their families III The loss of their fleet which was either taken or funk had intercepted the retreat of the Goths A vast circle of Roman posts distributed with skill supported with firmness and gradually closing towards a common center forced the barbarians into the most inaccessible parts of mount Haemus where they found a safe refuge but a very scanty subsistence During the course of a rigorous winter in which they were besieged by the emperor s troops famine and pestilence desertion and the sword continually diminished the imprisoned multitude On the return of spring A D 270 nothing appeared in arms except a hardy and desperate band the remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the mouth of the Niester The pestilence which swept away such numbers of the barbarians Msrcb at length proved fatal to their conqueror After a sliort but glo emperor who rious reign of two years Claudius expired at Sirmium amidst the Au nsor tears and acclamations of his subjects In his last illness he con his successor vened the principal officers of the state and army and in their pre sence recommended Aurelian one of his generals as the most de serving of the throne and the best qualified to execute the great de sign which he himself had been permitted only to undertake The virtues of Claudius his valour affability 4 justice and tempe rance his love of fame and of his country place him in that short list of emperors who added lustre to the Roman purple Those vir tues however were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age of Constantine who was the great grandson of Crifpus the elder brother of Claudius The voice of flattery was soon taught to repeat that the gods who so hastily had snatched 20f5 THE DECLINE AND FALL The attempt and sail ot Quintilius April Origin and services of Aurelian snatched Claudius from the earth rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual establishmenfof the empire in his family Notwithstanding these oracles the greatness of the Flavian family a name which it had pleased them to assume was deferred above twenty years and the elevation of Claudius occasioned the immediate ruin of his brother Quintilius who possessed not sufficient mpderation or courage to descend into the private station to which the patriot ism of the late emperor had condemned him Without delay or re flection he assumed the purple at Aquileia where he commanded a considerable force and though his reign lasted only seventeen days he had time to obtain the sanction of the senate and to ex perience a mutiny of the troops As soon as he was informed that the great army of the Danube had invested the well known valour of Aurelian with imperial power he funk under the fame and merit of his rival and ordering his veins to be opened prudently with drew himself from the unequal contest si The general design of this work will not permit us minutely to relate the actions of every emperor after he ascended the throne much less to deduce the various fortunes of his private life We shall only observe that the father of Aurelian was a peasant of the territory of Sirmium who occupied a small farm the property of Aurelius a rich senator His warlike son inlisted in the troops as a common soldier successively rose to the rank of a centurion a tri bune the prÃ fect of a legion the inspector of the camp the gene ral or as it was then called the duke of a frontier and at length during the Gothic war exercised the important office of commander in chief of the cavalry In every station he distinguished himself by matchless valour 7 rigid discipline and successful conduct He was invested with the consulffiip by the emperor Valerian who styles him in the pompous language of that age the deliverer of Illyri cum the restorer of Gaul and the rival of the Scipios At the re commendation of Valerian a senator of the highest rank and merit Ulpius Ot THE ROMAN EMPIRE 297 TJlpius Crinitus whose blood was derived from the fame source as that of Trajan adopted the Pannonian peasant gave him his daughter in marriage and relieved with his ample fortune the honourable poverty which Aurelian had preserved inviolate 8 The reign of Aurelian was only four years and about nine Aurelian s months but every instant of that short period was filled by some reign memorable atchievment He put an end to the Gothic war chas tised the Germans who invaded Italy recovered Gaul Spain and Britain out of the hands of Tetricus and destroyed the proud mo narchy which Zenobia had erected in the East on the ruins of the afflicted empire It was the rigid attention of Aurelian even to the minutest ar His severe dis licles of discipline which bestowed such uninterrupted success on his arms His military regulations are contained in a very concise epistle to one of his inferior officers who is commanded to enforce them as he wishes to become a tribune or as he is desirous to live Gaming drinking and the arts of divination were severely pro hibited Aurelian expected that his soldiers should be modest frugal and laborious that their armour should be constantly kept bright their weapons sharp their clothing and horses ready for immediate service that they should live in their quarters with chas tity and sobriety without damaging the corn fields without stealing even a sheep a fowl or a bunch of grapes without exacting from their landlords either salt or oil or wood The public allow u ance continues the emperor is sufficient for their support u their wealth should be collected from the spoil of the enemy not  from the tears of the provincials V A single instance will serve to display the rigour and even cruelty of Aurelian One of the soldiers had seduced the wife of his host The guilty wretch was fastened to two trees forcibly drawn towards each other and his limbs torn asunder by their sudden separation A few such examples im pressed a salutary consternation The punishments of Aurelian were Vol I Q q terrible j 2o8 THE DECLINE AND FALL terrible but he had seldom occasion to punish more than once the same offence His own conduct gave a sanction to his laws and the seditious legion dreaded a chief who had learned to obey and who was worthy to command He concludes The death Â f Claudius had revived the fainting spirit of the Goths theeGothsith ne tr0Â P which guarded the passes of mount Haemus and the banks of the Danube had been drawn away by the apprehension of a eivil war and it is probable that the remaining body of the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favourable opportunity left their settlements of the Ukraine traversed the rivers and swelled with new multitudes the destroying host of their countrymen Their united numbers were at length encountered by Aurelian and the bloody and douhtful conflict ended only with the approach of night Exhausted by so many calamities which they had mutually Endured and inflicted during a twenty years war the Goths and the Romans consented to a lasting and beneficial treaty It was earnestly solicited by the barbarians and cheerfully ratified by the legions to whose suffrage Aurelian prudently referred the decision of that important question The Gothic nation engaged to supply the armies of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries con fisting entirely of cavalry and stipulated in return an undisturbed retreat with a regular market as far as the Danube provided b jr the emperor s care but at their own expence The treaty was observed with such religious fidelity that when a party of five hun dred men straggled from the camp in quest of plunder the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements It is however not unlikely that the precaution of Aurelian who had exacted as hostages the sons and daughters of the Gothic chiefs contributed something to this pacific temper The youths he trained in arms and near his own person i to the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman educations and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Â 90 and by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most endearing connexions  But the most important condition of peace was understood rather Â nd resigns 1 A them the ptOÂ than expressed in the treaty Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces vinÂ of from Dacia and tacitly relinquished that great province to the Goths and Vandals His manly judgment convinced him of the solid advantages and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchyv The Dacian subjects removed from those distant possessions which they were unable to cultivate or defend added strength and populousnefs to the southern side of the Danube A fertile territory which the repe tition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert was yielded to their industry and a new province of Dacia still preserved the memory of Trajan s conquests The old country of that name detained however a considerable number of its inhabitants who dreaded exile more thart a Gothic master J These degenerate Ro mans continued to serve the empire whose allegiance they had re nounced by introducing among their conquerors the first notions of agriculture the useful arts and the conveniences of civilised life An intercourse of commerce and language was gradually established between the opposite banks of the Danube and after Dacia became an independent state it often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the invasions of the savages of the north A fense of interest attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance of Rome and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and useful friendship This various colony which filled the ancient province and was insensibly blended into one great people still ac knowledged the superior renown and authority of the Gothic tribe and claimed the fancied honour of a Scandinavian origin At the same time the happy resemblance of the name of GetÃ infused among the credulous Goths a vain persuasion that in a remote QjJ 2 age Soo THE DECLINE ANU FALL bic war September age their own ancestors already seated in the Dacian provinces had received the instructions of Zamolxis and checked the victorious arms of Sesostris and Darius z The Aleman While the vigorous and moderate conduct of Aurelian restored the Illyrian frontier the nation of the Alemanni 1S violated the conditions of peace which either Gallienus had purchased or Claudius had imposed and inflamed by their impatient youth suddenly flew to arms Forty thousand horse appeared in the field 6 and the numbers of the infantry doubled those of the ca valry 11 The first objects of their avarice were a few cities of the RhÃ tian frontier but their hopes soon rising with success the rapid march of the Alemanni traced a line of devastation from the Danube to the Po lS A D 270 The emperor was almost at the fame time informed of the irrupt tion and of the retreat of the barbarians Collecting an active body of troops he marched with silence and celerity along the â fleirts of the Hercynian forest and the Alemanni laden with the spoils of Italy arrived at the Danube without suspecting that on the opposite bank and in an advantageous post a Roman army lay concealed and prepared to intercept their return Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians and permitted about half their forces to pass the river without precaution Their situation and astonishment gave him an easy victory his skilful conduct im proved the advantage Disposing the legions in a semicircular form he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the Danube and wheeling them on a sudden towards the center inclosed the rear of the German host The dismayed barbarians on whatsoever side they cast their eyes beheld with despair a wasted country a deep and rapid stream a victorious and implacable enemy Reduced to this distressed condition the Alemanni no longer disdained to sue for peace Aurelian received their ambassadors at the head of his camp and with every circumstance of martial pomp that OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 30 1 that could display the greatness and discipline of Rome The legions stood to their arms in well ordered ranks and awful silence The principal commanders distinguished by the ensigns of their rank appeared on horseback on either side of the imperial throne Behind the throne the consecrated images of the emperor and his predecessors the golden eagles and the various titles of the legions engraved in letters of gold were exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver When Aurelian assumed his seat his manly grace and majestic figure 30 taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple of their conqueror The ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground in silence They were commanded to rife and permitted to speak By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy magnified their exploits  expatiated on the vicissitudes of fortune and the advantages of peace and with an ill timed confidence demanded a large subsidy as the price of the alliance which they offered to the Romans The answer of the emperor was stern and imperious He treated their offer with contempt and their demand with indignation reproached the barbarians that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of the laws of peace and finally dismissed them with the choice only of submitting to his unconditioned mercy or awaiting the utmost severity of his resentment3 Aurelian had resigned a distant province to the Goths but it was dangerous to trust or to pardon these perfidious barbarians whose formidable power kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms Immediately after this conference it should seem that some un The Ale expected emergency required the emperor s presence in Pannonia faty 1 He devolved on his lieutenants the care of finishing the destruction of the Alemanni either by the sword or by the surer operation of famine But an active despair has often triumphed over the indo lent assurance of success The barbarians finding it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman camp broke through the posts 3Â 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL In their rear which were more feebly or less carefully guarded and with incredible diligence but by a different road returned towards the mountains of Italy  Aurelian who considered the war as totally extinguished received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the Alemanni and of the ravage which they already committed in the territory of Milan The legions were com manded to follow with as much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting the rapid flight of an enemy whose in fantry and cavalry moved with almost equal swiftness A few days afterwards the emperor himself marched to the relief of Italy at the head of a chosen body of auxiliaries among whom were the hostages and cavalry of the Vandals and of all the PrÃ torian guards who had served in the wars on the Danube tÂ d are at last As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from aSm y the Alps to the Apennine the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and his officers was exercised in the discovery the attack and the pursuit of their numerous detachments Notwithstanding this desultory war three considerable battles are mentioned in which the principal force of both armies was obstinately engaged  The success was various In the first fought near Placentia the Romans received so severe a blow that according to the expression of a writer ex tremely partial to Aurelian the immediate dissolution of the empire was apprehended 5S The crafty barbarians who had lined the woods suddenly attacked the legions in the dusk of the evening and as it is most probable after the fatigue and disorder of a long march The fury of their charge was irresistible but at length aster a dreadful slaughter the patient firmness of the emperor rallied his troops and restored in some degree the honour of his arms The second battle was fought near Fano in Umbria on the spot which five hundred years before had been fatal to the brother of Hannibal 6 Thus far the successful Germans had advanced along the Ã milian and Flaminian way with a design of sacking the un 8 guarded OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 303 guarded mistress of the world But Aurelian who watchful for the safety of Rome still hung on their rear found in this place the decisive moment of giving them a total and irretrievable de feat 57 The flying remnant of their host was exterminated in a third and last battle near Pavia and Italy was delivered from the inroads of the Alemanni Fear has been the original parent of superstition and every new cala Superstitious  r ceremonies mity urges trembling mortals to deprecate the wrath of their invisible enemies Though the best hope of the republic was in the valour and conduct of Aurelian yet such was the public consternation when the barbarians were hourly expected at the gates of Rome that by a decree of the senate the Sibylline books were consulted Even the emperor himself either from a principle of religion or of policy recommended the salutary measure chided the tardiness of the senateand offered to supply whatever expence whatever animals whatsoever captives of any nation the gods mould require Notwithstanding this liberal offer it does not appear that any human victims expiated with their Wood the fins of the Roman people The Sibylline books enjoined ceremonies of a more harm a D 271 less nature processions of priests in white robes attended by a â January u chorus of youths and virgins lustrations of the city and adjacent country and sacrifices whose powerful influence disabled the bar barians from passing the mystic ground on which they had been celebrated However puerile in themselves these superstitious arts were subservient to the success of the war and if in the decisive battle of Fano she Alemanni fancied they saw an army of spectres combating on the side of Aurelian he received a very powerful aid from this imaginary reinforcement39 But whatever confidence might be placed in ideal ramparts the Fortification experience of the past and the dread of the future induced the Â Ro ne Romans to construct fortifications of a grosser and more substantial kind THE DECLINE AND FALL 1dnd The seven hills of Rome had been surrounded by the suc cessors of Romulus with an ancient wall of more than thirteen miles 4 The vast inclosure may seem disproportioned to the strength and numbers of the infant state But it was necessary to secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land against the fre quent and sudden incursions of the tribes of Latium the perpetual enemies of the republic With the progress of Roman greatness the city and its inhabitants gradually increased filled up the vacant space pierced through the useless walls covered the field of Mars and on every fide followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs 4 The extent of the new walls erected by Au relian and finished in the reign of Probus was magnified by popu lar estimation to near fifty 41 but is reduced by accurate measure ment to about twenty one miles 4J It wasa great but a mela ncholy labour since the defence of the capital betrayed the decline of the monarchy The Romans of a more prosperous age who trusted to the arms of the legions the safety of the frontier camps 44 were very far from entertaining a suspicion that it would ever become necessary to fortify the seat of empire against the inroads of the barbarians 4S urdian sup ne victory or Claudius over the Goths and the success of loesses the Aurelian against the Alemanni had

seventh year of his reign became the victim of their disappointed avarice 6 The death of Victorinus his friend and associate was occasioned by a less worthy cause The shining accomplishments 47 of that prince were stained by a licentious passion which he indulged in acts of violence with too little regard to the laws of society or even to those of love 4 He was slain at Cologne by a conspiracy of jealous huf 1 bands whose revenge would have appeared more justifiable had they spared the innocence of his son After the murder of so many valiant princes it is somewhat remarkable that a female for a long time controuled the fierce legions of Gaul and still more singular that she was the mother of the unfortunate Victorinus The arts and treasures of Victoria enabled her successively to place Man us and Tetricus on the throne and to reign with a manly vigour under the name of those dependent emperors Money of copper of silver and of gold was coined in her name she as sumed the titles of Augusta and Mother of the Camps her power ended only with her life but her life was perhaps shortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus 49 When at the instigation of his ambitious patroness Tetricus The

in the beginning of the action The rebel legions though disordered and dismayed by the unexpected trea chery of their chief defended themselves with a desperate valour till they were cut in pieces almost to a man in this bloody and me morable battle which was fought near Chalons in Champagne 5Â The retreat of the irregular auxiliaries Franks and Batavians whom the conqueror compelled or persuaded to repass the Rhine restored the general tranquillity and the power of Aurelian was ac knowledged from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules As early as the reign of Claudius the city of Autun alone and unassisted had ventured to declare against the legions of Gaul After a siege of seven months they stormed and plundered that unfortunate city already wasted by famine s Lyons oh the con trary had resisted with obstinate disaffection the arms of Aurelian We read of the punishment of Lyons but there is not any men tion of the rewards of Autun Such indeed is the policy of civil war severely to remember injuries and to forget the most import ant services Revenge is profitable gratitude is expensive A D 273 Aurelian had no sooner secured the person and provinces of Tetri Zenobfa i Â f cusÂ than he turned his arms against Zenobia the celebrated queen of Palmyra and the East Modern Europe has produced several illustrious women who have sustained with glory the weight of em pire nor is our own age destitute of such distinguished characters But Zenobia is perhaps the only female whose superior genius broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by the cli mate and manners of Asia She claimed her descent from the Macedonian OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Macedonian kings of Egypt equalled in beauty her ancestor Cleo patra and far surpassed that princess in chastity55 and valour Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely as well as the greatest of her sex She was of a dark complexion for in speaking of a lady her beauty 1 x   and learnin these trifles become important Her teeth were of a pearly white ness and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon fire tem pered by the most attractive sweetness Her voice wa3 strong and harmonious Her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study She was not ignorant of the Latin tongue but possessed in equal perfection the Greek the Syriac and the Egyp tian languages She had drawn up for her own use an epitome of oriental history and familiarly compared the beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the sublime Longinus This accomplished woman gave her hand to Odenathus who from her valour a private station raised himself to the dominion of the Eatst She soon became the friend and companion of a hero In the intervals of war Odenathus passionately delighted in the exercise of hunt ing he pursued with ardour the wild beasts of the desert lions panthers and bears and the ardour of Zenobia in that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own She had inured her con stitution to fatigue disdained the use of a covered carriage gene rally appeared on horseback in a military habit and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the troops The suc cess of Odenathus was in a great measure ascribed to her incom parable prudence and fortitude Their splendid victories over the Great King whom they twice pursued as far as the gates of Ctesi phon laid the foundations of their united fame and power The armies which they commanded and the provinces which they had saved acknowledged not any other sovereigns than their invincible chiefs The senate and people of Rome

time to assume the title of Augustus before he was sacrificed by Zenobia to the memory of her husband SS and reigns With the assistance of his most faithful friends she immediately over the East  J and Egypt filled the vacant throne and governed with manly counsels Palmyra Syria and the East above five years By the death of Odenathus that authority was at an end which the senate had granted him only as a personal distinction j but his martial widow disdaining both the senate and Gallienus obliged one of the Roman generals who was sent against her to retreat into Europe with the loss of his army and his reputationS9 Instead of the little passions which so frequently perplex a female reign the steady administration of Zenobia was guided by the most judicious maxims of policy If it was expedient to pardon she covdd calm her resentment if it was necessary topunifh she could im pose silence on the voice of pity Her strict ceconomy was accused of avarice yet on every proper occasion he appeared magnificent and liberal The neighbouring states of Arabia Armenia and Persia dreaded her enmity and solicited her alliance To the do minions OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 309 minions of Odenathus which extended from the Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia his widow added the inheritance of her an cestors the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt The emperor Claudius acknowledged her merit and was content that while he pursued the Gothic war yZ Â should assert the dignity of the empire in the East 6 The conduct however of Zenobia was attended with some ambiguity nor is it unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an independent and hostile monarchy She blended with the popular manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts of Asia and exacted from her subjects the fame adoration that was paid to the successors of Cyrus She bestowed on her three sons 61 a Latin education and often shewed them to the troops adorned with the imperial purple For herself she reserved the diadem with the splendid but doubtful title of Queen of the East When Aurelian passed over into Asia against an adversary whofe sex The expedf alone could render her an object of contempt his presence restored obe ran Â f Aure dience to the province of Bithynia already shaken by the arms and A D intrigues of Zenobia 6 Advancing at the head of his legions he ac cepted the submission of Ancyra and was admitted into Tyana after an obstinate siege by the help of a perfidious citizen The generous though fierce temper of Aurelian abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers a superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the countrymen of Apollonius the philosopherfiJ Antioch was deserted on his approach till the emperor by his salutary edicts recalled the fugitives and granted a general pardon to all who from necessity rather than choice had been engaged in the service of the Palmyrenian queen The unexpected mildness of such a conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians and as far as the gates of Emesa the wishes of the people seconded the terror of his arms6 Zenobia would have ill deserved her reputation had she indo dci i heâ lently permitted the emperor of the West to approach within an sn thebTtties 4 hundred Â eÂ SIO T HE DECLINE AND FALL hundred miles of her capital The fate of the East was decided in two great hattles so similar in almost every circumstance that we can scarcely distinguish them from each other except by observing that the first was fought near Antioch 5 and the second near Emesa6S In both the queen of Palmyra animated the armies by her presence and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdas who had already signalized his military talents by the conquest of Egypt The numerous forces of Zenobia consisted for the most part of light archers and of heavy cavalry clothed in complete steel The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists They fled in real cur affected disorder engaged the Palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit harassed them by a desultory combat and at length dis comfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry The light infantry in the mean time when they had exhausted their quivers remaining without protection against a closer onset exposed their naked sides to the swords of the legions Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops who were usually stationed on the Upper Danube and whose valour had been severely tried in the Alemannic war67 After the defeat of Emesa Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army As far as the frontier of Egypt the nations subject to her empire had joined the standard of the conqueror who detached the bravest of his generals to possess himself of the Egyp tian provinces Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of Ode nathus She retired within the walls of her capital made every preparation for a vigorous resistance and declared with the intrepi dity of a heroine that the last moment of her reign and of her life should be the same The state of Amid the barren deserts of Arabia a few cultivated spots rife like islands out of the sandy ocean Even the name of Tadmor or Palmyra by its signification in the Syriac as well as in the Latin language de noted the multitude of palm trees which afforded shade and verdure to 2 that OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 311 that temperate region The air was pure and the foil watered by some invaluable springs was capable of producing fruits as well as corn A place possessed of such singular advantages and situ ated at a convenient distance 6S between the gulph of Persia and the Mediterranean was soon frequented by the caravans which con veyed to the nations of Europe a considerable part of the rich com modities of India Palmyra insensibly increased into an opulent and independent city and connecting the Roman and the Parthian monarchies by the mutual benefits of commerce was suffered to observe an humble neutrality till at length after the victories of Trajan the little republic funk into the bosom of Rome and flou rished more than one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate though honourable rank of a colony It was during that peaceful period if we may judge from a few remaining inscriptions that the wealthy Palmyrenians constructed those temples palaces and porticos of Grecian architecture whose ruins scattered over an ex tent of several miles have deserved the curiosity of our travellers The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to reflect new splendour on their country and Palmyra for a while stood forth the rival of Rome but the competition was fatal and ages of prospe rity were sacrificed to a moment of glory 6 In his march over the sandy desert between Emesa and Palmyra it is besieged by Aurelian the emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs nor could he always defend his army and especially his baggage from these flying troops which were vexatious only from their minuteness and activity The siege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and important and the emperor who with incessant vigour pressed the attacks in person was himself wounded with a dart  The Roman people says Aurelian in an original letter  speak with contempt of the war which I am waging against a woman They are ignorant both of the character and of the power of Zenobia It is impossible to enumerate THE DECLINE AND FALL nobia and os the city enumerate her warlike preparations of stones of arrows and of every species of missile weapons Every part of the walls is pro  vided with two or three balistte and artificial fires are thrown  from her military engines The fear of punishment has armed her with a desperate courage Yet still I trust in the protecting deities of Rome who have hitherto been favourable to all my undertakings70 Doubtful however of the protection of the gods and of the event of the siege Aurelian judged it more pru dent to offer terms of an advantageous capitulation to the queen a splendid retreat to the citizens their ancient privileges His proposals were obstinately rejected and the refusal was accompanied with insult wko kcÂ mes phe firmnefs of Zenobia was supported by the hope that in a master of Ze rr y r Â very short time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the desert and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the East and particularly the Persian monarch would arm in the defence of their most natural ally But Fortune and the perseverance of Aure lian overcame every obstacle The death of Sapor which hap pened about this time7 distracted the counsels of Persia and the inconsiderable succours that attempted to relieve Palmyra were easily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor From every part of Syria a regular succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp which was increased by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from the conquest of Egypt It was then that Zenobia resolved to fly She mounted the fleetest of her dro medaries 7 and had already reached the banks of the Euphrates about sixty miles from Palmyra when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian s light horse seized and brought back a captive A D 273 to the feet of the emperor Her capital soon afterwards surrendered and was treated with unexpected lenity The arms horses and camels with an immense treasure of gold silver silk and precious stones were all delivered to the conqueror who having only a garrison OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE garrison of six hundred archers returned to Emesa and employed some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments at the end of so memorable a war which restored to the obedience of Rome those provinces that had renounced their allegiance since the cap tivity of Valerian When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aure r of lian he sternly aiked her How he had presumed to rise in arm6 against the emperors of Rome The answer of Zenobia was a pru dent mixture of respect and firmness Because I disdained to con sider as Roman emperors an Aureolus or a Gallienus You alone I ackowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign71 But as female fortitude is commonly artificial so it is seldom steady or con sistent The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial she trembled at the angry clamours of the soldiers who called aloud for her immediate execution forgot the generous despair of Cleopatra which she had proposed as her model and ignominioufly purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her friends It was to their counsels which governed the weakness of her sex that she imputed the guilt of her ob stinate resistance it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the conqueror The fame of Longinus who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear will survive that of the queen who betrayed or the tyrant who condemned him Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered soldier but they had served to elevate and harmonise the soul of Longinus Without uttering a complaint he calmly followed the executioner pitying his unhappy mistress and bestowing comfort on his afHicted friends 7 Returning from the conquest of the East Aurelian had already Rebellion and crossed the Streights which divide Europe from Asia when he was myra provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred the governor and garrison which he had left among them and again erected the standard of revolt Without a moment s deliberation Vol I S f he THE DECLINE AND FALL he once more turned his face towards Syria Antioch was alarmed by his rapid approach and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the irre sistible weight of his resentment We have a letter of Aurelian himself in which he acknowledges that old men women chil dren and peasants had been involved in that dreadful execution which should have been confined to armed rebellion and although his principal concern seems directed to the restoration of a temple of the Sun he discovers some pity for the remnant of the Palmy xenians to whom he grants the permission of rebuilding and inha biting their city But it is easier to destroy than to revive The feat of commerce of arts and of Zenobia gradually funk into an obscure town a trifling fortress and at length a miserable vilfage The present citizens of Palmyra consisting of thirty or forty fami lies have erected their mud cottages within the spacious court of a magnificent temple Aurelian sup Another and a last labour still awaited the indefatigable Aurelian beilion of Fir to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel who during the re auiftio gypt  pajmvra ha j arifen on the banks of the Nile Firmus the friend and ally as he proudly styled himself of Odenathus and Zenobia was no more than a wealthy merchant of Egypt In the course of his trade to India he had formed very intimate connections with the Saracens and the Blemmyes whose situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy introduction into the Upper Egypt The Egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom and at the head of their furious multitude broke into the city of Alexandria where he assumed the imperial purple coined money published edicts and raised an army which as he vainly boasted he was capable of maintaining from the sole profits of his paper trade Such troops were a feeble defence against the approach of Aurelian and it seems almost unnecessary to relate that Firmus was routed taken tortured and put to death Aurelian might now congratulate the senate the people and himself that in little more than OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE than three years he had restored universal peace and order to the Roman world7 S Since the foundation of Rome no general had more nobly deserved A p 274   Triumph o a triumph than Aurelian nor was a triumph ever celebrated with Aureiian superior pride and magnificence11 The pomp was opened by twenty elephants four royal tygers and above two hundred of the most curi ous animals from every climate of the North the East and the South They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre The wealth of Asia the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations and the magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen were disposed in exact symmetry or artful disorder The ambassadors of the most remote parts of the earth of Ã thiopia Arabia Persia Bactriana India and China all remarkable by their rich or singular dresses displayed the fame and power of the Roman emperor who exposed likewise to the public view the presents that he had received and particularly a great number of crowns of gold the offerings of grateful cities The victories of Aurelian were attested by the long train of cap tives who reluctantly attended his triumph Goths Vandals Sar matians Alemanni Franks Gauls Syrians and Egyptians Each people was distinguished by its peculiar inscription and the title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the Gothic na tion who had been taken in arms7 But every eye disregarding the crowd of captives was fixed on the emperor Tetricus and the queen of the East The former as well as his son whom he had created Augustus was dressed in Gallic trowscrs 7 a saffron tunic and a robe of purple The beauteous figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold a slave supported the gold chain which encircled her neck and she almost fainted under the intolerable weight of jewels She preceded on foot the magnificent chariot in which she once hoped to enter the gates of Rome It was followed by two other chariots still more sumptuous of Odenathus and of the S s 2 Persian 3i THE DECLINE AND FALL Persian monarch The triumphal car of Aurelian it had formerly been used by a Gothic king was drawn on this memorable occasion either by four stags or by four elephantst0 The most illustrious of the senate the people and the army closed the solemn procession Un feigned joy wonder and gratitude swelled the acclamations of the multitude but the satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the appearance of Tetricus nor could they suppress a rising murmur that the haughty emperor mould thus expose to public ignominy the person of a Roman and a magistrate His treat But however in the treatment of his unfortunate rivals Aure uicus and lian might indulge his pride he behaved towards them with a ge 1 1 nerous clemency which was seldom exercised by the ancient con querors Princes who without success had defended their throne or freedom were frequently strangled in prison as soon as the tri umphal pomp ascended the capitol These usurpers whom their defeat had convicted of the crime of treason were permitted to spend their lives in affluence and honourable repose The emperor presented Ze nobia with an elegant villa at Tibur or Tivoli about twenty miles from the capital the Syrian queen insensibly sunk into a Roman matron her daughters married into noble families and her race was not yet extinct in the fifth century 8 Tetricus and his son were reinstated in their rank and fortunes They erected on the CÃ lian hill a magnificent palace and as soon as it was finished in vited Aurelian to supper On his entrance he was agreeably sur prised with a picture which represented their singular history They were delineated offering to the emperor a civic crown and the scepter of Gaul and again receiving at bis hands the ornaments of the senatorial dignity The father was afterwards invested with the government of Lucania 8 and Aurelian who soon admit ted the abdicated monarch to his friendship and conversation fami liarly alked him Whether it were not more desirable to administer a province of Italy than to reign beyond the Alps The son long continued  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3 7 continued a respectable member of the senate nor was there any one of the Roman nobility more esteemed by Aurelian as well as by his successors  So long and so various was the pomp of Aurelian s triumph that His magni although it opened with the dawn of day the flow majesty of the devotion procession ascended not the capitol before the ninth hour and it was already dark when the emperor returned to the palace The festival was protracted by theatrical representations the games of the circus the hunting of wild beasts combats of gladiators and naval engagements Liberal donatives were distributed to the army and people and several institutions agreeable or beneficial to the capital contributed to perpetuate the glory of Aurelian A con siderable portion of his oriental spoils was consecrated to the gods of Rome the capitol and every other temple glittered with the offerings of his ostentatious piety and the temple of the Sun alone received above fifteen thousand pounds of gold 8s This last was a magnificent structure erected by the emperor on the side of the Quirinal hill and dedicated soon after the triumph to that deity whom Aurelian adored as the parent of his life and fortunes His mother had been an inferior priestess in a chapel of the Sun a peculiar devotion to the god of Light was a sentiment which the fortunate peasant imbibed in his infancy and every step of his ele vation every victory of his reign fortified superstition by gra titude 86 The arms of Aurelian had vanquistied the foreign and domestic He suppresses 1 Â a sedition a foes of the Republic We are assured that by his salutary rigour Rome crimes and factions mischievous arts and pernicious connivance the luxuriant growth of a feeble and oppressive government were eradicated throughout the Roman world 8 But if we attentively re flect how much swifter is the progress of corruption than its cure and if we remember that the years abandoned to public disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of Aurelian we 6 must THE DECLINE AND FALL must confess that a few short intervals of peace were insufficient for the arduous work of reformation Even his attempt to restore the integrity of the coin was opposed by a formidable insurrection The emperor s vexation breaks out in one of his private letters Surely fays he  the gods have decreed that my life should be a perpetual warfare A sedition within the walls has just now given birth to a very serious civil war The workmen of the mint at the instigation of Felicissimus a stave to whom I had entrusted an employment in the finances have risen in rebellion They are at length suppressed but seven thousand of my soldiers have been flain in the contest of those troops whose ordinary station is in Dacia and the camps along the Danube88 Other writers who confirm the fame fact add likewise that it happened soon after Aurelian s triumph that the decisive engagement was fought on the CÃ lian hill that the workmen of the mint had adulterated the coin and that the emperor restored the public credit by delivering out good money in exchange for the bad which the people was commanded to bring into the treasury Observation We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary upon it  transaction but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form it appears to us inconsistent and incredible The debasement of the coin is indeed well suited to the administration of Gallienus nor is it unlikely that the instruments of the corruption might dread the inflexible justice of Aurelian But the guilt as well as the profit must have been confined to a few nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm a people whom they had injured against a mo narch whom they had betrayed We might naturally expect that such miscreants should have shared the public detestation with the informers and the other ministers of oppression and that the re formation of the coin should have been an action equally popular with the destruction of those obsolete accounts which by the empe ror s order were burnt in the forum of Trajan 9Â In an age when 2 the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 315  the principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood the most desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudi cious means but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support a serious civil war The repeti tion of intolerable taxes imposed either on the land or on the necessaries of life may at last provoke those who will not or who cannot relinquish their country But the case is far otherwise in every operation which by whatsoever expedients restores the just value of money The transient evil is soon obliterated by the per manent benefit the loss is divided among multitudes and if a few wealthy individuals experience a sensible diminution of treasure with their riches they at the fame time lose the importance However Aurelian might chuse to disguise the real cause of the insurrection his reformation of the coin could furnish only a faint pre tence to a party already powerful and discontented Rome though deprived of freedom was distracted by faction The people to wards whom the emperor himserf a plebeian always expressed a peculiar fondness lived in perpetual dissension with the senate the equestrian order and the PrÃ torian guards Nothing less than the firm though secret conspiracy of those orders of the authority of the first the wealth of the second and the arms of the third could have displayed a strength capable of contending in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube which under the conduct of a martial sovereign had atchieved the conquest of the West and of the East Whatever was the cause or the object of this rebellion imputed Cruelty of with so little probability to the workmen of the mint Aurelian used bia victory with unrelenting rigour 9 He was naturally of a severe disposition A peaiant and a soldier his nerves yielded not easily to the impressions of sympathy and he could sustain without emotion the sight of tortures and death Trained from his earliest youth in the exercise of arms he set too siaall a value 00 the life of Aurelian 320 THE DECLINE AND FALL He marches into the East and is assassi nated A D 274 Oaober of a citizen chastised by military execution the flighted offences and transferred the stern discipline of the camp into the civil admi nistration of the laws His love of justice often became a blind and furious passion and whenever he deemed his own or the public safety endangered he disregarded the rules of evidence and the proportion of punishments The unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans rewarded his services exasperated his haughty spirit The noblest families of the capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark conspiracy A hasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody prosecution and it proved fatal to one of the nephews  of the emperor The executioners were fatigued the prisons crowded and the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence of its most illustrious members 9 Nor was the pride of Aurelian less offensive to that assembly than his cruelty Ignorant or impatient of the restraints of civil institutions he disdained to hold his power by any other title than that of the sword and governed by right of conquest an empire which he had saved and subdued 9 It was observed by one of the most sagacious of the Roman princes that the talents of his predecessor Aurelian were better suited to the command of an army than to the government of an empire95 Conscious of the character in which Nature and expe rience had enabled him to excel he again took the field a few months after his triumph It was expedient to exercise the restless temper of the legions in some foreign war and the Persian monarch exulting in the shame of Valerian still braved with impunity the offended majesty of Rome At the head of an army less formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and valour the emperor ad vanced as far as the Streights which divide Europe from Asia He there experienced that the most absolute power is a weak defence a gainst the effects of despair He had threatened one of his secretaries who was accused of extortion and it was known that he seldom threat ened in vain The last hope which remained for the criminal was to OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE to involve some of the principal officers of the army in his danger or at least in his fears Artfully counterfeiting his master s hand he shewed them in a long and bloody list their own names devoted to death Without suspecting or examining the fraud they resolved to secure their lives by the murder of the emperor On his march between Byzantium and Heraclea Aurelian was suddenly attacked by the conspirators whose stations gave them a right to surround his person  and after a short resistance fell by the hand of Mucapor a general whom he had always loved and trusted He died regret A ted by the army detested by the senate but universally acknow ledged as a warlike and fortunate prince the useful

venerable lords and fathers to place him in the number of the 84 gods and to appoint a successor whom your judgment fliall deelape  worthy of the imperial purple None of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our lose shall ever reign over  us  The Roman senators heard without surprise that another emperor had been assassinated in his camp they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian but the modest and dutiful address of the legions when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul diffused the most pleasing astonishment Such honours as fear and perhaps esteem could extort they liberally poured forth on the 4 memory OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 323 memory of their deceased sovereign Such acknowledgments as gratitude could inspire they returned to the faithful armies of the republic who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the senate in the choice of an emperor Yet notwithstanding this flattering appeal the most prudent of the assembly declined ex posing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multi tude The strength of the legions was indeed a pledge of their sincerity  but could it naturally be expected that a hasty repent ance would correct the inveterate habits of fourscore years  Should the soldiers relapse into their accustomed seditions their insolence might disgrace the majesty of the senate and prove fatal to the object of its choice Motives like these dictated a decree by which the election of a new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order    The contention that ensued is one of the best attested but most A D t7y improbable events in the history of mankind  The troops as if AÂ 3fJ satiated with the exercise of power again conjured the senate to in rfSJff1 vest one of its own body with

either party was resolved to receive a master from the hands of the other eight months insensibly elapsed an amazing period of tranquil anarchy during which the Roman world remained without a sovereign without an usurper and with out a sedition The generals and magistrates appointed by Aure lian continued to execute their ordinary functions and it is observed that a proconsul of Asia was the only considerable person removed from his office in the whole course of the interregnum An event somewhat similar but much less authentic is supposed to have happened after the death of Romulus who in his life and character bore some affinity with Aurelian The throne was va cant during twelve months till the election of a Sabine philosopher T t 2 and 324 THE DECLINE AND FALL and the public peace was guarded in the fame manner by the union of the several orders of the state But in the the time of Numa and Ro mulus the arms of the people were controuled by the authority of the Patricians and the balance of freedom was easily preserved in a small and virtuous community  The decline of the Roman state far different from its infancy was attended with every circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the prospect of obedience and harmony an immense and tumultuous capital a wide extent of empire the ser vile equality of despotism an army of four hundred thousand mer cenaries and the experience of frequent revolution Yet notwith standing all these temptations the discipline and memory of Aure lian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders The flower of the legions main tained their station on the banks of the Bosphorus and the imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the pro vinces A generous though transient enthusiasm diffused itself among the military order and we may hope that a few real pa triots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the se nate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to itsi ancient beauty and vigour A TT 17 On the twenty fifth of September near eight months1 after â the The cmis 5 murder of Aurelian the consul convoked an assembly of the senate senate ant rePorte tne doubtful and dangerous situation of the empire â He slightly insinuated that the precarious loyalty of the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour and of every accident but he represented with the most convincing eloquence the various dangers that might attend any farther delay in the choice of an emperor Intelligence he said was already received that the Ger mans had passed the Rhine and occupied some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul The ambition of the Persian king kept the East in perpetual alarms Egypt Africa and lllyricum were exposed to foreign and domestic arms and the levity of Syria 3 would OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE would prefer even a female scepter to the sanctity of the Roman laws The consul then addressing himself to Tacitus the first of the senators  required his opinion on the important subject of a proper candidate for the vacant throne If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness we shall charter of esteem the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of kings Tacitas He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose writ ings will instruct the last generations of mankind 5 The senator Tacitus was then seventy five years of age 6 The long period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honours He had twice been invested with the consular dignity 7 and enjoyed his am ple patrimony of between two and three millions sterling with ele gance and sobriety 8 The experience of so many princes whom he had esteemed or endured from the vain follies of Elagabalus to the useful rigour of Aurelian taught him to form a just estimate of the duties the dangers and the temptations of their sublime station From the assiduous study of his immortal ancestor he derived the knowledge of the Roman constitution and of human nature The voice of the people had already named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire The ungrateful rumour reached his ears and induced him to seek the retirement of one of his villas in Campania He had pasted two months in the delightful privacy of FaiÃ when he reluctantly obeyed the summons of the consul to resume his honourable place in the senate and to assist the republic with his counsels on this important occasion He arose to speak when from every quarter of the house he was He is elected saluted with the names of Augustus and emperor  Tacitus Au empcr0rÂ gustus the gods preserve thee we chuse thee for our sovereign  â Mto thy care we entrust the republic and the world Accept the  empire from the authority of the senate It is due to thy rank â to thy conduct to thy manners As soon as the tumult of ac clamations subsided Tacitus attempted to decline the dangerous honour 326 THE DECLINE AND FALL honour and to express his wonder that they should elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigour of Aurelian Are these limbs conscript fathers fitted to sustain the weight of ar mour or to practise the exercises of the camp The variety of climates and the hardships of a military life would soon op  press a feeble constitution which subsists only by the most tender management My exhausted strength scarcely enables me to discharge the duty of a senator how insufficient would it prove  to the arduous labours of war and government Can you fup pose that the legions will respect a weak old man whose days  have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement Can u you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favourable opinion of the senate 10 and accepts The reluctance of Tacitus and it might possibly be sincere was the purple t er encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate Five hun dred voices repeated at once in eloquent confusion that the greases of the Roman princes Numa Trajan Hadrian and the Antonines had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of life that the mind not the body a sovereign not a soldier was the object of their choice and that they expected from him no more than to guide by his wisdom the valour of the legions These presling though tumultuary instances were seconded by a more regular oration of Metius Falconius the next on the consular bench to Tacitus himself He reminded the assembly of the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and capricious youths congratulated them on the election of a virtuous and ex perienced senator and with a manly though perhaps a selfish freedom exhorted Tacitus to remember the reasons of his elevation and to seek a successor not in his own family but in the republic The speech of Falconius was enforced by a general acclamation The emperor elect submitted to the authority of his country and received the voluntary homage of his equals The judgment of the senate OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 327 s senate was confirmed by the consent of the Roman people and of the PrÃ torian guards  The administration of Tacitus was not unworthy of his life and Authority of principles A grateful servant of the senate he considered that na tional council as the author and himself as the subject of the laws He studied to heal the wounds which imperial pride civil discord and military violence had inflicted on the constitution and to restore at least the image of the ancient republic as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus and the virtues of Trajan and the Antonines It may not be useless to recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus  1 To invest one of their body under the title of emperor with the general command of the armies and the government of the frontier provinces 2 To determine the list or as it was then styled the College of Consuls They were twelve in number who in successive pairs each during the space of two months filled the year and represented the dignity of that ancient office The authority of the senate in the nomination of them was exercised with such independent freedom that no regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor in favour of his brother Florianus The senate exclaimed Tacitus with the honest transport of a patriot  understand the character of the prince  whom they have chosen 3 To appoint the proconsuls and pre sidents of the provinces and to confer on all the magistrates their civil jurisdiction 4 To receive appeals through the intermediate office of the prÃ fect of the city from all the tribunals of the empire 5 To give force and validity by their decrees to such as they should approve of the emperor s edicts 6 To these several branches of authority we may add some inspection over the finances since even in the stern reign of Aurelian it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue from the public service I Circular 328 THE DECLINE AND FALL confidence8 1 Circular epistles were sent without delay to all the principal â cities of the empire Treves Milan Aquileia Thessalonica Corinth Athens Antioch Alexandria and Carthage to claim their obe dience and to inform them of the happy revolution which had restored the Roman senate to its ancient dignity Two of these epistles are still extant We likewise possess two very singular frag ments of the private correspondence of the senators on this oc casion They discover the most excessive joy and the most un bounded hopes Cast away your

too we may restrain themâ to the wife a word is suffi  cient These lofty expectations were however soon dis appointed nor indeed was it possible that the armies and the provinces should long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome On the flightest touch the unsupported fabric of their pride and power fell to the ground The expiring senate displayed a sudden lustre blazed for a moment and was extinguished for ever A D 276 All that had yet passed at Rome was no more than a theatrical Tacius is ac knowledged representation unless it was ratified by the more substantial power by the army   legions Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream of free dom and ambition Tacitus proceeded to the Thracian camp and was there by the PrÃ torian prÃ fect presented to the assembled troops as the prince whom they themselves had demanded and whom the senate had bestowed As soon as the prÃ fect was silent the em peror addressed himself to the soldiers with eloquence and propriety He OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 32 He gratified their avarice by a liberal distribution of treasure under the names of pay and donative He engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration that although his age might disable him from the performance of military exploits his counsels mould never be unworthy of a Roman general the successor of the brave Au relian 6 Whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a fe TheAlaniio cond expedition into the east he had negociated with the Alani and are re a Scythian people who pitched their tents in the neighbourhood of Tachas 7 the lake Mceotis Those barbarians allured by presents and sub sidies had promised to invade Persia with a numerous body of light cavalry They were faithful to their engagements but when they arrived on the Roman frontier Aurelian was already dead the design of the Persian war was at least suspended and the generals who during the interregnum exercised a doubtful authority were unpre pared either to receive or to oppose them Provoked by such treat ment which they considered as trifling and perfidious the Alani had recourse to their own valour for their payment and revenge and as they moved with the usual swiftness of Tartars they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of Pontus Cappadocia Cilicia and Galatia The legions who from the opposite shores of the Bosphorus could almost distinguish the flames of the cities and villages impa tiently urged their general to lead them against the invaders The conduct of Tacitus was suitable to his age and station He convinced the barbarians of the faith as well as of the power of the empire Great numbers of the Alani appeased by the punctual discharge of the engagements which Aurelian had contracted with them relin quished their booty and captives and quietly retreated to their own deserts beyond the Phasis Against the remainder who refused peace the Roman emperor waged in person a successful war Seconded by an army of brave and experienced veterans in a few weeks he de Vol I U u livered THE EECilNE AND TALL emperor Tacitus Mveretl the provinces of Asia from the terror of the Scythian wr vafion  Beatlvof the But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short duration Trans ported in the depth of winter front the soft retirement of Cam pania to the foot of mount Caucasus he funk under the unaccus tomed hardships of a military life The fatigues of the body were aggravated by those of the mind For a while the angry and selfish paffiohs of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthusiasm of public virtue They soon broke out with redoubled violence and raged in the camp and even in the tent of the aged emperor Htfc  mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt and he was incessantly tormented by factions which he couki not aflvvage and by demands which it was impossible to satisfy Whatever flat tering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public disorders Tacitus soon was convinced that the licentiousness of the army disdained the feeble restraint of laws and his last hour was hastened by anguisti and disappointment It may be doubtful whether the soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this inno cent pftBce s It is certain that their insolence was the cause of his death He expired at Tyane in Cappadocia after a reign of onlyv six months and about twenty days 9 The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed before his brother Florianus shewed himself unworthy to reign by the hasty usurpation of the purple without expecting the approbation of the senate The reverence for the Roman constitution which yet influenced the camp and the provinces was sufficiently strong to dispose them to censure but not to provoke them to oppose the precipitate am bition of Florianus The discontent would have evaporated

defended Tarsus opened its gates and the soldiers of J k r xianus when they had permitted him to enjoy the imperial title about three months delivered the empire from civil war by the JÂ ly easy sacrifice of a peince whom they despised l0 The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfectly erazed Their family every notion of hereditary right that the family of an unfortunate scurfr 0t emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his successors The children of Taoitus and Elorianus were permitted to descend into a private station and to mingle with the general mass of the people Their poverty indeed became an additional safeguard to their innocence When Tacitus was elected by the senate he resigned his ample patrimony to the public service an act of ge nerosity specious in appearance but which evidently disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his dependents The only consolation of their fallen state was the remembrance of transient greatness and a distant hope the child of a flattering prophecy that at the end of a thousand years a monarch of the race of Tacitus mould arise the protector of the senate the restorer of Rome and the conqueror of the whole earth The peasants of Illyricum who had already given Claudius and Cna raster a nl    elevation of Aurelian to the sinking empire bad an equal right to glory in the themperje

a near relation of Vale rian and deserved to receive from the emperor s hand the collars bracelets spears and banners the mural and the civic crown and all the honourable rewards reserved by ancient Rome for successful valour The third and afterwards the tenth legion were entrusted to the command of Probus who in every step of his promotion shewed himself superior to the station which he filled Africa and Pontus the Rhine the Danube the Euphrates and the Nile by turns afforded him the most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and military knowledge Aurelian was indebted to him for the conquest of Egypt and still more indebted for the honest courage with which he often checked the cruelty of his master Tacitus who desired by the abilities of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military ta lents named him commander in chief of all the eastern provinces with five times the usual salary the promise of the consulsliip and the hope of a triumph When Probus ascended the imperial throne he was about forty four years of age 1 in the full possession of his fame of the love of the army and of a mature vigour of mind and body His acknowledged merit and the success of his arms against Florianus left him without an enemy or a competitor Yet if we may credit his own professions very far from being desirous of the empire he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance But  it is no longer in my power fays Probus in a private letter to lay down a title so full of envy and of danger I must con tinue to personate the character which the soldiers have imposed 14 upon me V His dutiful address to the senate displayed the sentiments or at least the language of a Roman patriot When Â you elected one of your order conscript fathers to succeed the â emperor Aurelian you acted in a manner suitable to your justice  and wisdom For you are the legal sovereigns of the world M and 8 OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 333 cc August 3 and the power which you derive from your ancestors will de  scend to your posterity Happy would it have been if Flori anus instead of usurping the purple of his brother like a pri vate inheritance had expected what your majesty might deter mine either in his favour or in that of any other person The  prudent soldiers have punislied his rashness To me they have offered the title of Augustus But I submit to your clemency my pretensions and my merits 6 When this respectful epistle was A D 276 read by the consul the senators were unable to disguise their satis faction that Probus should condescend thus humbly to solicit a scepter which he already possessed They celebrated with the warmest gratitude his virtues his exploits and above all his mode ration A decree immediately passed without a dissenting voice to gratify the election of the eastern armies and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the imperial dignity the names of Caesar and Augustus the title of Father of his country the right of making in the fame day three motions in the senate t7 the office of Pontifex Maximus the tribunitian power and the proconsular command a mode of investiture which though it seemed to mul tiply the authority of the emperor expressed the constitution of the ancient republic The reign of Probus corresponded with this fair beginning The senate was permitted to direct the civil admini stration of the empire Their faithful general asserted the honour of the Roman arms and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric trophies the fruits of his numerous victories 1V Yet whilst he gratified their vanity he must secretly have despised their indolence and weakness Though it was every moment in their power to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus the proud succes sors of the Scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclusion from all military employments They soon experienced that those who re fuse the sword must renounce the scepter  The 334 THE DECLINE AND FALX Viaories of she strength of Aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies Piobus over thebarba of Rome After his death they seemed to revive and even to mul tiply They were again vanquished by the active vigour of Probus who in a short reign of about six years 9 equalled the fame of ancient heroes and restored peace and order to every province of the Roman world The dangerous frontier of Rhqctia he so firmly secured that he left it without the suspicion of an enemy He broke the wandering power of the Sarmatian tribes and by the ter ror of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquish their spoil The Gothic nation courted the alliance of so warlike an emperor 5Â He attacked the Isaurians in their mountains4 besieged and took several of their strongest castles and flattered himself that he had for ever suppressed a domestic foe whose independence so deeply wounded the majesty of the empire The troubles excited by the usurper Firmus in the Upper Egypt had never been perfectly ap peased and the cities of Ptolemais and Coptos fortified by the alliance of the Blemmyes still maintained an obscure rebellion The chastisement of those cities and of their auxiliaries the savages of the South is said to have alarmed the court of Persia and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of Probus Most of the exploits whioh distinguished his reign were atchieved by the per sonal valour and conduct of the emperor insomuch that the writer of his life expresses some amazement how in so short a time a single man could be present in so many distant wars The remain ing actions he entrusted to the care of his lieutenants the judicious choice of whom forms no inconsiderable part of his glory Carus Dioclcsian Maximian Constantius Galerius Asclepiodatus Anni balianus and a crowd of other chiefs who afterwards ascended or supported the throne were trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus 35 A D 2 7 But the most important service which Probus rendered to the re lulseoÃ ihe Pu ucj was tne deliverance of Gaul and the recovery of seventy flourishing OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE flourishing cities oppressed by the barbarians of Germa ny who si nce the death of Aurelian had ravaged that great province with impunity 3 Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders we may distinguish with some degree of clearness three great armies or rather nations successively vanquished by the valour of Probus He drove back the Franks into their morasses a descriptive cir cumstance from whence we may infer that the confederacy known by the manly appellation of Free already occupied the flat maritime country intersected and almost overflown1 by the stagnating water of the Rhine and that several tribes of the Frisians and Batavians had acceded to their alliance He vanquished the Burgundians a considerable people of the Vandalic race They had wandered in quest of booty from the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine They esteemed themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase by the restitution of all their booty the permission of an undisturbed retreat They attempted to elude that article of the treaty Their punish ment was immediate and terrible 5 But of all the invaders of Gaul Â the most formidable were the Lygians a distant people who reigned â over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and Silesia In theLygian nation the Arii held the first rank by their numbers and fierceness The Arii it is thus that they are described by the  energy of Tacitus study to improve by art and circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism Their shields are black their  bodies are painted black They chuse for the combat the darkest hour of the night Their host advances covered as it were with a funereal shade 57 nor do they often find an enemy capable of  sustaining so strange and infernal an aspect Of all our senses 44 the eyes are the first vanquished in battle Yet the arms and discipline of the Remans easily discomfited these horrid phan  toms The Tygii were defeated in a general engagement and SemnO  the most renowned of their chiefs fell alive into the hands of Probus That prudent emperor unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair granted 336 THE DECLINE AND FALL i granted them an honourable capitulation and permitted them to return in safety to their native country But the losses which they suffered in the march the battle and the retreat broke the power of the nation nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history either of Germany or of the empire The deliverance of Gaul is reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the in vaders a work of labour to the Romans and of expence to the emperor who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barba rian 9 But as the fame of warriors is built on the destruction of human kind we may naturally suspect that the sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of Probus and carries Since the expedition of Maximin the Roman generals had con Gcrmany nt0 fined their ambition to a defensive war against the nations of Ger many who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire The more daring Probus pursued his Gallic victories passed the Rhine and displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the Necker He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the minds of the barbarians to peace unless they experienced in their own country the calamities of war Germany exhausted by the ill success of the last emigration was astonished by his presence Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his camp and fell prostrate at his feet Such a treaty was humbly received by the Germans as it pleased the conqueror to dictate He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces and obliged their own magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to detain any part of the spoil A considerable tribute of corn cattle and horses the only wealth of barbarians was reserved for the use of the garrisons which Probus established on the limits of their territory He even entertained some thoughts of compelling the Germans to relinquish she exercise of arms and to trust their differences to the justice their OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 337 their safety to the power of Rome To accomplish these salutary ends the constant residence of an imperial governor supported by a numerous army was indispensably requisite Probus therefore judged it more expedient to defer the execution of so great a de sign which was indeed rather of specious than solid utility 40 Had Germany been reduced into the state of a province the Romans with immense labour and expence would have acquired only a more extensive boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians of Scythia Instead of reducing the warlike natives of Germany to the con He builds a  e _   _   wall from thi dition or lubjects Probus contented himself with the humble ex Rhine to the pedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads The country Danube which now forms the circle of Swabia had been left desert in the age of Augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants  The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the ad jacent provinces of Gaul Crowds of adventurers of a roving tem per and of desperate fortunes occupied the doubtful possession and acknowledged by the payment of tythes the majesty of the em pire  To protect these new subjects a line of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the Rhine to the Danube About the reign of Hadrian when that mode of defence began to be practised these garrisons were connected and covered by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades In the place of so rude a bulwark the emperor Probus constructed a stone wall of a considerable height and strengthened it by towers at convenient distances From the neighbourhood of Newstadt and Ratifbon on the Danube it stretched across hills vallies rivers and morasses as far as Wimpfen on the Necker and at length terminated on the banks of the Rhine after a wind ing course of near two hundred miles J This important barrier uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of Europe seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbarians and particularly the Alemanni could penetrate with the greatest faci  Vol I X x lity 33Â THE DECLINE AND FALL lity into the heart of the empire But the experience of the world from China to Britain has exposed the rain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country  An active enemy who can select and vary his points of attack must in the end discover some feeble spot or some unguarded moment The strength as well as the at tention of the defenders is divided and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest troops that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly deserted The fate of the wall which Probus erected may confirm the general observation Within a few years after his death it was overthrown by the Alemanni Its scattered ruins universally ascribed to the power of the DÃ mon now serve only to excite the wonder of the Swabian peasant Jntroduaion Among the useful conditions of peace imposed by Probus on the oflhe baâ Wt vanquished nations of Germany was the obligation of supplying barUM the Roman army with sixteen thousand recruit the bravest and most robust of their youth The emperor dispersed them through all the provinces and distributed this dangerous reinforcement in inall bands of fifty or sixty each among the national troops judiciously observing that the aid which the republic derived from the barbarians slvould be felt but not seen Their aid was now become necefiary The feeble elegance of Italy and the internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms The hardy frontier of the Rhine and Danube still produced minds and bodies equal to the labours of the camp but a perpetual series of wars had gradually diminimed their numbers The infrequency of marriage and the ruin of agriculture affected the principles of population and not only destroyed the strength of the present but intercepted the hope of future generations The wisdom of Probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of replenifliing the exhausted frontiers by new co lonies of captive or fugitive barbarians on whom he bestowed lands cattle instruments of husbandry and every encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of 6 the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 333 the republic Into Britain and most probably into Cambridge shire 46 he transported a considerable body of Vandals The im possibility of an escape reconciled them to their situation and in the subsequent troubles of that island they approved themselves the most faithful servants of the state  Great numbers of Franks and Gepidse were settled on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine An hundred thousand BastarnÃ expelled from their own country cheerfully accepted an establishment in Thrace and sooa imbibed the manners and sentiments of Roman subjects 8 But the expectations of Probus were too often disappointed The impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill brook the flow labours of agriculture Their unconquerable love of freedom rising against despotism provoked them into hasty rebellions alike fatal to themselves and to the provinces 49 nor could these artificial supplies however repeated by succeeding emperors restore the im portant limit of Gaul and Illyricum to its ancient and native vigour Of all the barbarians who abandoned their new settlements and Dar g enter prise of the disturbed the public tranquillity a very small number returned to their Franks own country For a short season they might wander in arms through the empire but in the end they were surely destroyed by the power of a warlike empercr The successful rashness of a party of Franks was attended with such memorable consequences that it ought not to be passed unnoticed They had been established by Probus on the sea coast of Pontus with a view of strengthening that frontier against the inroads of the Alani A fleet stationed in one of the harbours of the Euxine fell into the hands of the Franks and they resolved through unknown seas to explore their way from the mouth of the Phasis to that of the Rhine They easily escaped through the Bosphorus and the Hellespont and cruizing along the Mediterranean indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder by frequent descents on the unsuspecting shores of Asia Greece and X x 2 Africa 34Â THE DECLINE AND FALL Africa The opulent city of Syracuse in whose port the navies of Athens and Carthage had formerly been funk was sacked by a handful of barbarians who massacred the greatest part of the trembling inhabitants From the island of Sicily the Franks pro ceeded to the columns of Hercules trusted themselves to the ocean coasted round Spain and Gaul and steering their triumphant course through the British channel at length finished their surprising voyage by landing in safety on the Batavian or Frisian shores 5Â The example of their success instructing their countrymen to con ceive the advantages and to despise the dangers of the sea pointed out to their enterprising spirit a new road to wealth and glory Revolt of Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus it was almost Saturninus in    ihe E ft impossible that he could at once contain in obedience every part or his wide extended dominions Hie barbarians who broke their chains had seized the favourable opportunity of a domestic war When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul he devolved the com mand of the East on Saturninus That general a man of merit and experience Was driven into rebellion by the absence of his so vereign the levity of the Alexandrian people the pressing in â stances of his friends and his own fears but from the moment of his elevation he never entertained a hope of empire or even of life Alas he said the republic has lost a useful servant and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the services of many  years You know not continued he the misery of sovereign power a sword is perpetually suspended over our head We â dread our very guards we distrust our companions The choice of action or of repose is no longer in our disposition nor is there any age or character or conduct that can protect us from the cen iU sure of envy In thus exalting me to the throne you have doomed me to a life of cares and to an untimely fate The only consolation which remains is the assurance that I shall not fall  alone V But as the former part of his prediction was verified O F THE ROMAN EMPIRE by the victory so the latter was disappointed by the clemency of Probus That amiable prince attempted even to save the un happy Saturninus from the fury of the soldiers He had more than once solicited the usurper himself to place some confidence in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his character that A D 27 he had punished as a malicious informer the first who related the improbable news of his defection  Saturninus might perhaps have embraced the generous offer had he not been restrained by the obstinate distrust of his adherents Their guilt was deeper and their hopes more sanguine than those of their experienced leader The revolt of Saturninus was scarcely extinguished in the East A d 280  r  of Bonosus before new troubles were excited in the West by the rebellion andProcuius of Bonosus and Proculus in Gaul The most distinguished merit of those two officers was their respective prowess of the one in the combats of Bacchus of the other in those of Venus â yet neither of them were destitute of courage and capacity and both sustained with honour the august character which the fear of punishment had engaged them to assume till they sunk at length beneath the superior genius of Probus He used the victory with his accus tomed moderation and spared the fortunes as well as the lives of their innocent families 5V The arms of Probus had now suppressed all the foreign and do A D 281      Triumph of mestic enemies of the state His mild but steady administration the emperor confirmed the re establishment of the public tranquillity nor was there left in the provinces a hostile barbarian a tyrant or even a robber to revive the memory of past disorders It was time that the emperor should revisit Rome and celebrate his own glory and the general happiness The triumph due to the valour of Probus was conducted with a magnificence suitable to his fortune and the people who had so lately admired the trophies of Aurelian gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic successor 5S We caniiott na this occasion forget the desperate courage of about fourscore GladiatorsÂ 342 THE DEGLINE AND FALt Gladiators reserved with nea si hundred others for she inhuman sports of the amphitheatre Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace they killed their keepers broke from the place of their confinement and filled the streets of Rome With blood and confusion After an obstinate resistance they Were over powered and cut in pieces by the regular forces but they obtained at least an honourable death and the satisfaction of  just re venge 56 Hisdiseiplinc The military discipline which reigned in the camps of Probus was less cruel than that of Aurelian but it was equally rigid and exact The latter punished the irregularities of the soldiers With unrelenting severity the former prevented them by employing the legions iri constant and useful labours When Probus commanded in Egypt he executed many considerable Works for the splendor and benefit of that rich country The navigation of the Nile so important to Rome itself was improved j and temples bridges porticoes asld palaces were constructed by the hands of the soldiers who acted by turns as architects as engineers and as husbandnteri It was reported of Hannibal that in order to pie serve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness he had obliged them to form large plantations of olive trees along the cOast of Africa s8 Frdm a similar principle Probus efcercised his legions in covering with rich vineyards the hills of Gaul and Pahnbhiaj and two considerable spots are described Whieh were entirely dbg and planted by military labour One of these known under the name of Mount Alma was situated neat Sifmium the country where Probus was torn for which he ever retained a partial affection arid  whose gratitude he endeavoured to secure by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract of marshy ground An army thus employed constituted perhaps the most use ful as well as the bravest portion Of Romatt subjects But OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 343 But in the prosecution of a favourite scheme the best of men satis His death fied with the rectitude of their intentions are subject to forget the bounds of moderation j nor did Probus himself sufficiently consult the patience and disposition of his fierce legionaries 6o The dangers of the military profession seem only to be compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness but if the duties of the soldier are in cessantly aggravated by the labours of the peasant he will at last sink under the intolerable burden or shake it off with indignation The imprudence of Probus is said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops More attentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army he expressed the vain hope that by the establishment of universal peace he ihould soon abolish the necessity of a standing and mercenary force 61 The unguarded expression proved fatal to him In one of the hottest days of summer aÂ he severely urged the unwholesome labour of draining the marches of Sirmium the soldiers impatient of fatigue on a sudden threw down their tools grasped their arms and broke out into a furious mutiny The emperor conscious of his danger took refuge in a lofty tower constructed for the purpose of surveying the progress of the work 6z The tower was instantly forced and a thousand A v tSg swords were plunged at once in the bosom Â f tJie unfortunate August Probus The rage of the troops subsided as seon as it had been gratified They then lamented their fatal rashness forgot the se verity of the emperor whom they had massacred and hastened to perpetuate by an honourable monument the memory of his vir tues and victories 6 When the legions had indulged their grief and repentance for Eleaion and the death of Probus their unanimous consent declared Carus his caTus Â f PrÃ torian prefect the most deserviug of the imperial throne Every circumstance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature He gloried in the title of Roman Citizen and affected to compare the purity of his blood with the foreign and 344 THE DECLINE AND FALL and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors yet the most inquisitive of his contemporaries very far from admitting his claim have variously deduced his own birth or that of his parents from Ulyricumj from Gaul or from Africa 6 Though a soldier he had received a learned education though a senator he was invested with the first dignity of the army and in an age when the civil and military professions began to be irrecoverably separated from each other they were united in the person of Carus Notwith standing the severe justice which he exercised against the assassins of Probus to whose favour and esteem he was highly indebted he could not escape the suspicion of being accessary to a deed from whence he derived the principal advantage He enjoyed at least before his elevation an acknowledged character of virtue and abilities65 but his austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and cruelty and the imperfect writers of his life al most hesitate whether they shall not rank him in the number of Roman tyrants 66 When Carus assumed the purple he was about sixty years of age and his two sons Carinus and Numerian had al ready attained the season of manhood 7 â The semi The authority of the senate expired with Probus nor was the senate and repentance of the soldiers displayed by the same dutiful regard for people the ciyil power which they had testified after the unfortunate death of Aurelian The election of Carus was decided without expecting the approbation of the senate and the new emperor contented him self with announcing in a cold and stately epistle that he had ascended the vacant throne 6 A behaviour so very opposite to that of his amiable predecessor afforded no favourable presage of the new reign and the Romans deprived of power and freedom asserted their privilege of licentious murmurs 6s The voice of congratula tion and flattery was not however silent and we may still peruse with pleasure and contempt an eclogue which was composed on the accession of the emperor Carus Two shepherds avoiding the noon tide OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 345 noontide heat retire into the cave of Faunus On a spreading beech they discover some recent characters The rural deity had described in prophetic verses the felicity promised to the empire under the reign of so great a prince Faunus hails the approach of that hero who receiving on his moulders the sinking weight of the Roman world shall extinguish war and faction and once again restore the innocence and security of the golden age 7Â It is more than probable that these elegant trifles never reached Cams defeati the ears of a Veteran general who with the consent of the legions j 3â was preparing to execute the long suspended design of the Persian jj Eart war Before his departure for this distant expedition Carus con ferred on his two sons Carinus and Numerian the title of CÃ sar and investing the former with almost an equal share of the im perial power directed the young prince first to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul and afterwards to fix the feat of his residence at Rome and to assume the government of the western provinces 7 The safety of Illyricum was confirmed by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians sixteen thousand of those barbarians remained on the field of battle and the number of captives amounted to twenty thousand The old emperor animated with the fame and prospect of victory pursued his march in the midst of winter through the countries of Thrace and Asia Minor and at length with his younger son Numerian arrived on the confines of the Persian mo narchy There encamping on the summit of a lofty mountain he pointed out to his troops the opulence and luxury of the enemy whom they were about to invade The successor of Artaxerxes Varanes or Bahram though he had A d 283 subdued the Segestans one of the most warlike nations of Upper dience the P C Asia  was alarmed at the approach of the Romans and endea basladors 1 voured to retard their progress by a negociation of peace His ambassadors entered the camp about sunset at the time when the troops were satisfying their hunger with a frugal repast The Vol I Y y Persians 34 THE DECLINE AND FALL His victories and extraor dinary death A D 283 December 25 Persians expressed their desire of being introduced to the presence of the Roman emperor They were at last conducted to a soldier who was seated on the grass A piece of stale bacon and a few old pease com posed his supper A coarse woollen garment of purple was the only circumstance that announced his dignity The conference was con ducted with the fame disregard of courtly elegance Carus taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness assured the ambassadors that unless their master acknowledged the superiority of Rome he would speedily render Persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair 11 Notwithstanding some traces of art and prepa ration we may discover in this scene the manners of Carus and the severe simplicity which the martial princes who succeeded Gallienus had already restored in the Roman camps The ministers of the great king trembled and retired The threats of Carus were not without effect He ravaged Mesopotamia cut in pieces whatever opposed his passage made himself master of the great cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon which seem to have surrendered without resistance and carried his vic torious arms beyond the Tigris 74 He had seized the favourable moment for an invasion The Persian councils were distracted by domestic factions and the greater part of their forces were detained on the frontiers of India Rome and the East received with transport the news of such important advantages Flattery and hope painted in the most lively colours the fall of Persia the conquest of Arabia the submission of Egypt and a lasting deliverance from the inroads of the Scythian nations 7S But the reign of Carus was destined to expose the vanity of predictions They were scarcely uttered before they were contradicted by his death an event attended with such ambiguous circumstances that it may best be related in a letter from his own secretary to the praefect of the city Carus fays he our dearest emperor was confined by sickness to his bed when a furious tempest arose in the camp The darkness which overspread Â â OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 347 and Nume rian overspread the sky was so thick that we could no longer dis tinguish each other and the incessant flashes of lightning took from us the knowledge of all that passed in the general confusion  Immediately after the most violent clap of thunder we heard a sudden cry that the emperor was dead and it soon appeared that his chamberlains in a rage of grief had set fire to the royal pavillion a circumstance which gave rife to the report that Carus was killed by lightning But as far as we have been able to w investigate the truth his death was the natural effect of his disorder76 The vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance He s succeed The ambition of the aspiring generals was checked by their mu sons Carina tual fears and young Numerian with his absent brother Carinus were unanimously acknowledged as Roman emperors The public expected that the successor of Carus would pursue his father s foot steps and without allowing the Persians to recover from their con sternation would advance sword in hand to the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana 11 But the legions however strong in numbers and dis cipline were dismayed by the most abject superstition Notwith standing all the arts that were practised to disguise the manner of the late emperor s death it was found impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude and the power of opinion is irresistible Places or persons struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror as singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven 78 An oracle was remembered which marked the river Tigris as the fatal boundary of the Roman arms The troops terrified with the fate of Carus and with their own danger called aloud on young Numerian to obey the will of the gods and to lead them away from this inauspicious scene of war The feeble emperor was un able to subdue their obstinate prejudice and the Persians wondered at the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy 7 The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the late emperor was A D 284 soon carried from the frontiers of Persia to Rome and the senate Y y 2  as Vices of Ca rinus THE DECLINE AND FALL as well as the provinces congratulated the accession of the sons of Carus These fortunate youths were strangers however to that con scious superiority either of birth or of merit which can alone render the possession of a throne easy and as it were natural Born and edu cated in a private station the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of princes and hie death which happened about sixteen months afterwards left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire To sustain with temper this rapid elevation an uncommon share of virtue and prudence was requisite and Carinus the elder of the brothers was more than commonly deficient in those qua lities In the Gallic war he discovered some degree of personal courage 80 but from the moment of His arrival at Rome he aban doned himself to the luxury of the capital and to the abuse of his fortune He was soft yet cruel devoted to pleasure but destitute of taste and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity indifferent to the public esteem In the course of a few months he successively married and divorced nine wives most of whom he left pregnant and notwithstanding this legal inconstancy found time to indulge such a variety of irregular appetites as brought dishonour on himself and on the noblest houses of Rome He beheld with inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former obscurity or censure his present conduct He banished or put to death the friends and coun sellors whom his father had placed about him to guide his inexpe rienced youth and he persecuted with the meanest revenge his school fellows and companions who had not sufficiently respected the future majesty of the emperor With the senators Carinus affected a lofty and regal demeanour frequently declaring that he designed to distri bute their estates among the populace of Rome From the dregs of that populace he selected his favourites and even his ministers The palace and even the imperial table was filled with lingers dancers prostitutes and all the various retinue of vice and folly One of his door keepers81 he entrusted with the government of the city In the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the room of the prÃ torian praefect whom he put to death Carinus substituted one of the ministers of his looser pleasures Another who possessed the fame or even a more infamous title to favour was invested with the consulship A confidential secretary who had a6 Â quired uncommon skill in the art of forgery delivered the indolent emperor with his own consent from the irksome duty of signing his name When the emperor Carus undertook the Persian war he was in duced by motives of affection as well as policy to secure the sot  tunes of his family by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the armies and provinces of the West The intelligence which he soon received of the conduct of Carinus filled him with shame and re gret nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the republic by a severe act of justice and of adopting in the place of an un worthy son the brave and virtuous Constantius who at that time was governor of Dalmatia But the elevation of Constantius was for a while deferred and as soon as a father s death had released Carinus from the controul of fear or decency he displayed to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian 8 The only merit of the administration of Carinus that history He celebrates  ii i r i i â i he Roman could record or poetry celebrate was the uncommon lplendor with games which in his own and his brother s name he exhibited the Roman games of the theatre the circus and the amphitheatre More than twenty years afterwards when the courtiers of Diocletian repre sented to their frugal sovereign the fame and popularity of his mu nificent predecessor he acknowledged that the reign of Carinus had indeed been a reign of pleasure 8 But this vain prodigality which the prudence of Diocletian might justly despise was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the Roman people The oldest of the citizens recollecting the spectacles of former days the trium phal pomp of Probus or Aurelian and the secular games of the em peror S5Â THE DECLINE AND FALL peror Philip acknowledged that they were all surpassed by the su perior magnificence of Carinus 8 Spectacles of The spectacles of Carinus may therefore be best illustrated by the 1 nu observation of some particulars which history has condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors If we confine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of the execution we are obliged to confess that neither before nor since the time of the Romans so much art and expence have ever been lavished for the amuse ment of the people8J By the order of Probus a great quantity of large trees torn up by the roots were transplanted into the midst of the circus The spacious and shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches a thousand stags a thousand fallow deer and a thousand wild boars and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude The tragedy of the suc ceeding day consisted in the massacre of an hundred lions an equal number of lionesses two hundred leopards and three hundred bears8S The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his triumph and which his successor exhibited in the secular games was less remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and varie gated beauty to the eyes of the Roman people s Ten elks and as many camelopards the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander over the plains of Sarmatia and Ã thiopia were contrasted with thirty African hyÃ nas and ten Indian tygers the most im placable savages of the torrid zone The unoffending strength with which Nature has endowed the greater quadrupedes was admired in the rhinoceros the hippopotamus of the Nile 88 and a majestic troop of thirty two elephants 8 While the populace gazed with stupid wonder on the splendid show the naturalist might indeed ob serve the figure and properties of so many different species tran sported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE of Rome But this accidental benefit which science might derive from folly is surely insufficient to justify such a wanton abuse of the public riches There occurs however a single instance in the first Punic war in which the senate wisely connected this amuse ment of the multitude with the interest of the state A considerable number of elephants taken in the defeat of the Carthaginian army were driven through the circus by a few slaves armed only with blunt javelins 9Â The useful spectacle served to impress the Roman soldier with a just contempt for those unwieldy animals and he no longer dreaded to encounter them in the ranks of war The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts was conducted with a Theamphi magnificence suitable to a people who styled themselves the masters of the world nor was the edifice appropriated to that entertain ment less expressive of Roman greatness Posterity admires and will long admire the awful remains of the amphitheatre of Titus which so well deserved the epithet of Colossal It was a building of an eliptic figure five hundred and sixty four feet in length and four hundred and sixty seven in breadth founded on fourscore arches and rising with four successive orders of architecture to the height of one hundred and forty feet The outside of the edifice was en

with cushions and capable of receiving with ease above four score thousand spectators Sixty four vomitories for by that name the doors were very aptly distinguished poured forth the immense multitude

fountains and pro fusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics In the cen ter of the edifice the arena or stage was strewed with the finest sand and successively afTumed the most different forms At one moment it seemed to rise out of the earth like the garden of the Hefperides and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns of Thrace The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible supply of water and what had just before appeared a level plain might be suddenly converted into a wide lake covered with armed vessels and replenished with the monsters of the deep95 In the decoration of these scenes the Roman empefors displayed their wealth and liberality and we read on various occasions that the whole furni ture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver or of gold or of amber 9 s The poet who describes the games of Carinus in the cha racter of a shepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence affirms that the nets designed as a defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire that the porticos were gilded and that the belt or circle which divided the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with a precious Mosaic of beautiful stones 97 In the midst of this glittering pageantry the emperor Carinus secure of his fortune enjoyed the acclamations of the people the flattery of his courtiers and the songs of the poets who for want of a more essential merit were reduced to celebrate the divine graces of his person 9 In the same hour but at the distance of nine hundred miles from Rome his brother expired and a sudden revolution transferred into the hands of a stranger the scepter of the house of Carus The sons of Carus never saw each other after their father s death The arrangements which their new situation required were proba 6 bly OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE bly deferred till the return of the younger brother to Rome where a triumph was decreed to the young emperors for the glorious suc cess of the Persian war Co It is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the administration or the provinces of the empire but it is very unlikely that their union would have proved of any long duration The jealousy of power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters In the most corrupt of times Carinus was unworthy to live Numerian deserved to reign in a happier period His affable manners and gentle vir tues secured him as soon as they became known the regard and affections of the public He possessed the elegant accomplishments of a poet and orator which dignify as well as adorn the humblest and the most exalted station His eloquence however it was applauded by the senate was formed not so much on the model of Cicero as on that of the modern declaimers  but in an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit he contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his contemporaries and still remained the friend of his rivals a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart or the superiority of his genius lo But the talents of Numerian were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind When his father s elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of retire ment neither his temper ncr his pursuits had qualified him for the command of armies His constitution was destroyed by the hard ships of the Persian war  and he had contracted from the heat of the climate 01 such a weakness in his eyes as obliged him in the course of a long retreat to confine himself to the solitude and dark ness of a tent or litter The administration of all affairs civil as well as military was devolved on Arrius Aper the PrÃ torian prÃ fect who to the power of his important office added the honour of being father in law to Numerian The imperial pavilion was strictly guarded by his most trusty adherents and during many Vol I Z z daysi 2H THE fcfcCLJNfe ANt tAtt days Aper delivered to she arms the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign Â 5 Death of Nu It was hot till eight months after the death of Cams that the menan Roman army returning by flow marches from thd banks of the Tigris arrived on those of the Thracian Botfphorus The legions halted at ChaTcedori in Asia while the court passed over to He raclea on the European side of the Propontis 0 But a report soon circulated through the camp at first in fec rct whifttefs and at length in loud clamours of the emperor s death and of the pre sumption of his ambitious minister who still exercised the sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more The impa tience of the soldiers could not long support a state of suspense With rude curiosity they broke into the imperial tent and dis covered only the corpse of Numeriah rÂ T he gradual decline of his health might have induced theni to believe that his death was natural but the concealment was interpreted as an evidence of guilt and the measures which Aper had taken to secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruitf Yet eVen in the tran sport of their rage and grief the troops observed a regular pro ceeding which proves how firmly discipline had been re establiflied by the martial successors of Gallienus A general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at Chalcedoh whither Aper Was transported in chains a a prisoner and a criminal A Vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the camp and the generals and A r 284 tribunes formed a great military council They soon announced to Electros17 e multitude that their choice had Fallen on Diocletian com theemperor mander of the domestics or body guards as the person the most Diocletian  capable of revenging and succeeding their beloved emperor The future fortunes of the candidate depended on the charice Or conduct of the present hour Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to some suspicions Diocletian ascended the tribunal OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 35 tribunal and raising his eyes towards the Sun made a solemn pro fession of his own innocence in the presence of that all seeing Deity o6 Then assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge he commanded that Aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal This man said he is the murderer of Numerian and without giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification drew his sword and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate prÃ fect A charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without contradiction and the legions with repeated acclamations acknow ledged the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian Â 7 Before we enter upon the memorable reign of that prince it will JjJ i8 be proper to punish and dismiss the unworthy brother of Numerian Carinus Carinus possessed arms and treasures sufficient to support his legal title to the empire But his personal vices overbalanced every advantage of birth and situation The most faithful servants of the father despised the incapacity and dreaded the cruel arrogance of the ion The hearts of the people were engaged in favour 9s his rivaj and even the senate was inclined to prefer an usurper to a tyrant The arts of Diocletian inflamed the general discontent and the winter was employed in secret intrigues and open preparations for a civil war In the spring the forces of the EajR and of the ejr â l8S encountered each other in the plains of Margus a small city of MÃ sia in the neighbourhood of the Danube o8  The troops so lately returned from the Persian war had acquired their glory at the expence of health and numbers nor were they in a condition to contend with the unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe Their ranks were broken and for a moment Diocletian despaired of the purple and of life But the advantage which Carinus had obtained by the valour of his soldiers he quickly lost iby the infidelity of his officers A Tribune whose wife he had seduced seized the opportunity of revenge and by a single blow extin guished civil discord in the

tranquillity â The Perfean war victory and triumph â The new form of administration â Abdication and retirement of Diocletian and Maximian Elevation and character of Diocletian A D 285  The strong claims of merit and of violence had frequently superseded the ideal prerogatives of nobility but a distinct line of separation was still preserved between the free and the servile part of mankind The parents of Diocletian had been staves in the house of Anuli nus a Roman senator  nor was he himself distinguished by any other name than that which he derived from a small town in Dalmatia from whence his mother deduced her origin It is however pro bable that his father obtained the freedom of the family and that he soon acquired an office of scribe which was commonly exercised by persons of his condition  Favourable oracles or rather the consciousness of superior merit prompted his aspiring son to pursue the profession of arms and the hopes of fortune and it would be extremely curious to observe the gradation of arts and accidents which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles and to display that merit to the world Diocletian was successively promoted to the government of MÃ sia the honours of the consul ship and the important command of the guards of the palace He distinguished his abilities in the Persian war  and after the death of Numerian the slave by the confession and judgment of his rivals was OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 2S7 was declared the most worthy of the imperial throne The malice of religious zeal whilst it arraigns the savage fierceness of his col league Maximian has affected to cast suspicions on the personal courage of the emperor DiocletianIt would not be easy to per suade us of the cowardice of a soldier of fortune who acquired and preserved the esteem of the legions as well as the favour of so many Warlike princes Yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to attack the most vulnerable part The valour of Diocletian was never found inadequate to his duty or to the occasion but he appears not to have possessed the daring and generous spirit of a hero who courts danger and fame disdains artifice and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals His abilities were useful rather than splendid a vigorous mind improved by the experience and study of mankind dexterity and application in business a judicious mixture of liberality and ceconomy of mildness and ri gour profound dissimulation under the disguise of military frank ness steadiness to pursue his ends flexibility to vary his means and above all the great art of submitting his own passions as well as those of others to the interest of his ambition and of colouring his ambition with the most specious pretences of justice and public utility Like Augustus Diocletian may be considered as the found er of a new empire Like the adopted son of CÃ sar he was dis tinguished as a statesman rather than as a warrior nor did either of those princes employ force whenever their purpose could be effected by policy The victory of Diocletian was distinguished by its singular mild His clemency ness A people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the con 30 v ct ry queror if the usual punishments of death exile and confiscation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity beheld with the most pleasing astonishment a civil war whose rage was confined to the field of battle Diocletian received into his confidence Ari stobulus the principal minister of the house of Carus respected the lives S58 THE DECLINE AND FALL lives the fortunes and the dignity of his adversaries and even continued in their respective stations the greater number of the ser vants of Carinus  It is not improbable that motives of prudence might assist the humanity of the artful Dalmatian of these ser vants many had purchased his favour by secret treachery in others he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfortunate master The discerning judgment of Aurelian of Probus and of Carus had filled the several departments of the state and army with officers of approved merit whose removal would have injured the public ser vice without promoting the interest of the successor Such a con duct however displayed to the Roman world the fairest prospect of the new reign and the emperor affected to confirm this favour able prepossession by declaring that among all the virtues of his predecessors he was the most ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of Marcus Antoninus s Association The first considerable action of his reign seemed to evince bis of Maximtuu sincerity as well as his moderation After the example of Marcus Aprii i286 he gave himself a colleague in ithe person of Maximian on whom heibestowed at first the title of CÃ sar and afterwards that of Augustus 6 â But the motives of his conduct as well as the object of his choice were of a very different nature from those of hisadmired predecessor By investing a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple Marcus bad discharged a debt of privategratitude at the expcnce indeed of the happiness of the state By associating a friend and a fellow soldier to the labours of government Diocletian in a time of public danger pro vided for the defence both of the East and of the West Maximian was born a peasant and like Aurelian in the territory of Sirmium Ignorant of letters7 careless of laws the rusticity of his appear ance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated fortune the meanness of his extraction War was the only art which he pro fessed In a long course of service he had distinguished himself on every frontier of the empire 5 and though his military talents were formed Of THE ROMAN EMPIRE formed to obey rather than so command though perhaps he never attained the skill of a consummate general he was capable by his valour constancy and experience of executing the most arduous undertakings Nor were the vices of Maximian less useful to his benefactor Insensible to pity and fearless of consequences he was the ready instrument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once suggest and disclaim As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been offered to prudence or to revenge Diocletian by his seasonable intercession saved the remaining few whom he had never designed to punish gently censured the severity of his stern colleague and enjoyed the comparison of a golden and an iron age which was universally applied to their opposite maxims of government Notwithstanding the difference of their characters the two emperors maintained on the throne that friendship which they had contracted in a private station The haughty turbulent spirit of Maximian so fatal afterwards to himself and to the public peace was accustomed to respect the genius of Diocletian and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence 8 From a motive either of pride or superstition the two emperors assumed the titles the one of Jovius the other of Herculius Whilst the motion of the world such was the language of their venal orators was maintained by the all seeing wisdom of Jupiter the invincible arm of Hercules purged the earth of monsters and tyrants 9 But even the omnipotence of Joviusand Herculius was insufficient to Association of two CÃ sars fdstain the weight of the public administration The prudence of Dio Galerius and cletian discovered that the empire assailed on every side by the barba a d 292 rians required on every side the presence of a great army and of an Ma  emperor With this view he resolved once more to divide his unwieldy power and with the inferior title of Cafars to confer on two generals of approved merit an equal share of the sovereign authority  Ga â terius surnamed Armentarius from his original profession of a iierdsman and Gonstantius who from his pale complexion had 5 acquired 360 THE DECLINE AND FALL acquired the denomination of Chlorus were the two persona invested with the second honours of the imperial purple In describing the country extraction and manners of Herculius we have already delineated those of Galerius who was often and not improperly styled the younger Maximian though in many in stances both of virtue and ability he appears superior to the elder The birth of Constantius was less obscure than that of his colleagues Eutropius his father was one of the most considerable nobles of Dardania and his mother was the niece of the emperor Claudius Although the youth of Constantius had been spent in arms he possessed a mild and amiable disposition and the popular voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained To strengthen the bonds of political by those of domestic union each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of the CÃ sars Diocletian to Galerius and Maximian to Con stantius and each obliging them to repudiate their former wives bestowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted son 5 These four princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the Departments Roman empire The defence of Gaul Spain  and Britain was ofdthearfour y entrusted to Constantius Galerius was stationed on the banks of princes  jjanubej as the safeguard of the Illyrian provinces Italy and Africa were considered as the department of Maximian and for his peculiar portion Diocletian reserved Thrace Egypt and the rich countries of Asia Every one was sovereign within his own juris diction but their united authority extended over the whole mo narchy and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues with his counsels or presence The CÃ sars in their exalted rank revered the majesty of the emperors and the three younger princes in variably acknowledged by their gratitude and obedience the com mon parent of their fortunes The suspicious jealousy of power found not any place among them and the singular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus of music whose har 4 mony OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE mony was regulated and maintained by the skilful hand of the first artist s This important measure was not carried into execution till about Scries of events fix years after the association of Maximian and that interval of time had not been destitute of memorable incidents But we have pre ferred for the fake of perspicuity first to describe the more perfect form of Diocletian s government and afterwards to relate the actions of his reign following rather the natural order of the events than the dates of a very doubtful chronology The first exploit of Maximian though it is mentioned in a few A D 2 7 r  State of the words by our imperfect writers deserves from its singularity to peasants of be recorded in a history of human manners He suppressed the peasants of Gaul who under the appellation of BagaudÃ a had risen in a general insurrection very similar to those which in the fourteenth century successively afflicted both France and England 7Â It should seem that very many of those institutions referred by an easy solution to the feudal system are derived from the Celtic bar barians When CÃ sar subdued the Gauls that great nation was already divided into three orders of men the clergy the nobility and the common people The first governed by superstition the second by arms but the third and last was not of any weight or account in their public councils It was very natural for the Ple beians oppressed by debt or apprehensive of injuries to implore the protection of some powerful chief who acquired over their persons and property the fame absolute rights as among the Greeks and Romans a master exercised over his staves s The greatest part of the nation was gradually reduced into a state of servitude com pelled to perpetual labour on the estates of the Gallic nobles and confined to the foil either by the real weight of fetters or by the no less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws During the long series of troubles which agitated Gaul from the reign of Gallienus to that of Diocletian the condition of these servile peasants was Vol I A a a peculiarly THE DECLINE AND FALL peculiarly miserable and they experienced at once the complicated tyranny of their masters of the barbarians of the soldiers and of the officers of the revenue Their rebel Their patience was at last provoked into despair On every side they rose in multitudes armed with rustic weapons and with irresistible fury The ploughman became a foot soldier the shep herd mounted on horseback the deserted villages and open towns were abandoned to the flames and the ravages of the peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians  They asserted the natural rights of men but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty The Gallic nobles justly dreading their revenge either took refuge in the fortified cities or fled from the wild scene of anarchy The peasants reigned without controul and two of their most daring leaders had the folly and rashness to assume the im perial ornaments Their power soon expired at the approach of the legions The strength of union and discipline obtained an easy and chastise victory over a licentious and divided multitude  A severe re taliation was inflicted on the peasants who were found in arms the affrighted remnant returned to their respective habitations and their unsuccessful effort for freedom served only to confirm their slavery So strong and uniform is the current of popular passions that we may venture from very scanty materials to relate the par ticulars of this war but we are not disposed to believe that the principal leaders Ã lianus and Amandus were Christiansor to insinuate that the rebellion as it happened in the time of Luther was occasioned by the abuse of those benevolent principles of Christianity which inculcate the natural freedom of mankind A D 287 Maximian had no sooner recovered Gaul from the hands of the Revolt of Ca raufiusio peasants than he lost Britain by the usurpation of Carausius Ever since the successful rashness of the franks under the reign of Probus their daring countrymen had constructed squadrons of light brigantines in which they incessantly ravaged the provinces i adjacent OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE adjacent to the ocean l To repel their desultory incursions it was found necessary to create a naval power and the judicious measure was pursued with prudence and vigour Gessoriacum or Boulogne in the narrow streights of the British channel was chosen by the emperor for the station of the Roman fleet and the command of it was intrusted to Carausius a Menapian of the meanest origin IS but who had long signalized his skill as a pilot and his valour as a soldier The integrity of the new admiral corresponded not with his abilities When the German pyrates sailed from their own harbours he connived at their passage but he diligently intercepted their return and appropriated to his own use an ample share of the spoil which they had acquired The wealth of Carausius was on this occasion very justly considered as an evidence of his guilt and Maximian had already given orders for his death But the crafty Menapian foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded and secured the barbarians in his interest From the port of Boulogne he sailed over to Britain persuaded the legion and the auxiliaries which guarded that island to embrace his party and boldly assuming with the imperial purple the title of Augustus defied the justice and the arms of his injured sovereign l6 When Britai n was thus dismembered from the empire its im Importance portance was sensibly felt and its loss sincerely lamented The Â fBslUia Romans celebrated and perhaps magnified the extent of that noble island provided on every side with convenient harbours the tem perature of the climate and the fertility of the foil alike adapted for the production of corn or of vines the valuable minerals with which it abounded its rich pastures covered with innumerable flocks and its woods free from wild beasts or venomous serpents Above all they regretted the large amount of the revenue of Britain whilst they confessed that such a province well deserved to A a a 2 become 3 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL Power of Cvaufiaia A D Â 8a acknowledg ed by the other empe iors become the seat of an independent monarchy 7 During the space of seven years it was possessed by Caraufius j and fortune con tinued propitious to a rebellion supported with courage and ability The British emperor defended the frontiers of his dominions against the Caledonians of the North invited from the continent a great number of skilful artists and displayed on a variety of coins that are still extant his taste and opulence Born on the confines of the Franks he courted the friendship of that formidable people by the flattering imitation of their dress and manners The bravest of their youth he enlisted among his land or sea forces and in return for their useful alliance he communicated to the barbarians the dangerous knowledge of military and naval arts Caraufius still preserved the possession of Boulogne and the ad jacent country His fleets rode triumphant in the channel com manded the mouths of the Seine and of the Rhine ravaged the coasts of the ocean and diffused beyond the columns of Hercules the terror of his name Under his command Britain destined in a future age to obtain the empire of the sea already assumed its natural and respectable station of a maritime power 8 By seizing the fleet of Boulogne Caraufius had deprived his master of the means of pursuit and revenge And when after a vast expence of time and labour a new armament was launched into the water 9 the imperial troops unaccustomed to that eleiv ent were easily baffled and defeated by the veteran sailors of the usurper This disappointed effort was soon productive of a treaty of peace Diocletian and his colleague who justly dreaded the enterprising spirit of Caraufius resigned to him the sovereignty of Britain and reluctantly admitted their perfidious servant to a participation of the imperial honours 0 But the adoption of the two CÃ sars restored new vigour to the Roman arms and while the Rhine was guarded by the presence of Maximian his brave as sociate Constantius assumed the conduct of the British war His z first OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 365 first enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne A stupendous mole raised across the entrance of the harbour inter cepted all hopes of relief The town surrendered after an ob A DÂ 292 stinate defence and a considerable part of the naval strength of Caraufius fell into the hands of the besiegers During the three years which Constantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest of Britain he secured the coast of Gaul invaded the country of the Franks and deprived the usurper of the assistance of those powerful allies Before the preparations were finished Constantius received the A 0 294 His death intelligence of the tyrant s death and it was considered as a sure presage of the approaching victory The servants of Carausius imitated the example of treason which he had given He was murdered by his first minister Allectus and the assassin succeeded to his power and to his danger But he possessed not equal abilities either to exercise the one or to repel the other He beheld with anxious terror the opposite shores of the continent already silled with arms with troops and with vessels for Constantius had very prudently divided his forces that he might likewise divide the at tention and resistance of the enemy The attack was at length A D 295 made by the principal squadron which under the command of the Britain by prÃ fect Asclepiodotus an officer of distinguished merit had been ConstantluSk assembled in the mouth of the Seine So imperfect in those times was the art of navigation that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans who ventured to set sail with a side wind and on a stormy day The weather proved favourable to their enterprise Under the cover of a thick fog they escaped the fleet of Allectus which had been stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them landed in safety on some part of the western coast and convinced the Britons that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion As clepiodotus had no sooner disembarked the imperial troops than he set 366 THE DECLINE AND FALL set fire to his ships and as the expedition proved fortunate hlÂ heroic conduct was universally admired The usurper had posted himself near London to expect the formidable attack of Con stantius who commanded in person the fleet of Boulogne but the descent of a new enemy required his immediate presence in the west He performed that long march in so precipitate a manner that he encountered the whole force of the przefect with a small body of harassed and disheartened troops The engagement was soon terminated by the total defeat and death of Allectus a single battle as it has often happened deckled the fate of this great island and when Gonstantius landed on the shores of Kent he found them covered with obedient subjects Their acclamations were loud and unanimous and the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe that they sincerely rejoiced in a revolution which after a separation of ten years restored Britain to the body of the Roman empire Desenceof Britain had none but domestic enemies to dread and as Ions as the iron tiers 0 the governors preserved their fidelity and the troops their disci pline the incursions of the Scots or Irish could never materially affect the safety of the province The peace of the continent and the defence of the great rivers which bounded the empire were ob jects of far greater difficulty and importance The policy of Dio cletian which inspired the councils of his associates provided for the public tranquillity by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the barbarians and by strengthening the fortifications of the Fortifications Roman limit In the East he fixed a line of camps from Egypt to the Persian dominions and for every camp he instituted an adequate number of stationary troops commanded by their respec tive officers and supplied with every kind of arms from the new arsenals which he had formed at Antioch Emesa and Damascus Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the well known valour of the barbarians of Europe From the mouth of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 367 Â f the Rhine to that of the Danube the ancient camps towns and citadels were diligently re established and in the most exposed places new ones were skilfully constructed the strictest vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier and every expedient was practised that could render the long chain of for tifications firm and impenetrable A barrier so respectable was seldom violated and the barbarians often turned against each other their disappointed rape The Goths the Vandals the GepidÃ Dissensions of u  the barba the Burgundians the Alemanni wasted each other s strength by destructive hostilities and whosoever vanquimed they vanquished the enemies of Rome The subjects of Diocletian enjoyed the bloody spectacle and congratulated each other that the mischiefs of civil war were now experienced only by the barbarians Notwithstanding the policy of Diocletian it was impossible to Conduaof maintain an equal and undisturbed tranquillity during a reign of cmPer0M twenty years and along a frontier of many hundred miles Some times the barbarians suspended their domestic animosities and the vigilance of the garrisons sometimes gave a passage to their strength or dexterity Whenever the provinces were invaded Diocletian conducted himself with that calm dignity which he always affected or possessed reserved his presence for such occasions as were worthy of his interposition never exposed his person or reputation to any unnecessary danger ensured his success by every means that pru dence could suggest and displayed with ostentation the conse quences of his victory In wars of a more difficult nature and more doubtful event he employed the rough valour of Maximian and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to the wife counsels and auspicious influence of his benefactor But sr oftht after the adoption of the two CÃ sars the emperors themselves re tiring to a lese laborious scene of action devolved on their adopted sons the defence of the Danube and of the Rhine The vigilant Galerius was never reduced to the necessity of vanquishing an army of 368 THE DECLINE AND FALL of barbarians on the Roman territory 15 The brave and active Constantius delivered Gaul from a very furious inroad of the Alemanni and his victories of Langres and Vindonissa appear to have been actions of considerable danger and merit As he tra versed the open country with a feeble guard he was encompassed on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy He retreated with difficulty towards Langres but in the general consternation the citizens refused to open their gates and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope But on the news of his distress the Roman troops hastened from all fides to his relief and before the evening he had satisfied his honour and revenge by the slaughter of six thousand Alemanni 6 From the monuments of those times the memory of several other victories over the barbarians of Sarmatia and Germany might possibly be collected but the tedious search would not be rewarded either with amusement or with instruction Treatment os The conduct which the emperor Probus had adopted in the dis tne barba x  liant pofal of the vanquistied was imitated by Diocletian and his asso ciates The captive barbarians exchanging death for flavery were distributed among the provincials and assigned to those districts in Gaul the territories of Amiens Beauvais Cambray Treves Langres and Troy es are particularly specified 7 which had been depopulated by the calamities of war They were usefully em ployed as shepherds and husbandmen but were denied the exercise of arms except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the military service Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands  with a less servile tenure to such of the barbarians as solicited the protection of Rome They granted a settlement to several colonies of the Carpi the Bastarnae and the Sarmatians and by a dangerous indulgence permitted them in some measure to retain their national manners and independence 5S Among the pro vincials it was a subject of flattering exultation that the barbarian so 6F THE ROMAN EMPIRE so lately an object of terror now cultivated their lands drove their cattle to the neighbouring fair and contributed by his labour to the public plenty They congratulated their masters on the powerful accession of subjects and soldiers but they forgot to observe that multitudes of secret enemies insolent from favour or desperate from oppression were introduced into the heart of the empire While the CÃ sars exercised their valour on the bank of the Rhine WarsofAsrica and Danube the presence of the emperor6 was required on the southern confines of the Roman world From the Nile to Mount Atlas Africa was in arms A confederacy of five Moorish nations issued from their deserts to invade the peaceful provinces 4 Julian had assumed the purple at Carthage Achilleus at Alexandria and even the Blemmyes renewed or rather continued their in cursions into the Upper Egypt Scarcely any circumstances have been preserved of the exploits of Maximian in the western parts of Africa but it appears by the event that the progress of his arms was rapid and decisive that he vanquished the fiercest barbarians of Mauritania and that he removed them from the mountains whose inaccessible strength had inspired their inhabitants with a law less confidence and habituated them to a life of rapine and vio lence  Diocletian on his side opened the campaign in Egypt by ndiict9 the siege of Alexandria cut off the aqueducts which conveyed Diocletian in the waters of the Nile into every quarter of that immense city4J and rendering his camp impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude he pushed his reiterated attacks with caution and vigour After a siege of eight months Alexandria wasted by the sword and by fire implored the clemency of the conqueror but it ex perienced the full extent of his severity Many thousands of the citizens perished in a promiscuous flaughter and there were few obnoxious persons in Egypt who escaped a sentence either of death or at least of exile 44 The fate of Busiris and of Coptos was still more melancholy than that of Alexandria those proud cities the Vol I B b b former THE DECLINE AND FALL former distinguished by its antiquity the latter enriched by the passage of the Indian trade were utterly destroyed by the arms and by the severe order of Diocletian4S The character of the Egyptian nation insensible to kindness but extremely susceptible of fear could alone justify this excessive rigour The seditions of Alexandria had often affected the tranquillity and subsistence of Rome itself Since the usurpation of Firmus the province of Upper Egypt incessantly relapsing into rebellion had embraced the alliance of the savages of Ã thiopia The numbers of the Blemmyes scattered between the island of Meroe and the Red Sea was very inconsiderable their disposition was unwarlike their weapons rude and inoffensive46 Yet in the public disorders these barbarians whom antiquity shocked with the deformity of their figure had almost excluded from the human species presumed to rank themselves among the enemies of Rome 7 Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians and while the attention of the state was engaged in more serious wars their vexatious inroads might again harass the repose of the province With a view of opposing to the Blemmyes a suitable adversary Diocletian persuaded the NobatÃ or people of Nubia to remove from their ancient habitations in the deserts of Lybia and resigned to them an extensive but unprofitable territory above Syene and the cataracts of the Nile with the stipulation that they should ever respect and guard the frontier of the empire The treaty long subsisted and till the establishment of Christianity in troduced stricter notions of religious worship it was annually ra tified by a solemn sacrifice in the ifle of Elephantine in which the Romans as well as the barbarians adored the fame visible or invisible powers of the universe 8 At the same time that Diocletian chastised the past crimes of the Egyptians he provided for their future safety and happiness by many wife regulations which were confirmed and enforced under the succeeding reigns49 One very remarkable edict which he pub lished OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE lifhed instead of being condemned as the effect of jealous tyranny e0 freJe deserves to be applauded as an act of prudence and humanity He chymy caused a diligent

opulence of the Egyptians should in spire them with confidence to rebel against the empire SV But if Diocletian had been convinced of the reality of that valuable art far from extinguishing the memory he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the public revenue It is much more likely that his good fense discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions and that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his subjects from the mischievous pursuit It may be remarked that these ancient books so liberally ascribed Novelty and to Pythagoras to Solomon or to Hermes were the pious frauds hafart of more recent adepts The Greeks were inattentive either to the use or to the abuse of chymistry In that immense register where Pliny has deposited the discoveries the arts and the errors of man kind there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals and the persecution of Diocletian is the first authentic event in the history of alchymy The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs diffused that vain science over the globe Congenial to the avarice of the human heart it was studied in China as in Europe with equal eagerness and with equal success The darkness of the middle ages ensured a favourable reception to every tale of wonder and the revival of learning gave new vigour to hope and suggested more specious arts of deception Philosophy with the aid of expe rience has at length banished the study of alchymy and the pre sent age however desirous of riches is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry The reduction of

286 His restora tion to the throne of Armenia powerful nation and to force a confession from the successors of Artaxerxes of the superior majesty of the Roman empire We have observed under the rejgn of Valerian that Armenia was subdued by the perfidy and the arms of the Persians and that after the assassination of Chosroes his son Tiridates the infant heir of the monarchy was saved by the fidelity of his friends and educated under the protection of the emperors Tiridates derived from his exile such advantages as he could never have obtained on the throne of Armenia the early knowledge of adversity of man kind and of the Roman discipline He signalized his youth by deeds of valour and displayed a matchless dexterity as well as strength in every martial exercise and even in the less honourable contests of the Olympian games s Those qualities were more no bly exerted in the defence of his benefactor Licinius fJ That offi cer in the sedition which occasioned the death of Probus was ex posed to the most imminent danger and the enraged soldiers were forcing their way into hie tent when they were checked by the single arm of the Armenian prince The gratitude of Tiridates contributed soon afterwards to his restoration Licinius was in every station the friend and companion of Galerius and the merit of Galerius long before he was raised to the dignity of Caesar had been known and esteemed by Diocletian In the third year of that emperor s reign Tiridates was invested with the kingdom of Ar menia The justice of the measure was not less evident than its expediency It was time to rescue from the usurpation of the Per sian monarch an important territory which since the reign of Nero had been always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the house of Arsacess When Tiridates appeared on the frontiers of Armenia he was received with an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty During twenty six years the country had experienced the real and imagi nary hardfliips of a foreign yoke The Persian monarchs had 4  adorned OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 373 adorned their new conquest with magnificent buildings but those au tÂ sthc monuments were raised at the expence of the people and abhorred as badges of slavery The apprehension of a revolt had inspired the most rigorous precautions oppression had been aggravated by insult and the consciousness of the public hatred had been produc tive of every measure that could render it still more implacable We have already remarked the intolerant spirit of the Magian re r ligion The statue6 of the deified kings of Armenia and the sacred images of the fun and moon Were broke in pieces by the zeal of the conqueror and the perpetual fire of Ormuzd was kindled and pre served upon an altar erected on the summit of mount BagavanSJ It was natural thata people exasperated by so many injuries should arm Revolt os the with zeal in the cause of their independence their religion and their nobles 1 1 hereditary sovereign The torrent bore down every obstacle and the Persian garrison retreated before its fury The nobles of Armenia flew to the standard of Tiridates all alleging their past merit offering their future service and soliciting from the new king those honours and rewards from which they had been excluded with dis dain under the foreign governments6 The command of the army was bestowed on Artavasdes whose father had saved the infancy of Tiridates and whose family had been massacred for that generous action The brother of Artavasdes obtained the government of a province One of the first military dignities was conferred on the Satrap Otas a man of singular temperance and fortitude who pre sented to the king his sister 57 and a considerable treasure both of which in a sequestered fortress Otas had preserved from violation Among the Armenian nobles appeared an ally whose fortunes are Story of too remarkable to pass unnoticed His name was Mamgo his origin Mamg0 was Scythian and the horde which acknowledged his authority had encamped a very few years before on the skirts of the Chinese em pire S8 which at that time extended as far as the neighbourhood of Sogdiana59 Having incurred the displeasure of his master Mamgo 574 THE DECLINE AND FALL Mamgo with his followers retired to the banks of the Oxus and implored the protection of Sapor The emperor of China claimed the fugitive and alleged the rights of sovereignty The Persian monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality and with some difficulty avoided a war by the promise that he would banish Mamgo to the uttermost parts of the West a punishment as he described it not less dreadful than death itself Armenia was chosen for the place of exile and a large district was assigned to the Scythian horde on which they might feed their flocks and herds and remove their en campment from one place to another according to the different seasons of the year They were employed to repel the invasion of Tiridates but their leader after weighing the obligations and in juries which he had received from the Persian monarch resolved to abandon his party The Armenian prince who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power of Mamgo treated him with dis tinguished respect and by admitting him into his confidence ac quired a brave and faithful servant who contributed very effectually to his restoration 6 The Persian For a while fortune appeared to favour the enterprising valour of menia Tiridates He not only expelled the enemies of his family and coun try from the whole extent of Armenia but in the prosecution of his revenge he carried his arms or at least his incursions into the heart of Assyria The historian who has preserved the name of Tiridates from oblivion celebrates with a degree as national enthusiasm his personal prowess and in the true spirit of eastern romance de scribes the giants and the elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm It is from other information that we discover the distracted state of the Persian monarchy to which the king of Armenia was indebted for some part of his advantages The throne was disputed by the am bition of contending brothers and Hormuz after exerting without success the strength of his own party had recourse to the dangerous assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the Caspian 6 Sea OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 375 Sea 6l The civil war was however soon terminated either by a vic tory or by a reconciliation and Narscs who was universally acknow ledged a king of Persia directed his whole force against the foreign enemy The contest then became too unequal nor was the valour of the hero able to withstand the power of the monarch Tiridates a second time expelled from the throne of Armenia once more took refuge in the court of the emperors Narses soon re established his authority in the revolted province and loudly complaining of the protection afforded by the Romans to rebels and fugitives aspired to the conquest of the East 6 Neither prudence nor honour could permit the emperors to desert War between the cause of the Armenian king and it was resolved to exert the and the Ro force of the empire in the Persian war Diocletian with the calm T â r dignity which he uniformly affected fixed his own station in the city of Antioch from whence he prepared and directed the military operations 6 The conduct of the legions was intrusted to the in trepid valour of Galerius who for that important purpose was re moved from the banks of the Danube to those of the Euphrates The armies soon encountered each other in the plains of Mesopo Defeat of c r Galerius tamia and two battles were fought with various and doubtful suc cess but the third engagement was of a more decisive nature  and the Roman army received a total overthrow which is attributed to the rashness of Galerius who with an inconsiderable body of troops attacked the innumerable host of the Persians 6 But the consider ation of the country that was the scene of action may suggest ano ther reason for his defeat The fame ground on which Galerius was vanquished had been rendered memorable by the death of Crassus and the slaughter of ten legions It was a plain of more than sixty miles which extended from the hills of CarrÃ to the Euphrates a smooth and barren surface of sandy desert without a hillock without a tree and without a spring of fresh water 6 The steady infantry of the Romans fainting with heat and thirst could neither â 376 THE DECLINE AND FALL neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks nor break their ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger In this situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior num bers harassed by the rapid evolutions and destroyed by the arrows of the barbarian cavalry The king of Armenia had signalized his valour in the battle and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune He was pursued as far as the Euphrates his horse was wounded and it appeared impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy In this extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which he saw before him he dismounted and plunged into the stream His armour was heavy the river very deep and in those parts at least half a mile in breadth66 yet such was his strength and dexterity that he reached in safety the opposite bank 6 With regard to the Roman gene ral we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape but when His reception he returned to Antioch Diocletian received him not with the ten byDwcieuan ernef8 cf a frien j amj colleague but with the indignation of an offended sovereign The haughtiest of men clothed in his purple but humbled by the fense of his fault and misfortune was obliged to follow the emperor s chariot above a mile on foot and to exhibit before the whole court the spectacle of his disgrace  Second cam As soon as Diocletian had indulged his private resentment and ieriu osGa asserted the majesty of supreme power he yielded to the submissive A D 297 entreaties of the CÃ sar and permitted him to retrieve his own honour as well as that of the Roman arms In the room of the unwarlike troops of Asia which had most probably served in the first expe dition a second army was drawn from the veterans and new levies of the Illyrian frontier and a considerable body of Gothic auxili aries were taken into the imperial pay 9 At the head of a chosen army of twenty five thousand men Galerius again passed the Eu phrates but instead of exposing his legions in the open plains of Mesopotamia he advanced through the mountains of Armenia where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause and the country as OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 377 as favourable to the operations of infantry as it was inconvenient for the motions of cavalry 7Â Adversity had confirmed the Ro man discipline whilst the barbarians elated by success were become His victory so negligent and remiss that in the moment when they least ex pected it they were surprised by the active conduct of Galerius who attended only by two horsemen had with his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their camp A surprise especially in the night time was for the most part fatal to a Persian army Their horses were tied and generally shackled to prevent their run ning away  and if an alarm happened a Persian had his housing to Â fix his horse to bridle and his corflet to put on before he could mount 7V On the occasion the impetuous attack of Galerius spread disorder and dismay over the camp of the barbarians A flight resistance was followed by a dreadful carnage and in the general confusion the wounded monarch for Narses commanded his armies in person fled towards the deserts of Media His sumptuous tents and those of his Satraps afforded an immense booty to the conqueror and an incident is mentioned which proves the rustic but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant superfluities of life A bag of shining leather silled with pearls fell into the hands of a private soldier he carefully preserved the bag but he threw away its contents judging that whatever was of no use could not possibly be of any value 7 The principal loss Â 5 of Narses was of a much more affecting nature Several of his P wives his sisters and children who had attended the army were made captives in the defeat But though the character of Ga lerius had ip general very little affinity with that of Alexander he imitated after his victory the amiable behaviour of the Ma cedonian towards the family of Darius The wives and children of Narses were protected from violence and rapine conveyed to a place of safety and treated with every mark of respect and Vol I C c c tenderness 378 THE DECLINE AND FALL tenderness that was due from a generous enemy to their age their sex and their royal dignity J Ntgoriation While the East anxiously expected the decision of this great for peace j r o contest the emperor Diocletian having assembled in Syria a strong army of observation displayed from a distance the resources of the Roman power and reserved himself for any future emer gency of the war On the intelligence of the victory he condescended to advance towards the frontier with a view of moderating by his presence and counsels the pride of Ga lerius The interview of the Roman princes at Nifibis was accompanied with every expression of respect on one side and of esteem on the other It was in that city that they  soon afterwards gave audience to the ambassador of the great king 7f The power or at least the spirit of Narses had been broken by his last defeat and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could stop the progress of the Roman arms He dispatched Apbarban a servant who possessed his favour and confidence with a com mission to negociate a treaty or rather to receive whatever con Perfiinam ditions the conqueror should impose Apharban opened the baslador conference by expressing his master s gratitude for the generous treatment of his family and by soliciting the liberty of those illus trious captives He celebrated the valour of Galerius without degrading the reputation of Narses and thought it no dishonour to confess the superiority of the victorious CÃ sar over a monarch who had surpassed in glory all the princes of his race Notwithstanding the justice of  the Persian cause he was empowered to submit the present differences to the decision of the emperors themselves convinced as he was that in the midst of prosperity they would not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune Apharban con cluded his discourse in the style of eastern allegory by observing that the Roman and Persian monarchies were the two eyes of the world OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 379 world which would remain imperfect and mutilated if either of them should be put out It well becomes the Persians replied Galerius with a transport Answer of of fury which seemed to convulse his whole frame  it well be a comes the Persians to expatiate on the vicissitudes of fortune and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of moderation Let them remember their own moderation towards the unhappy Valerian They vanquished him by fraud they treated him with indignity They detained him till the last moment of his life in shameful captivity and after his death they exposed his body to perpetual ignominy Softening however his tone Galerius insinuated to the ambassador that it had never been the practice of the Romans to trample on a prostrate enemy and that on this occasion they should consult their own dignity rather than the Persian merit He dismissed Apharban with a hope that Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain from the clemency of the emperors a lasting peace and the restoration of his wives and children In this conference we may discover the fierce passions of Galerius as well as his deference to the superior wisdom and authority of Diocletian The ambition of Moderation of Diocletian the former grasped at the conquest of the East and had proposed to reduce Persia into the state of a province The prudence of the latter who adhered to the moderate policy of Augustus and the Antonines embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a successful war by an honourable and advantageous peace 7S in pursuance of their promise the emperors soon afterwards Conclusion appointed Sicorius Probus one of their secretaries to acquaint the Persian court with their final resolution As the minister of peace he was received with every mark of politeness and friendship but under the pretence of allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey the audience of Probus was deferred from day to day and he attended the flow motions of the king till at length he was admitted to his presence near the river Asprudus C c c 2 in 38o THE DECLINE AND FALL in Media The secret motive of Narses in this delay had been to collect such a military force as might enable him though sincerely desirous of peace to negociate with the greater weight and dignity Three persons only assisted at this important conference the minister Apharban the prÃ fect of the guards and an officer who had commanded on the Armenian frontier 76 The first condition proposed by the ambassador is not at present of a very intelligible nature that the city of Nisibis might be established for the place of mutual exchange of as we should formerly have termed it for the staple of trade between the two empires There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce but as Nisibis was situated within their own dominions and as they were masters both of the imports and exports it mould seem that such restraints were the objects of an internal law rather than of a foreign treaty To render them more effectual some stipulations were probably required on the fide of the king of Persia which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity that Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them As this was the only article to which he refused his consent it was no longer in sisted on and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in its natural channels or contented themselves with such restrictions as it depended on their own authority to establish ni articles of As soon as this difficulty was removed a solemn peace was the treaty t 1 concluded and ratified between the two nations The conditions of a treaty so glorious to the empire and so necessary to Persia may deserve a more peculiar attention as the history of Rome presents very few transactions of a si milar nature most of her wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest or waged against The Aboras barbarians ignorant of the use of letters I The Aboras or as it limit between is called by Xenophon the Araxes was fixed as the boundary the empires between the two monarchies 11 That river which rises near the Tigris was increased a few miles below Nisibis by the little stream of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 38 of the Mygdonius passed under the walls of Singara and fell into the Euphrates at Circefium a frontier town which by the care of Diocletian was very strongly fortified 8 Mesopotamia the object of so many wars was ceded to the empire and the Persians by this treaty renounced all pretensions to that great province II They relinquished to the Romans five provinces beyond the Cession of five   x  provinces Tigris Their situation formed a very useful barrier and their bfyÂ d the natural strength was soon improved by art and military skill Four  of these to the north of the river were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent Intiline Zabdicene Arzanene and Mox oene but on the east of the Tigris the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of Carduene the ancient feat of the Carduchians who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia The ten thousand Greeks traversed their country after a painful march or rather engage ment of seven days and it is confessed by their leader in his incomparable relation of the retreat that they suffered more from  the arrows of the Carduchians than from the power of the great king 8 Their posterity the Curds with very little alteration either of name or manners acknowledge the nominal sovereignty of the Turkish sultan III It is almost needless to observe thatTiridates Armenia the faithful ally of Rome was restored to the throne of his fathers and that the right of the imperial supremacy were fully asserted and secured The limits of Armenia were extended as far as the fortress of Sintha in Media and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of justice Of the provinces already mentioned beyond the Tigris the four first had been dismembered by the Parthians from the crown of Armenia 81 and when the Romans acquired the possession of them they stipulated at the expence of the usurpers an ample compensation which invested their ally with the extensive and fertile country of Atropatene Its principal city in the fame situation perhaps as the modern Tauris was 382 THE DECLINE AND FALL was Frequently honoured with the residence of Tiridates and as k sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana he imitated in the build Iberia fogs and fortifications the splendid capital of the Mcdes 8 IV The country of Iberia was barren its inhabitants rude and savage But they were accustomed to the use of arms and they separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves The narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus were in their hands and it was in their choice either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climates of the South 8 The nomination of the kings of Iberia which was resigned by the Persian monarch to the emperors contributed to the strength and security of the Roman power in Asia 8 The East enjoyed a profound tranquillity during forty years and the treaty be tween the rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of Tiridates when a new generation animated with different views and different passions succeeded to the government of the world j and the grandson of Narses undertook a long and memorable war against the princes of the house of Corrstantine Triumph of The arduous work of rescuing the distressed empire from tyrants Diocletian  _ and Maxi and barbarians had now been completely atchieved by a succession A D 303 of Illyrian peasants As soon as Diocletian entered into the twentieth year of his reign he celebrated that memorable aera as well as the success of his arms by the pomp of a Roman triumph 8 Maxi mian the equal partner of his power was his only companion in the glory of that day The two CÃ sars had fought and con quered but the merit of their exploits was ascribod according to the rigour of ancient maxims to the auspicious influence of their fathers and emperors The triumph of Diocletian and Maximian was less magnificent perhaps than those of Aurelian and Probus but it was dignified by several circumstances of superior fame and good fortune Africa and Britain the Rhine the Danube and the Nile furnistied their respective trophies but the most distinguished ornament mian A D November 20  Of THP ROMAN EMPIRE 383 ornament was of a more singular nature a Persian victory followed by an important conquest The represeatations of rivers moun tains and provinces were carried before tbe imperial cw The images of the captive wives sisters and children of the great king afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the vanity of the people 8z In the eyes of posterity this triumph is remarkable by a distinction of a less honourable kind It was the last that Rome ever be held Soon after this period the emperors ceased to vanquish and Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire The spot on which Rome was founded had been consecrated Long absence  â â â i n n r oftheempe by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles The pretence rorsfrom of some god or the memory of some hero seemed to animate Rome Ã very part of the city and the empire of the world had been promised to the Capitol8S The native Romans felt and confessed the power of this agreeable illusion It was derived from their ancestors had grown up with their earliest habits of life and was protected in some measure by the opinion of political utility The form and the seat of government were intimately blended together nor was it esteemed possible to transport the one without destroying the other S But the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conquest  the provinces rose to the same level and the vanquished nations acquired the name and privileges without imbibing the partial affections of Romans During a long period however the remains of the ancient con stitution and the influence of custom preserved the dignity of Rome The emperors though perhaps of African or Ulyrian extraction respected their adopted country as the feat of their power and the center of their extensive dominions The emer gency of war very frequently required their presence on the fron tiers  but Diocletian and Maximian were the first Roman princes who fixed in time of peace their ordinary residence in the proÂ Â vinces j and their conduct however it might be suggested by private 4 motives 384 THE DECLINE AND FALL motives was justified by very specious considerations of policy Jencelr ne court of the emperor of the West was for the most part Milan established at Milan whose situation at the foot of the Alps ap peared far more convenient than that of Rome for the important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany Milan soon assumed the splendour of an imperial city The houses are described as numerous and well built the manners of the people as polished and liberal A circus a theatre a mint a palace baths which bore the name of their founder Maximian j porticos adorned with statues and a double circumference of walls con tributed to the beauty of the new capital nor did it seem op pressed even by the proximity of Rome 9Â To rival the majesty d NiCOmC Â f Rome was the ambition likewise of Diocletian who employed his leisure and the wealth of the East in the embellishment of Nicomedia a city placed on the verge of Europe and Asia almost at an equal distance between the Danube and the Euphrates By the taste of the monarch and at the expence of the people Ni â comedia acquired in the space of a few years a degree of magnificence which might appear to have required the labour of ages and became inferior only to Rome Alexandria and Antioch in extent or populous ness 9 The life of Diocletian and Maximian was a life of action and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps or in their long and â frequent marches  but whenever the public business allowed them any relaxation they seem to have retired with pleasure to their favourite re sidences of Nicomedia and Milan Till Diocletian in the twentieth year ef his reign celebrated his Roman triumph it is extremely doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire Even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed two months Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people he quitted Rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he should have appeared in tbe senate invested with the ensigns of the consular dignity 9 The OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3 The diflike expressed by Diocletian towards Rome and Roman Debasement freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice but the remit 0f the senate of the most artful policy That crafty prince had framed a new system of imperial government which was afterwards completed by the family of Constantine and as the image of the old con stitution was religioufly preserved in the senate he resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration We may recollect about eight years before the elevation of Dio cletian the transient greatness and the ambitious hopes of the Roman senate As long as that enthusiasm prevailed many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom and after the successors of Probus had withdrawn their countenance from the republican party the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment As the sovereign of Italy Maximian was intrusted with the care of extinguishing this troublesome rather than dingerous spirit and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper The most illustrious members of the senate whom Diocletian always affected to esteem were involved by his col league in the accusation of imaginary plots and the possession of an elegant villa or a well cultivated estate was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt9 The camp of the PrÃ torians which had so long oppressed began to protect the majesty of Rome and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their power they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the authority of the senate By the prudent measures of Diocletian the number of the Praetorians were insensibly reduced their pri vileges abolished 9 and their place supplied by two faithful legions Ncwbedies o of Illyricum who under the new titles of Jovians and Herculians fns and Â were appointed to perform the service of the imperial guards 9S IlCrculians But the most fatal though secret wound which the senate received from the hands of Diocletian and Maximian was inflicted by the in evitable operation of their long absence As long as the emperors Vol I D d d resided 386 THE DECLINE AND FALL resided at Rome that assembly might be oppressed but it could scarcely be neglected The successors of Augustus exercised the power of dic tating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate The model of an cient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees and wife princes who respected the prejudices of the Roman people were in some measure obliged to assume the language and behaviour suitable to the general and first magistrate of the republic In the armies and in the provinces they displayed the dignity of monarchs and when they fixed their residence at a distance from the capital they for ever laid aside the dissimulation which Augustus had recommended to his successors In the exercise of the legislative as well as of the executive power the sovereign advised with his ministers instead of consulting the great council of the nation The name of the senate was men tioned with honour till the last period of the empire the vanity of its members was still flattered with honorary distinction 6 but the assembly which had so long been the source and so long the instru ment of power was respectfully suffered to sink into oblivion The senate of Rome losing all connexion with the imperial court and the actual constitution was left a venerable but useless monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill Civil magi When the Roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their aside la d ancient capital they easily forgot the origin and nature of their legal power The civil offices of consul of proconsul of censor and of tribune by the union of which it had been formed betrayed to the people its republican extraction Those modest titles were laid aside 97 and if they still distinguished their high station by the appellation of Emperor or Imperator that word was understood in a new and more dignified fense and no longer denoted the gene ral of the Roman armies but the sovereign of the Roman world imperiaHig The name of Emperor which was at first of a military nature was titles associated with another of a more servile kind The epithet of 4 Dominos OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 387 Dominus or Lord in its primitive signification was expressive not of the authority of a prince over his subjects or of a comman der over his soldiers but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic staves9 Viewing it in that odious light it had been re jected with abhorrence by the first CÃ sars Their resistance insen sibly became more feeble and the name less odious till at length the style of our Lord and Emperor was not only bestowed by flat tery but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monu ments Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity and if the successors of Diocletian still de clined the title of King it seems to have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy Wherever the Latin tongue was in use and it was the language of government through out the empire the imperial title as it was peculiar to themselves conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of king which they must have shared with an hundred barbarian chieftains or which at the best they could derive only from Romulus or from Tarquin But the sentiments of the East were very different from those of the West From the earliest period of history the sove reigns of Asia had been celebrated in the Greek language by the title of Basileus or King and since it was considered as the first distinction among men it was soon employed by the servile provincials of the East in their humble addresses to the Roman throne Even the attributes or at least the titles of the Divinity were usurped by Diocletian and Maximian who transmitted them to a succession of Christian emperors 0Â Such extravagant compli ments however soon lose their impiety by losing their meaning and when the ear is once accustomed to the sound they are heard with indifference as vague though excessive professions of respect From the time of Augustus to that of Diocletian the Roman Diocletian as pnnces convening in a iamiliar manner among their fellow citi lem and in zens were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid t ersian cere dd 2 to THE DECLINE AND FALL to senators and magistrates Their principal distinction was the imperial or military robe of purple whilst the senatorial gar ment was marked by a broad and the equestrian by a narrow band or stripe of the fame honourable colour The pride or rather the policy of Diocletian engaged that artful prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of Persia I0t He ventured to assume the diadem an ornament detested by the Romans as the odious ensign of royalty and the use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the madness of Caligula It was no more than a broad white fillet set with pearls which encircled the emperor s head The sumptuous robes of Diocletian and his suc cessors were of silk and gold and it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were studded with the most precious gems The access to their sacred person was every day rendered more diffi cult by the institution of new forms and ceremonies The ave nues of the palace were strictly guarded by the various schools as they began to be called of domestic officers The interior apart ments were intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs the in crease of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symp tom of the progress of despotism When a subject was at length admitted to the imperial presence he was obliged whatever might be his rank to fall prostrate on the ground and to adore accord ing to the eastern fashion the divinity of his lord and master  Diocletian was a man of fense who in the course of private as well as public life had formed a just estimate both of himself and of man kind nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting the manners of Persia to those of Rome he was serioufly actuated by so mean a prin ciple as that of vanity He flattered himself that an ostentation of splendor and luxury would subdue the imagination of the multi tude that the monarch would be less exposed to the rude licence of the people and the soldiers as his person was secluded from the public view 5 and that habits of submission would insensibly be pro ductive OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ductive of sentiments of veneration Like the modesty affected by Augustus the state maintained by Diocletian was a thea trical representation but it must be confessed that of the two comedies the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter It was the aim of the one to disguise and the object of the other to display the unbounded power which the emperors possessed over the Roman world Ostentation was the first principle of the new system instituted by New soâ of Diocletian The second was division He divided the empire the tion two   Augusti and provinces and every branch of the civil as well as military admi two CÃ sars nistration He multiplied the wheels of the machine of govern ment and rendered its operations less rapid but more secure Whatever advantages and whatever defects might attend these innovations they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the first inventor but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes it will be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full maturity and perfection C5 Reserving therefore for the reign of Constantine a more exact picture of the new empire we shall con tent ourselves with describing the principal and decisive outline as it was traced by the hand of Diocletian He had associated three colleagues in the exercise of the supreme power and as he was convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defence he considered the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary expedient but as a fundamental law of the con stitution It was his intention that the two elder princes should be distinguished by the use of the diadem and the title of Augusti i that as affection or esteem might direct their choice they should regularly call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues and that the CÅ fors rising in their turn to the first rank should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors The empire wc s divided into four parts The East and Italy were the most honourable the Danube THE DECLINE AND FALL Danube and the Rhine the most laborious stations The former claimed the presence of the Augusts the latter were entrusted to the administration of the Ctesars The strength of the legions was in the hands of the four partners of sovereignty and the despair of successively vanquishing four formidable rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general In their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided power of the monarchy and their edicts inscribed with their common names were received in all the provinces as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority Notwithstanding these precautions the po litical union of the Roman world was gradually dissolved and a principle of division wa6 introduced which in the course of a few years occasioned the perpetual separation of the eastern and western empires The system of Diocletian was accompanied with another very material disadvantage which cannot even at present be totally over looked a more expensive establishment and consequently an in crease of taxes and the oppression of the people Instead of a modest family of staves and freedmen such as had contented the simple greatness of Augustus and Trajan three or four magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the empire and as many Roman kings contended with each other and with the Persian monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and luxury The num ber of ministers of magistrates of officers and of servants who filled the different departments of the state was multiplied beyond the example of former times and if we borrow the warm expression of a contemporary when the proportion of those u who received exceeded the proportion of those who contri buted the provinces were oppressed by the weight of tri butes 0 From this period to the extinction of the empire it would be easy to form a series of clamours and complaints Ac cording to his religion and situation each writer chuses either Dio cletian OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 391 cletlan or Constantine or Valens or Theodofius for the object of his invectives but they unanimously agree in representing the bur den of the public impositions and particularly the land tax and capitation as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times From such a concurrence an impartial historian who is obliged to extract truth from satire as well as from panegyric will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they ac cuse and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices than to the uniform system of their administration The emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that system but during his reign the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion and he deserves the reproach of establishing pennV cious precedents rather than of exercising actual oppression I0J It may be added that his revenues were managed with prudent ceco nomy and that after all the current expences were discharged there still remained in the imperial treasury an ample provision ei ther for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state It was in the twenty first year of his reign that Diocletian exe Abdication of cuted his memorable resolution of abdicating the empire an action and mIxU more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger Antoninus than from a prince who had never practised the lessons of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme power Diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the world the first example of a resignation cS which has not been very fre quently imitated by succeeding monarchs The parallel of Charles Resemblance the Fifth however will naturally offer itself to our mind not only Fisih since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name so familiar to an English reader but from the very striking resem blance between the characters of the two emperors whose political abilities were superior to their military genius and whose specious virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art The abdi cation of Charles appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude of 92 THE DECLINE AND PALL of fortune and the disappointment of his favourite schemes urged him to relinquish a power which he found inadequate to his am bition But the reign of Diocletian had slowed with a tide of unin terrupted success nor was it till after he had vanquished all his enemies and accomplished all his designs that he seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire Neither Charles nor Diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of life since the one was only fifty five and the other was no more than fifty nine years of age but the active life of those princes their wars and journies the cares of royalty and their application to business had already impaired their constitution and brought on A D 304 the infirmities of a premature old age107 Long illness m   of Diocletian  Notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter Dio cletian left Italy soon after the ceremony of his triumph and began his progress towards the East round the circuit of the Illyrian provinces Erom the inclemency of the weather and the fatigue of the journey he soon contracted a flow illness and though he made easy marches and was generally carried in a close litter his disorder before he ar rived at Nicomedia about the end of the summer was become very serious and alarming During the whole winter he was confined to his palace his danger inspired a general and unaffected concetn but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health from the joy or consternation which they discovered in the countenances and behaviour of his courtiers The rumour of his death was for some time universally believed and it was supposed to be concealed with a view to prevent the troubles that might have hap pened during the absence of the CÃ sar Galerius At length however on the first of March Diocletian once more appeared in public but so pale and emaciated that he could scarcely have been recognised by His prudence those to whom his person was the most familiar It was time to put an end to the painful struggle which he had sustained during more than a year between the care of his health and that of his dignity OF THE ROM AM EMPIRE 393 dignity The former required indulgence and relaxation the latter compelled him to direct from the bed of sickness the administration of a great empire He resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honourable repose to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune and to relinquish the theatre of the world to his younger and more active associates The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain about three miles from Nicomedia The emperor ascended a lofty throne and in a speech full of reason and dignity declared his intention both to the people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion As soon as he had divested himself of 3Â S the purple he withdrew from the gazing multitude and traversing the city in a covered chariot proceeded without delay to the favourite retirement which he had chosen in his native country of Dalmatia On the fame day which was the first of May  Maximian as it had been previously concerted made his resignation of the imperial dignity at Milan Even in the splendour of the Roman triumph Compliance   r of Maximian Diocletian had meditated his design of abdicating the government As he wished to secure the obedience of Maximian he exacted from him either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the authority of his benefactor or a particular promise that he would descend from the throne whenever he should receive the advice and the example This engagement though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter Â would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce tem per of Maximian whose passion was the love of power and who neither desired present tranquillity nor future reputation But unable in one moment to surmount the habits of twenty years he submitted however reluctantly to the ascendant which his wiser colleague had acquired over him and retired immediately after his abdication to a villa in Lucania where it was almost im Vol I E e e possible 394

loss of power they principally regret the want of occupation The amusements of letters and of devotion which afford so many resources Ln solitude were incapable of fixing the attention of Diocletian but he had preserved or at least he soon recovered a taste for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures and his leisure hours we e sufficiently employed in building planting and gardening His phaoso His answer to Maximian is deservedly celebrated He was solicited by that restless old man to reassume the reins of government and the imperial purple He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity calmly observing that if he could shew Maximian the cab bages which he had planted with his own hands at Salona he should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power  In his conversations with his friends he frequently acknowledged that of all arts the most difficult was the ar t of reigning and he expressed himself on that favourite topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of ex perience c How often was he accustomed to fay is it the interest M of four or five ministers to combine together to deceive their sovereign Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity the truth is concealed from his knowledge he can fee only with their eyes he hears nothing but their misrepresentations He confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness and disgraces i OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Z9S disgraces the most virtuous and capable among his subjects Â By such infamous arts added Diocletian the best and wisest  princes are fold to the venal corruption of their courtiers  A just estimate of greatness and the assurance of immortal fame improve our relish for the pleasures of retirement but the Roman emperor had filled too important a character in the world to enjoy without allay the comforts and security of a private condition It was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication It was impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences Fear sorrow and discontent sometimes pursued him into the solitude of Salona His tenderness or at least his pride was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter  and the last moments of Diocletian were embittered by some affronts which Licinius and Constantine might have spared the father of so many emperors and the first author of their own fortune A report though of a very and death doubtful nature has reached our times that he prudently withdrew 3 3 himself from their power by a voluntary death  Before we dismiss the consideration of the life and character of Description of Diocletian we may for a moment direct our view to the place of the adjacent his retirement Salona a principal city of his native province of coantrjs Dalmatia was near two hundred Roman miles according to the measurement of the public highways from Aquileia and the con fines of Italy and about two hundred and seventy from Sirmium the usual residence of the emperors whenever they visited the IUyrian frontier s A miserable village still preserves the name of Salona but so late as the sixteenth century the remains of a theatre and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble columns con tinued to attest its ancient splendour I 5 About six or seven miles from the city Diocletian constructed a magnificent palace and we may infer from the greatness of the work how long he had meditated his design of abdicating the empire The choice of a E e e 2 spot 3 6 THE DECLINE AND FALL spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require the partiality of a native The soil was  dry and fertile the air is pure and wholesome and though ex c tremely hot during the summer months this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious winds to which the coast of Â c Istria and some parts of Italy are exposed The views from the palace are no less beautiful than the foil and climate was in Â viting Towards the west lies the fertile shore that stretchea along the Hadriatic in which a number of small islands are  scattered in such a manner as to give this part of the sea the appearance of a great lake On the north side lies the bay which led to the ancient city of Salona and the country be  yond it appearing in sight forms a proper contrast to that â more extensive prospect of water which the Hadriatic presents both to the south and to the east Towards the north the view U terminated by high and irregular mountains situated at a u proper distance and in many places covered with villages woods and vineyards 7 OfDiode Though Constantine from a very obvious prejudice affects to tian s palace    mention the palace of Diocletian with contempt  yet one of their successors who could only fee it in a neglected and mutilated state celebrates its magnificence in terms of the highest admiration 9 It covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and ten Eng lish acres The form was quadrangular flanked with sixteen towers Two of the sides were near six hundred and the other two near seven hundred feet in length The whole was constructed of a beautifuL free stone extracted from the neighbouring quarries of Trau or Tragutium and very little inferior to marble itself Four streets intersecting each other at right angles divided the several parts of this great edifice and the approach to the principal apartment was from a stately entrance which is still denominated the Golden gate The approach was terminated by a periftylium of granite v columns OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 397 columns on one side of which we discover the square temple of Ã sculapius on the other the octagon temple of Jupiter The latter of those deities Diocletian revered as the patron of his for tunes the former as the protector of his health By comparing the present remains with the precepts of Vitruvius the several parts of the building the baths bedchamber the atrium the bafisica and the Cyzicene Corinthian and Egyptian halls have been described with some degree of precision or at least of probability Their forms were various their proportions just but they were all attended with two imperfections very repugnant to our modern notions of taste and conveniency These stately rooms had neither windows nor chimnies They were lighted from the top for the building seems to have consisted of no more than one story and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls The range of principal apartments was protected towards the south west by a portico five hundred and seventeen feet long which must have formed a very noble and delightful walk when the beauties of painting and sculpture were added to those of the prospect Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country it would have been exposed to the ravages of time  but it might per haps have escaped the rapacious industry of man The village of Aspalathus 10 and long afterwards the provincial town of Spalatro have grown out of its ruins The golden gate now opens into the market place St John the Baptist has usurped the honours of Ã sculapius and the temple of Jupiter under the protection of the Virgin is converted into the cathedral church For this account of Diocletian s palace we are principally indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and country whom a very liberal curiosity car Decline of ried into the heart of Dalmatia But there is room to suspect that the am the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their purpose to represent We are in formed by a more recent and very judicious traveller that the awful1 ruins 59S THE DECLINE AND FALL ruins of Spalatro are not less expressive of the decline of the arts than of the greatness of the Roman empire in the time of Diocle tian  If such was indeed the state of architecture we must na turally believe that painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible decay The practice of architecture is directed by a few general and even mechanical rules But sculpture and above all painting propose to themselves the imitation not only of the forms of nature but of the characters and passions of the human foul In those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of little avail unless it is animated by fancy and guided by the most cor rect taste and observation Of letters It is almost unnecessary to remark that the civil distractions of the empire the license of the soldiers the inroads of the barbari ans and the progress of despotism had proved very unfavourable to genius and even to learning The succession of Illyrian princes restored the empire without restoring the sciences Their mili tary education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of letters and even the mind of Diocletian however active and capacious in business was totally uninformed by study or specu lation The professions of law and physic are of such common use and certain prosit that they will always secure a sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable degree of abili ties and knowledge but it does not appear that the students in those two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who flourished within that period The voice of poetry was silent History was reduced to dry and confused abridgments alike destitute of amuse ment and instruction A languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service of the emperors who encouraged not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of their pride or the defence of their power ThenewPla The declining age of learning and of mankind is marked w Â however by the rife and rapid progress of the new Platonicians The school of Alexandria silenced those of Athens and the ancient sects OF tfrfE ROMAN EMPIRE sects enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable teachers who recommended their system by a new method and by their manners Several of these masters Ammonius Plotinus Ame lius and Porphyry were men of profound thoughtand intense ap plication but by mistaking the true object of philosophy their la bours contributed much less to improve than to corrupt the human understanding The knowledge that is suited to our situation and powers the whole compass of moral natural and mathematical science was neglected by thtf new Platonicians whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics attempted to explore the secrets of the invisible world and studied to reconcile Aristotle with Plato on subjects of which both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditations their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy They flattered themselves that they possessed the secreb of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison claimed a familiar intercourse with dÃ mons and spirits and by a very singular revolution converted the study of philosophy into that of magic The ancient sages had derided the popular superstition j after dis guising its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory the dis ciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its most zealous defenders As they agreed with the Christians in a few mysterious points of faith they attacked the remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil war The new Platonicians would scarcely de serve a place in the history of science but in that of the church the mention of them will very frequently occur CHAP 400 THE DECLINE AND FALL CHAP XIV Troubles after the abdication of Diocletian â Death of Conjlantius â Elevation of Conjlantine and Maxentius â Six Emperors at

power established by Diocletian subsisted no fufion nd CÂ n â â longer than while it was sustained by the firm and dexterous A D 305â hand of the founder It required such a fortunate mixture of different tempers and abilities as could scarcely be found or  even expected a second time two emperor s without jealousy two CÃ sars without ambition and the fame general interest inva riably pursued by four independent princes The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and confusion The empire was afflicted by five civil wars and the remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs who viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred strove to increase their respective forces at the expence of their subjects Character and As soon as Diocletian and Maximian had resigned the purple Constant their station according to the rules of the new constitution was filled by the two CÃ sars Constantius and Galerius who imme diately assumed the title of Augustus  The honours of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former of those princes and he continued under a new appellation to administer his ancient department of Gaul Spain and Britain The government of tkofe OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 401 those ample provinces was sufficient to exercise his talents and to satisfy his ambition Clemency temperance and moderation dis tinguished the amiable character of Constantius and his fortunate subjects had frequently occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the passions of Maximian and even with the arts of Diocletian  Instead of imitating their eastern pride and magni ficence Constantius preserved the modesty of a Roman prince He declared with unaffected sincerity that his most valued treasure was in the hearts of his people and then whenever the dignity of the throne or the danger of the state required any extraordinary supply he could depend with confidence on their gratitude and liberality The provincials of Gaul Spain and Britain sensible of his worth and of their own happiness reflected with anxiety on the declining health of the emperor Constantius and the tender age of his numerous family the issue of his second marriage with the daughter of Maximian â The stern temper of Galerius was cast in a very different mould Of Galerius and while he commanded the esteem of his subjects he seldom con descended to solicit their affections His fame in arms and above all the success of the Persian war had elated his haughty mind which was naturally impatient of a superior or even of an equal If it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an injudicious writer we might ascribe the abdication of Diocletian to the me naces of Galerius and relate the particulars of a private conver sation between the two princes in which the former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed ingratitude and arro gance  But these obscure anecdotes are sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of Diocletian What ever might otherwise have been his intentions if he had appre hended any danger from the violence of Galerius his good fense would have instructed him to prevent the ignominious contest and Vol I Fff as 402 THE DECLINE AND FALL as he had held the scepter with glory he would have resigned it without disgrace The two c After the elevation of Conscantius and Galerius to the rank of lars Severuj andMaximin August two new Casars were required to supply their place and to complete the system of the imperial government Diocletian was sincerely desirous of withdrawing himself from the world  he considered Galerius who had married his daughter as the firmest support of his family and of the empire and he consented without reluctance that his successor should assume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination t was fixed without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of the Weft Each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of manhood and who might have been deemed the most natural candidates for the vacant honour But the moderate Constantius was not disposed to assert his claims by arms and the impotent resentment of Maximian was no longer to be dreaded The two persons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of CÃ fer were much better suited to serve the views of his ambition and their principal recom mendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or personal consequence The first of these was Daza or as he was after ward called Maximin whose mother was the lister of Galerius The unexperienced youth still betrayed by his manners and lan guage his rustic education when to his own astonishment as well as that of the world he was invested by Diocletian with the purple ex alted to the dignity of CÃ sar and intrusted with the sovereign command of Egypt and Syria J At the same time Severus a faithful servant addicted to pleasure but not incapable of busi ness was sent to Milan to receive from the reluctant hands of Maximian the CÃ sarean ornaments and the possession of Italy and Africa6 According to the forms of the constitution Severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western emperor  but he was absolutely OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4cj absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius who reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of Italy to those of Syria firmly established his power over three fourths of the monarchy In the full confidence that the ap proaching death of Constantius would leave him sole master of the Roman world we are assured that he had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes and that he meditated his own retreat from public life after he should have accomplistied a glorious reign of about twenty years 7 But within less than eighteen months two unexpected revolutions Ambition of  Galerius dis overturned the ambitious schemes of Galerius The hopes of unit appointed by ing the weflern provinces to his empire were disappointed by the tions elevation of Constantine whilst Italy and Africa were lost by the successful revolt of Maxentius I The fame of Constantine has rendered posterity attentive to the Birth educa tion and es most minute circumstances of his life and actions The place of cape of Con his birth as well as the condition of his mother Helena have been a dÂ the subject not only of literary but of national disputes Notwith standing the recent tradition which assigns for her father a British king we are obliged to confess that Helena was the daughter of an innkeeper 8 but at the fame time we may defend the legality of her marriage against those who have represented her as the concubine of Gonstantius 9 The great Constantine was most probably born at Naissus in Dacia  and it is not surprising that in a family and province distinguished only by the profession of arms the youth should discover very little inclination to improve his mind by the acquisition of knowledge He was about eigh A D 291 teen years of age when his father was promoted to the rank of CÃ sar but that fortunate event was attended with his mother s divorce and the splendor of an imperial alliance reduced the son of Helena to a state of disgrace and humiliation Instead of following Con stantius into the West he remained in the service of Diocletian F f f 2 signalised 4o4 THE DECLINE AND FALL signalised his valour in the wars of Egypt and Persia and gradually rose to the honourable station of a tribune of the first order The figure of Constantine was tall and majestic he was dexterous in all his exercises intrepid in war affable in peace in his whole con duct the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence and while his mind was engrossed by ambition he appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure The favour of the people and soldiers who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of CÃ sar served only to exasperate the jealousy of Ga lerius and though prudence might restrain him from exercising any open violence an absolute monarch is seldom at a loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge 1  Every hour increased the danger of Constantine and the anxiety of his father who by repeated letters expressed the warmest desire of embracing his son For some time the policy of Galerius supplied him with delays and excuses but it was impossible long to refuse so natural a request of his associate without maintaining his refusal by arms The permission for the journey was reluctantly granted and whatever precautions the emperor might have taken to intercept a return the consequences of which he with so much reason apprehended they were effectually disappointed by the incredible diligence of Constantine  Leaving the palace of Nicomedia in the night he travelled post through Bithynia Thrace Dacia Pannonia Italy and Gaul and amidst the joyful acclamations of the people reached the port of Boulogne in the very moment when his father was preparing to embark for Britain 4 Death of The British expedition and an easy victory over the barbarians anÂ d elevation of Caledonia were the last exploits of the reign of Constantius tineConstan He ended his life in the imperial palace of York fifteen months july ae a ter e ad assumed the title of Augustus and almost fourteen years and a half after he had been promoted to the rank of CÃ sar His death was immediately succeeded by the elevation of Constan tine OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tine The ideas of inheritance and succession are so very familiar that the generality of mankind consider them as founded not only in reason but in nature itself Our imagination readily transfers the fame principles from private property to public dominion  and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a son whose merit seems to justify the esteem or even the hopes of the people the joint influence of prejudice and of affection operates with irresistible weight The flower of the western armies had followed Constantius into Britain and the national troops were reinforced by a numerous body of Alemanni who obeyed the orders of Crocus one of their hereditary chieftains IS The opinion of their own importance and the as surance that Britain Gaul and Spain would acquiesce in their no mination were diligently inculcated to the legions by the adherents of Constantine The soldiers were asked Whether they could hesi tate a moment between the honour of placing at their head the worthy son of their beloved emperor and the ignominy of tamely expecting the arrival of some obscure stranger on whom it might please the sovereign of Asia to bestow the armies and provinces of the West It was insinuated to them that gratitude and liberality held a distinguished place among the virtues of Constantine nor did that artful prince shew himself to the troops till they were prepared to salute him with the names of Augustus and Emperor The throne was the object of his desires and had he been less ac tuated by ambition it was his only means of safety He was well acquainted with the character and sentiments of Galerius and suffi ciently apprized that if he wished to live he must determine to reign The decent and even obstinate resistance which he chose to affect l6 was contrived to justify his usurpation nor did he yield to the acclamations of the army till he had provided the proper materials for a letter which he immediately dispatched to the em peror of the East Constantine informed him of the melancholy event of his father s death modestly asserted his natural claim to the 4o6 THE DECLINE AND FALL the succession and respectfully lamented that the affectionate vio lence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise disappointment and rage and as he could seldom restrain his passions he loudly threatened that he would commit to the flames both the letter and the messenger Heisacknow But his resentment insensibly subsided and when he recollected the ledgedbyGa doubtful chance of war when he had weighed the character and lenus who gives him strength of his adversary he consented to embrace the honourable only the title Â of CÃ sar and accommodation which the prudence of Constantine had left open to gustustoSe him Without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the Csu5 British army Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps but he gave him only the title of CÃ sar and the fourth rank among the Roman princes whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite Severus The apparent harmony of the empire was still preserved and Constantine who already possessed the substance expected without impatience an opportunity of obtaining the ho nours of supreme power  The t nthers The children of Constantius by his second marriage were six in Constantbe number three of either sex and whose imperial descent might have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of Helena But Constantine was in the thirty second year of his age in the full vigour both of mind and body at the time when the eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than thirteen years old His claim of superior merit had been allowed and ratified by the dying emperor S In his last moments Constantius bequeathed to his eldest son the care of the safety as well as greatness of the fa mily

the first honours of the state with which they were in vested OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 407 nested attest the fraternal affection of Constantine and as those princes poflested a mild and grateful disposition they submitted with out reluctance to the superiority of his genius and fortune 9 H The ambitious spirit of Galerius was scarcely reconciled to the Discontent of the Romans disappointment of his views upon the Gallic provinces before the attheappre unexpected loss of Italy wounded his pride as well as power in a taxes still more sensible part The long absence of the emperors had filled Rome with discontent and indignation and the people gra dually discovered that the preference given toNicomedia and Milan was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of Diocletian but to the permanent form of government which he had instituted It was in vain that a few months after his abdication his succes sors dedicated under his name those magnificent baths whose ruins still supply the ground as well as the materials for so many churches and convents I0 The tranquillity of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was disturbed by the impatient murmurs of the Romans and a report was insensibly circu lated that the sums expended in erecting those buildings would soon be required at their hands About that time the avarice of Galerius or perhaps the exigencies of the state had induced him to make a very strict and rigorous inquisition into the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation both on their lands and on their persons A very minute survey appears to have been taken of their real estates and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment torture was very freely employed to ob tain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth The privi leges which had exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces were no longer regarded and the officers of the revenue al ready began to number the Roman people and to settle the pro portion of the new taxes Even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly extinguished the tamest subjects have sometimes ven tured to resist an unprecedented invasion of their property but on  this 4oS THE DECLINE AND FALL this occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult and the sense of private interest was quickened by that of national honour The conquest of Macedonia as we have already observed had delivered the Roman people from the weight of personal taxes Though they had experienced every form of despotism they had now en joyed that exemption near five hundred years nor could they pa tiently brook the insolence of an Illyrian peasant who from his distant residence in Asia presumed to number Rome among the tri butary cities of his empire The rising fury of the people was en couraged by the authority or at least the connivance of the senate and the feeble remains of the PrÃ torian guards who had reason to apprehend their own dissolution embraced so honourable a pretence and declared their readiness to draw their swords in the service of their oppressed country It was the wish and it soon became the hope of every citizen that after expelling from Italy their foreign tyrants they should elect a prince who by the place of his resi dence and by his maxims of government might once more deserve the title of Roman emperor The name as well as the situation of Maxentius determined in his favour the popular enthusiasm Maxemius Maxentius was the son of the emperor Maximian and he had declared em f a i Â peror at married the daughter of Galenus His birth and alliance seemed aÂ d 3c6 to offer him the fairest promise of succeeding to the empire but 8th October n S vices and incapacity procured him the fame exclusion from the dignity of CÃ sar which Constantine had deserved by a danger ous superiority of merit The policy of Galerius preferred such associates as would neither disgrace the choice nor dispute the com â mands of their benefactor An obscure stranger was therefore raised to the throne of Italy and the son of the late emperor of the West was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles distant from the capital The gloomy passions of his â foul sliame vexation and rage were inflamed by envy on the news of Constantine s success j but the hopes of Maxentius revived with 8 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE i with the public discontent and he was easily persuaded to unite his personal injury and pretensions with the cause of the Roman peo ple Two PrÃ torian tribunes and a commissary of provisions under took the management of the conspiracy and as every order of men was actuated by the fame spirit the immediate event was nei ther doubtful not difficult The prÃ fect of the city and a few magistrates who maintained their fidelity to Severus were massa cred by the guards and Maxentius invested with the imperial ornaments was acknowledged by the applauding senate and people as the protector of the Roman freedom and dignity It is uncer tain whether Maximian was previously acquainted with the conspi racy but as soon as the standard of rebellion was erected at Rome Maximian the old emperor broke from the retirement where the authority of purple Diocletian had condemned him to pass a life of melancholy soli tude and concealed his returning ambition under the disguise of pa ternal tenderness At the request of his son and of the senate he condescended to reassume the purple His ancient dignity his ex perience and his fame in arms added strength as well as reputation to the party of Maxentius  According to the advice or rather the orders of his colleague Defeat and ri r death of the emperor Severus immediately hastened to Rome in the full Severus confidence that by his unexpected celerity he should easily sup press the tumult of an unwarlike populace commanded by a licen tious youth But he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut against him the walls filled with men and arms an experienced general at the head of the rebels and his own troops without spirit or affection A large body of Moors deserted to the enemy allured by the promise of a large donative and if it be true that they had been levied by Maximian in his African war preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of allegiance Anulinus the PrÃ torian prÃ fect declared himself in favour of Max entius and drew after him the most considerable part of the troops Vol I G g g accustomed 4io THE DECLINE AND FALL accustomed to obey his commands Rome according to the expression of an orator recalled her armies and the unfortunate Severus destitute of force and of counsel retired or rather fled with precipitation to Ravenna Here he might for some time have been safe The fortifications of Ravenna were able to resist the attempts and the morasses that surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach of the Italian army The sea which Severus commanded with a powerful fleet secured him an inexhaustible supply of pro visions and gave a free entrance to the legions which on the re turn of spring would advance to his assistance from Illyricum and the East Maximian who conducted the siege in person was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his army in the fruitless enterprise and that he had nothing to hope either from force or famine With an art more suitable to the character of Diocletian than to his own he directed his attack not so much against the walls of Ravenna as against the mind of Severus The treachery which he had experienced disposed that unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and adherents The emis saries of Maximian easily persuaded his credulity that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town and prevailed upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion of an irritated conqueror but to accept the faith of an honourable capitulation He was at first re ceived with humanity and treated with respect Maximian con ducted the captive emperor to Rome and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had secured his life by the resignation of the purple But Severus could obtain only an easy death and an impe A D 307 rial funeral When the sentence was signified to him the manner e ruary  executing it was left to his own choice  he preferred the favour ite mode of the ancients that of opening his veins and as soon as he expired his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been constructed for the family of Gallienus J Though OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 411 Though the characters of Constantine and Maxentiua had very Maximian little affinity with each other their situation and interest were the daughter same and prudence seemed to require that they should unite their the tit e of forces against the common enemy Notwithstanding the superiority Â o constan of his age and dignity the indefatigable Maximian passed the  307 Alps and courting a personal interview with the sovereign of Gaul 3lstMarch carried with him his daughter Fausta as the pledge of the new alliance The marriage was celebrated at Aries with every circum stance of magnificence and the ancient colleague of Diocletian who again asserted his claim to the western empire conferred on his son in law and ally the title of Augustus By consenting to receive that honour from Maximian Constantine seemed to embrace the cause of Rome and of the senate but his professions were am biguous and his assistance flow and ineffectual He considered with attention the approaching contest between the masters of Italy and the emperor of the East and was prepared to consult his own safety or ambition in the event of the war  The importance of the occasion called for the presence and abi Galerius in lities of Galerius At the head of a powerful army collected from vadeslul r Illyricum and the East he entered Italy resolved to revenge the death of Severus and to chastise the rebellious Romans or as he expressed his intentions in the furious language of a barbarian to extirpate the senate and to destroy the people by the sword But the skill of Maximian had concerted a prudent system of defence The invader found every place hostile fortified and inaccessible and though he forced his way as far as Narni within sixty miles of Rome his dominion in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp Sensible of the increasing difficulties of his enterprise the haughty Galerius made the first advances towards a reconciliation and dispatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the Roman princes by the offer of a conference and the G g g 2 declaration THE DECLINE AND FALL declaration of his paternal regard for Maxentius who might obtain more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance of war 5 The offers of Galerius were rejected with firm ness his perfidious friendship refused with contempt and it was not long before he discovered that unless he provided for his safety by a timely retreat he had some reason to apprehend the fate of Severus The wealth which the Romans defended against his ra pacious tyranny they freely contributed for his destruction The name of Maximian the popular arts of his son the secret distri bution of large sums and the promise of still more liberal rewards checked the ardour and corrupted the fidelity of the lllyrian le gions and when Galerius at length gave the signal of the retreat it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his veterans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory and honour A contemporary writer assigns two other causes for the failure of the expedition but they are both of such a nature that a cautious historian will scarcely venture to adopt them We are told that Galerius who had formed a very imperfect notion of the greatness of Rome by the cities of the East with which he was acquainted found his forces inadequate to the siege of that immense capital But the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible to the enemy Rome hadJong since been accus tomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror nor could the temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended with the discipline and valour of the legions We are likewise in formed that the legions themselves were struck with horror and remorse and that those pious sons of the republic refused to vio late the sanctity of their ancient parentl6 But when we recollect with how much ease in the more ancient civil war the zeal of party and the habits of military obedience had converted the native citizens of Rome into her most implacable enemies we shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and 2 barbarians OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE barbarians who had never beheld Italy till they entered it in a ho stile manner Had they not been restrained by motives of a more interested nature they would probably have answered Galerius in the words of CÃ sar s veterans If our general wishes to lead us to the banks of the Tyber we are prepared to trace out his camp Whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground our hands are ready to work the engines nor shall we hesitate should the name of the devoted city be Rome itself These are indeed the expressions of a poet but of a poet who had diligently consulted both history and human nature  The legions of Galerius exhibited a very melancholy proof of His retreat their disposition by the ravages which they committed in their retreat They murdered they ravished they plundered they drove away the flocks and herds of the Italians they burnt the villages through which they passed and they endeavoured to destroy the country which it had not been in their power to subdue During the whole march Maxentius hung on their reaT but he very prudently declined a general engagement with those brave and desperate veterans His father had undertaken a second journey into Gaul with the hope of persuading Constantine who  had assembled an army on the frontier to join the pursuit and to complete the victory But the actions of Constantine were guided by reason and not by resentment He persisted in the wise reso lution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire and he no longer hated Galerius when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an object of terror 8 The mind of Galerius was the most susceptible of the sterner Elevation of passions but it was not however incapable of a sincere and lasting rankofAji friendship Licinius whose manners as well as character were i 07 not unlike his own seems to have engaged both his affection and NovemberIIi esteem Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period perhaps of their youth and obscurity It had been cemented by the 414 THE DECLINE AND FALL ad of Max the freedom and dangers of a military life they had advanced almost by equal steps through the successive honours of the ser vice and as soon as Galerius was invested with the imperial dignity he seems to have conceived the defign of raising his com panion to the fame rank with himself During the ssiort period of his prosperity he considered the rank of Caesar as unworthy of the age and merit of Licinius and rather chose to reserve for him the place of Constantius and the empire of the West While the emperor was employed in the Italian war he intrusted his friend with the defence of the Danube and immediately after his return from that unfortunate expedition he invested Licinius with the vacant purple of Severus resigning to his immediate command the provinces of Illyricum The news of his promotion was no sooner carried into the East than Maximin who governed or rather oppressed the countries of Egypt and Syria betrayed his envy and discontent disdained the inferior name of CÃ sar and not withstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius exacted almost by violence the equal title of Augustus For the first and indeed for the last time the Roman world was administered by Sx emperors six emperors In the West Constantine and Maxentius affected to A  308 feverence their father Maximian In the East Licinius and Maximin honoured with more real consideration their benefactor Galerius The opposition of interest and the memory of a recent was divided the empire into two great hostile powers  but their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity and even a feigned reconciliation till the deaths of the elder princes of Maximian and more particularly of Galerius gave a new direction to the views and passions of their surviving associates Misfortunes When Maximian had reluctantly abdicated the empire the of Maximian m venal orators of the times applauded his philosophic moderation When his ambition excited or at least encouraged a civil war they returned thanks to his generous patriotism and gently cen sured â OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE sured that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him from the public service But it was impossible that minds like those of Maximian and his son could long possess in harmony an undivided power Maxentius considered himself as the legal sovereign of Italy elected by the Roman senate and people nor would he endure the controul of his father who arrogantly de clared that by his name and abilities the rash youth had been established on the throne The cause was solemnly pleaded before the PrÃ torian guards and those troops who dreaded the severity of the old emperor espoused the party of Maxentius The life and freedom of Maximian were however respected and he retired from Italy into Illyricum affecting to lament the past and secretly con triving new mischiefs But Galerius who was well acquainted with his character soon obliged him to leave his dominions and the last refuge of the disappointed Maximian was the court of his son in law Constantine JJ He was received with respect by that artful prince and with the appearance of filial tenderness by the empress Fausta That he might remove every suspicion he re signed the imperial purple a second time professing himself at length convinced of the vanity of greatness and ambition Had he persevered in this resolution he might have ended his life with less dignity indeed than in his first retirement yet however with comfort and reputation But the near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the state from whence he was fallen and he resolved by a desperate effort either to reign or to peristu An incursion of the Franks had summoned Constantine with a part of his army to the banks of the Rhine the remainder of the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul which Jay exposed to the enterprises of the Italian emperor and a con siderable treasure was deposited in the city of Aries Maximian either craftily invented or hastily credited a vain report of the death of Constantine Without hesitation he ascended the throne seized 4i6 THE DECLINE AND FALL seized the treasure and scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the soldiers endeavoured to awake in their minds the memory of his ancient dignity and exploits Before he could establish his authority or finish the negociation which he appears to have entered into with his son Maxentius the celerity of Con stantine defeated all his hopes On the first news of his perfidy and ingratitude that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to the Saone embarked on the last mentioned river at Chalons and at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone arrived at the gates of Aries with a military force which it was im possible for Maximian to resist and which scarcely permitted him to take refuge in the neighbouring city of Marseilles The narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against the besiegers whilst the sea was open either for the escape of Maximian or for the succours of Maxentius if the latter should chuse to disguise his invasion of Gaul under the honourable pretence of defending a distressed or as he might allege an injured father Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay Constantine gave orders for an immediate assault but the scaling ladders were found too short for the height of the walls and Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did against the arms of CÃ sar if the garrison conscious either of their fault or of their danger had not purchased their pardon by de His death livering up the city and the person of Maximian A secret but February 0 irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against the usurper he obtained only the same favour which he had indulged to Se verus and it was published to the world that oppressed by the remorse of his repeated crimes he strangled himself with his own hands After he had lost the assistance and disdained the moderate counsels of Diocletian the second period of his active life was a series of public calamities and personal mortifications which were terminated in about three years by an ignominious death He OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE He deserved his fate but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of Constantine if he had spared an old man the benefactor of his father and the father of his wife During the whole of this melancholy transaction it appears that Fausta sa crificed the sentiments of nature to her conjugal duties SJ The last years of Galerius were less shameful and unfortunate Death of and though he had filled with more glory the subordinate station of a d 31 CÃ sar than the superior rank of Augustus he preserved till the y moment of his death the first place among the princes of the Roman world He survived his retreat from Italy about four years and wifely relinquishing his views of universal empire he devoted his time to the enjoyment of pleasure and to the execution of some works of public utility among which we may distinguish the discharging into the Danube the superfluous waters of the lake Pelso and the cutting down the immense forests that encompassed it an opera tion which restored an extensive country to the use of his Pannonian subjects 5 s His death was occasioned by a very painful and lingering disorder His body swelled by an intemperant course of life to an unwieldy corpulence was covered with ulcers and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insects who have given their name to a most loathsome disease5 7 but as Galerius had offended a very zeal ous and powerful party among his subjects his sufferings instead of exciting their compassion have been celebrated as the visible effects of divine justice 8 He had no sooner expired in his palace of Nicomedia Hfa domi than the two emperors who were indebted for their purple to his favour between M began to collect their forces with the intention either of disputing or â c nJ d of dividing the dominions which he had left without a master They were persuaded however to desist from the former design and to agree in the latter The provinces of Asia fell to the share of Maximin aud those of Europe augmented the portion of Licinius The Hellespont and the Thracian Bosphorus formed their mu tual boundary and the banks of those narrow seas which flowed Vol L Hhh ia 418 THE DECLINE AND FALL in the might of the Roman world were covered with soldiers with arms and with fortifications The deaths of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors to four The fense â of their true interest soon connected Licinius and Constantine a secret alliance was concluded between Maximin and Maxentius and their unhappy subjects expected with terror the bloody consequences of their inevitable dissensions which were no longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they entertained for Galerius Administra Among so many crimes and misfortunes occasioned by the ftamine iT passions of the Roman princes there is some pleasure in discovering 5u 306â a single action which may be ascribed to their virtue In the 3I sixth year of his reign Constantine visited the city of Autun and generously remitted the arrears of tribute reducing at the fame time the proportion of their assessment from twenty five to eighteen thousand persons subject to the capitation 4o Yet even this indulgence affords the most unquestionable proof of the public misery This tax was so extremely oppressive either in itself or in the mode of collecting it that whilst the revenue was increased by extortion it was diminished by despair a consider able part of the territory of Autun was left uncultivated and great numbers of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws than to support the weight of civil society It i but too probable that the bountiful emperor relieved by a par tial act of liberality one among the many evils which he had caused by his general maxims of administration But even those maxims were less the effect of choice than of necessity And if we except the death of Maximian the reign of Constantine in Gaul seems to have been the most innocent and even virtuous period of his life The provinces were protected by his presence from the inroads of the barbarians who either dreaded or experienced his active valour After a signal victory over the Franks and Ale nianni several of their princes were exposed by bis order to the a  wild  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 419 312 wild beasts in the amphitheatre of Treves and the people seem to have enjoyed the spectacle without discovering in such a treatment of royal captives any thing that was repugnant to the laws of nations or of humanity  The virtues of Constantine were rendered more illustrious by the Tyranny of    â â Maxentius ia vices of Maxentius Whilst the Gallic provinces enjoyed as much Italy and happiness as the condition of the times was capable of receiving a d 306â â Italy and Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant as con temptible as he was odious The zeal of flattery and faction has indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquished to the glory of their successful rivals but even those writers who have revealed with the most freedom and pleasure the faults of Constantine unanimously confess that Maxentius was cruel ra pacious and profligate 4 He had the good fortune to suppress a flight rebellion in Africa The governor and a few adherents had been guilty the province suffered for their crime The flourishing cities of Cirtha and Carthage and the whole extent of that fertile country were wasted by fire and sword The abuse of victory was followed by the abuse of law and justice A for midable army of sycophants and delators invaded Africa the rich and the noble were easily convicted of a connexion with the rebels and those among them who experienced the emperor s clemency were only punished by the confiscation of their estates 4 So signal a victory was celebrated by a magnificent triumph and Maxentius exposed to the eyes of the people the spoils and cap tives of a Roman province The state of the capital was no Jess deserving of compassion than that of Africa The wealth of Rome supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expences and the ministers of his revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine It was under his reign that the method of exacting a fret gift from the senators was first invented and as the sum was insensibly H h h 2 increased THE DECLINE AND FALL increased the pretences of levying it a victory a birth a marriage or an imperial consulship were proportionally multiplied4 Maxentius had imbibed the fame implacable aversion to the senate which had characterised most of the former tyrants of Rome nor was it possible for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous fidelity which had raised him to the throne and supported him against all his enemies The lives of the senators were exposed to his jealous suspicions the dishonour of their wives and daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual passions 4S It may be presumed that an imperial lover was seldom reduced to sigh in vain  but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual he had recourse to violence and there remains one memorable example of a noble matron who preserved her chastity by a voluntary death The soldiers were the only order of men whom he appeared to respect or studied to please He filled Rome and Italy with armed troops connived at their tumults suffered them with impunity to plunder and even to massacre the defenceless people 46 and indulging them in the fame licentiousness which their emperor enjoyed Maxentius often bestowed on his military favourites the splendid villa or the beautiful wife of a senator A prince of such  character alike incapable of governing either in peace or in warr might purchase the support but he could never obtain the esteem of the army Yet his pride was equal to his other vices Whilst he passed his indolent life either within the walls of his palace or in the neighbouring gardens of Sallust he was repeatedly heard to declare that he alone was emperor and that the other princes were no more than his lieutenants on whom he had devolved the defence of the frontier provinces that he might enjoy without interruption the elegant luxury of the capital Rome which had fo long regretted the absence lamented during the six years of hi reign the presence of her sovereign  Though OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4Â Though Constantinre might view the conduct of Maxentius with CiviI w be Â Â tween Con abhorrence and the situation of the Romans with companion we have famine and Maxentius no reason to presume that he would have taken up arms to punish A D 312 the one or to relieve the other But the tyrant of Italy rashly ventured to provoke a formidable enemy whose ambition had been hitherto restrained by considerations of prudence rather than by principles of justice  After the death of Maximian his titles according to the established custom had been erased and his statue thrown down with ignominy His son who had persecuted and deserted him when alive affected to display the most pious re gard for his memory and gave orders that a similar treatment should be immediately inflicted on all the statues that had been erected in Italy and Africa to the honour of Constantine That wife prince who sincerely wished to decline a war the difficulty and im portance of which he was sufficiently acquainted with at firifr dissembled the insult and sought for redress by the milder ex pedients of negociation till he was convinced that the hostile and ambitious designs of the Italian emperor made it necessary for him to arm in his own defence Maxentius who openly avowed his pretensions to the whole monarchy of the West had already pre pared a very considerable force to invade the Gallic provinces ot the side of RhÃ tia and though he could not expect any assistance from Licinius he was flattered that the legions of Illyricum allured by his presents and promises would desert the standard of that prince and unanimously declare themselves his soldiers and subjects 49 Con stantine no longer hesitated He had deliberated with caution he acted with vigour He gave a private audience to the ambassadors who in the name of the senate and people conjured him to deliver Rome from a detested tyrant and without regarding the timid remonstrances of his council he resolved to prevent the enemy and to carry the war into the heart of Italy Â The 45j THE DECLINE AND FALL Preparations The enterprise was as full of danger as of glory and the un 1 successful event of two former invasions was sufficient to inspire the most serious apprehensions The veteran troops who revered the name of Maximian had embraced in both those wars the party of his son and were now restrained by a sense of honour as well as of interest from entertaining an idea of a second desertion Max entius who considered the PrÃ torian guards as the firmest defence of his throne had increased them to their ancient establishment and they composed including the rest of the Italians who were in listed into his service a formidable body of fourscore thousand men Forty thousand Moors and Carthaginians had been raised since the reduction of Africa Even Sicily furnished its proportion of troops and the army of Maxentius amounted to no less than one hundred and seventy thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse The wealth of Italy supplied the expences of the war and the adjacent provinces were exhausted to form immense magazines of corn and every other kind of provisions The whole force of Constantine consisted of ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse51 and as the defence of the Rhine required a more than common atten tion during the absence of the emperor it was not in his power to employ above half his troops in the Italian expedition unless he sacrificed the public safety to his private quarrel 5 At the head of about forty thousand soldiers he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at least four times superior to his own But the armies of Italy placed at a secure distance from danger were â enervated by indulgence and luxury Habituated to the baths and theatres of Rome they took the field with reluctance and were chiefly composed of veterans who had almost forgotten or of new levies who had never acquired the use of arms and the practice of war The hardy legions of Gaul had long defended the fron tiers of the e nipire against the barbarians of the North and in the performance of that laborious service their valour was exercised and â OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE and their discipline confirmed There appeared the same difference between the leaders as between the armies Caprice or flattery had tempted Maxentius with the hopes of conquest but these aspiring hopes soon gave way to the habits of pleasure and the consciousness of his inexperience The intrepid mind of Constantine had been trained from his earliest youth to war to action and to military command When Hannibal marched from Gaul into Italy he was obliged first to discover and then to open a way over mountains and Constantine passes the through savage nations that had never yielded a passage to a regular Alps army The Alps were then guarded by nature they are now forti fied by art Citadels constructed with no less skill than labour and expence command every avenue into the plain and on that side render Italy almost inaccessible to the enemies of the king of Sar dinia 54 But in the course of the intermediate period the generalsr who have attempted the paflage have seldom experienced any dif ficulty or resistance In the age of Constantine the peasants of the mountains were civilized and obedient subjects the country was plentifully stocked with provisions and the stupendous high ways which the Romans had carried over the Alps opened several communications between Gaul and Italy  Constantine preferred the road of the Cottian Alps or as it is now called of Mount Cenis and led his troops with such active diligence that he de scended into the plain of Piedmont before the court of Maxentius had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine The city of Susa however which is situated at the foot of Mount Cents was surrounded with walls and pro vided with a garrison sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader but the impatience of Constantine s troops disdained the tedious forms of a siege The fame day that they appeared be fore Susa they applied fire to the gates and ladders to the walls j and mounting to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows they entered the place sword in hand and cut in pieces the greatest 4H THE DECLINE AND PALL part of the garrison The flames were extinguished by the care of Constantine and the remains of Susa preserved from total destruc tion About forty miles from thence a more severe contest awaited him A numerous army of Italians was assembled under the lieu Battle of tenants of Maxentius in the plains of Turin Its principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry which the Romans since the decline of their discipline had borrowed from the nations of the v East The horses as well as the men were clothed in complete armour the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies The aspect of this cavalry was formidable the weight almost irresistible and as on this occasion their generals liad drawn them up in a compact column or wedge with a fliarp point and with spreading flanks they flattered themselves that they should easily break and trample down the army of Constantine They might perhaps have succeeded in their design had not their experienced adversary embraced the same method of defence which in similar circumstances had been practised by Aurelian The skilful evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this massy column of cavalry The troops of Maxentius fled in confusion to wards Turin and as the gates of the city were hut against them very few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers By this important service Turin deserved to experience the clemency and even favour of the conqueror He made his entry into the imperial palace of Milan and almost all the cities of Italy between the Alps and the Po not only acknowledged the power but embraced with zeal the party of Constantine s6 Siege and From Milan to Rome the Ã milian and Flaminian highways y apnas opened an easy march of about four hundred miles but though Constantine was impatient to encounter the tyrant he prudently turned his arms against another army of Italians who by their strength and position might either oppose his progress or in cafe f a misfortune might intercept his retreat Ruricius Pompeianus 3 a general OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE a general distinguished by his valour and ability had under his command the city of Verona and all the troops that were stationed in the province of Venetia As soon as he was informed that Con stantine was advancing towards him he detached a large body of cavalry which was defeated in an engagement near Brescia and pursued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of Verona The necessity the importance and the difficulties of the siege of Verona immediately presented themselves to the sagacious mind of Con stantine  The city was accessible only by a narrow peninsula to wards the west as the other three sides were surrounded by the Adige a rapid river which covered the province of Venetia from whence the besieged derive d an inexhaustible supply of men and provisions It was not without great difficulty and after several fruitless attempts that Constantine found means to pass the river at some distance above the city and in a place where the torrent was less violent He then encompassed Verona with strong lines pushed his attacks with a prudent vigour and repelled a desperate sally of Pompeianus That intrepid general when he had used every means of defence that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could afford secretly escaped from Verona anxious not for his own but for the public safety With indefatigable diligence he soon collected an army sufficient either to meet Constantine in the field or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his lines The emperor attentive to the motions and informed of the ap proach of so formidable an enemy left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the siege whilst at the head of those troops on whose valour and fidelity he more particularly de pended he advanced in person to engage the general of Maxen tius The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines according to the usual practice of war but their experienced leader perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own suddenly changed his disposition and reducing the second extended the front of his first line to a just proportion with that of the enemy Such Vol I I i i evolutions a6 THE DECLINE AND FALL evolutions which only veteran troops can execute without con fusion in a moment of danger commonly prove decisive but as this engagement began towards the close of the day and was con tested with great obstinacy during the whole night there was less room for the ability of the generals than for the courage of the sol diers The return of light displayed the victory of Constantine and a field of carnage covered with many thousands of the van quished Italians Their general Pompeianus was found among the slain Verona immediately surrendered at discretion and the gar rison was made prisoners of war s8 When the officers of the vic torious army congratulated their master on this important success they ventured to add some respectful complaints of such a nature however as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without dis pleasure They represented to Constantine that not contented with performing all the duties of a commander he had exposed his own person with an excess of valour which almost degenerated into rashness and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the preservation of a life in which the safety of Rome and of the empire was involved Indolence and While Constantine signalized his conduct and valour in the field fears of Max  tntius the sovereign of Italy appeared insensible of the calamities and danger of a civil war which raged in the heart of his dominions Pleasure was still the only business of Maxentius Concealing or at least attempting to conceal from the public knowledge the mis fortunes of his arms 6o he indulged himself in a vain confidence which deferred the remedies of the approaching evil without deferring the evil itself6 The rapid progress of Constantine61 was scarcely sufficient to awaken him from this fatal security he flattered himself that his well known liberality and the majesty of the Roman name which had already delivered him from two invasions would dissipate with the fame facility the rebellious army of Gaul The officers of experience and ability who had served under OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 427 under the banners of Maximian were at length compelled to in form his effeminate son of the imminent danger to which he was reduced and with a freedom that at once surprised and convinced him to urge the necessity of preventing his ruin by a vigorous ex ertion of his remaining power The resources of Maxentius both of men and money were still considerable The PrÃ torian guards felt how strongly their own interest and safety were connected with his cause and a third army was soon collected more numerous than those which had been lost in the battles of Turin and Verona It was far from the intention of the emperor to lead his troops in person A stranger to the exercises of war he trembled at the ap prehension of so dangerous a contest and as fear is commonly su perstitious he gave a melancholy attention to the rumours of omens and presages which seemed to menace his life and empire Shame at length supplied the place of courage and forced him to take the field He was unable to sustain the contempt of the Roman people The circus resounded with their indignant clamours and they tu multuoufly besieged the gates of the palace reproaching the pusilla nimity of their indolent sovereign and celebrating the heroic spirit of Constantine65 Before Maxentius left Rome he consulted the Sibylline books The guardians of these ancient oracles were as well versed in the arts of this world as they were ignorant of the secrets of fate and they returned him a very prudent answer which might adopt itself to the event and secure their reputation whatever should be the chance of arms  â   The celerity of Constantine s march has been compared to the Vl ct y Â f â n c r n r Constantine rapid conquest of Italy by the first of the CÃ sars nor is the flatter near Rome ing parallel repugnant to the truth of history since no more than fs th October fifty eight days elapsed between the surrender of Verona and the final decision of the war Constantine had always apprehended that the tyrant would listen to the dictates of fear and perhaps of pru dence and that instead of risking his last hopes in a general en I i i 2 gagement THE DECLINE AND FALL gagement he would shut himself up within the walls of Rome His ample magazines secured him against the danger of famine and as the situation of Constantine admitted not of delay he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of destroying with fire and sword the imperial city the reward of his victory and the deliverance of which had been the motive or rather indeed the pretence of the civil war6f It was with equal surprise and pleasure that on hi6 arrival at a place called 5axa Rubra about nine miles from Rome66 he discovered the army of Maxentius prepared to give him battle67 Their long front filled a very spacious plain and their deep array reached to the banks of the Tyber which covered their rear and forbade their retreat We ate informed and we may bplieve that Constantine disposed his troops with consummate skill and that he chose for himself the post of honour and danger Distinguished by tbe splendour of his arms he charged in person the cavalry of his rival and his irresistible attack determined the fortune of the day The cavalry of Maxentius was principally composed either of unwieldy cuirassiers or of light Moors and Numidians They yielded to the vigour of the Gallic horse which possessed more acti vity than the one more firmness than the other The defeat of the two wings left the infantry without any protection On its flanks and the undisciplined Italians fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant whom they had always hated and whom they no longer feared The PrÃ torians conscious that their of fences were beyond the reach of mercy were animated by revenge and despair Notwithstanding their repeated efforts those brave vete rans were unable to recover the victory they obtained however an honourable death and it was observed that their bodies covered the fame ground which had been occupied by their ranks68 The confusion then became general and the dismayed troops of Maxentius pursued by an implacable enemy rushed by thousands into the deep and rapid stream of the Tyber The emperor himself attempted to escape back OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE back into the city over the Milvian bridge but the crowds which pressed together through that narrow passage forced him into the river where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his armour Â 9 His body which had funk very deep into the mud ras found with some difficulty the next day The fight of his head when it was exposed to the eyes of the people convinced them of their deliverance and admonished them to receive with acclamations of Joyalty and gratitude the fortunate Constantine who thus atchieved by his valour and ability the most splendid enterprise of his life 7Â In the use of victory Constantine neither deserves the praise of His reception clemency nor the censure of immoderate rigour7 He inflicted the same treatment to which a defeat would have exposed his own person and family put to death the two sons of the tyrant and carefully extirpated his whole race It was natural that the most distinguished adherents of Maxentius should share his fate as they had shared his prosperity and his crimes but when the Roman people loudly demanded a greater number of victims he resisted with firmness and humanity those servile clamours which were dictated by flattery as well as by resentment Informers were punished and discouraged the innocent who had suffered under the late tyranny were recalled from exile and restored to their estates A general act of oblivion quieted the minds and settled the property of the people both in Italy and in Africa 7 The fkst time that Constantine honoured the senate with his presence he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard and promised to re establish its ancient dignity and privileges The grateful senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty titles of honour which it was yet in their power to bestow and without presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine they passed a decree to assign him the first rank among the three Augufii who governed the Roman world Games and festivals were instituted S to l3o THEDECLINEANDFALL to preserve the fame of his victory and several edifices raised at the expence of Maxentius were dedicated to the honour of his successful rival The triumphal arch of Constantine still re mains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arts and a singular testimony of the meanest vanity As it was not possible to find in the capital of the empire a sculptor who was capable of adorning that public monument the arch of Trajan without any respect either for his memory or for the rules of propriety was stripped of its most elegant figures The difference of times and persons of actions and characters was totally disregarded The Parthian captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never had the smallest connexion with that people and curious antiquarians can still discover the head of Trajan on the trophies of Constantine The new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the vacancies of ancient sculpture are executed in the rudest and most unskilful manner 7 and conduct The final abolition of the PrÃ torian guards was a measure of prudence as well as of revenge Those haughty troops whose numbers and privileges had been restored and even augmented by Maxentius were for ever suppressed by Constantine Their fortified camp was destroyed and the few PrÃ torians who had escaped the fury of the sword were dispersed among the legions and banished to the frontiers of the empire where they might be serviceable without again becoming dangerous 7S By suppressing the troops which were usually stationed in Rome Constantine gave the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people and the disarmed capital was exposed without protection to the insults or neglect of its distant master We may observe that in this last effort to preserve their expiring freedom the Romans from the appre hension of a tribute had raised Maxentius to the throne He ex acted that tribute from the senate under the name of a free gift They implored the assistance of Constantine He vanquished the tyrant OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tyrant and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax The senators according to the declaration which was required of their property were divided into several classes The most opulent paid annually eight pounds of gold the next class paid four the last two and those whose poverty might have claimed an exemption were assessed however at seven pieces of gold Besides the proper members of the senate their sons their descendants and even their relations enjoyed the vain privileges and supported the heavy burdens of the senatorial order nor will it any longer excite our surprise that Constantine should be attentive to increase the number of persons who were included under so useful a descrip tion S After the defeat of Maxentius the victorious emperor passed no more than two or three months in Rome which he visited twice during the remainder of his life to celebrate the solemn festivals of the tenth and of the twentieth years of his reign Constantine was almost perpetually in motion to exercise the legions or to inspect the state of the provinces Treves Milan Aquileia Sirmium Naissus and Thessalonica were the occasional places of his residence till he founded a new Rome on the confines of Europe and Asia Before Constantine marched into Italy he had secured the friend His alliance stiip or at least the neutrality of Licinius the Illyrian emperor a D iu He had promised his sister Constantia in marriage to that prince Marcb but the celebration of the nuptials was deferred till after the con clusion of the war and the interview of the two emperors at Milan which was appointed for that purpose seemed to unite their families and interests 8 In the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged to take leave of each other An inroad of the Franks summoned Constantine to the Rhine and the hostile approach of the sovereign of Asia demanded the immediate pre sence of Licinius Maximin had been the secret ally of Maxentius War between Maxitnin and and without being discouraged by his fate he resolved to try the Licinius A D 313 fortune THE DECLINE AND FALL 432 The defeat April 30 and death of the former August fortune of a civil war He moved out of Syria towards the frontiers of Bithynia in the depth of winter The season was severe and tempestuous great numbers of men as well as horses perished in the snow and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains he was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy baggage which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced marches By this extraordinary effort of diligence he arrived with a harassed but formidable army on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus before the lieutenants of Licinius were apprized of his hostile intentions Byzantium surrendered to the power of Max imin after a siege of eleven days He was detained some day under the walls of Heraclea  and he had no sooner taken possession of that city than he was alarmed by the intelligence that Licinius had pitched his camp at the distance of only eighteen miles After a fruitless negociation in which the two princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each other s adherents they had recourse to arms The emperor of the East commanded a disciplined and â veteran army of above seventy thousand men and Licinius who had collected about thirty thousand Illyrians was at first oppressed by the superiority of numbers His military skill and the firmness of his troops restored the day and obtained a decisive victory The incredible speed which Maximin excited in his flight is much more celebrated than his prowess in the battle Twenty four hours after wards he was seen pale trembling and without his imperial orna ments at Nicomedia one hundred and sixty miles from the place of his defeat The wealth of Asia was yet unexhausted  and though the flower of his veterans had fallen in the late actiqn he had still power if he could obtain time to draw very numerous levies from Syria and Egypt But he survived his misforune only three or four months His death which happened at Tarsus was variously ascribed to despair to poison and to the divine justice As Maximin was alike destitute of abilities and of virtue he was lamented neither by the people nor b7 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 433 by the soldiers The provinces of the East delivered from the terrors of civil war cheerfully acknowledged the authority of Licinius 79 The vanquished emperor left behind him two children a boy of Cruelty of about eight and a girl of about seven years old Their inoffensive age might have excited compaffion but the compassion of Licinius was a very feeble resource nor did it restrain him from extinguiJJjing the name and memory of his adversary The death of Severianus will admit of less excuse as it was dictated neither by revenge nor by policy The conqueror had never received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth and the stiort and obscure reign of Severus in a distant part of the empire was already forgotten But the execution of Candidianus was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude He was the natural son of Galerius the friend and bene factor of Licinius The prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight of a diadem but he hoped that under the protection of princes who were indebted to his favour for the imperial purple Candidianus might pass a secure and honourable life He was now advancing towards the twentieth year of his age and the royalty of his birth though unsupported either by merit or ambition was sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of Licinius So To these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny we must add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian When that prince conferred on Galerius the title of CÃ sar he had given him in marriage his daughter Valeria whose melancholy adventures might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy She had fulfilled and even Unfortunate surpassed the duties of a wife As she had not any children her empress vV self flie condescended to adopt the illegitimate son of her hufbandj Jj thâ d  and invariably displayed towards the unhappy Cardidianus the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother After the death of Ga lerius her ample possessions provoked the avarice and her personal attractions excited the desires of his successor Maxioun He Vol I Kkk had THE DECLINE AND FALL had a wife still alive but divorce was permitted by the Roman law and the fierce passions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gra tification The answer of Valeria was such as became the daughter and widow of emperors but it was tempered by the prudence which her defenceless condition compelled her to observe She re presented to the persons whom Maximin had employed on this occasion c that even if honour could permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a thought of second nuptials decency at least must forbid her to listen to his addresses at a  time when the ashes of her husband and his benefactor were still warm and while the sorrows of her mind were still expressed  by her mourning garments She ventured to declare that she could place very little confidence in the professions of a man  whose cruel inconstancy was capable of repudiating a faithful and affectionate wife 8 On this repulse the love of Maximin was converted into fury and as witnesses and judges were always at his disposal it was easy for him to cover his fury with an appearance of legal proceedings and to persecute the reputation as well as the happiness of Valeria Her estates were confiscated her eunuchs and domestics devoted to the most inhuman tortures and several innocent and respectable matrons who were honoured with her friendship suffered death on a false accusation of adultery The empress herself together with her mother Prisca was con demned to exile and as they were ignominiousty hurried from place to place before they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of Syria they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces o the East which during thirty years had respected their august dignity Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes of his daughter and as the last return that he expected for the imperial purple which he had conferred upon Maximin he en treated that Valeria might be permitted to share his retirement of  Salona OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 435 Salona and to close the eyes of her afflicted father 8 He entreated but as he could no longer threaten his prayers were received with coldness and disdain and the pride of Maximin was gratified in treating Diocletian as a suppliant and his daughter as a criminal The death of Maximin seemed to assure the empresses of a favour able alteration in their fortune The public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard and they easily found means to escape from the place of their exile and to repair though with some precaution and in disguise to the court of Licinius His be haviour in the first days of his reign and the honourable re ception which he gave to young Candidianus inspired Valeria with a secret satisfaction both on her own account and on that of her adopted son But these grateful prospects were soon succeeded by horrour and astonishment and the bloody executions which stained the palace of Nicomedia sufficiently convinced her that the throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than himself Valeria consulted her safety by a hasty flight and stilj accompanied by her mother Prisca they wandered above fifteen months  through the provinces concealed in the disguise of plebeian habits They were at length discovered at Thessalonica and as the sentence of their death was already pronounced they were immediately beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea The people gazed on the melancholy spectacle but their grief and indignation were suppressed by the terrors of a military guard Such was the unworthy fate of the wife and daughter of Diocletian We lament their misfortunes we cannot discover their crimes and whatever idea we may justly entertain of the cruelty of Licinius it remains a matter of surprise that he was not contented with some more secret and decent method of revenge 8J The Roman world was now divided between Constantine and QUnre he Licinius the former of whom was master of the West and the fantiÂ eÂ d latter of the East It might perhaps have been expected that the i ll iu5 K k k 2 conquerors THE DECLINE AND FALL conquerors fatigued with civil war and connected by a private as well as public alliance would have renounced or at least have sus pended any farther designs of ambition And yet a year had scarcely elapsed after the death of Maximin before the victorious emperors turned their arms against each other The genius the success and the aspiring temper of Constantine may seem to mark him out as the aggressor but the perfidious character of Licinius justifies the most unfavourable suspicions and by the faint light which history reflects on this transaction 86 we may discover a conspiracy fomented by his arts against the authority of his col league Constantine had lately given his sister Anastasia in mar riage to Bassianus a man of a considerable family and fortune and had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of CÃ sar According to the system of government instituted by Diocletian Italy and per haps Africa were designed for his department in the empire But the performance of the promised favour was either attended with so much delay or accompanied with so many unequal con ditions that the fidelity of Bassianus was alienated rather than secured by the honourable distinction which he had obtained His nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius and that artful prince by the means of his emissaries soon contrived to enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new CÃ sar to irritate his discontents and to urge him to the rash enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit from the justice of Constantine But the vigilant emperor dis covered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution and after solemnly renouncing the alliance of Bassianus despoiled him of the purple and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and ingratitude The haughty refusal of Licinius when he was required to deliver up the criminals who had taken refuge in his dominions confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his perfidy and the indignities offered at Ã mona on the frontiers of Italy to the 5 statues OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 437 statues of Constantine became the signal of discord between the two princes 8 The first battle was fought near Cibalis a city of Pannonia F rst civil Â ar Â J between them situated on the river Save about fifty miles above Sirmium 88 From Battle of Ci c â r balis the inconsiderable forces which in this important contest two such A n 314 powerful monarchs brought into the field it may be inferred that 5 0 er the one was suddenly provoked and that the other was unexpect edly surprised The emperor of the West had only twenty thou sand and the sovereign of the East no more than five and thirty thousand men The inferiority of number was however com pensated by the advantage of the ground Constantine had taken post in a defile about half a mile in breadth between a steep hill and a deep morass and in that situation he steadily expected and repulsed the first attack of the enemy He pursued his success and advanced into the plain But the veteran legions of Illyricum rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms in the school of Probus and Diocletian The missile weapons on both sides were soon exhausted the two armies with equal valour rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears and the doubt ful contest had already lasted from the dawn of day to a late hour of the evening when the right wing which Constantine led in person made a vigorous and decisive charge The judicious retreat of Licinius saved the remainder of his troops from a total defeat but when he computed his loss which amounted to more than twenty thousand men he thought it unsafe to pass the night in the presence of an active and victorious enemy Abandoning his camp and magazines he marched away with secrecy and diligence at the head of the greatest part of his cavalry and was soon removed be yond the danger of a pursuit His diligence preserved his wife his son and his treasures which he had deposited at Sirmium Licinius passed through that city and breaking down the bridge on the Save hastened to collect a new army in Dacia and Thrace In his THE DECLINE AND FALL his flight he bestowed the precarious title of CÃ sar on Valens his general of the Illyrian frontier 8 The plain of Mardia in Thrace was the theatre of a second battle no less obstinate and bloody than the former The troops on both sides displayed the same valour and discipline and the victory was once more decided by the superior abilities of Constantine who directed a body of five thousand men to gain an advantage ous height from whence during the heat of the action they at tacked the rear of the enemy and made a very considerable slaugh ter The troops of Licinius however presenting a double front still maintained their ground till the approach of night put an end to the combat and secured their retreat towards the mountains of Macedonia 9Â The loss of two battles and of his bravest veterans reduced the fierce spirit of Licinius to sue for peace His ambas sador Mistrianus was admitted to the audience of Constantine he expatiated on the common topics of moderation aud humanity which are so familiar to the eloquence of the vanquished repre sented in the most insinuating language that the event of the war was still doubtful whilst its inevitable calamities were alike pernicious to both the contending parties and declared that he was authorised to propose a lasting and honourable peace in the name of the two emperors his masters Constantine received the mention of Valens with indignation and contempt It was not M for such a purpose he sternly replied that we have advanced u from the banks of the western ocean in an uninterrupted course of combats and victories that after rejecting an ungrateful kins  man we should accept for our colleague a contemptible slave  The abdication of Valens is the first article of the treaty It was necessary to accept this humiliating condition and the unhappy Valens after a reign of a few days was deprived of the purple and of his life As soon as this obstacle was removed the tran quillity of the Roman world was easily restored The successive de feat OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 439 feats of Licinius had ruined his forces but they had displayed his courage and abilities His situation was almost desperate but the efforts of despair are sometimes formidable and the good fense of Constantine preferred a great and certain advantage to a third trial of the chance of arms He consented to leave his rival or as he again Treaty of   peace styled Licinius his friend and brother in the possession of Thrace December Asia Minor Syria and Egypt but the provinces of Pannonia Dal matia Dacia Macedonia and Greece were yielded to the western empire and the dominions of Constantine extended from the confines of Caledonia to the extremity of Peloponnesus It was stipulated by the fame treaty that three royal youths the sons of the emperors should be called to the hopes of the succession Crispus and the younger Constantine were soon afterwards declared CÃ sars in the West while the younger Licinius was invested with the fame dignity in the East In this double proportion of honours the conqueror asserted the superiority of his arms and power  The reconciliation of Constantine and Licinius though it was General peace embittered by resentment and jealousy by the remembrance of reâ Constantine cent injuries and by the apprehension of future dangers main 3 3 3 S tained however above eight years the tranquillity of the Roman world Asa very regular series of the imperial laws commences about this period it would not be difficult to transcribe the civil re gulations which employed the leisure of Constantine But the most important of his institutions are intimately connected with the new system of policy and religion which was not perfectly cstablisiHed till the last and peaceful years of his reign There are many of his laws which as far as they concern the rights and property of indi viduals and the practice of the bar are more properly referred to the private than to the public jurisprudence of the empire and he â published many edicts of so local and temporary a nature that they would ill deserve the notice of a general history Two laws how ever may be selected from the crowd the one for its importance the THE DECLINE AND FALL the other for its singularity the former for its singular benevo lence the latter for its excessive severity i 1 he horrid practice so familiar to the ancients of exposing or murdering their new born infants was become every day more frequent in the provinces and especially in Italy It was the effect of distress and the dis tress was principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes and by the vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their insolvent debtors The less opulent or less industrious part of mankind instead of rejoicing in an increase of family deemed it an act of paternal tenderness to release their chil dren from the impending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to support The humanity of Constantine moved perhaps by some recent and remarkable instances of despair en gaged him to address an edict to all the cities of Italy and after wards of Africa directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to those parents who should produce before the magistrates the children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate But the promise was too liberal and the provision too vague to effect any general or permanent benefit9I The law though it may merit some praise served rather to display than to alleviate the public distress It still remains an authentic monument to contradict and confound those venal orators who were too well satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or misery under the govern ment of a generous sovereign 9 2 The laws of Constantine against rapes were dictated with very little indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature since the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal violence which compelled but even to the gentle seduction which might persuade an un married woman under the age of twenty five to leave the house of her parents The successful ravisher was punished with  death and as if simple death was inadequate to the enormity  of his guilt he was either burnt alive or torn in pieces by wild beasts OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4 â beasts in the amphitheatre The virgin s declaration that she had been carried away with her own consent instead of saving her lover exposed her to share his fate The duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the parents of the guilty or unfor w tunate maid and if the sentiments of Nature prevailed on them  to dissemble the injury and to repair by a subsequent marriage the u honour of their family they were themselves punished by exile and confiscation The slaves whether male or female who were con  victed of having been accessary to the rape or seduction were burnt  alive or put to death by the ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity of melted lead As the crime was of a public species the accusation was permitted even to strangers The commencement of the action was not limited to any term of years and the consequences of the sentence were extended to the innocent offspring of such an irregular union 9S But whenever the offence inspires less horror than the punishment the rigour of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of man kind The most odious parts of this edict were softened or re pealed in the subsequent reigns 96 and even Constantine himself very frequently alleviated by partial acts of mercy the stern tem per of his general institutions Such indeed was the singular hu mour of that emperor who shewed himself as indulgent and even remiss in the execution of his laws as he was severe and even cruel in the enacting of them â It is scarcely possible to observe a more decisive symptom of weakness either in the character of the prince or in the constitution of the government97 The civil administration was sometimes interrupted by the mili The Gothic tary defence of the empire Crispus a youth of the most amiable A b 322 character who had received with the title of CÃ sar the command of the Rhine distinguished his conduct as well as

grandson of Constantius 9 The emperor himself had assumed the more difficult and important province of the Danube The Goths who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian had felt the weight of the Roman arms respected the power of the empire even in the midst of its intestine divisions But the strength of that warlike nation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years a new generation had arisen who no longer remembered the misfortunes of ancient days the Sarmatians of the lake Maeotis followed the Gothic standard either as subjects or as allies and their united force was poured upon the countries of Illyricum Campona Margus and Bononia appear to have been the scenes of several memorable sieges and battles and though Constantine en countered a very obstinate resistance he prevailed at length in the  contest and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious retreat by restoring the booty aad prisoners which they had taken Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the emperor He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barba rians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome At the head of his legions he passed the Danube on the bridge which had been constructed by Trajan penetrated into the strongest recestes of Dacia co and when he had inflicted a severe revenge condescended i to give peace to the suppliant Goths on condition that as often as they were required they mould supply his armies with a body of forty thousand soldiers  Exploits like these were no doubt honourable to Constantine and beneficial to the state but it may surely be questioned whether they can justify the exaggerated as sertion of Eusebius that all Scythia as far as the extremity of the North divided as it was into so many names and nations of the most various and savage manners had been added by bis victorious arms to the Roman empire c Second civil In this exalted state of glory it was impossible that Constantine constantine hÂ uld any longer endure a partner in the empire Confiding in the and Licinius superiority OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE superiority of his genius and military power he determined with out any previous injury to exert them for the destruction of Licinius whose advanced age and unpopular vices seemed tt offer a very easy conquest 0J But the old emperor awakened by the approach ing danger deceived the expectations of his friends as well as of his enemies Calling forth that spirit and those abilities by which he had deserved the friendship of Galerius and the imperial purple he prepared himself for the contest collected the forces of the East and soon filled the plains of Hadrianople with his troops and the Streights of the Hellespont with his fleet The army con sisted of one hundred and fifty thousand foot and fifteen thousand horse and as the cavalry was drawn for the most part from Phrygia and Cappadocia we may conceive a more favourable opinion of the beauty of the horses than of the courage and dexterity of their riders The fleet was composed of three hundred and fifty gallies p of three ranks of oars An hundred and thirty of these were fur nished by Egypt and the adjacent coast of Africa An hundred and ten sailed from the ports of PhÅ nicia and the ifle of Cyprus and the maritime countries of Bithynia Ionia and Caria were likewise obliged to provide an hundred and ten gallies The troops of Constantine were ordered to rendezvous at Theflalonica they amounted to above an hundred and twenty thousand horse and foot Â 4 Their emperor was satisfied with their martial ap pearance and his army contained more soldiers though fewer men than that of his eastern competitor The legions of Constantine were levied in the warlike provinces of Europe action had confirmed their discipline victory had elevated their hopes and there were among them a great number of veterans who after seventeen glorious campaigns under the fame leader prepared them selves to deserve an honourable dismission by a last effort of their valour  But the naval preparations of Constantine were in every L 1 1 2 respect 144 THE DECLINE AND FALL respect much inferior to those of Licinius The maritime cities of Greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the celebrated harbour of PirÃ us and their united force consisted of no more than two hundred small vessels a very feeble armament if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped and maintained by the republic of Athens during the Peloponnesian war c6 Since Italy was no longer the feat of government the naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually neglected and as the shipping and mariners of the empire were supported by commerce rather than by war it was natural that they should the most abound in the industrious provinces of Egypt and Asia It is only surprising that the eastern emperor who possessed so great a superiority at sea should have neglected the opportunity of carrying an offensive war into the center of his rival s dominions BattleofHa 1 Instead of embracing such an active resolution which might have a d 3Z3 changed the whole face of the war the prudent Licinius expected JuIy 3Â tke approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople which he had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension of the event Gonstantine directed his march from Thessalonica towards that part of Thrace till he found himself stopped by the broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus and discovered the numerous army of Licinius which filled the steep ascent of the hill from the river to the city of Hadrianople Many days were spent in doubt ful and distant skirmishes but at length the obstacles of the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of Con stantme In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of Constantine which though it can scarcely be paralleled either ia poetry or romance is celebrated not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune but by an historian the partial enemy of his fame We are assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the river Hebrua accompanied only by twelve horsemen and that by a the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 445 the effort or terror of his invincible arm he broke slaughtered and put to flight a host of an hundred and fifty thousand men The credulity of Zosimus prevailed so strongly over his passion that among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople he seems to have selected and embellished not the most important but the most marvellous The valour and danger of Constantino are attested by a flight wound which he received in the thigh but it may be discovered even from an imperfect narration and perhaps a corrupted text that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero that a body of five thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy whose attention was diverted by the prepa ration of a bridge and that Licinius perplexed by so many artful evolutions was reluctantly drawn from his advantageous post to combat on equal ground in the plain The contest was no longer equal His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquished by the experienced veterans of the West Thirty four thousand men are reported to have been slain The fortified camp of Lici nius was taken by assault the evening of the battle the greater part of the fugitives who had retired to the mountains surrendered then selves the next day to the discretion of the conqueror and his rival who could no longer keep the field confined himself within the walls of Byzantium p7 The siege of Byzantium which was immediately undertaken by Siege of By  i â i ii i â t ntiumand Constantine was attended with great labour and uncertainty In naval victory the late civil wars the fortifications of that place so justly considered of CnsPw as the key of Europe and Asia had been repaired and

continued inactive in those nar row streights where its superiority of numbers was of little use or advantage Crispus the emperor s eldest son was intrusted with the execution of this daring enterprise which he performed with so much courage and success that he deserved the esteem and most probably excited the jealousy of his father The engagement lasted two days and in the evening of the first the contending fleets after a considerable and mutual loss retired into their respective harbours of Europe and Asia The second day about noon a strong south wind 08 sprang up which carried the vessels of Crispus against the enemy and as the casual advantage was im proved by his stcilful intrepidity he soon obtained a complete victory An hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed five thou sand men were slain and Amandus the admiral of the Asiatic fleet escaped with the utmost difficulty to the mores of Chalcedon As soon as the Hellespont was open a plentiful convoy of pro visions flowed into the camp of Constantine who had already advanced the operations of the siege He constructed artificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzan tium The lofty towers which were erected on that foundation galled the besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places If Licinius persisted much longer in the defence he ex posed himself to be involved in the ruin of the place Before he wras surrounded he prudently removed his person and treasures to Chalcedon in Asia and as he was always

sixty thousand men while the activity of Coa stantine was employed in the siege of Byzantium The vigilant emperor did not however neglect the last struggles of his antagonist A considerable part of his victorious army was transported over the Bosphorus in small vessels and the decisive engagement was fought soon after their landing on the heights of Chrysopolis or as it is now called of Scutari The troops of Licinius though  they were lately raised ill armed and worse disciplined made head against their conquerors with fruitless but desperate valour till a total defeat and the slaughter of five and twenty thousand men irretrievably determined the fate of their leader He retired to Nicomedia rather with ihe view of gaining some time for nego fnddewhof ciation than with the hope of any effectual defence Constantia L cimo his wife and the sister of Constantine interceded with her brother in favour of her husband and obtained from his policy rather than from hiss compassion a solemn promise confirmed by an oath that after the sacrifice of Martinianus and the resignation of the purple Licinius himself should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in peace and affluence The behaviour of Constantia and her relation to the contending parties naturally recalls the remembrance of that vir tuous matron who was the sister of Augustus and the wife of An tony But the temper of mankind was altered and it was no longer esteemed infamous for a Roman to survive his honour and independence Licinius solicited and accepted the pardon of his offences laid himself and his purple at the feet of his lord and mq lery was raised from the ground with insulting pity was admitted the fame day to the imperial banquet and soon afterwards was sent away to Theffalonica which had been chosen for the place of his confinement11 His confinement was soon terminated by death and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the soldiers or a decree of the senate was sug gested as the motive for his execution According to the rules of tyranny he was accused of forming a conspiracy and of holding a treasonable 448 THE DECLINE AND FALL treasonable correspondence with the barbarians but as he

and precision not only as the events are in themselves both interesting and important but still more as they contributed to the decline of the empire by the expence of blood and treasure and by the perpetual increase as well of the taxes as of the military establishment The foundation of Constantinople and the establishment of the Christian religion were the immediate and memorable consequences of this revolution CHAP OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 449 CHAP XV The Progress of the Christian Religion and the Senti ments Manners Numbers and Condition of the pri mitive Christians Acandid but rational inquiry into the progress and establish importanceof ment of Christianity may be considered as a very essential y part of the history of the Roman Empire While that great body was invaded by open violence or undermined by flow decay a pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men grew up in silence and obscurity derived new vigour from opposition and finally erected the triumphant banner of the cross on the ruins of the capitol Nor was the influence of Christianity confined to the period or to the limits of the Roman empire After a revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries that religion is still profesied by the nations of Europe the most distinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms By the industry and zeal of the Europeans it has been widely diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa and by the means of their colonies has been firmly established from Canada to Chili in a world unknown to the ancients But this inquiry however useful or entertaining is attended Its difficulties with two peculiar difficulties The scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church The great law of im partiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the gospel  and to a careless observer their faults may seem to cast a shade on the faith which Vol L M m m they kjp THE DECLINE AND FALL they professed But the scandal of the pious Christian and the fal lacious triumph of the Infidel should cease as soon as they recol lect not only by ivhom but likewise to whom the Divine Reve lation was given The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing Religion as she descended from Heaven arrayed in her native purity A more melancholy duty is imposed on the his torian He must discover the inevitable mixture of error and cor ruption which she contracted in a long residence upon earth among a weak and degenerate race of beings Five causes of Our curiosity k naturally prompted to inquire by what means ChrManity the Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the esta blished religions of the earth To this inquiry an obvious but satisfactory answer may be returned That it was owing to the con vincing evidence of the doctrine itself and to the ruling providence of its great Author But as truth and reason seldom find so favour able a reception in the world and as the wisdom of Providence fre quently condescends to use the passions of the human heart and the general circumstances of mankind as instruments to execute its purpose we may still be permitted though with becoming sub mission to ask not indeed what were the first but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth of the Christian church It will perhaps appear that it was most effectually favoured and assisted by the five following causes I The inflexible and if we may use the expression the intolerant zeal of the Christians de rived it is true from the Jewish religion but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which instead of inviting had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses II The doctrine of a future life improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth III The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church IV The pure and austere morals of the Christians V The union and discipline of the Christian republic which gradually formed  an 3 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 43 an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire I We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient The First world and the facility with which the most different and even hos Zealof the tile nations embraced or at least respected each other s superstitions ews A single people refused to join in the common intercourse of man kind The Jews who under the Assyrian and Persian monarchies had languished for many ages the most despised portion of their slaves emerged from obscurity under the successors of Alexander and as they multiplied to a surprising degree in the East and after wards in the West they soon excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations  The sullen obstinacy with which they main tained their peculiar rites and unsocial manners seemed to mark them out a distinct species of men who boldly professed or who faintly disguised their implacable hatred to the rest of human kind Neither the violence of Antiochus nor the arts of Herod nor the example of the circumjacent nations could ever persuade the Jews to associate with the institutions of Moses the elegant mythology of the Greeks According to the maxims of universal toleration the Romans protected a superstition which they despiseds The polite Augustus condescended to give orders that sacrifices should be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem6 while the meanest of the posterity of Abraham who should have paid the same homage to the Jupiter of the capitol would have been an object of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren The mode ration of the conquerors was insufficient to appease the jealous pre judices of their subjects who were alarmed and scandalized at the ensigns of paganism which necessarily introduced themselves into a Roman province 7 The mad attempt of Caligula to place his own statue in the temple of Jerusalem was defeated by the unani mous resolution of a people who dreaded death much less than such an idolatrous profanation 8 Their attachment to the law of Moses M m m 2 was THE DECLINE AND FALL 4S2 Its gradual increase Their reli gion better suited to de fence than to conquest was equal to their detestation of foreign religions The current of zeal and devotion as it was contracted into a narrow channel ran with the strength and sometimes with the fury of a torrent This inflexible perseverance which appeared so odious or so ri diculous to the ancient world assumes a more awful character since Providence has deigned to reveal to us the mysterious his tory of the chosen people But the devout and even scrupulous attachment to the Mosaic religion so conspicuous among the Jews who lived under the second temple becomes still more surprising if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their forefathers When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai when the tides of the ocean and the course of the planets were suspended for the convenience of the Israelites and when temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences of their piety or disobedience they perpetually relapsed into rebellion against the visible majesty of their Divine King placed the idols of the nations in the sanctuary of Jehovah and imitated every fantastic ceremony that was practised in the tents of the Arabs or in the cities of PhÅ nicia 9 As the protection of Heaven was deservedly withdrawn from the ungrateful race their faith acquired a proportionable de gree of vigour and purity The contemporaries of Moses and Joshua had beheld with careless indifference the most amazing miracles Under the pressure of every calamity the belief of those miracles has preserved the Jews of a later period from the universal contagion of idolatry and in contradiction to every known prin ciple of the human mind that singular people seems to have yielded a stronger and more ready assent to the traditions of their remote ancestors than to the evidence of their own fenses The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for defence but it wa never designed for conquest and it seems probable that the num ber of proselytes was never much superior to that of apostates The divine promises were originally made and the distinguishing rite of circumcision OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE circumcision was enjoined to a single family When the posterity of Abraham had multiplied like the sands of the sea the Deity from whose mouth they received a system of laws and ceremonies declared himself the proper and as it were the national God of Israel and with the most jealous care separated his favourite peo ple from the rest of mankind The conquest of the land of Canaan was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances that the victorious Jews were left in a state of irre concilable hostility with all their neighbours They had been com manded to extirpate some of the most idolatrous tribes and the execution of the Divine will had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or alliances and the prohibition of re ceiving them into the congregation which in some cafes was per petual almost always extended to the third to the seventh or even to the tenth generation The obligation of preaching to the Gen tiles the faith of Moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a voluntary duty In the admission of new citizens that unsocial people was actuated by the selfish vanity of the Greeks rather than by the generous policy of Rome The descendants of Abraham were flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the covenant and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the earth A larger acquaintance with mankind extended their know ledge without correcting their prejudices and whenever the God of Israel acquired any new votaries he was much more indebted to the inconstant humour of polytheism than to the active zeal of his own missionaries The religion of Moses seems to be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single nation and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order that every male three times in the year should present himself before the Lord Jehovah it would have 454 THE DECLINE AND FALL have been impossible that the Jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the promised land 1That obstacle was indeed removed by the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem but the most considerable part of the Jewish religion was involved in its destruction and the pagans who had long wondered at the strange report of an empty sanctuary  were at a loss to discover what could be the object or what could be the instruments of a worship which was destitute of temples and of altars of priests and of sacri fices Yet even in their fallen state the Jews still asserting their lofty and exclusive privileges shunned instead of courted the society of strangers They still insisted with inflexible rigour on those parts of the law which it was in their power to practise Their peculiar distinctions of days of meats and a variety of trivial though burdensome observances were so many objects of disgust and aversion for the other nations to whose habits and pre judices they were diametrically opposite The painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue More liberal Under these circumstances Christianity offered itself to the world xcsl oFChri fiianity armed with the strength of the Mosaic law and delivered from the weight of its fetters An exclusive zeal for the truth of religion and the unity of God was as carefully inculcated in the new as in the ancient system and whatever was now revealed to mankind concerning the nature and the designs of the Supreme Being was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious doctrine The divine authority of Moses and the prophets was admitted and even established as the firmest basis of Christianity From the be ginning of the world an uninterrupted series of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Messiah who in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the Jews had been more frequently represented under the character of a King and Conqueror than under that of a Prophet a Martyr and the Son of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 455 of God By his expiatory sacrifice the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were at once consummated and abolished The ceremonial law which consisted only of types and figures was succeeded by a pure and spiritual worship equally adapted to all climates as well as to every condition of mankind and to the initiation of blood was substituted a more harmless initiation of water The promise of divine favour instead of being partially confined to the posterity of Abraham was universally proposed to the freeman and to the slave to the Greek and to the barbarian to the Jew and to the Gentile Every privilege that could raise the proselyte from earth to Heaven that could exalt his devotion secure his happiness or even gratify that secret pride which under the semblance of devotion insinuates itself into the human heart was still reserved for the members of the Christian church but at the fame time all mankind was per mitted and even solicited to accept the glorious distinction which was not only proffered as a favour but imposed as an obligation It became the most sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among  his friends and relations the inestimable blefling which he had re ceived and to warn them against a refusal that would be severely puniflied as a criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but all powerful deity The enfranchisement of the church from the bonds of the syna Obstinacyand gogue was a work however of some time and of some difficulty beteWnjf The Jewish converts who acknowledged Jesus in the character of Jews the Messiah foretold by their ancient oracles respected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion but they obstinately ad hered to the ceremonies of their ancestors and were desirous of imposing them on the Gentiles who continually augmented the number of believers These Judaismg Christians seem to have ar gued with some degree of plausibility from the divine origin of the Mosaic law and from the immutable perfections of its great author They affirmed that if the Being who is the fame through all eternity 456 THE DECLINE AND FALL eternity had designed to abolish those sacred rites which had served to distinguish his chosen people the repeal of them would have been no less clear and solemn than their first promulgation that instead of those frequent declarations which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of the Mosaic religion it would have been re presented as a provisionary scheme intended to last only till the coming of the Messiah who should instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship  that the Messiah him self and his disciples who conversed with him on earth instead of authorizing by their example the most minute observances of the Mosaic law 5 would have published to the world the abolition of those useless and obsolete ceremonies without suffering Christianity to remain during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the Jewish church Arguments like these appear to have been used in the defence of the expiring cause of the Mosaic law but the industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the ambiguous language of the Old Testament and the ambiguous conduct of the apostolic teachers It was proper gradually to un fold the system of the Gospel and to pronounce with the utmost caution and tenderness a sentence of condemnation so repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing Jews TheNaza The history of the church of Jerusalem affords a lively proof ofjerusaiem of the necessity of those precautions and of the deep impression which the Jewish religion had made on the minds of its sectaries The first fifteen bishops of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews and the congregation over which they presided united the law of Moses with the doctrine of Christ s It was natural that the pri mitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days  after the death of Christ and was governed almost as many years under the immediate inspection of his apostles should be received as the standard of orthodoxy  The distant churches very fre quently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent and relieved OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms But when numerous and opulent societies were established in the great cities of the empire in Antioch Alexandria Ephesus Corinth and Rome the reverence which Jerusalem had inspired to all the Christian co lonies insensibly diminished The Jewish converts or as they were afterwards called the Nazarenes who had laid the foundations of the church soon found themselves overwhelmed by the increasing mul titudes that from all the various religions of polytheism inlisted under the banner of Christ and the Gentiles who with the ap probation of their peculiar apostle had rejected the intolerable weight of Mosaic ceremonies were gradually tempted to refuse to their more scrupulous brethren the fame toleration which at first they had humbly solicited for their own practice The ruin of the temple of the city and of the public religion of the Jews was severely felt by the Nazarenes as in their manners though not in their faith they maintained so intimate a connexion with their im pious countrymen whose misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to the contempt and more justly ascribed by the Christians to the wrath of the supreme deity The Nazarenes retired from the ruins of Jerusalem to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan where that ancient church languished above sixty years in solitude and obscurity 8 They still enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout visits to the Holy City and the hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature and religion taught them to sove as well as to revere But at length under the reign of Ha drian the desperate fanaticism of the Jews filled up the measure of their calamities and the Romans exasperated by their re peated rebellions exercised the rights of victory with rigour The emperor founded under the name of Ã lia Capitolina a new city on Mount Sion  to which he gave the privileges of a colony and denouncing the severest penalties against any of the Jewish people who should dare to approach its precincts he fixed a vigilant Vol I Nnn garrison THE DECLINE AND FALL garrison of a Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders The Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common pro scription and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by the influence of temporal advantages They elected Marcus for their bishop a prelate of the race of the Gentiles and most probably a native either of Italy or of some of the Latin provinces At his persuasion the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the Mosaic law in the practice of which they had persevered above a century By this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices they purchased a free admission into the colony of Hadrian and more firmly cemented their union with the Catholic church  ThaEhic When the name and honours of the church of Jerusalem had a es â been restored to Mount Sion the crimes of heresy and schism were imputed to the obscure remnant of the Nazarenes which refused to accompany their Latin bishop They still preserved their former habitation of Pella spread themselves into the villages adjacent to Damascus and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of Boerea or as it is now called Aleppo in Syria The name of Nazarenes was deemed too honourable for those Christian Jews and they soon received from the supposed poverty of their understanding as well as of their condition the contemptuous epithet of Ebionites  In a few years after the return of the church of Jerusalem it became a matter of doubl and controversy whether a man who sincerely acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah but who still continued to ob serve the law of Moses could possibly hope for salvation The humane temper of Justin Martyr inclined him to answer this ques tion in the affirmative and though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffidence he ventured to determine in favour of such an imperfect Christian if he were content to practise the Mosaic ceremonies without pretending to assert their general use or neces sity But when Justin was pressed to declare the sentiment of the church he confessed that there were very many among the ortho dox OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE dox Christians who not only excluded their Judaizing brethren from the hope of salvation but who declined any intercourse with them in the common offices of friendship hospitality and social life  The more rigorous opinion prevailed as it was natural to expect over the milder and an eternal bar of separation was fixed between the disciples of Moses and those of Christ The unfor tunate Ebionites rejected from one religion as apostates and from the other as heretics found themselves compelled to assume a more decided character and although some traces of that obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century they insensibly melted away either into the church or the synagogue While the orthodox church preserved a just medium between The Gnostic excessive veneration and improper contempt for the law of Moses the various heretics deviated into equal but opposite extremes of error and extravagance From the acknowledged truth of the Jewish religion the Ebionites had concluded that it could never be abolished From its supposed imperfections the Gnostics as hastily inferred that it never was instituted by the wisdom of the Deity There are some objections against the authority of Moses and the prophets which too readily present themselves to the sceptical mind though they can only be derived from our ignorance of remote anti quity and from our incapacity to form an adequate judgment of the divine Å conomy These objections were eagerly embraced and as petulantly urged by the vain science of the Gnostics s As those heretics were for the most part averse to the pleasures of fense they morosely arraigned the polygamy of the patriarchs the gal lantries of David and the seraglio of Solomon The conquest of the land of Canaan and the extirpation of the unsuspecting natives they were at a loss how to reconcile with the common notions of hu manity and justice But when they recollected the sanguinary list of murders of executions and of massacres which stain almost every page of the Jewish annals they acknowledged that the bar N n n 2 bariaas THE DECLINE AND FALL barians of Palestine had exercised as much compassion towards their idolatrous enemies as they had ever shewn to their friends or countrymen l6 Passing from the sectaries of the law to the law itself they asserted that it was impossible that a religion which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling ceremonies and whose rewards as well as punishments were all of a carnal and temporal nature could inspire the love of virtue or restrain the impetuosity of passion The Mosaic account of the creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the Gnostics who would not listen with patience to the repose of the deity after six days labour to the rib of Adam the garden of Eden the trees of life and of knowledge the speaking serpent the forbidden fruit and the eternal condemnation pronounced against human kind for the venial offence of their first progenitorsa7 The God of Israel was impiously represented by the Gnostics as a being liable to passion and to error capricious in his favour implacable in his resentment meanly jealous of his superstitious worship and con fining his partial providence to a single people and to this transitory Use In such a character they could discover none of the features of the wife and omnipotent father of the universe l They allowed that the religion of the Jews was somewhat less criminal than the idolatry of the Gentiles but it was their fundamental doctrine that the Christ whom they adored as the first and brightest emanation of the deity appeared upon earth to rescue mankind from their va rious errors and to reveal a neiv system of truth and perfection The most learned of the fathers by a very singular condescension1 have imprudently admitted the sophistry of the Gnostics Ac knowledging that the literal fense is repugnant to every principle of faith as well as reason they deem themselves secure and in vulnerable behind the ample veil of allegory which they carefully spread over every tender part of the Mosaic dispensatioa It OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 461 It has been remarked with more ingenuity than truth that the The r 5ct Â 0 â 4 progress and virgin purity of the church was never violated by schism or herely influence before the reign of Trajan or Hadrian about one hundred years after the death of Christ o We may observe with much more propriety that during that period the disciples of the Messiah were indulged in a freer latitude both of faith and practice than has ever been allowed in succeeding ages As the terms of communion were insensibly narrowed and the spiritual authority of the prevailing party was exercised with increasing severity many of its most respectable adherents who were called upon to renounce were provoked to assert their private opinions to pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles and openly to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the church The Gnostics were dis tinguished as the most polite the most learned and the most wealthy of the Christian name and that general appellation which expressed a superiority of knowledge was either assumed by their own pride or ironically bestowed by the envy of their adversaries They were almost without exception of the race of the Gentiles and their principal founders seem to have been natives of Syria or Egypt where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the body to contemplative devotion The Gnostics blended with the faith of Christ many sublime but obscure tenets which they derived from oriental philosophy and even from the religion of Zoroaster concerning the eternity of matter the existence of two principles and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible world As soon as they launched out into that vast abyss they delivered themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination and as the paths of error are various and infinite the Gnostics were imperceptibly divided into more than fifty particular sects  of whom the most celebrated appear to have been the Basilidians the Yalentinians the Marcionites and in a still later period the  ManichÃ ans 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL ManichÃ ans Each of these sects could boast of its bistiops and congregations of its doctors and martyrs and instead of the four gospels adopted by the church the heretics produced a mul titude of histories in which the actions and discourses of Christ and of his apostles were adapted to their respective tenets K The success of the Gnostics was rapid and extensive They covered Asia and Egypt established themselves in Rome and sometimes penetrated into the provinces of the West For the most part they arose in the second century flourished during the third and were suppressed in the fourth or fifth fcy the prevalence of more fashion able controversies and by the superior ascendant of the reigning power Though they constantly disturbed the peace and fre quently degraded the honour of religion they contributed to aflist rather than to retard the progress of Christianity The Gen tile converts whose strongest objections and prejudices were di rected against the law of Moses could find admission into many Christian societies which required not from their untutored mind any belief of an antecedent revelation Their faith was insensibly fortified and enlarged and the church was ultimately benefited by the conquests of its most inveterate enemies 6 The dÃ mons But whatever difference of opinion might subsist between the the gods of Orthodox the Ebionites and the Gnostics concerning the divinity or the obligation of the Mosaic law they were all equally animated by the same exclusive zeal and by the same abhorrence for idolatry which had distinguished the Jews from the other nations of the ancient world The philosopher who considered the system of polytheism as a composition of human fraud and error could dis guise a smile of contempt under the mask of devotion without ap prehending that either the mockery or the compliance would ex pose him to the resentment of any invisible or as he conceived them imaginary powers But the established religions of Paganism were seen antiquity GF THE ROMAN EMPIRE seen by the primitive Christians in a much more odious and formid able light It was the universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics that the dÃ mons were the authors the patrons and the objects of idolatry 57 Those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from the rank of angels and cast down into the infernal pit were still permitted to roam upon earth to torment the bodies and to seduce the minds of sinful men They soon discovered and abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards devotion and artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from their Creator they usurped the place and honours of the Supreme Deity By the success of their malicious contrivances they at once gratified their own vanity and revenge and obtained the only comfort of which they were yet susceptible the hope of involving the human species in the participation of their guilt and misery It was confessed or at least it was imagined that they had dis tributed among themselves the most important characters of poly theism one dÃ mon assuming the name and attributes of Jupiter another of Ã sculapius a third of Venus and a fourth perhaps of Apollo38 and that by the advantage of their long experience and aerial nature they were enabled to execute with sufficient skill and ignity the parts which they had undertaken They lurked in the temples instituted festivals and sacrifices invented fables pronounced oracles and were frequently allowed to perform miracles The Christians who by the interposition of the dÃ mons could so readily explain every prÃ ternatural appear ance were disposed and even desirous to admit the most extra vagant fictions of the Pagan mythology But the belief of the Christian was accompanied with horror The most trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the dÃ mon and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of God i la 4 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL Abhorrence of the Chris tians for idolatry Ceremonies Arts In consequence of this opinion it was the first but arduous duty â of a Christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the practice of idolatry The religion of the nations was not merely a specu lative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples The innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were closely inter woven with every circumstance of business or pleasure of public or of private life and it seemed impossible to escape their obser vance without at the same time renouncing the commerce of mankind and all the offices and amusements of society The important transactions of peace and war were prepared or con cluded by solemn sacrifices in which the magistrate the senator and the soldier were obliged to preside or to participate40 The public spectacles were an essential part of the cheerful devotion of the Pagans and the gods were supposed to accept as the most grateful offering the games that the prince and people celebrated in honour of their peculiar festivals  The Christian who with pious horror avoided the abomination of the circus or the theatre found himself encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial entertainment as often as his friends invoking the hospitable deities poured out libations to each other s happiness  When the bride struggling with well affected reluctance was forced in hymenÃ al pomp over the threshold of her new habitation 4 or when the sad procession of the dead slowly moved towards the funeral pile 4 the Christian on these interesting occasions was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him rather than contract the guilt inherent to those impious ceremonies Every art and every trade that was in the least concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the stain of idola try  a levere sentence since it devoted to eternal misery the far greater part of the community which is employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanic professions If we cast our eyes over the numerous remains of antiquity we shall perceive that besides the immediate OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE immediate representations of the Gods and the holy instruments of their worship the elegant forms and agreeable fictions con secrated by the imagination of the Greeks were introduced aÂ the richest ornaments of the houses the dress and the furniture of the Pagans 4Â Even the arts of music and painting of eloquence and poetry flowed from the fame impure origin In the style of the fathers Apollo and the Muses were the organs of the infernal spirit Homer and Virgil were the most eminent of his servants and the beautiful mythology which pervades and animates the compositions of their genius is destined to celebrate the glory of the dÃ mons Even the common language of Greece and Rome abounded with familiar but impious expressions which the im prudent Christian might too carelessly utter or too patiently hear 47 The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in Festival ambush to surprise the unguarded believer assailed him with re doubled violence on the days of solemn festivals So artfully were they framed and disposed throughout the year that super stition always wore the appearance of pleasure and often of vir tue 8 Some of the most sacred festivals in the Roman ritual were destined to salute the new calends of January with vows of public and private felicity to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead and living to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property to hail on the return of spring the genial powers of fecundity to per petuate the two memorable aeras of Rome the foundation of the city and that of the republic and to restore during the humane license of the Saturnalia the primitive equality of mankind Some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians for such impious ceremonies by the scrupulous delicacy which they dis played on a much less alarming occasion On days of general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel and to crown their heads Vol I O o o with 4 5 THE DECLINE AND FALL with a garland of flowers This innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution But it most unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the household gods that the laurel was sacred to the lover of Daphne and that garlands of flowers though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning had been dedicated in their first origin to the service of superstition The trembling Christians who were persuaded in this instance to comply with the fashion of their country and the commands of the magistrate laboured under the most gloomy apprehensions from the reproaches of their own conscience the censures of the church and the de nunciations of divine vengeance 5 Zeal for Such was the anxious diligence which was required to guard the Christianity cyia ty 0f tne gGfpei fr0m the infectious breath of idolatry The superstitious observances of public or private rites were carelessly prac tised from education and habit by the followers of the established religion But as often as they occurred they afforded the Christians an opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition By these frequent protestations their attachment to the faith was continually fortified and in proportion to the increase of zeal they combated with the more ardour and success in the holy war which they had undertaken against the empire of the dÃ mons The second If The writings of Cicero JÂ represent in the most livery colours The doctrine the ignorance the errors and the uncertainty of the ancient phi uijtyofthe losophers with regard to the immortality of the foul When he phToso ttey are denrous Â f arming their disciples against the fear of death phers thev inculcate as an obvious though melancholy position that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the calamities of life and that those can no longer suffer who no longer exist Yet there were a few sages of Greece and Rome who had conceived a more exalted and in some respects a juster idea of human nature though it must be confessed that in the sublime inquiry  their OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE their reason had been often guided by their imagination and that their imagination had been prompted by their vanity When they viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental powers when they exercised the various faculties of memory of fancy and of judgment in the most profound speculations or the most important labours and when they reflected on the desire of fame which transported them into future ages far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave they were unwilling to confound them selves with the beasts of the field or to suppose that a beings for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration could be limited to a spot of earth and to a few years of duration With this favourable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science or rather the language of Metaphysics They soon dis covered that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the operations of the mind the human foul must consequently be a substance distinct from the body pure simple and spiritual in capable of dissolution and susceptible of a much higher degree of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison From these specious and noble principles the philosophers who trod in the footsteps of Plato deduced a very unjustifiable conclu sion since they asserted not only the future immortality but the past eternity of the human soul which they were too apt to con sider as a portion of the infinite and self existing spirit which per vades and sustains the universe 51 A doctrine thus removed beyond the fenses and the experience of mankind might serve to amuse the leisure of a philosophic mind or in the silence of soli tude it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue but the faint impression which had been received in the schools was soon obliterated by the commerce and business of active life We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent per sons who flouriihed in the age of Cicero and of the first CÃ sars with their actions their characters and their motives to be assured O o o 2 that 468 THE DECLINE AND FALL that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state At the bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not appre hensive of giving offence to their hearers by exposing that doc trine as an idle and extravagant opinion which was rejected with contempt by every man of a liberal education and understand ing 51 among the Since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy can extend Pagans of Greece and no farther than feebly to point out the desire the hope or at most the probability of a future state there is nothing except a divine revelation that can ascertain the existence and describe the condition of the invisible country which is destined to receive the fouls of men after their separation from the body But we may perceive several defects inherent to the popular religions of Greece and Rome which rendered them very unequal to so arduous a task i The general system of their mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs and the wisest among the Pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority a The description of the infer nal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and of poets who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little equity that a solemn truth the most congenial to the human heart was oppressed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions 3 The doctrine of a future state was scarcely con sidered among the devout polytheists of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith The providence of the gods as it related to public communities rather than to private individuals was principally displayed on the visible theatre of the present world The private petitions which were offered on the altars of Jupiter or Apollo expressed the anxiety of their worshippers for temporal happiness and their ignorance or indifference concerning a future life  The important truth of the immortality of the foul was inculcated OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE inculcated with more diligence as well as success in India in mÂ ng the barbarians Assyria in Egypt and in Gaul and since we cannot attribute such a difference to the superior knowledge of the barbarians we must ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood which employed the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition JJ We might naturally expect that a principle so essential to imons he Jews religion would have been revealed in the clearest terms to the chosen people os Palestine and that it might safely have been en trusted to the hereditary priesthood of Aaron It is incumbent on us to adore the mysterious dispensations of providence s when we discover that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is omitted in the law of Moses j it is darkly insinuated by the prophets and during the long period which elapsed between the Egyptian and the Babylonian servitudes the hopes as well as fears of the Jews appear to have been confined within the narrow compass of the present life After Cyrus had permitted the exiled nation to return into the promised land and after Ezra had restored the ancient records of their religion two celebrated sects the Saducees and the Pharisees insensibly arose at Jerusalem 5 The former who claimed the most opulent and distinguished part of the society were strictly attached to the literal sense of the Mosaic law and they pioufly rejected the immortality of the soul as an opinion that received no countenance from the divine book which they revered as the only rule of their faith To the authority of scripture the Pharisees added that of tradition and they accepted under the name of traditions several speculative tenets from the philosophy or religion of the Eastern nations The doctrines of fate or pre destination of angels and spirits and of a future state of rewards and punishments were in the number of these new articles of belief and as the Pharisees by the austerity of their manners had drawn into their party the body of the Jewish people the immor tality of the soul became the prevailing sentiment of the synagogue I under 470 THE DECLINE AND FALL among the Chriltians Approaching Â nd of the world under the reign of the AsmonÃ an princes and pontiffs The tem per of the Jews was incapable of contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of a Poly thrift and as soon as they admitted the idea of a future state they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the nation Their zeal however added nothing to its evidence or even probability and it was still necessary that the doctrine of life and immortality which had been dictated by nature approved by reason and received by superstition should obtain the sanction of divine truth from the authority and example of Christ When the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind on condition of adopting the faith and of observing the precepts of the gospel it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer should have been accepted by great numbers of every religion of every rank and of every province in the Roman empire The ancient Christians were animated by a contempt for their present existence and by a just confidence of immortality of which the doubtful and imperfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion In the primitive church the influence of truth was very powerfully strengthened by an opinion which however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity has not been found agreeable to experience It was universally believed that the end of the worldÂ and the kingdom of Heaven were at hand The near approach of this wonderful event had been predicted by the apostles the tradition of it was preserved by their earliest disciples and those who understood in their literal sense the discourses of Christ himself were obliged to expect the second and glorious coming of the Son of Man in the clouds before that generation was totally extin guished which had beheld his humble condition upon earth and which might still be witness to the calamities of the Jews under Vespasian or Hadrian The revolution of seventeen centuries haa instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4 7 prophecy and revelation but as long as for wise purposes this error was permitted to subsist in the church it was productive of the most salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itself and all the various race of mankind should tremble at the appearance of their divine judge The ancient and popular doctrine of the Millennium was inti Doctrine of mately connected with the second coming of Christ As the works n 1 of the creation had been finished in six days their duration in their present state according to a tradition which was attributed to the prophet Elijah was fixed to fix thousand years6o By the fame analogy it was inferred that this long period of labour and con tention which was now almost elapsed 6 would be succeeded by a joyful Sabbath of a thousand years and that Christ with the tri umphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped death or who had been miraculously revived would reign upon earth till the time appointed for the last and general resurrection So pleasing was thifr hope to the mind of believers that the neiv Jerusalem the seat of this blissful kingdom was quickly adorned

human nature and senses A garden of Eden with the amusements of the pastoral Jife was no longer suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the Roman empire A city Was therefore erected of gold and precious stones and a supernatural plenty of corn and Wine was bestowed on the adjacent territory in the free enjoyment of whose spontaneous productions the happy and benevolent peo ple was never to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property6 The assurance of such a Millennium was carefully irtÂ culcated by a succession of the fathers from Justin Martyr and IrenÃ

as received by the general consent of the Christians of their own times and it seems so well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of mankind that it must have contributed in a very considerable degree to the progress of the Christian faith But when the edifice of the church was almost completed the temporary support was laid aside The doctrine of Christ s reign upon earth was at first treated as a pro found allegory was considered by degrees as a doubtful and useless opinion and was at length rejected as the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism 6 A mysterious prophecy which still forms a part of the sacred canon but which was thought to favour the exploded sentiment has very narrowly escaped the proscription of the church 6s Conflagration Whilst the happiness and glory of a temporal reign was promised of the world Â tne disciples of Christ the most dreadful calamities were de nounced against an unbelieving world The edification of the new Jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the mystic Babylon and as long as the emperors who reigned before Constantine persisted in the profession of idolatry the epithet of Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome A re gular series was prepared of all the moral and physical evils which can afflict a flourishing nation j intestine discord and the invasion Â f the fiercest barbarians from the unknown regions of the North j pestilence and famine comets and eclipses earthquakes and inun dations 66 All these were only so many preparatory and alarming signs of the great catastrophe of Rome when the country of the Scipios and CÃ sars should be consumed by a flame from Heaven and the city of the seven hills with her palaces her temples and her triumphal arches should be buried in a vast lake of fire and brimstone It might however afford some consolation to Roman vanity that the period of their empire would be that of the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 473 the world itself which as it had once perished by the element of water was destined to experience a second and a speedy destruction from the element of fire In the opinion of a general conflagration the faith of the Christian very happily coincided with the tradition of the East the philosophy of the Stoics and the analogy of Nature and even the country which had been chosen from religious motives for the origin and principal scene of the conflagration was the best adapted for that purpose by natural and physical causes by its deep caverns beds of sulphur and numerous volcanos of which those of Ã tna of Vesuvius and of Lipari exhibit a very imperfect re presentation The calmest and most intrepid sceptic could not re fuse to acknowledge that the destruction of the present system of  the world by fire was in itself extremely probable The Christian who founded his belief much less on the fallacious arguments of reason than on the authority of tradition and the interpretation of scripture expected it with terror and confidence as a certain and approaching event and as his mind was perpetually filled with the solemn idea he considered every disaster that happened to the em pire as an infallible symptom of an expiring world 6 The condemnation of the wisest and most virtuous of the pagans The pa ani on account of their ignorance or disbelief of the divine truth seems eteevrnai Â to offend the reason and the humanity of the present age But Punisliment the primitive church whose faith was of a much firmer consistence delivered over without hesitation to eternal torture the far greater part of the human species A charitable hope might perhaps be indulged in favour of Socrates or some other sages of antiquity who had consulted the light of reason before that of the gospel had arisen 69 But it was unanimously affirmed that those who since the birth or the death os Christ had obstinately persisted in the worship of the dÃ mons neither deserved nor could expect a pardon from the irritated justice of the Deity These rigid sentiments which had been unknown to the ancient world appear to have in Vol I P p p fused 74 THE DECLINE AND FALL fused a spirit of bitterness into a system of love and harmony The ties of blood and friendship were frequently torn asunder by the difference of religious faith and the Christians who in this world found themselves oppressed by the power of the pagans were some times seduced by resentment and spiritual pride to delight in the prospect of their future triumph You are fond of spectacles exclaims the stern Tertullian  expect the greatest of all spectacles the last and eternal judgment of the universe How shall I ad mire how laugh how rejoice how exult when I behold so many proud monarchs and fancied gods groaning in the lowest abyss of darkness so many magistrates who persecuted the name of the Lord liquefying in fiercer fires than they ever kindled against the Christians so many sage philosophers blushing in red  hot flames with their deluded scholars so many celebrated poets trembling before the tribunal not of Minos but of Christ so many tragedians more tuneful in the expression of their own sufferings so many dancers â But the humanity of the reader will permit me to draw a veil over the rest of this infernal descrip tion which the zealous African pursues in a long variety of affected and unfeeling witticisms 7 WeÂ often Doubtless there were many among the primitive Christians of a theiTfws by temper more suitable to the meekness and charity of their profession There were many who felt a sincere compassion for the danger of their friends and countrymen and who exerted the most benevolent zeal to save them from the impending destruction The careless Polytheist assailed by new and unexpected terrors against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could afford him any cer tain protection was very frequently terrified and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures His fears might assist the progress of his faith and reason and if he could once persuade himself to suspect that the Christian religion might possibly be true it became an easy talk OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 475 task to convince him that it was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly embrace III The supernatural gifts which even in this life were ascribed TheTH gD to the Christians above the rest of mankind must have conduced to Miracuious their own comfort and very frequently to the conviction of infidels p rive the Besides the occasional prodigies which might sometimes be effected church by the immediate interposition of the Deity when he suspended the laws of Nature for the service of religion the Christian church from the time of the apostles and their first disciples7 has claimed an uninterrupted succession of miraculous powers the gift of tongues of vision and of prophecy the power of expelling dÃ mons of healing the sick and of raising the dead The know ledge of foreign languages was frequently communicated to the con temporaries of IrenÃ us though IrenÃ us himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a barbarous dialect whilst he preached the gospel to the natives of Gaul 7 The divine inspiration whether it was conveyed in the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision is described as a favour very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful on women as on elders on boys as well as upon bishops When their devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer of fasting and of vigils to receive the extraordinary im pulse they were transported out of their senses and delivered in extasy what was inspired being mere organs of the holy spirit just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it7S We may add that the design of these visions was for the most part either to dis close the future history or to guide the present administration of the church The expulsion of the dÃ mons from the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted to torment was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of religion and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apologists as the most con vincing evidence of the truth of Christianity The awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner and in the presence of P p p 2 a great THE DECLINE AND FALL a great number of spectators the patient was relieved by the power or kill of the exorcist and the vanquished dÃ mon was heard to confess that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity who had impiously usurped the adoration of mankind 7 But the miracu lous cure of diseases of the most inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any surprise when we recollect that in the days of IrenÃ us about the end of the second century the resurrection of the dead was very far from being esteemed an un common event that the miracle was frequently performed on neces sary occasions by great fasting and the joint supplication of the church of the place and that the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterwards among them many years i At such a period when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories over death it seems difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the re surrection A noble Grecian had rested on this important ground the whole controversy and promised Theophilus bishop of Antiochj that if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had been actually raised from the dead he would immediately em brace the Christian religion It is somewhat remarkable that the prelate of the first eastern church however anxious for the con version of his friend thought proper to decline this fair and rea sonable challenge 6 The miracles of the primitive church after obtaining the sanc tion of ages have been lately attacked in a very free and in genious inquiry77 which though it has met with the most favourable reception from the Public appears to have excited a general scandal among the divines of our own as well as of the other protestant churches of Europe7 Our different sentiments of this controversy will be much less influenced by any particular argu ments than by our habits of study and reflection and above all by the degree of the evidence which we have accustomed ourselves to re quire OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 477 quire for the proof of a miraculous event The duty of an his Ourperpiext  ty in defining torian does not call upon him to interpose his private judgment in the miracu this nice and important controversy but he ought not to dissemble Â US fericd the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interest of religion with that of reason of making a proper application of that theory and of defining with precision the limits of that happy period exempt from error and from deceit to which we might be disposed to allow the gift of supernatural powers From the first of the fathers to the last of the popes a succession of bishops of saints of martyrs and of miracles is continued without interrup tion and the progress of superstition was so gradual and almost imperceptible that we know not in what particular link we should break the chain of tradition Every age bears testimony to the wonderful events by which it was distinguished and its testimony appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding generation till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own incon sistency if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable Bede or to the holy Bernard the same degree of con fidence which in the second century we had so liberally granted to Justin or to IrenÃ us 79 If the truth of any of those miracles is appreciated by their apparent use and propriety every age had un believers to convince heretics to confute and idolatrous nations to convert and sufficient motives might always be produced to justify the interposition of Heaven And yet since every friend to revelation is persuaded of the reality and every reasonable man is convinced of the cessation of miraculous powers it is evident that there must have been some period in which they were either sud denly or gradually withdrawn from the Christian church What ever Ã ra is chosen for that purpose the death of the apostles the conversion of the Roman empire or the extinction of the Arian heresy 8o the insensibility of the Christians who lived at that time will equally afford a just matter of surprise They still supported their 478 THE DECLINE AND FALL I their pretensions after they had lost their power Credulity per formed the office of faith fanaticism was permitted to assume the language of inspiration and the effects of accident or contrivance were ascribed to supernatural causes The recent experience of genuine miracles mould have instructed the Christian world in the ways of providence and habituated their eye if we may use a very inadequate expression to the style of the divine artist Should the most skilful painter of modern Italy presume to decorate his feeble imitations with the name of Raphael or of Correggio the in solent fraud would be soon discovered and indignantly rejected Use of the Whatever opinion may be entertained of the miracles of the miracles primitive church since the time of the apostles this unresisting soft ness of temper so conspicuous among the believers of the second and third centuries proved of some accidental benefit to the cause of truth and religion In modern times a latent and even involuntary scepticism adheres to the most pious dispositions Their admission of supernatural truths is much less an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence Accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of Nature our reason or at least our imagination is not sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the Deity But in the first ages of Christianity the situation of mankind was extremely different The most curious or the most credulous among the pagans were often persuaded to enter into a society which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers The primitive Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground and their minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraor dinary events They felt or they fancied that on every side they were incessantly assaulted by dÃ mons comforted by visions in structed by prophecy and surprisingly delivered from dan ger sickness and from death itself by the supplications of the church The real or imaginary prodigies of which they so fre quently conceived themselves to be the objects the instruments or OF THE ROM AN EMPIRE 479 or the spectators very happily disposed them to adopt with the same ease but with far greater justice the authentic wonders of the evangelic history and thus miracles that exceeded not the measure of their own experience inspired them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding It is this deep impression of supernatural truths which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith a state of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favour and of future felicity and recommended as the first or perhaps the only merit of a Christian According to the more rigid doctors the moral virtues which may be equally practised by infidels are destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our justification  IV But the primitive Christian demonstrated his faith by his The FOURTH virtues and it was very justly supposed that the divine persuasion cause â which enlightened or subdued the understanding must at the same first Chris time purify the heart and direct the actions of the believer The tians first apologists of Christianity who justify the innocence of their brethren and the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors display in the most lively colours the reforma tion of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel As it is my intention to remark only such human causes as were permitted to second the influence of revelation I shall slightly mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive Christians much purer and more austere than those of their Pagan contemporaries or their degenerate successors repentance for their past sins and the laudable desire of supporting the reputation of the society in which they were engaged It is a very ancient reproach suggested by the ignorance or the Effect of malice of infidelity that the Christians allured into their party the ince most atrocious criminals who as soon as they were touched by a fense of remorse were easily persuaded to wash away in the water their

misrepresentation contributes as much to the honour as it did to the increase of the church 8 The friends of Christianity may acknowledge without a blush that many of the most eminent saints had been before their baptism the most abandoned of sinners Those persons who in the world had followed though in an imperfect manner the dictates of bene volence and propriety derived such a calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude as rendered them much less sus ceptible of the sudden emotions of shame of grief and of terror which have given birth to so many wonderful conversions After the example of their Divine Master the missionaries of the gospel addressed themselves to men and especially to women oppressed by the consciousness and very often by the effects of their vices As they emerged from sin and superstition to the glorious hope of immortality they resolved to devote themselves to a life not only of virtue but of penitence The desire of perfection became the ruling passion of their foul and it is well known that while reason embraces a cold mediocrity our passions hurry us with rapid violence over the space which lies between the most opposite extremes Care of their When the new converts had been enrolled in the number of the faithful and were admitted to the sacraments of the church they found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual but of a very innocent and respectable nature Any particular society that has departed from the great body of the nation or the religion to which it belonged immediately becomes the object of universal as well as invidious observation In proportion to the smallness of its num bers the character of the society may be affected by the virtues and vices of the persons who compose it and every member is en 7 gage â f puution OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE gaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over his own behaviour and over that of his brethren since as he must expect to incur a part of the common disgraee he may hope to enjoy a share of the common reputation When the Christians of Bi thynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny they assured the proconsul that far from being engaged in any unlawful conspiracy they were bound by a solemn obligation to abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the private or public peace of society from theft robbery adultery perjury and frauds Near a century afterwards Tertullian with an honest pride could boast that very few Christians had suffered by the hand of the executioner except on account of their religion Their serious and sequestered Use averse to the gay luxury of the age inured them to chastity temperance Å conomy and all the sober and domestic virtues As the greater number were of some trade or profession it was incumbent on them by the strictest integrity and the fairest dealing to remove the suspicions which the prophane are too apt to conceive against the appearances of sanctity The contempt of the world exercised them in the habits of humility meekness and patience The more they were persecuted the more closely they adhered to each other Their mutual charity and unsuspecting confidence has been remarked by infidels and was too often abused by perfidious friends 8 It is a very honourable circumstance for the morals of the primi Morality of tive Christians that even their faults or rather errors were derived the sather5 from an excess of virtue The bishops and doctors of the church whose evidence attests and whose authority might influence the professions the principles and even the practice of their con temporaries had studied the scriptures with less skill than devo tion and they often received in the most literal sense those rigid precepts of Christ and the apostles to which the prudence of succeeding commentators has applied a looser and more figurative Vol I Q q q mode THE DECLINE AND FALL Principles of human na mode of interpretation Ambitious to exalt the perfection of the gospel above the wisdom of philosophy the zealous fathers have carried the duties of self mortification of purity and of patience to a height which it is scarcely possible to attain and much less to preserve in our present state of weakness and corruption A doctrine so extraordinary and so sublime must inevitably command the veneration of the people but it was ill calculated to obtain the suffrage of those worldly philosophers who in the conduct of this transitory life consult the feelings of nature and the interest of society ts â There are two very natural propensities which we may dis twe tinguifh in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions the love of pleasure and the love of action If the former is refined by art and learning improved by the charms of social intercourse and cor rected by a just regard to Å conomy to health and to reputation it is productive of the greatest part of the happiness of private fife The love of action is a principle of a much stronger and mocc doubtful nature It often leads to anger to ambition and to revenge but when it is guided by the fense of propriety and bene volence it becomes the parent of every virtue and if those virtues are accompanied with equal abilities a family a state or an empire may be indebted for their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single man To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the agreeable to the love of action we may attribute most of the useful and respectable qualifications The character in which both the one and the other should be united and harmonised would seem to constitute the most perfect idea of human nature The insensible and inactive disposition which should be supposed alike destitute of both would be rejected by the common consent of mankind as utterly incapable of pro curing any happiness to the individual or any public benefit to the world But it was not in this world that the primitive Christians OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4 Christians were desirous of making themselves either agreeable or useful â  i  1  The acquisition of knowledge the exercise of our reason or fancy Theprimi and the cheerful flow of unguarded conversation may employ condem the leisure of a liberal mind They were rejected however with flTur nd abhorrence or admitted with the utmost caution by the severity of the fathers who despised all knowledge that was not useful to sal vation and who considered all levity of discourse as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech In our present state of existence the body is so inseparably connected with the soul that it seems to be our interest to taste with innocence and moderation the enjoy ments of which that faithful companion is susceptible Very different was the reasoning of our devout predecessors vainly aspiring to imitate the perfection of angels they disdained or they affected to disdain every earthly and corporeal delight S Some of our fenses indeed are necessary for our preservation others for our subsistence and others again for our information and thus far it was impossible to reject the use of them The first sensation of pleasure was marked as the first moment of their abuse The unfeeling candidate for Heaven was instructed not only to resist the grosser allurements of the taste or smell but even to shut his ears against the profane harmony of sounds and to view with indifference the most finished productions of human art gay apparel magnificent houses and elegant furniture were supposed to unite the double guilt of pride and of sensuality A simple and mortified appearance was more suitable to the Christian who was certain of his sins and doubtful of his salvation In their censures of luxury the fathers are extremely minute and cir cumstantial 87 and among the various articles which excite their pious indignation we may enumerate false hair garments of any colour except white instruments of music vases of gold or silver downy pillows as Jacob reposed his head on a stone white bread Qji q 2 foreign THE DECLINE AND FALL foreign wines public salutations the use of warm baths and the practice of shaving the beard which according to the expression of Tertullian is a lie against our own faces and an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator When Christianity was introduced among the rich and the polite the observation of these singular laws was left as it would be at present to the few who were ambitious of superior sanctity But it is always easy as well as agreeable for the inferior ranks of mankind to claim a m erit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach The virtue of the primitive Christians like that of the first Romans was very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance The chaste severity of the fathers in whatever related to the com merce of the two sexes flowed from the fame principle j their abhorrence of every enjoyment which might gratify the sensual and degrade the spiritual nature of man It was their favourite opinion that if Adam had preserved hi obedience to the Creator he would have lived and died in a state of virgin purity and that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with a Face of innocent and immortal beings 9 The use of mar riage was permitted only to his fallen posterity as a necessary ex pedient to continue the human species and as a restraint however imperfect on the natural licentiousness of desire The hesitation of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject betrays the per plexity of men unwilling to approve an institution which they were compelled to tolerate so The enumeration of the very whimsical laws which they most circumstantially imposed on the marriage bed would force a smile from the young and a blush from the fair It was their unanimous sentiment that a 6rst marriage was adequate to all the purposes of nature and of society The sensual connexion was refined into a resemblance of the mystic union of Christ with hja church and was pronounced to be indissoluble 5 either OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4 S by divorce or by death The practice of second nuptials branded with the name of a legal adultery and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous an offence against Christian purity were soon excluded from the honours and even from the alms of the church  Since desire was imputed as a crime and marriage was tolerated as a defect it was confident with the fame principles to consider a state of celibacy as the nearest approach to the Divine perfection It was with the utmost difficulty that ancient Rome could support the institution of six vestals 9 but the primitive church was filled with a great number of persons of either sex who had devoted themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity 9i A few of these among whom we may reckon the learned Origen judged it the most prudent to disarm the tempter 9 Some were insensible and some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh Disdaining an ignominious flight the virgins of the warm climate of Africa encountered the enemy in the closest engagement they permitted priests and deacons to share their bed and gloried amidst the flames in their unsullied purity But insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights and this new species of martyrdom served only to in troduce a new scandal into the church 9S Among the Christian ascetics however a name which they soon acquired from their painful exercise many as they were less presumptuous were pro bably more successful The loss of sensual pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride Even the multitude of Pagans were inclined to estimate the merit of the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty and it was in the praise of these chaste spouses of Christ that the fathers have poured forth the troubled stream of their eloquence a 5 Such are the early traces of monastic principles and institutions which in a subsequent age have counterbalanced all the temporal advantages of Christianity The Christians were not less averse to the business than to the Their

even though their criminal or hostile attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole community 9 It was acknowledged that under a less perfect law the powers of the Jewish constitution had been exercised with the approbation of Heaven by inspired prophets and by anointed kings The Christians felt and confessed that such institutions might be ne cessary for the present system of the world and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their Pagan governors But while they inculcated the maxims of passive obedience they refused to take any active part in the civil administration or the military defence of the empire Some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to those persons who before their conversion were already engaged in such violent and sanguinary occupations 99 but it was impossible that the Christians without renouncing a more sacred duty could assume the character of soldiers of magistrates or of princes 00 This indolent or even criminal disregard to the public welfare exposed them to the contempt and reproaches of the Pagans who very frequently asked what must be the fate of the empire attacked on every side by the barbarians if all mankind should adopt the pusillanimous sentiments of the new sect V i To this insulting question the Christian apologists returned obscure and ambiguous answers as they were unwilling to reveal the secret cause of their security the expectation that before the conversion of mankind was accomplished war government the Roman empire and the world itself would be no more It may be observed that in this instance likewise OF TH Â  ROMAN EMPIRE 487 likewise the situation of the first Christians coincided very happily with their religious scruples and that their aversion to an active life contributed rather to excuse them from the service than to exclude them from the honours of the state and army V But the human character however it may be exalted The fifth or depressed by a temporary enthusiasm will return by

spiritual functions but even with the temporal direction of the Christian commonwealth The safety of that society its honour its aggrandisement were productive even in the most pious minds of a spirit of patriotism such as the first of the Romans had felt for the republic and sometimes of a similar indifference in the use of whatever means might probably conduce to so desirable an end The ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honours and offices of the church was disguised by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit the power And consideration which for that purpose only it became their duty to solicit In the exercise of their functions they were fre quently called upon to detect the errors of heresy or the arts of faction to oppose the designs of perfidious brethren to stigmatize their characters with deserved infamy and to expel them from the bosom of a society whose peace and happiness they had attempted to disturb The spiritual guides of Christianity were taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove but as the former was refined so the latter was insensibly cor â  1 4 rupted THE DECLINE AND FALL rupted by the habits of government In the church as well as in the world the persons who were placed in any public station rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness by their knowledge of mankind and by their dexterity in business and while they concealed from others and perhaps from them selves the secret motive of their actions they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent passions of active life which were tinctured with an additional degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of religious zeal The government of the church has often been the subject as well as the instrument of contention The hostile disputants of Rome of Paris of Oxford and of Geneva have each of them strove to reduce the primitive and apostolic model  to the respec tive standards of their own policy The few who have pursued this inquiry with more candour and impartiality are of opinion that the apostles declined the office of legislation and rather chose to endure some partial scandals and divisions than to exclude the Christians of a future age from the liberty of varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the changes of times and circumstances The scheme of policy which under their approbation was adopted for the use of the first century may be discovered from the practice of Jerusalem of Ephesus or of Corinth The societies which were instituted in the cities of the Roman empire were united only by the ties of faith and charity Independence and equality formed the basis of their internal con stitution The want of discipline and human learning was sup plied by the occasional assistance of the prophets e who were called to that function without distinction of age of sex or of natural abilities and who as often as they felt the divine impulse poured forth the effusions of the spirit in the assembly of the faithful But these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused Or misapplied by the prophetic teachers They displayed them

Corinth a long and melancholy train of dis orders oS As the institution of prophets became useless and even pernicious their powers were withdrawn and their office abolished The public functions of religion were solely entrusted to the esta blished ministers of the church the bi hops and the presbyters two appellations which in their first origin appear to have distinguished the same office and the same order of persons The name of Pres byter was expressive of their age or rather of their gravity and wisdom The title of Bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the christians who were committed to their pastoral care In proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful a larger or smaller number of these episcopal presbyters guided each infant congregation with equal authority and with united counsels Io6 But the most perfect equality of freedom requires the directing institution of hand of a superior magistrate and the order of public deliberations presidents of soon introduces the office of a president invested at least with the prlityten Â f authority of collecting the sentiments and of executing the re solutions of the assembly A regard for the public tranquillity which would so frequently have been interrupted by annual or by occasional elections induced the primitive christians to constitute an honourable and perpetual magistracy and to choose one of the wisest and most holy among their presbyters to execute during his life the duties of their ecclesiastical governor It was under these circum stances that the lofty title of Bishop began to raise itself above the humble appellation of presbyter and while the latter remained the most natural distinction for the members of every christian senate the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president Â 7 The advantages of this episcopal form of governments which ap pears to have been introduced before the end of the first century 0  Vol L R r r were 490 THE DECLINE AND FALL were so obvious and so important for the future greatness as well as the present peace of Christianity that it was adopted without delay by all the societies which were already scattered over the em pire had acquired in a very early period the sanction of anti quity 0 and is still revered by the most powerful churches both of the East and of the West as a primitive and even as a divine establishment Â It is needless to observe that the pious and hum ble presbyters who were first dignified with the episcopal title could not possess and would probably have rejected the power and pomp which now encircles the tiara of the Roman pontiff or the mitre of a German prelate But we may define in a few words the narrow limits of their original jurisdiction which was chiefly of a spiritual but in some instances of a temporal nature It con sisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church the superintendency of religious ceremonies which imper ceptibly increased in number and variety the consecration of eccle siastical ministers to whom the bishop assigned their respective func tions the management of the public fund and the determination of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose be fore the tribunal of an idolatrous judge These powers during a Ihort period were exercised according to the advice of the presby teral college and with the consent and approbation of the assembly Â f Christians The primitive bishops were considered only as the first of their equals and the honourable servants of a free people Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death a new presi dent was chosen among the presbyters by the suffrage of the whole congregation every member of which supposed himself invested with a sacred and sacerdotal character  Provincial Such was the mild and equal constitution by which the Christians councils were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apostles Every society formed within itself a separate and inde pendent republic and although the most distant of these little states 1  â maintained OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 491 maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and deputations the christian world was not yet connected by any su preme authority or legislative assembly As the numbers of the faithful were gradually multiplied they discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union of their interest and designs Towards the end of the second century the churches of Greece and Asia adopted the useful institutions of provincial synods and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council from the celebrated examples of their own country the Amphictyons the AchÃ an league or the assemblies of the Ionian cities It was soon established as a custom and as a law that the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and autumn Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few distinguished presbyters and moderated by the presence of a listening multi tude  Their decrees which were styled Canons regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the holy spirit would be poured on the united assembly of the delegates of the christian people The institution of synods was so well suited to private ambition and to public interest that in the space of a few years it was received through out the whole empire A regular correspondence was established Union of the between the provincial councils which mutually communicated churLh and approved their respective proceedings and the catholic church soon assumed the form and acquired the strength of a great fede rative republic  As the legislative authority of the particular chnrches was insen Progress of  sibly superseded by the use of councils the bishops obtained by hority U their alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrary power connected by a sense of their common interest they were enabled to attack with united vigour the original rights of their clergy and people The prelates of the third century imperceptibly R r r 9 changed THE DECLINE AND FALL changed the language of exhortation into that of command scattered the seeds of future usurpations and supplied by scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric their deficiency of force and of reason They exalted the unity and power of the church as it was repre sented in the episcopal office of which every bishop enjoyed an equal and undivided portion Princes and magistrates it was often repeated might boast an earthly claim to a transitory domi nion It was the episcopal authority alone which was derived from the deity and extended itself over this and over another world The bishops were the vicegerents of Christ the successors of the apostles and the mystic substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic law Their exclusive privilege of conferring the sacerdotal charac ter invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections and if in the administration of the church they sometimes con sulted the judgment of the presbyters or the inclination of the people they most carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in the assembly of their brethren but in she govern ment of his peculiar diocese each of them exacted from his Jlock the fame implicit obedience as if that favourite metaphor had been literally just and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted nature than that of his sheep 6 This obedience however waÂ not imposed without some efforts on one side and some resistance on the other The democratical part of the constitution was in many places very warmly supported by the zealous or interested opposition of the inferior clergy But their patriotism received the ignominious epithets of faction and schism and the episcopal cause Was indebted for its rapid progress to the labours of many active prelates who like Cyprian of Carthage could reconcile the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the christian virtues which seerr adapted to the character of a faint and martyr  The I Otf TUX JR OMAN EMPIRE 493 The same causes which at first liad destroyed the equality of the IfSHmS presbyters introduced among the bishops a pre eminence of rank and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction As often as in the spring and autumn they met in provincial synod the difference of personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the memr bers of the assembly and the multitude was governed by the wis dom and eloquence of the few But the order of public proceed ings required a more regular and less invidious distinction the office of perpetual presidents in the councils of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal city and these aspiring prelates who soon acquired the lofty titles of Metropolitans and Primates secretly prepared themselves to usurp over their episcopal brethren the same authority which the bishops had so lately assumed above the college of presbyters  Nor was it long before an emulation of pre eminence and power prevailed among the metro i politans themselves each of them affecting to display in the most pompous terms the temporal honours and advantages of the city over which he presided the numbers and opulence of the Christians who were subject to their pastoral care the faints and martyrs who had arisen among them and the purity with which they pre served the tradition of the faith as it had been transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle or the apostolic dis ciple to whom the foundation of their church was ascribed 9 From every cause either of a civil or of an ecclesiastical nature it was easy to foresee that Rome must enjoy the respect and would soon claim the obedience of the provinces The society of the Ambition of faithful bore a just proportion to the capital of the empire and pontiff 1 the Roman church was the greatest the most numerous and in re gard

and the bishops of Rome very prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were attributed either to the person or to the office of Saint Peter The bishops of Italy and of the pro vinces were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and associa tion such was their very accurate expression in the Christian ari stocracy  But the power of a monarch was rejected with ab horrence and the aspiring genius as Rome experienced from the nations of Asia and Africa a more vigorous resistance to her spiri tual than she had formerly done to her temporal dominion The patriotic Cyprian who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of Carthage and the provincial synods opposed with resolution and success the ambition of the Roman pontiff artfully connected his own cause with that of the eastern bishops aud like Hannibal sought out new allies in the heart of Asia If this Punic war was carried on without any effusion of blood it was owing much less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending pre lates Invectives and excommunications were their only weapons and these during the progress of the whole controversy they hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion The hard necessity of censuring either a pope or a saint and martyr distresses the modern catholics whenever they are obliged to relate the par ticulars of a dispute in which the champions of religion indulged such passions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the camp The progress of the ecclesiastical authority gave birth to the me morable distinction of the laity and of the clergy which had been unknown to the Greeks and Romans J The former of these appellations comprehended the body of the Christian people the latter according to the signification of the word was

not always the most edifying subjects for modern history Their mutual hostilities sometimes disturbed the peace of the infant church but thejr zeal and activity were united in the common cause and the love of power which under the most artful disguises could insinuate itself into the breast of bishops and mar tyrs animated them to increase the number of their subjects and to enlarge the limits of thei Christian empire They were destitute of any temporal force and they were for a long time discouraged and oppressed rather than assisted by the civil magistrate but they had acquired and they employed within their own society the two most efficacious instruments of government rewards and punish ments the former derived from the pious liberality the latter from the devout apprehensions of the faithful  I The community of goods which had so agreeably amused the Oblations and p   revenue of the imagination of Plato 1 Â and which subsisted in some degree among church the austere sect of the Estonians 7 was adopted for a short time in the primitive church  The fervour of the first proselytes prompted them to fell those worldly possessions which they despised to lay the price of ithem at the feet of the apostles and to content them selves with receiving an equal share out of the general distribution V The progress of the Christian religion relaxed and gradually abo lished this generous institution which in hands less pure than those of the apostles would too soon have been corrupted and abused by the returning selfishness of human nature  and the converts who embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession of their patrimony to receive legacies and inheritances and to H crease their separate property by all the lawful means of trade and industry Instead of an absolute sacrifice a moderate proportion was accepted by the ministers of the gospel j and in their weekly or monthly assemblies every beiSfevery according to the exigency of the occasion and the measure of his weaUk and piety presented his voluntary THE DECLINE AND FAIL voluntary offering for the use of the common fund 9 Nothing however inconsiderable was refused but it was diligently incul cated that in the article of Tythes the Mosaic law was still of di vine obligation and that since the Jews under a less perfect disci pline had been commanded to pay a tenth part of all that they possessed it would become the disciples of Christ to distinguisti them selves by a superior degree of liberality 0 and to acquire some merit by resigning a superfluous treasure which must so soon be anni hilated with the world itself  It is almost unnecessary to observe that the revenue of each particular church which was of so uncer tain and fluctuating a nature must have varied with the poverty or the opulence of the faithful as they were dispersed in obscure villages or collected in the great cities of the empire In the time of the em peror Decius it was the opinion of the magistrates that the Christians of Rome were possessed of very considerable wealth that vessels of gold and silver were used in their religious worship and that many among their proselytes had fold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the sect at the expence indeed of their un fortunate children who found themsclvs beggars because their parents had been saints s We should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers and enemies on this occasion how ever they receive a very specious and probable colour from the two following circumstances the only ones that have reached our knowledge which define any precise sums or convey any distinct idea Almost at the fame period the bishop of Carthage from a society less opulent than that of Rome collected an hundred thou sand sesterces above eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling on a sudden call of charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia who had been carried away captives by the barbarians of the desert About an hundred years before the reign of Decius the Roman â church had received in a single donation the sum of two hundred â thousand sesterces from a stranger of Pontus who proposed to fix  â his OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 497 his residence in the capital These oblations for the most part were made in money nor was the society of Christians either desirous or capable of acquiring to any considerable degree the incumbrance of a landed property It had been provided by several laws which were enacted with the fame design as our statutes of mortmain that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to any corporate body without either a special privilege or a particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate JJ who were seldom disposed to grant them in favour of a sect at first the object of their contempt and at last of their fears and jealousy A transaction however is related under the reign of Alexander Severus which discovers that the restraint was sometimes eluded or sus pended and that the Christians were permitted to claim and to possess a piece of ground within the limits of Rome itself S The progress of Christianity and the civil confusions of the empire contributed to relax the severity of the laws and before the close of the third century many considerable estates were bestowed on the opulent churches of Rome Milan Carthage Antioch Alexandria and the other great cities of Italy and the provinces The bishop was the natural steward of the church the public Distribution stock was entrusted to his care without account or controul the ofthe revenue presbyters were confined to their spiritual functions and the more dependent order of deacons was solely employed in the manage ment and distribution of the ecclesiastical revenue 7 If we may give credit to the vehement declamations of Cyprian there were too many among his African brethren who in the execution of their charge violated every precept not only of evangelic perfection but even of moral virtue By some of these unfaithful stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual pleasures by others they were perverted to the purposes of private gain of fraudulent purchases and of rapacious usury  But as long as the contri v butions of the Christian people were free and unconstrained the Vol I S s s abuse 498 THE DECLINE AND FALL abuse of their confidence could not be very frequent and the general uses to which their liberality was applied reflected honour on the religious society A decent portion was reserved for the maintainance of the bishop and his clergy a sufficient sum was allotted for the expences of the public worship of which the feasts of love the agapÃ as they were called constituted a very pleasing and essential part The w hole remainder was the sacred patrimony of the poor According to the discretion of the bishop it was dis tributed to support widows and orphans the lame the sick and the aged of the community to comfort strangers and pilgrims and to alleviate the misfortunes of prisoners and captives more especially  when their sufferings had been occasioned by their firm attach ment to the cause of religion 9 A generous intercourse of charity united the most distant provinces and the smaller congregations were cheerfully assisted by the alms of their more opulent bre thren 4Â Such an institution which paid less regard to the merit than to the distress of the object very materially conduced to the progress of Christianity The Pagans who were actuated by a fense of humanity while they derided the doctrines acknowledged the benevolence of the new sect  The prospect of immediate relief and of future protection allured into its hospitable bosom many of those unhappy persons whom the neglect of the world would have abandoned to the miseries of want of sickness and of old age There is some reason likewise to believe that great num bers of infants who according to the inhuman practice of the times had been exposed by their parents were frequently rescued from death baptised educated and maintained by the piety of the Christians and at the expence of the public treasure  Excommum  1S undoubted right of every society to exclude from cation its communion and benefits such among its members as reject or violate those regulations which have been established by general con sent In the exercise of this power the censures of the Christian 2 church OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE church were chiefly directed against scandalous sinners and par ticularly those who were guilty of murder of fraud or of incon tinence against the authors or the followers of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the episcopal order and against those unhappy persons who whether from choice or from compulsion had polluted themselves after their baptisin by any act of idolatrous worship The consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as a spiritual nature The Christian against whom it was pronounced was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful The ties both of religious and of private friendfliip were dissolved he found himself a prophane object of abhorrence to the persons whom he the most esteemed or by whom he had been the most tenderly beloved and as far as an expulsion from a respectable society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace he was sliunned or suspected by the generality of mankind The situation of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy but as it usually happens their apprehensions far exceeded their sufferings The benefits of the Christian communion were those of eternal life nor could they erase from their minds the awful opinion that to those ecclesiastical governors by whom they were condemned the Deity had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradise The heretics indeed who might be supported by the consciousness of their in tentions and by the flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of salvation endeavoured to regain in their separate assemblies those comforts temporal as well as spiritual which they no longer derived from the great society of Christians But almost all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition and anxiously desirous of being restored to the benefits of the Christian com munion Sss2 With THE DECLINE AND FALL With regard to the treatment of these penitents two opposite Â pinions the one of justice the other of mercy divided the primitive church The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused them for ever and without exception the meanest place in the holy com munity which they had disgraced or deserted and leaving them to the remorse of a guilty conscience indulged them only with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being A milder sentiment was embraced in practice as well as in theory by the purest and most respectable of the Christian churches  The gates of re conciliation and of Heaven were seldom shut against the returning penitent but a severe and solemn form of discipline was instituted which while it served to expiate his crime might powerfully Publicpe deter the spectators from the imitation of his example Humbled nance by a public confession emaciated by fasting and clothed in sack cloth the penitent lay prostrate at the door of the assembly imr ploring with tears the pardon of his offences and soliciting the prayers of the faithful 5 If the fault was of a very heinous nature whole years of penance were esteemed an inadequate satisfaction lo the Divine Justice and it was always by flow and painful grar dations that the sinner the heretic or the apostate was re ad mitted into the bosom of the church A sentence of perpetual exr communication was however reserved for some crimes  of an extraordinary magnitude and particularly for the inexcusable re lapses of those penitents who had already experienced and abused the clemency of their ecclesiastical superiors According to the circumstances or the number of the guilty the exercise of the Christian discipline was varied by the discretion of the bishops The councils of Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the fame time the one in Galatia the other in Spain but their respective canons which are still extant seem to breathe a very different spirit The Galatian OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 501 Galatian who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to idols might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years and if he had seduced others to imitate his example only three years more were added to the term of his exile But the unhappy Spaniard who had committed the fame offence was deprived of the hope of reconciliation even in the article of death and his idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other crimes against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of calumniating a bishop a presbyter or even a deacon 6 The well tempered mixture of liberality and rigour the judicious The dignity dispensation of rewards and punishments according to the maxims of eP koPa  r     government of policy as well as justice constituted the human strength of the church The bishops whose paternal care extended itself to the government of both worlds were sensible of the importance of these prerogatives and covering their ambition with the fair pre tence of the love of order they were jealous of any rival in the exercise of a discipline so necessary to prevent the desertion of those troops which had inlisted themselves under the banner of the cross and whose numbers every day became more considerable From the imperious declamations of Cyprian we should naturally conclude that the doctrines of excommunication and penance formed the most essential part of religion and that it was much less dangerous for the disciples of Christ to neglect the observance of the moral duties than to despise the censures and authority of their bishops Sometimes we might imagine that we were listening to the voice of Moses when he commanded the earth to open and to swallow up in consuming flames the rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of Aaron and we should some times suppose that we heard a Roman consul asserting the majesty Â f the republic and declaring his inflexible resolution to enforce the rigour of the laws  If such irregularities are suffered with â  impunity 502 THE DECLINE AND FALL tion of the five causes Weakness of Polytheism â impunity it is thus that the bishop of Carthage chides the lenity of his colleague if such irregularities are suffered there  is an end of Episcopal vigour 4T an end of the sublime and divine power of governing the church an end of Christianity w itself Cyprian had renounced those temporal honours which it is probable he would never have obtained but the acquisition of such absolute command over the consciences and understanding of a congregation however obscure or despised by the world is more truly grateful to the pride of the human heart than the possession of the most despotic power imposed by arms and conquest on a re luctant people In the course of this important though perhaps tedious inquiry I have attempted to display the secondary causes which so effica ciously assisted the truth of the Christian religion If among these causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments any accidental circumstances or any mixture of error and passion it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their imperfect nature It was by the aid of these causes exclusive zeal the immediate expectation of another world the claim of miracles the practice of rigid virtue and the constitution of the primitive church that Christianity spread itself with so much success in the Roman empire To the first of these the Christians were indebted for their invincible valour which disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to vanquish The three succeeding causes supplied their valour with the most formidable arms The last of these causes united their courage directed their arms and gave their efforts that irresistible weight which even a small band of well trained and desperate volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined multitude ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of the war In the various religions of Polytheism some wandering fanatics of Egypt and Syria who addressed themselves to the credulous superstition of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the populace were perhaps the only order of priests s who derived their whole support and credit from their sacerdotal profession and who were very deeply affected by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their tutelar deities The ministers of polytheism both in Rome and in the principal provinces were for the most part men of a noble birth and of an affluent fortune who received as an honourable distinction the care of a celebrated temple or of a public sacrifice exhibited very fre quently at their own expence the sacred games 49 and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites according to the laws and fashion of their country Engaged in the ordinary occupations of life their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of interest or by the habits of an ecclesiastical character Confined to their respective temples and cities they remained without any connexion of discipline or government and whilst they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate of the college of pontiffs and of the emperor those civil magistrates contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining in peace and dignity the established worship of mankind We have already seen how various how loose and how uncertain were the religious senti ments of Polytheists They were abandoned almost without controul to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy The accidental circumstances of their life and situation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion and as long as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand deities it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them When Christianity appeared in the world even these faint and The sceP ticism of the imperfect impressions had been insensibly obliterated Human Pagan world reason which by its unassisted strength is incapable of perceiving vourabieto the mysteries of faith had already obtained an easy triumph over religion the folly of Paganism and when Tertullian or Lactantius employ S s s 4 their THE DECLINE AND FALL their labours in exposing its falsehood and extravagance they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of Cicero or the wit of Lucian The contagion of these sceptical writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their readers The fashion of incredulity was communicated from the philosopher to the man of pleasure or business from the noble to the plebeian and from the master to the menial slave who waited at his table and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his conversation On public occasions the phi losophic part of mankind affected to treat with respect and decency the religious institutions of their country but their secret con tempt penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise and even the people when they discovered that their deities were rejected and derided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed to reverence were filled with doubts and apprehensions concerning the truth of those doctrines to which they had yielded the most implicit belief The decline of ancient prejudice left a very numerous portion of human kind in a painful and comfortless situation A state of scepticism and suspence may amuse a few inquisitive minds But the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude that if they are forcibly awakened they still regret the loss of their pleasing vision Their love of the marvellous and supernatural their curiosity with regard to future events and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the visible world were the principal causes which favoured the establishment of Polytheism So urgent on the vulgar is the necessity of believing that the fall of any system of mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of some other mode of superstition Some deities of a more recent and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted temples of Jupiter and Apollo if in the decisive moment the wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction whilst at the same time it was 2 adorned 0 F THE ROMAN EMPIRE 0 adorned with all that could attract the curiosity the wonder and the veneration of the people In their actual disposition as they were almost disengaged from their artificial prejudices but equally susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment an object fftucfo less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of their passions Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection instead of viewing With astonishment the rapid progress of Christianity will perhaps be surprised that its success was1 not still more rapid and still more universal It has been observed with truth as well as propriety that the as well as the  peace and conquests of Rome prepared and facilitated those of Christianity union of the In the second chapter of this work we have attempted to explain pire 3 Cm in what manner the most civilized provinces of Europe Asia and Africa were united under the dominion of one sovereign and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws of man ners and of language The Jews of Palestine who had fondly expected a temporal deliverer gave so cold a reception to the mi racles of the divine prophet that it was found unnecessary to publish or at least to preserve any Hebrew gospel 5Â The au thentic histories of the actions of Christ were composed in the Greek language at a considerable distance from Jerusalem and after the Gentile converts were grown extremely numerous As soon as those histories were translated into the Latin tongue they were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome excepting only to the peasants of Syria and Egypt for whose benefit par ticular versions were afterwards made The public highways which had been constructed for the use of the legions opened an easy passage for the Christian missionaries from Damascus to Corinth and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or Britain nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a foreign religion into a Vol L T t t distant o6 THE DECLINE AND FALL distant country There is the strongest reason to believe that be fore the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine

which lay beyond the frontiers of t the Roman empire   ntfie Eafe The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian sea were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the Gentiles displayed his zeal and piety The feeds of the gospel which he bad scattered in a fertile soil were diligently cultivated by his dis ciples and it should seem that during the two first centuries the most considerable body of Christians was contained within those limits Among the societies which were instituted in Syria none were more ancient or more illustrious than those of Damascus of Berea or Aleppo and of Antioch The prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has described and immortalised the seven churches of Asia Ephesus Smyrna Pergamus Thyatira Sardes Lao dicea and Philadelphia and their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country In a very early period the islands of Cyprus and Crete the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia gave a favourable reception to the new religion and Christian republics were soon founded in the cities of Corinth of Sparta and of Athens 5 The antiquity of the Greek and Asiatic churches allowed a sufficient space of time for their increase and multipli cation and even the swarms of Gnostics and other heretics serve to display the flourishing condition of the orthodox church since the 3 â appellatioa OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less numerous party To these domestic testimonies we may add the confession the complaints and the apprehensions of the Gentiles themselves From a philosophic writer who had studied mankind and who de scribes their manners in the most lively colours we may learn that under the reign of Commodus his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and Christians  Within fourscore years after the death of Christ the humane Pliny laments the mag nitude of the evil which he vainly attempted to eradicate In his very curious epistle to the emperor Trajan he affirms that the tem ples were almost deserted that the sacred victims scarcely found any purchasers and that the superstition had not only infected the cities but had even spread itself into the villages and the open country of Pontus and Bithynia s6   Without descending into a minute scrutiny of the expressions or The church of the motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament the progress of Christianity in the East it may in general be observed that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces One circumstance however has been fortunately preserved which seems to cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject Under the reign of Theodosius after Chri stianity had enjoyed during more than sixty years the sunshine of imperial favour the ancient and illustrious church of Antioch con sisted of one hundred thousand persons three thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations S7 The splendor and dignity of the queen of the East the acknowledged populousness of CÃ sarea Seleucia and Alexandria and the destruction of two hundred and fifty thousand souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder Justin M are  so many convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less than half a million and that the Christians however multiplied bj zeal and  i T11 2 v power THE DECLINE AND FALL power did not exceed a fifth part of that great city How differ ent a proportion must we adopt when

Â pv superior to that of the jews and Pagans 5 But the solution oÂ this a ppir lent difficulty is easy and obvious The eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the ecclesiastical

excommunications the community of goods the love of celibacy their zeal for martyrdom and the warmth though not the purity of their faith already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline l6Â It was in the school of Alexandria that the Christian theology appears to have assumed a regular and scientifical form and when Hadrian visited Egypt he found a church com posed of Jews and of Greeks sufficiently important to attract the no tice of that inquisitive prince But the progress of Christianity was for a long time confined within the limits of a single city which was itself a foreign colony and till the close of the second century the predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian church Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius 4 and OF

soon indeed as Christianity ascended the throne the zeal of those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion the cities of Egypt were filled with bishops and the deserts of Thebais swarmed with hermits A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the In Rome capacious bosom of Rome Whatever was strange or odious who ever waÂ guilty or suspected might hope in the obscurity of that immense capital to elude the vigilance of the law In such a various conflux of nations every teacher either of truth or of falsehood every founder whether of a virtuous or a criminal association might easily multiply his disciples or accomplices The Christians of Rome at the time of the accidental persecution of Nero are repre sented by Tacitus as already amounting to a very great multitude  and the language of that great historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy when he relates the introduction and the sup pression of the rites of Bacahus After the Bacchanals had awa kened the severity of the senate it was likewise apprehended that a very great multitude as it were another people had been initiated into those abhorred mysteries A more careful inquiry soon demon strated that the offenders did not exceed seven thousand a num ber indeed sufficiently alarming when considered as the object of public justice166 It is with the fame candid allowance that we should interpret the vague expressions of Tacitus and in a former instance of Pliny when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods The church of Rome was undoubtedly the first and most populous of the empire and we are possessed of an authentic record which at tests Â 10 THE DECLINE AND FALL tests the state of religion in that city ahout the middle of the third century and after a peace of thirty eight years The clergy at that time consisted of a bishop forty six presbyters seven deacons as many sub deacons forty two acolythes and fifty readers exor cists and porters The number of widows of the infirm and of the poor who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful amounted to fifteen hundred 6 From reason as well as from the example of Antioch we may venture to estimate the Christians of Rome at about fifty thousand The populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly ascertained but the most modest calculation will not surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants of whom the Christians might constitute at the most a twentieth  168 part in Africa and The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge provinces 1 of Christianity from the fame source which had diffused among them the language the sentiments and the manners of Rome In this more important circumstance Africa as well as Gaul were gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital Yet notwith standing the many favourable occasions which might invite the Roman missionaries to visit their Latin provinces it was late before they passed either the sea or the Alps 169 nor can we discover in those great countries any assured traces either of faith or of perse cution that ascend higher than the reign of the Antonines 70 The flow progress of the gospel in the cold climate of Gaul was ex tremely different from the eagerness with which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of Africa The African Chris tians soon formed one of the principal members of the primitive church The practice introduced into that province of appointing bissiops to the most inconsiderable towns and very frequently to the most obscure villages contributed to multiply the splendor and importance of their religious societies which during the course of the third century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian directed  i by OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by the abilities of Cyprian and adorned by the eloquence of Lac tantius But if on the contrary we turn our eyes towards Gaul we can only discern in the time of Marcus Antoninus the feeble and united congregations of Lyons and Vienna and even as late as the reign of Decius we are assured that in a few cities Aries Nar bonne Thoulouse Limoges Clermont Tours and Paris some scattered churches were supported by the devotion of a small num ber of Christians 7 Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion but as it is seldom compatible with zeal we may perceive and la ment the languid state of Christianity in those provinces which had exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue since they did not during the three first centuries give birth to a single ecclesiastical writer From Gaul which claimed a just pre eminence of learning and authority over all the countries on this fide of the Alps the light of the gospel was more faintly reflected on the remote pro vinces of Spain and Britain and if we may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian they had already received the first rays of the faith when he addressed his apology to the magistrates of the emperor Severus  But the obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of Europe has been so negligently recorded that if we would relate the time and manner of their foundation we must supply the silence of antiquity by those legends which avarice or superstition long afterwards dictated to the monks in the lazy gloom of their convents Of these holy romances that of the apostle St James can alone by its singular extravagance deserve to be mentioned From a peaceful fisherman of the lake of Gennesa reth he was transformed into a valorous knight who charged at the head of the Spanish chivalry in their battles against the Moors The gravest historians have celebrated his exploits the miracu lous flirine of Compostella displayed his power and the sword of a military order assisted by the terrors of the Inquisition were suffi cient to remove every objection of profane criticism i Thee THE DECLINE AND FALL Beyond the nie pr0grefs 0f Christianity was not confined to the Roman limits of the  Â Roman em empire and according to the primitive fathers who interpret facts P by prophecy the new religion within a century after the death of its divine author had already visited every part of the globe M There exists not fays Justin Martyr a people whether Greet  or Barbarian of any other race of men by whatsoever appella tkm or manners they may be distinguished however ignorant of arts or agriculture whether they dwell under tents or wander u about in covered waggons among whom prayers are not offered up n the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of all things171 But this splendid exaggeration which even at present it would be extremely difficult to reconcile with the real state of mankind can be considered only as the rash sally of a devoat but careless writer the measure of whose belief was regulated by that of his wishes But neither the belief nor the wishes of the fathers can alter the truth of history It will still remain an un doubted fact that the barbarians of Scythia and Germany who subverted the Roman monarchy were involved in the darkness of paganism and that even the conversion of Iberia of Armenia or of Ã thiopia was not attempted with any degree of success till the scepter was in the hands of an orthodox emperor 6 Before that time the various accidents of war and commerce might indeed diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the gospel among the tribes of Caledonia 77 and among the borderers of the Rhine the Danube and the Euphrates 73 Beyond the last mentioned river Edessa was distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith 79 From Edessa the principles of Christianity were easily introduced into the Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the successors of Artaxerxes but they do not appear to have made any deep impression on the minds of the Persians whose religious system by the labours of a well disciplined order of priests had been constructed with much more OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of Greece and Rome S  From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of General pro portion of Christianity it may perhaps seem probable that the number of its Christiani proselytes has been excessively magnified by fear on the one side and Pagan and by devotion on the other According to the irreproachable testimony of Origen 8 the proportion of the faithful was very in considerable when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving   world but as we are left without any distinct information it is impos sible to determine and it is difficult even to conjecture the real num bers of the primitive Christians The most favourable calculation however that can be deduced from the examples of Antioch and of Rome will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the banner of the cross before the important conversion of Con ftantine But their habits of faith of zeal and of union seemed to multiply their numbers and the fame causes which contributed to their future increase served to render their actual strength more apparent and more formidable Such is the constitution of civil society that whilst a few persons Whether the first Christians are distinguished by riches by honours and by knowledge the were mean body of the people is condemned to obscurity ignorance and poverty The Christian religion which addressed itself to the whole human race must consequently collect a far greater number of pro selytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of life This innocent and natural circumstance has been improved into a very odious imputation which seems to be less strenuoufly denied by the apologists than it is urged by the adversaries of the faith that The new sect of Christians was almost entirely composed of the dregs of the populace of peasants and mechanics of boys and women of beggars and staves the last of whom might sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged Vol I U u u These and ignorant SI4 THE DECLINE AND FALL Some excep tions with regard to learning j These obscure teachers such was the charge of malice and infidelity are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in private Whilst they cautiously avoid the dangerous encounter of philosophers they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd and insinuate themselves into those minds whom their age their sex or their education has the best disposed to receive the impression of superstitious terrors  This unfavourable picture though not devoid of a faint resem blance betrays by its dark colouring and distorted features the pencil of an enemy As the humble faith of Christ diffused itself through the world it was embraced by several persons who derived some importance from the advantages of nature or fortune Ariftides who presented an eloquent apology to the emperor Hadrian was an Athenian philosopher  Justin Martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of Zeno of Aristotle of Pythagoras and of Plato before he fortunately was accosted by the bid man or rather the angel who turned his attention to the study of the Jewiflx prophets 8 Clemens of Alexandria had acquired much various reading in the Greek and Tertullian in the Latin language Julius Africanus and Origen possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their times and although the style of Cyprian is very different from that of Lactantius we might almost discover that both those writers had been public teachers of rhetoric Even the study of philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians hut it was not always productive of the most salutary effects knowledge was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion and the description which was designed for the followers of Artemon may with equal propriety be applied to the various sects that resisted the successors of ths apostles They presume to alter the holy scriptures to abandon the ancient rule of faith and to form their opinions according to the subtile precepts of logic The science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE S 5  and they lose sight of Heaven while they are employed in measur ing the earth Euclid is perpetually in their hands Aristotle and Theophrastus are the objects cf their admiration and they  express an uncommon reverence for the works of Galen Their errors are derived from the abuse of the arts and sciences of  the infidels and they corrupt the simplicity of the gospel by the  refinements of human reason  V Nor can it be affirmed with truth that the advantages of birth and wi h re8ar 1  to rank ml fortune were always separated from the profession of Christianity soitune Several Roman citizens were brought before the tribunal of Pliny and he soon discovered that a great number of persons of every order of men in Bithynia had deserted the religion of their ancestors His unsuspected testimony may in this instance obtain more credit than the bold challenge of Tertullian when he addresses him self to the fears as well as to the humanity of the proconsul of Africa by assuring him that if he persists in his cruel intentions he must decimate Carthage and that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank senators and matrons of noblest extraction and the friends or relations of his most intimate friends 8 It appears however that about forty years afterwards the emperor Valerian was persuaded of the truth of this assertion since in one of his rescripts he evidently supposes that senators Roman knights and ladies of quality were engaged in the Chris tian sect S The church still continued to increase its outward splendor as it lost its inrernal purity and in the reign of Diocletian the palace the courts of justice and even the army concealed a multitude of Christians who endeavoured to reconcile the interests of the present with those of a future life And yet these exceptions are either too few in number or too Christianity recent in time entirely to remove the imputation of ignorance and Xy received obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the first proselytes of h Â eT Christianity Instead of employing in our defence the fictions U u u 2 of Si6 THE DECLINE AND FALL of later ages it will be more prudent to convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification Our serious thoughts will suggest to us that the apostles themselves were chosen by pro vidence among the fishermen of Galilee and that the lower we depress the temporal condition of the first Christians the more reason we shall find to admire their merit and success It is in cumbent on us diligently to remember that the kingdom of Heaven was promised to the poor in spirit and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of mankind cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future happiness while on the contrary the fortu nate are satisfied with the possession of this world and the wife abuse in doubt and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge Rejected by We stand in need of such reflections to comfort us for the loss of men â sÂ me illustrious characters which in our eyes might have seemed con cen mo wortny Â f heavenly present The names of Seneca turies cf tjie elder and the younger Pliny of Tacitus of Plutarch of Galen of the slave Epictetus and of the emperor Marcus Anr toninus adorn the age in which they flourished and exalt the dignity of human nature They filled with glory their respective stations either in active or contemplative life their excellent understandings were improved by study Philosophy had purified their minds from the prejudices of superstition and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue Yet all these sages it is no less an object of surprise than of concern over looked or rejected the perfection of the Christian system Their language or their silence equally discover their contempt for the growing sect which in their time had diffused itself over the Roman empire Those among them who condescend to mentioa the Christians consider them only as obstinate and perverse en thusiasts who exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines without being able to produce a single argument that could engage the attention of men of fense and learning 8 It OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Sl7 â It is at least doubtful whether any1 of these philosophers perused the apologies which the primitive Christians repeatedly published in behalf of themselves and of their religion but it is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by abler advo cates They expose with superfluous wit and eloquence the extravagance of Polytheism They interest our compaction by displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured brethren But when they would demonstrate the divine origin of Christianity they insist much more strongly on the predictions which announced than on the miracles which accompanied the appearance of the Messiah Their favourite argument might serve to edify a Christian or to convert a Jew since both the one and the other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies and both are obliged with devout reverence to search for their sense and their accomplish ment But this mode of persuasion loses much of its weight and in fluence when it is addressed to those who neither understand nor respect the Mosaic dispensation and the prophetic style 9 In the unskilful hands of Justin and of the succeeding apologists the suhlime meaning of the Hebrew oracles evaporates in distant types affected conceits and cold allegories and even their authenticity was rendered suspicious to an unenlightened Gentile by the mixture of pious forgeries which under the names of Orpheus Hermes and the Sibyls 9 were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine inspirations of Heaven The adoption of fraud and sophistry in the defence of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious conduct of those poets who load their invulnerable heroes with a useless weight of cumbersome and brittle armour But how shall we explain or excuse the supine inattention and of mi of the Pagan and philosophic world to those evidences which were presented by the hand of Omnipotence not to their rea son but to their senses During the age of Christ of his apostles and of their first disciples the doctrine which they preached races 6 was 5i8 THE DECLINE AND FALL was confirmed by innumerable prodigies The lame walked the blind saw the sick were healed the dead were raised dÃ mons were expelled and the laws of Nature were perpetually suspended for General the benefit of the church But the sages of Greece and Rome turned silence con cerning the aside from the awful spectacle and pursuing the ordinary occupa th Passion tions of life and study appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world Under the reign of Tiberius the whole earth 9 or at least a celebrated province of the Roman empirewas involved in a preternatural darkness of three hours Even this miraculous event which ought to have ex cited the wonder the curiosity and the devotion of mankind passed without notice in an age of science and history 9 It happened during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny who must have experienced the immediate effects or received the earliest intelli gence of the prodigy Each of these philosophers in a laborious work has recorded all the great phenomena of Nature earth quakes meteors comets and eclipses which his indefatigable curi osity could collect Both the one and the other have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has been witness since the creation of the globe A distinct chapter of Pliny 196 is devoted to eclipses of an extraordinary nature and un usual duration but he contents himself with describing the singular defect of light which followed the murder of CÃ sar when during the greatest part of a year the orb of the fun appeared pale and without splendor This season of obscurity which cannot surely be compared with the preternatural darkness of the Passion had been already celebrated by most of the poets 97 and historians of that memorable age 9 CHAP OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 9 CHAP XVI The conduB of the Roman Government towards the Chri stians  from the reign of Nero to that of Constantine IF we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion the Christianity sanctity of its moral precepts and the innocent as well as austere thesRoman KVes of the greater number of those who during the first ages emPerors embraced the faith of the gospel we should naturally suppose that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due re verence even by the unbelieving world j that the learned and the polite however they might deride the miracles would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect and that the ma gistrates instead of persecuting would have protected an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws though they declined the active cares of war and government If on the other hand we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people the in credulity of philosophers and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors we are at a loss to discover what new offence the Chri stians had committed what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity and what new motives could urge the Roman princes who beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive mode of faith and worst ip The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character to oppose the 2 progress s20 THE DECLINE AND FALL progress of Christianity About fourscore years after the dtasti of Christ his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic cha racter and according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his general administration The apo logies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the most pathetic complaints that the Christians who obeyed the dictates and solicited the liberty of conscience were alone among all the subjects of the Roman empire excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care and from the times that Christianity was invested with the supreme power the governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in displaying the cruelty than in imitating the conduct of their Pagan adversaries To separate if it be possible a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error and to relate in a clear and rational manner the causes the extent the duration and the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the first Christians were exposed is the design of the present chapter Srmo Ses The scctaries of a persecuted religion depressed by fear animated with resentment and perhaps heated by enthusiasm are seld Dm in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate or candidly to appreciate the motives of their enemies which often escape the im partial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution A reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism It has already been observed that the religious concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies It OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE It plight therefore be expected that they would unite with just indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself from the communion of mankind and claiming the exclusive pos session of divine knowledge should disdain as impious and idola trous every form of worshipbut its own The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence they were naturally forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the Jews and by them alone the consi deration of the treatment which they experienced from the Roman magistrates will serve to explain how far these speculations are justi fied by facts and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecution of Christianity Without repeating what has been already mentioned of the Rebellious reverence of the Roman Princes and governors for the Temple of jew 0 Ch Jerusalem we shall only observe that the destruction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors and authorize reli gious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice and the public safety From the reign of Nero to that of Arito ninus Pius the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections Humanity is shocked at the recital of the hor rid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt of Cyprus and of Cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives  and we are tempted to applaud thesevere retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman govern ment but of humankind  The enthusiasm of the jews was sup ported by the opinion that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous master and by the flattering promise which they derived from their ancient oracles that a conquering Messiah would soon arise destined to break their fetters and to invest the favourites Vol I X x x of THE DECLINE AND FALL Toleration of the Jewish of heaven with the empire of the earth It was by announcing himself as their long expected deliverer and by calling on all the de scendants of Abraham to assert the hope of Israel that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army with which he resisted during two years the power of the Emperor Hadrian  Notwithstanding these repeated provocations the resentment of religion the Roman Princes expired after the victory nor were their appre hensions continued beyond the period of war and danger By the general indulgence of polytheism and by the mild temper of Anto ninus Pius the Jews were restored to their ancient privileges and once more obtained the permission of circumcising their children with the easy restraint that they should never confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the Hebrew race  The nume rous remains of that people though they were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem were permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments both in Italy and in the provinces to acquire the freedom of Rome to enjoy municipal honours and to obtain at the fame time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of society The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical policy which was instituted by the vanquished sect The patriarch who had fixed his residence at Tiberias was empowered to appoint his subordinate ministers and apostles to exercise a domestic jurisdiction and to receive from his dispersed brethren an annual contribution New synagogues were frequently erected in the principal cities of the Empire and the sabbaths the fasts and the festivals which were either commanded by the Mosaic law or enjoined by the tra ditions of the Rabbis were celebrated in the most solemn and public manner6 Such gentle treatment insensibly asswaged the stern temper of the Jews Awakening from their dream of prophecy and conquest they assumed the behaviour of peaceable and industrious subjects Their irreconcilable hatred of mankind instead of fla ming out in acts of blood and violence evaporated in less dangerous gratifications 3 OFTHEROMANEMPIRE 523 gratifications They embraced every opportunity of over reaching the idolaters in trade and they pronounced secret and ambiguous imprecations against the haughty kingdom of Edom  Since the Jews who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored The Jews by their sovereign and by their fellow subjects enjoyed however the which fol free exercise of their unsocial religion there must have existed some chHst th ians a other cause which exposed the disciples of Christ to those severities J erel from which the posterity of Abraham was exempt The difference g 00 of their between them is simple and obvious but according to the senti ments of antiquity it was of the highest importance The Jews were a nation the Christians were a seSi and if it was natural for every community to respect the sacred institutions of their neigh bours it was incumbent on them to persevere in those of their an cestors The voice of oracles the precepts of philosophers and the authority of the laws unanimously enforced this national obligation By their lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race By disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their contempt The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous or absurd yet since they had been received during many ages by a large society his followers were justified by the example of mankind and it was universally acknowledged that they had a right to prac tise what it would have been criminal in them to neglect But this principle which protected the Jewish synagogue afforded not any favour or security to the primitive church By embracing the faith of the Gospel the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education violated the religious institutions of their country and presumptuoufly despised whatever their fathers had believed as true or had reverenced as sacred Nor was this apostacy if we may use the expression merely of a partial or local kind j since the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those X x x 2 of 5a4 THE DECLINE AND FALL of Athens or Carthage Every Christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family his city and his province The whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of Rome of the empire and of mankind It was in vain â that the oppressed believer asserted the inalienable rights of con science and private judgment Though his situation might excite the pity his arguments could never reach the understanding either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world To their apprehensions it was no less a matter of surprise that any individuals should entertain scruples against complying with the established mode of worship than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners the dress or the language of their na tive country 8 Christianity The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment atheism and and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but danger Jhestpfopiey ous imputation of impiety Malice and prejudice concurred in sophers 10 representing the Christians as a society of atheists who by the most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire had me rited the severest animadversion of the civil magistrate They had separated themselves they gloried in the confession from every mode of superstition which had been adopted in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism but it was not altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the Supreme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude who were at a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary God that was neither represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol nor was adored with the accus tomed pomp of libations and festivals of altars and sacrifices  The sages of Greece and Rome who had elevated their minds to the contemplation of the existence and attributes of the First Cause were induced by reason or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the privilege of this philosophical devotion 0 They were i OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind a6 the standard of truth but they considered them as flowing from the original dis position of human nature and they supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the senses would in proportion as it receded from superstition find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the visions of fanaticism The careless glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation served only to confirm their hasty opinion and to persuade them that the prin ciple which they might have revered of the divine unity was de faced by the wild enthusiasm and annihilated by the airy specula tions of the new sectaries The author of a celebrated dialogue which has been attributed to Lucian whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and con tempt betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine perfections  It might appear less surprising that the founder of Chri stianity should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a prophet but that he should be adored as a God The Po lytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith which seemed to offer any resemblance however distant or imperfect with the popular mythology and the legends of Bacchus of Hercules and of Ã sculapius had in some measure prepared their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes who in the infancy of the world had invented arts instituted laws and vanquished the tyrants or monsters who infested the earth in order to choose for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure teacher who in a recent age and among the barbarous people had fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen or to the jealousy of the Roman government The Pagan multitude reserving their gratitude 526 TI E DECLINE AND FALL gratitude for temporal benefits alone rejected the inestimable present of life and immortality which was offered to mankind by Jesus of Nazareth His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary sufferings his universal benevolence and the sublime simplicity of his actions and character were insufficient in the opinion of those carnal men to compensate for the want of fame of empire and of success and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupen dous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave they misrepresented or they insulted the equivocal birth wandering life and ignominious death of the divine Author of Christianity  andafkm1 The personal guilt which every Christian had contracted in thuspre biies of the ferring his private sentiment to the national religion was aggravated in Christians ox considered as a very high degree by the number and union or the criminals It is well conspiracy known and has been already observed that Roman policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any association among its sub jects and that the privileges of private corporations though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes were bestowed with a very sparing hand The religious assemblies of the Christians who had separated themselves from the public worstiip appeared of a much less innocent nature they were illegal in their principle and in their consequences might become dangerous nor were the emperors conscious that they violated the laws of justice when for the peace of society they prohibited those secret and sometimes noc turnal meetings The pious disobedience of the Christians made their conduct or perhaps their designs appear in a much more serious and criminal light and the Roman princes who might per haps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready submission deeming their honour concerned in the execution of their com mands sometimes attempted by rigorous punishments to sub due this independent spirit which boldly acknowledged an au thority superiour to that of the magistrate The extent and du ration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it every day more deserving of his animadversion We have already seen that the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the active and successful zeal of the Christians had insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every city of the empire The new converts seemed to renounce their family and country that they might connect themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society which every where assumed a different cha racter from the rest of mankind Their gloomy and austere aspect their abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life and their frequent predictions of impending calamities 6 inspired the Pagans with the apprehension of some danger which would arise from the new sect the more alarming as it was the more obscure M Whatever says Pliny  may be the principle of their conduct 11 their inflexible obstinacy appeared deserving of punishment V The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed the Their offices of religion were at first dictated by fear and necessity but iated lum they were continued from choice By imitating the awful secrecy which reigned in the Eleusinian mysteries the Christians had flat tered themselves that they should render their sacred institutions more respectable in the eyes of the Pagan world But the event as it often happens to the operations of subtile policy deceived their wishes and their expectations It was concluded that they only concealed what they would have blushed to disclose Their mis taken prudence afforded an opportunity for malice to invent and for suspicious credulity to believe the horrid tales which described the Christians as the most wicked of human kind who practised in their dark recesses every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest and who solicited the favour of their unknown God by the sacrifice of every moral virtue There were many who pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of this abhorred society It was asserted that a new born infant entirely covered over with flour was presented like some mystic symbol os initiation to the knife of the proselyte who unknowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error that as Â l soon THE DECLINE AND FALL soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated the sectaries drank up the blood greedily tore asunder the quivering members and pledged themselves to eternal secrecy by a mutual consciousness of guilt It was as confidently affirmed that this inhuman sacrifice was  succeeded by a suitable entertainment in which intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust till at the appointed mo inent the lights were suddenly extinguished shame was banished nature was forgotten and as accident might direct the dark  ness of the night was polluted by the incestuous commerce of sisters and brothers of sons and of mothers 9 Their impru But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to re dÂ ot defence move even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adver sary The Christians with the intrepid security of innocence appealed from the voice of rumour to the equity of the magistrates They acknowledge that if any proof can be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to them they are worthy of the most severe punishment They provoke the punishment and they challenge the proof At the same time they urge with equal truth and propriety that the charge is not less devoid of probability than it is destitute of evidence they ask whether any one can seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the Gospel which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful enjoyments should inculcate the practice of the most abominable crimes that a large society should resolve to dishonour itself in the eyes of its own members and that a great number of persons of either sex and every age and character insensible to the fear of death or infamy should consent to violate those principles which nature and education had imprinted most deeply in their minds10 Nothing it should seem could weaken the force or destroy the ef fect of so unanswerable a justification unless It were the injudicious conduct of the apologists themselves who betrayed the common cause of religion to gratify their devout hatred to the domestic ene mies of the church It was sometimes faintly insinuated and some times OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5a sometimes boldly asserted that the fame bloody sacrifices and the fame incestuous festivals which were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers were in reality celebrated by the Marcionites by the Car pocratians and by several other sects of the Gnostics who not withstanding they might deviate into the paths of heresy were still actuated by the sentiments of men and still governed by the pre cepts of Christianity  Accusations of a similar kind were retorted upon the church by the schismatics who had departed from its com munion and it was confessed on all sides that the most scandal ous licentiousness of manners prevailed among great numbers of those who affected the name of Christians A Pagan magistrate who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to discern the almost im perceptible line which divides the orthodox faith from heretical pravity might easily have imagined that their mutual animosity had extorted the discovery of their common guilt It was fortu nate for the repose or at least for the reputation of the first Chris tians that the magistrates sometimes proceeded with more temper and moderation than is usually consistent with religious zeal and that they reported as the impartial result of their judicial inquiry that the sectaries who had deserted the established worship appeared to them sincere in their professions and blameless in their man ners however they might incur by their absurd and excessive su perstition the censure of the laws History which undertakes to record the transactions of the past idea of the for the instruction of future ages would ill deserve that honour emperors able office if she condescended to plead the cause of tyrants or to christians justify the maxims of persecution It must however be acknow ledged that the conduct of the emperors who appeared the least favourable to the primitive church is by no means so criminal as that of modern sovereigns who have employed the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinions of any part of their subjects From their reflections or even from their own feelings a Charles V Vol I Yyy or 53o THE DECLINE AND FALL Or a Louis XIV might have acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience of the obligation of faith and of the innocence of error But the princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were strangers to those principles which inspired and authorized the in flexible obstinacy of the Christians in the cause of truth nor could they themselves discover in their own breasts any motive which would have prompted them to refuse a legal and as it were a natu ral submission to the sacred institutions of their country The fame reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt must have tended to abate the rigour of their persecutions As they were actuated not by the furious zeal of bigots but by the temperate policy of legis lators contempt must often have relaxed and humanity must fre quently have suspended the execution of those laws which they enacted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ From the general view of their character and motives we might naturally conclude I That considerable time elapsed before they considered the new sectaries as an object deserving of the attention of govern ment II That in the conviction of any of their subjects who were accused of so very singular a crime they proceeded with cau tion and reluctance III That they were moderate in the use of punishments and IV That the afflicted church enjoyed many in tervals of peace and tranquillity Notwithstanding the careless indifference which the most copious and the most minute of the pagan writers have shewn to the affairs of the Christiansl it may still be in our power to confirm each of these probable supposi tions bv the evidence of authentic facts They neglect L By the wife dispensation of Providence a mysterious veil was dan afa sect ca over tne infancy of the church which served to protect the â fjews Christians till their faith was matured and their numbers were multiplied not only from the malice but even from the knowledge of the pagan world The slow and gradual abolition of the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to the more early pro â OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE proselytes of the Gospel As they were far the greater part of the race of Abraham they were distinguished by the peculiar mark of circumcision offered up their devotions in the Temple of Jerusalem till its final destruction and received both the Law and the Prophets as the genuine inspirations of the Deity The Gentile converts who by a spiritual adoption had been associated to the hope of Israel were likewise confounded under the garb and appearance of Jews s and as the Polytheists paid less regard to articles of faith than to the external worship the new sect which carefully concealed or faintly announced its future greatness and ambition was permitted to slielter itself under the general toleration which was granted to an ancient and celebrated people in the Roman empire It was not long perhaps before the Jews themselves animated with a fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith perceived the gradual separation of their Nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the synagogue and they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous heresy in the lilood of its adherents But the decrees of heaven had already dis armed their malice and though they might sometimes exert the li centious privilege of sedition they no longer possessed the admini stration of criminal justice nor did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman magistrate the rancour of their own zeal and prejudice The provincial governors declared themselves ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the public safety but as soon as they were informed that it was a question not of facts tut of words a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the Jewifli laws and prophecies they deemed it unworthy the majesty of Rome serioufly to discuss the obscure differences which might arise among a barbarous and superstitious people The innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance and contempt and the tribunal of the pagan magistrate often proved their most assured refuge against the fury of the synagogue lS If indeed we were disposed to adopt the traditions of a too credulous antiquity we might relate Yyy 2 the 53 THE DECLINE AND FALL the distant peregrinations the wonderful atchievements and the various deaths of the twelve apostles but a more accurate inquiry will induce us to doubt whether any of those persons who had been witnesses to the miracles of Christ were permitted beyond the limits of Palestine to seal With their blood the truth of their testimony 7 From the ordinary term of human life it may very naturally be presumed that most of them were deceased before the discontent of the Jews broke out into that furious war which was terminated only by the ruin of Jerusalem During a long period from the death of Christ to that memorable rebellion we cannot discover any traces of Roman intolerance unless they are to be found in the sud den the transient but the cruel persecution which was exercised by Nero against the Christians of the Capitol thirty five years after the former and only two years before the latter of those great events The character of the philosophic historian to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge of this singular trans action would alone be sufficient to recommend it to our most at tentive consideration The fire of In the tenth year of the reign of Nero the capital of the empire th ei oof was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example er0 of former ages  The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman virtue the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars the most holy temples and the most splendid palaces were involved in one com mon destruction Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided four only subsisted entire three were levelled with the ground and the remaining seven which had experienced the fury of the flames displayed a melancholy prospect of ruin and desolation The vigilance of government appears not to have ne glected any of the precautions which might alleviate the fense of so dreadful a calamity The imperial gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude temporary buildings were erected for their accommodation and a plentiful supply of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate price The most generous policy seemed OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 533 seemed to have dictated the edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the construction of private houses and as it usually happens in an age of prosperity the conflagration of Rome in the course of a few years produced a new city more regular and more beautiful than the former Bur all the prudence and huma nity of Nero were insufficient to protect him from the popular sus picion Every crime might be imputed to the assassin of his wife and mother nor could the prince who prostituted his person and dignity on the theatre be deemed incapable of the most extravagant folly The voice of rumour accused the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital and as the most incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people it was gravely reported and firmly believed that Nero enjoying the calamity which he had occasioned amused himself with singing to his lyre the de struction of ancient Troy 0 To divert a suspicion which the power of despotism was unable to suppress the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some fictitious criminals With this view continues Tacitus he inflicted the most exquisite Cruel punifh tortures on those men who under the vulgar appellation christians as of Christians were already branded with deserved infamy neVofthe They derived their name and origin from Christ who in the c ty reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence of the pro curator Pontius Pilate  For a while this dire superstition was  checked but it again burst forth and not only spread itself over JudÃ a the first seat of this mischievous sect but was even intro duced into Rome the common asylum which receives and pro tects whatever is impure whatever is atrocious The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices and they were all convicted not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city as for their hatred of human  kind They died in torments and their torments were embit tered by insult and derision Some were nailed on crosses others c sewn â 534 THE DECLINE AND FALL  sewn up in the skins of wild beasts and exposed to the fury of doga others again smeared over with combustible materials were i used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle which was accompanied with a horse race and honoured with the presence of the emperor who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer The guilt of the Chris tians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment but the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed not so much   to the rigour of justice as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind may observe that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse of the persecuted religion On the same spot a temple which far sur passes the ancient glories of the Capitol has been since erected by the Christian Pontifs who deriving their claim of universal do minion from an humble fisherman of Galilee have succeeded to the throne of the CÃ sars given laws to the barbarian conquerors of Rome and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the Baltic to the banks of the Pacific Ocean But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero s per secution till we have made some observations that may serve to remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed and to throw some light on the subsequent history of the church Remarks on I The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth and TacitusÂ iaÂ f tne integrity of this celebrated passage of Tacitus The former is perseruitn of confirmed by the diligent and accurate Suetonius who mentions the b New0 3 5 runistiment wnich Nero inflicted on the Christians a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition 3 The latter is warranted by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts by the inimitable OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE inimitable character of the style of Tacitus by his reputation  which guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud and by the substance of his narration which accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes without insinuating that they pos sessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind 55 2 Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was born some years before the fire of Rbme 36 he could derive only from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which happened during his infancy Before he gave himself to the pub lic he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity and he was more than forty years of age when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant posterity After making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the description of Germany he conceived and at length executed a more arduous work the his tory of Rome in thirty books from the fall of Nero to the acces sion of Narva The administration of Nerva introduced an age of justice and prosperity which Tacitus had destined for the occu pation of his old age37 but when he took a nearer view of his subject judging perhaps that it was a more honourable or a less invidious office to record the vices of past tyrants than to cele brate the virtues of a reigning monarch he chose rather to relate under the form of annals the actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus To collect to dispose and to adorn a series of fourscore years in an immortal work every sentence of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and the most lively images was an un dertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during the greatest part of his life In the last years of the reign of Trajan whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond its ancient limits the historian was describing in the second and fourth books of his annals the tyranny of Tiberius33 and the 6  emperot THE DECLINE AND FALL emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne before Tacitus in the regular prosecution of his work could relate the sire of the capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians At the distance of sixty years it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin the progress and the character of the new sect not so much accord ing to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero as accord ing to those of the time of Hadrian 3 Tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas which in his extreme con ciseness he has thought proper to suppress We may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome whose obscurity as well as innocence should have shielded them from his indignation and even from his notice The Jews who were numerous in the capital and oppressed in their own country were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation who already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace and even in the heart of the tyrant his wife and mistress the beautiful PoppÃ a and a favourite player of the race of Abraham who had already employed their intercession in behalf of the obnoxious people In their room it was necessary to offer some other victims and it might easily be suggested that although the genuine followers of Moses were innocent of the fire of Rome there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of GalilÃ ans which was capable of the most horrid crimes Under the appellation of GalilÃ ans two distinctions of men were confounded the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles the disciples who had em 7 braced OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 537 braced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth  and the zealots who had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite 4 The former were the friends the latter were the enemies of humankind and the only resemblance between them consisted in the same inflexible con stancy which in the defence of their cause rendered them insen sible of death and tortures The followers of Judas who impelled their countrymen into rebellion were soon buried under the ruins of Jerusalem whilst those of Jesus under the more celebrated name of Christians diffused themselves over the Roman empire How natural was it for Tacitus in the time of Hadrian to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and the sufferings which he might with far greater truth and justice have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost extinguished 4 Whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture for it is no more than a conjecture it is evident that the effects as well as the cause of Nero s persecution were confined to the walls of Rome 41 that the religious tenets of the GalilÃ ans or Christians were never made a subject of punishment or even of inquiry and that as the idea of their sufferings was for a long time connected with those of cruelty and injustice the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them to spare a sect op pressed by a tyrant whose rage had been usually directed against virtue and innocence It is somewhat remarkable that the flames of war consumed al Oppression of the Jews and most at the fame time the temple of Jerusalem and the Capitol of Christians by Rome 4J and it appears no less singular that the tribute which de Dom tian votion had destined to the former should have been converted by the power of an insulting victor to restore and adorn the splendor of the latter44 The emperors levied a general capitation tax on the Jewish people and although the sum assessed on the head of each individual was inconsiderable the use for which it was designed and the severity with which it was exacted were considered as an intolerable grievance 4J Since the officers of the revenue extended  Vol I 2 z 2 their THE DECLINE AND PALL their unjust claim to many persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the Jews it was impossible that the Christians who had so often sheltered themselves under the made of the synagogue should now escape this rapacious persecution Anxious as they were to avoid the flightest infection of idolatry their conscience forbade them to contribute to the honour of that dÃ mon who had assumed the character of the Capitoline Jupiter As a very numerous though declining party among the Christians still adhered to the law of Moses their efforts to dissemble their Jewish origin were detected by the decisive test of circumcision 46 nor were the Roman magi strates at leisure to inquire into the difference of their religious tenets Among the Christians who were brought before the tribu nal of the emperor or as it seems more probable before that of the procurator of JudÃ a two persons are said to have appeared di stinguished by their extraction which was more truly noble than that of the greatest monarchs These were the grandsons of St Jude the apostle who himself was the brother of Jesus Christ 7 Their natural pretensions to the throne of David might perhaps attract the respect of the people and excite the jealousy of the governor but the meanness of their garb and the simplicity of their answers soon convinced him that they were neither desirous nor capable of disturbing the peace of the Roman empire They frankly confessed their royal origin and their near relation to the Messiah but they disclaimed any temporal views and professed that his kingdom which they devoutly expected was purely of a spiritual and angelic nature When they were examined concerning their fortune and occupation they hewed their hands hardened with daily labour and declared that they derived their whole subsistence from the culti vation of a farm near the village of Cocaba of the extent of about twenty four English acres  and of the value of nine thousand drachms or three hundred pounds sterling The grandsons of St Jude were dismissed with compassion and contempt â But OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE But although the obscurity of the house of David might protect Execution of â â c r Â  Clemens ihe them from the suspicions of a tyrant the present greatness of his consul own family alarmed the pusillanimous temper of Domitian which could only be appeased by the blood of those Romans whom he either feared or hated or esteemed Of the two sons of his uncle Flavius Sabinus sÂ the elder was soon convicted of treasonable in tentions and the younger who bore the name of Flavius Clemens was indebted for his safety to his want of courage and ability s The emperor for a long time distinguished so harmless a kinsman by his favour and protection bestowed on him his own niece Domitilla adopted the children of that marriage to the hope of the fucceffion and invested their father with the honours of the con sulship But he had scarcely finished the term of his annual ma gistracy when on a flight pretence he was condemned and exe cuted Domitilla was banished to a desolate island on the coast of Campania 5 and sentences either of death or of confiscation were pro nounced against a great number of persons who were involved in the fame accusation The guilt imputed to their charge was that of Atheism and Jewish manners 5J a singular association of ideas which cannot with any propriety be applied except to the Chri stians as they were obscurely and imperfectly viewed by the ma gistrates and by the writers of that period On the strength of so probable an interpretation and too eagerly admitting the suspicions of a tyrant as an evidence of their honourable crime the church has placed both Clemens and Domitilla among its first martyrs and has branded the cruelty of Domitian with the name of the second persecution But this persecution if it deserves that epithet was of no long duration A few months after the death of Clemens and the banishment of Domitilla Stephen a freedman belonging to the latter who had enjoyed the favour but who had not surely embraced the faith of his mistress assassinated the emperor in his palace 5 The memory of Domitian was condemned by the senate Zzz Â his 54Â THE DECtINE AND FALL his acts were rescinded his exiles recalled and under the gentle administration of Nerva while the innocent were restored to their rank and fortunes even the most guilty either obtained pardon or escaped punishment Ignorance of II About ten years afterwards under the reign of Trajan the cernmgthe younger Pliny was entrusted by his friend and master with the Chnslians government of Bithynia and Pontus He soon found himself at a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should direct his conduct in the execution of an office the most repugnant to his humanity P iny had never assisted at any judicial proceedings against the Christians with whose name alone he seems to be ac quainted and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt the method of their conviction and the degree of their punishment In this perplexity he had recourse to his usual expedient of submitting to the wisdom of Trajan an impartial and in some respects a favourable account of the new superstition requesting the emperoF that he would condescend to resolve his doubts and to instruct his ignorance s6 The life of Pliny had been employed in the acquisition of learning and in the business of the world Since the age of nineteen he had pleaded with distinc tion in the tribunals of Rome 57 filled a place in the senate had been invested with the honours of the consulship and had formed very numerous connexions with every order of men both in Italy and in the provinces From his ignorance therefore we may derive some useful information We may assure ourselves that when he accepted the government of Bithynia there were no general laws or decrees of the senate in force against the Christians that neither Trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors whose edicts were re ceived into the civil and criminal jurisprudence had publickly declared their intentions concerning the new sect and that what ever proceedings had been carried on against the Christians there were OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 541 were none of sufficient weight and authority to establish a precedent for the conduct of a Roman magistrate The answer of Trajan to which the Christians of the succeeding Trajan and age have frequently appealed discovers as much regard for justice establish a S and humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions pr ceed ng Â f of religious policy s Instead of displaying the implacable zeal of aga nst nem an inquisitor anxious to discover the most minute particles of heresy and exulting in the number of his victims the emperor expresses much more solicitude to protect the security of the in nocent than to prevent the escape of the guilty He acknowledges the difficulty of fixing any general plan but he lays down two salutary rules which often afforded relief and support to the distressed Christians Though he directs the magistrates to punish such persons as are legally convicted he prohibits them with a very humane inconsistency from making any inquiries concern ing the supposed criminals Nor was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every kind of information Anonymous charges the emperor rejects as too repugnant to the equity of his government and he strictly requires for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of Christianity is imputed the positive evidence of a fair and open accuser It is likewise probable that the persons who assumed so invidious an office were obliged to declare the grounds of their suspicions to specify both in respect to time and place the secret assemblies which their Christian adversary had frequented and to disclose a great number of circumstances which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from the eye of the profane If they succeeded in their prosecution they were exposed to the resentment of a considerable and active party to the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind and to the ignominy which in every age and country has attended the character of an informer K on the contrary they failed in their proofs they incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty which according to a law pub lished THE DECLINE AND FALL limed by the emperor Hadrian was inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their fellow citizens the crime of Christianity The violence of personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes pre vail over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger but it cannot surely be imagined that accusations of so unpromising an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the Pagan subjects of the Roman empire 59 The expedient which was employed to elude the prudence of the laws affords a sufficient proof how effectually they disappoint ed the mischievous designs of private malice or superstitious zeal In a large and tumultuous assembly the restraints of fear and shame so forcible on the minds of individuals are de prived of the greatest part of their influence The pious Christian as he was desirous to obtain or to escape the glory of martyrdom â expected either with impatience or with terror the stated returns â of the public games and festivals On those occasions the in habitants of the great cities of the empire were collected in the circus or the theatre where every circumstance of the place as well as of the ceremony contributed to kindle their devotion and to extinguish their humanity Whilst the numerous spectators crowned with garlands perfumed with incense purified with the blood of victims and surrounded with the altars and statues of their tutelar deities resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures which they considered as an essential part of their religious worship they recollected that the Christians alone ahhorred the gods of mankind and by their absence and melancholy on these solemn festivals seemed to insult or to lament the public felicity If the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity by a plague a famine or an unsuccessful war if the Tiber had or if the Nile had not risen beyond its banks if the earth had shaken or if the temperate order of the seasons had been interrupted the super stitious Pagans were convinced that the crimes and the impiety  i of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE of the Christians who were spared by the excessive lenity of the government had at length provoked the Divine Justice It was not among a licentious and exasperated populace that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed it was not in an amphitheatre stained with the blood of wild beasts and gladiators that the voice of compassion could be heard The impatient clamours of the multitude denounced the Christians as the enemies of gods and men doomed them to the severest tortures and venturing to accuse by name some of the most distinguished of the new sectaries re quired with irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly apprehended and cast to the lions  The provincial governors and magistrates who presided in the public spectacles were usually inclined to gratify the inclinations and to appease the rage of the people by the sacrifice of a few obnoxious victims But the wisdom of the emperors protected the church from the danger of these tumultuous clamours and irregular accusations which they justly censured as repugnant both to the firmness and to the equity of their administration The edicts of Hadrian and of Antoninus Pius ex pressly declared that the voice of the multitude should never be ad mitted as legal evidence to convict or to punish those unfortunate per sons who had embraced the enthusiasm of the Christians 6 III Punishment was not the inevitable consequence of conviction Trials os the and the Christians whose guilt was the most clearly proved by Ck 1 tbje testimony of witnesses or even by their voluntary confession still retained in their own power the alternative of life or death Lt was not so much the past offence as the actual resistance which excited the indignation of the magistrate An easy pardon was granted to repentance and if they consented to cast a few grains oÂ incense upon the altar they were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause It was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavour to reclaim rather than to punissi those deluded enthusiasts Varying his tone according to the age the sex or the situation THE DECLINE AND FALL situation of the prisoners he frequently condescended to set before their eyes every circumstance which could render life more pleasing or death more terrible and to solicit nay to intreat them that they would shew some compassion to themselves to their families and to their friends 6 If threats and persuasions proved in effectual he had often recourse to violence the scourge and the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument and every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible and as it appeared to the Pagans such criminal obstinacy The ancient apologists of Christianity have censured with equal truth and severity the irregular conduct of their persecutors who contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding admitted the use of torture in order to obtain not a confession but a denial of the crime which was the object of their inquiry 6 The monks of succeeding ages who in their peaceful solitudes entertained themselves with di versifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs have frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature In particular it has pleased them to suppose that the zeal of the Roman magistrates disdaining every consideration of moral virtue or public decency endeavoured to seduce those whom they were unable to vanquish and that by their orders the most brutal violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to seduce It is related that pious females who were prepared to despise death were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial and called upon to de termine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their chastity The youths to whose licentious embraces they were aban doned received a solemn exhortation from the judge to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus against the im pious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars Their violence however was commonly disappointed and the seasonable interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses of Christ from the diflionour even of an involuntary defeat We 2 should OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 54S should not indeed neglect to remark that the more ancient as welj as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with these extravagant and indecent fictions 6 The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation Jjjg of of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural magistrates mistake The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the fame degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which silled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolaters of their own times It is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the empire might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment 6s But it is certain and we may appeal to the grateful confections of the first Christians that the greatest part of those magistrates who exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor or of the senate and to whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death was intrusted behaved like men of polished manners and liberal educations who respected the rules of justice and who were conver_ fant with the precepts of philosophy They frequently declined the odious task of persecution dismissed the charge with contempt or suggested to the accused Christian some legal evasion by which he might elude the severity of the laws 66 Whenever they were invested with a discretionary power 6 they used it much less for the oppression than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted church They were far from condemning all the Christians who were ac cused before their tribunal and very far from punishing with death all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to the new superstition Contenting themselves for the most part with the milder chastisements of imprisonment exile or slavery in the mines 6 they left the unhappy victims of their justice some reason to hope that a prosperous event the accession the marriage or the Vol I 4 A triumph THE DECLINE AND FALL 54 Inconsider able number of martyrs Example of Cyprian bishop of Carthage triumph of an emperor might speedily restore them by a general pardon to their former state The martyrs devoted to immediate execution by the Roman magistrates appear to have been selected from the most opposite extremes They were either bishops and presbyters the persons the most distinguished among the Christians by their rank and influence and whose example might strike terror into the whose sect t9 or else they were the meanest and most abject among them particularly those of the servile condition whose lives were esteemed of little value and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too careless an indifference 70 The learned Origen who from his experience as well as reading was intimately acquainted with the history of the Christians declares in the most express terms that the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable7 His authority would alone be sufficient to annihilate that formidable army of martyrs whose relics drawn for the most part from the catacombs of Rome have replenished so many churches 7 t and whose marvellous atchievements have been the subject of so many volumes of Holy Romance 75 But the general assertion of Origen may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his friend Dionysius who in the immense city of Alexandria and under the rigorous persecution of Decius reckons only ten men and seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian name 7 During the same period of persecution the zealous the eloquent the ambitious Cyprian governed the church not only of Carthage but even of Africa He possessed every quality which could engage the reverence of the faithful or provoke the suspicions and resent ment of the Pagan magistrates His character as well as his station seemed to mark out that holy prelate as the most distinguished object of envy and of danger 75 The experience however of the life of Cyprian is sufficient to prove that our fancy has exaggerated the perilous situation of a Christian bishop  and that the dangers to which he was exposed were less imminent than those which temporal ar 3   bit ion OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 547 bition is always prepared to encounter in the pursuit of honours Four Roman emperors with their families their favourites and their adherents perished by the sword in the space of ten years during which the bishop of Carthage guided by his authority and eloquence the counsels of the African church It was only in the third year of his administration that he had reason during a few months to apprehend the severe edicts of Decius the vigilance Hi Â n8er r  Â and night f of the magistrate and the clamours of the multitude who loudly demanded that Cyprian the leader of the Christians mould be thrown to the lions Prudence suggested the necessity of a tem porary retreat and the voice of prudence was obeyed He with drew himself into an obscure solitude from whence he could maintain a constant correspondence with the clergy and peo ple of Carthage and concealing himself till the tempest was past he preserved his life without relinquishing either his power or his reputation His extreme caution did not however escape the censure of the more rigid Christians who lamented or the reproaches of his personal enemies who insulted a conduct which they considered as a pusillanimous and criminal desertion of the most sacred duty 6 The propriety of reserving himself for the future exigencies of the church the example of several holy bishops 77 and the divine admonitions which as he declares him self he frequently received in visions and extafies were the reasons alleged in his justification 7  But his best apology may be found in the cheerful resolution with which about eight years afterwards he suffered death in the cause of religion The authentic history of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual candour and impartiality A short abstract therefore of its most important cir cumstances will convey the clearest information of the spirit and of the forms of the Roman persecutions 7 When Valerian was consul for the third and Gallienus for the A D 2 fourth time Paternus proconsul of Africa summoned Cyprian 4 A 2 to THE DECLINE AND FALL to appear in his private council chamber He there acquainted him with the Imperial mandate which he had just received 8o that those who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately return to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors Cyprian replied without hesitation that he was a Christian and a bishop devoted to the worship of the true and only Deity to whom he offered up his daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors his lawful sovereigns With modest confidence he pleaded the pri vilege of a citizen in refusing to give any answer to some invidious and indeed illegal questions which the proconsul had proposed A sentence of banishment was pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian s disobedience and he was conducted without delay to Curubis a free and maritime city of Zeugitania in a pleasant situation a fertile territory and at the distance of about forty miles from Carthage 8r The exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniencies of life and the con sciousness of virtue His reputation was diffused over Africa and Italy an account of his behaviour was publistied for the edification of the Christian world 81 and his solitude was frequently interrupted by the letters the visits and the congratulations of the faithful On the arrival of a new proconsul in the province the fortune of Cyprian appeared for some time to wear a still more favourable as pect He was recalled from banishment and though not yet per mitted to return to Carthage his own gardens in the neighbourhood of the capital were assigned for the place of his residence At length exactly one year  after Cyprian was first appre hended Galerius Maximus proconsul of Africa received the Impe rial warrant for the execution of the Christian teachers The bishop of Carthage was sensible that he should be singled out for one of the first victims and the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw himself by a secret flight from the danger and the honour of martyrdom but soon recovering that fortitude which his character required he returned to his gardens and patiently expected the ministers OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE y ministers of death Two officers of rank who were intrusted with that commission placed Cyprian between them in a chariot and as the proconsul was not then at leisure they conducted him not to a pri son but to a private house in Carthage which belonged to one of them An elegant supper was provided for the entertainment of the bishop and his Christian friends were permitted for the last time to enjoy his society whilst the streets were filled with a multitude of the faithful anxious and alarmed for the approaching fate of their spiritual father 5 In the morning he appeared before the tri bunal of the proconsul who after informing himself of the name and situation of Cyprian commanded him to offer sacrifice and pressed him to reflect on the consequences of his disobedience The refusal of Cyprian was firm and decisive and the magistrate when he had taken the opinion of his council pronounced with some reluctance the sentence of death It was conceived in the following terms That Thascius Cyprianus should be immediately beheaded as the enemy of the gods of Rome and as the chief and ring leader of a criminal association which he had seduced into an impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperor6 Valerian and Gallienus 86 The manner of his execution was the mildest and least painful that could be inflicted on a person con victed of any capital offence nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the Bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his principles or the discovery of his accomplices As soon as the sentence was proclaimed a general cry of  We His martyr will die with him arose at once among the listening multitude dom of Christians who waited before the palace gates The generous effusions of their zeal and affection were neither serviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to themselves He was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions without resistance and without insult to the place of his execution a spacious and level plain near the city which was already filled with great numbers of specta y5o THE DECLINE AND FALL tors His faithful presbyters and deacons were permitted to accom pany their holy bishop They assisted him in laying aside his upper garment spread linen on the ground to receive the precious relics of hie blood and received his orders to bestow five and twenty pieces of gold on the executioner The martyr then covered his face with hie hands and at one blow his head was severed from his body His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles but in the night it was removed and transported in a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination to the burial place of the Christians The funeral of Cyprian was publickly cele brated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magis trates and those among the faithful who had performed the last offices to his person and his memory were secure from the danger of inquiry or of punishment It is remarkable that of so great a multitude of bishops in the province of Africa Cyprian was the first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom T Various In It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live martyrdom an apostate but on that choice depended the alternative of honour or infamy Could we suppose that the Bishop of Carthage had em ployed the profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or ambition it was still incumbent on him to support the character which he had assumed 88 and if he possessed the smallest degree of manly fortitude rather to expose himself to the most cruel tortures than by a single act to exchange the reputation of a whole life for the abhorrence of his Christian brethren and the contempt of the Gentile world But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached the crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of desire rather than of terror It is not easy to extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declama tions of the Fathers or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory and happiness which they confidently promised to those who were so OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 1 so fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of religion They inculcated with becoming diligence that the fire of martyrdom sup plied every defect and expiated every fin that while the souls of ordinary Christians were obliged to pass through a flow and painful purification the triumphant sufferers entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliss where in the society of the patriarchs the apostles and the prophets they reigned with Christ and acted as his assessors in the universal judgment of mankind The assurance of a lasting reputation upon earth a motive so congenial to the ta nity of human nature often served to animate the courage of the martyrs The honours which Rome or Athens bestowed on those citizens who had fallen in the cause of theif country were cold and unmeaning demonstrations of respect when compared with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expressed towards the victorious champions of the faith The annual com memoration of their virtues and sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony and at length terminated in religious worship Among the Christians who had publickly confessed their religious principles those who as it very frequently happened had been dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the pagan magistrates obtained such honours as were justly due to their imperfect martyrdom and their generous resolution The most pious females courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters which they had worn and on the wounds which they had received Their persons were esteemed holy their decisions were admitted with deference and they too often abused by their spiritual pride and licentious manners the pre eminence which their zeal and intrepidity had acquired 9o Di stinctions like these whilst they display the exalted merit betray the inconsiderable number of those who suffered and of those who

r of THE DECLINE AND FALL of the first Christians who according to the lively expression of Sulpicius Severus desired martyrdom with more eagerness than his own contemporaries solicited a bishopric S The epistles which Ignatius composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of Asia breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary feelings of human nature He earnestly beseeches the Romans that when he should be exposed in the amphitheatre they would not by their kind but unseasonable intercession deprive him of the crown of glory and he declares his resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which might be employed as the instruments of his death  Some stories are related of the courage of martyrs who actually performed what Ignatius had intended who exasperated the fury of the lions pressed the executioner to hasten his office cheerfully leaped into the sires which were kindled to consume them and discovered a sensation of joy and pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite tortures Several examples have been preserved of a zeal impatient of those restraints which the emperors had provided for the security of the church The Christians sometimes supplied by their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser rudely dis turbed the public service of Paganism 9J and rushing in crowds round the tribunal of the magistrates called upon them to pronounce and to inflict the sentence of the law The behaviour of the Christians was too remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient philosophers  but they seem to have considered it with much less admiration than astonishment Incapable of conceiving the motives which sometimes transported the fortitude of believers beyond the bounds of prudenie or reason they treated such an eagerness to die as the strange result of obstinate despair of stupid insensibility or of superstitious phrenzy9 Unhappy men exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus to the Christians of Asia  unhappy men if you are thus weary of your lives is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices 95 He was extremely cautious as it is observed by a learned and pious 4 historian OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 553 historian of punishing men who had found no accusers but them selves the Imperial laws not having made any provision for so un expected a case condemning therefore a few as a warning to their brethren he dismissed the multitude with indignation and con tempt 9 S Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain the intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace had disposed for the easy recep tion of religious truth On these melancholy occasions there were many among the Gentiles who pitied who admired and who were converted The generous enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to the spectators and the blood of martyrs according to a well known observation became the seed of the church But although devotion had raised and eloquence continued to Gradual re inflame this fever of the mind it insensibly gave way to the more hxMoa natural hopes and fears of the human heart to the love of life the apprehension of pain and the horror of dissolution The more pru dent rulers of the Church found themselves obliged to restrain the indiscreet ardour of their followers and to distrust a constancy which too often abandoned them in the hour of trial97 As the lives of the faithful became less mortified and austere they were every day less ambitious of the honours of martyrdom and the soldiers of Christ instead of distinguishing themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism frequently deserted their post and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their duty to resist There were three methods however of escaping the flames of persecution which were not attended with an equal degree of guilt the first indeed was generally allowed to be innocent the second was of a doubtful or at least of a venial nature but the third implied a direct and cri minal apostacy from the Christian faith I A modern inquisitor would hear with surprise that whenever Thr tree me an information was given to a Roman magistrate of any person alping within his jurisdiction who had embraced the sect of the Christians mart rJon Vol I 4 B the THE DECU NE A ND f ALL the charge was communicated to the party accused and that a con venient time vyas allowed him to settle his domestic concerns and to prepare an answer to the crime which was imputed to him 9 If he entertained any doubt of his own constancy such a delay af forded him the opportunity of preserving his life and honour by flight of withdrawing himself into some obseure retirement or some distant province and of patiently expecting the return of peace and security A measure so consonant o reason was soon authorized by the advice and example of the most holy prelates and seems to have been censured by few except by the Mpntanists who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate adherence to the rigour of ancient discipline II The provincial governors whose zeal was kss prevalent than their avarice had countenanced the practice of felling certificates or libels as they were called which attested that the persons therein mentioned had complied with the laws and sa crificed to the Roman deities  By producing these false r k clarations the opulent and timid Ghristiane were enabled lo silence the malice of an informer and to reconcile in some meaÂ sure their safety with their religion A flight pennance atoned for tins profane dissimulation HI In every persecution there were great number of unworthy Christians who publickly disowned or renounced the faith which they had profesied and who con firmed the sincerity of their abjuration by the legal acts of burning incense or of offering sacrifices Some of these apostates had yielded on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate whilst the patience of others had been subdued by the length and repetition of tortures The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their in ward remorse while others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the altars of the gods  But the disguise which fear had im posed subsisted no longer than the present danger As soon as the severity of the persecution was abated the doors of the churches were assailed by the returning multitude of penitents who detested their OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE SS5 their idolatrous submission and who solicited with equal ardor but with various success their re admission into the society of Chris tians Â IV Notwithstanding the general rules established for the con AfÂ â Â ivÂ 00 of seventy viction and punishment of the Christians the fate of those sectaries a nÂ i toiera in an extensive and arbitrary government must still in a great mea sure have depended on their own behaviour the circumstances of the times and the temper of their supreme as well as subordinate rulers Zeal might sometimes provoke and prudence might some times avert or assuage the superstitious f iry of 1 he pagan6 A va riety of motives might dispose the provincial governors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the laws and of these motives the most forcible was their regard not only for the public edicts but for the secret intentions of the emperor a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the flames of persecu tion As often as any occasional severities were exercised in the different parts of the empire the primitive Christians lamented and perhaps magnified their own sufferings  but the celebrated number The ten per of ten persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical writers secut on â of the fifth century who possessed a more distinct view of the pro sperous or adverse fortunes of the church from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian The ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of Egypt arid of the ten horns of the Apocalypse first suggested this calculation to their minds and in their application of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history they were careful to select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the Christian cause OJ But these transient persecutions served only to revive the zeal and to restore the discipline of the faithful and the moments of extraor dinary rigour were compensated by much longer intervals of peace and security The indifference of some princes and the indulgence of others permitted the Christiarfs to enjoy though not peifiaps a legal yet an actuaVand public toleration of their religion 4B2

attested the truth of their doctrine The first of these examples is attended with some difficulties which might perplex a sceptical mind We are required to believe that Pontius Pilate informed the emperor of the unjust sentence of death which he had pro nounced against an innocent and as it appeared a divine person and that without acquiring the merit he exposed himself to the danger of martyrdom that Tiberius who avowed his contempt for all religion immediately conceived the design of placing the Jewish Messiah among the gods of Rome that his servile senate ventured ro disobey the commands of their master that Tiberius instead of resenting their refusal contented himself with protecting the Chris tians from the severity of the laws many years before such laws were enacted or before the church had assumed any distinct name or existence and lastly that the memory of this extraordinary transaction was preserved in the most public and authentic records which escaped the knowledge of the historians of Greece and Rome and were only visible to the eyes of an African Christian who com posed his apology one hundred and sixty years after the death of Tiberius The edict of Marcus Antoninus is supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude for the miraculous deliver ance which he had obtained in the Marcomannic war The distress of the legions the seasonable tempest of rain and hail of thunder and of lightning and the dismay and defeat of the barharians have been celebrated by the eloquence of several pagan writers If there were any Christians in that army it was natural that they should ascribe some merit to the fervent prayers which in the moment of danger they had offered up for their own and the public safety But OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 7 But we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble by the imperial medals and by the Antonine column that neither the prince nor the people entertained any fense of this signal obligation since

they passed in safety the thirteen years of a cruel ty ranny and when the empire was established in the house of Sever rus they formed a domestic but more honourable connexion with the new court  The emperor was persuaded that in a dangerous sickness he had derived some benefit either spiritual or physical from the holy oil with which one of his slaves had anointed him He always treated with peculiar distinction several persons of both sexes who had embraced the new religion The nurse as well as the preceptor of Caracalla were Christians and if that young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity it was occasioned by an in cident which however trifling bore some relation to the cause of Christianity C7 Under the reign of Severus the fury of the popu lace was checked the rigour of ancient laws was for some time sus pended j and the provincial governors were satisfied with receiving 5 3 THE DECLINE AND FALL an annual present from the churches within their jurisdiction as the price or as the reward of their moderation 0 The controversy concerning the precise time of the celebration of Easter armed the bishops of Asia and Italy against each other and was considered as the most important business of this period of leisure and tranquil lity Â 9 Nor was the peace of the church interrupted till the ir creasing numbers of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the A D

not be carried into strict execution without exposing to danger and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and missionaries Ia thi6 mitigated persecution we may still discover the indulgent

and afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented that he had been purified by confession and pennance from the stain of guilt which he had con tracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor 9 The fall of A D 449 Philip introduced with the change of masters a new system of government fo oppressive to the Christians that their former con dition ever since the time of Domitian was represented as a state of perfect freedom and security if compared with the rigorous treat ment which they experienced under the short reign of Decius The virtues of that prince will scarcely allow us to suspect that he was actuated by a mean resentment against the favourites of his predecessor and it is more reasonable to believe that in the prosecu tion of his general design to restore the purity of Roman manners he was desirous of delivering the empire from what he condemned as a recent and criminal superstition The bishops of the most con siderable cities were removed by exile or death the vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy of Rome during sixteen months from proceeding to a new election and it was the opinion of the Christians that the emperor would more patiently endure a compe titor for the purple than a bishop in the capital  Were it possible to suppose that the penetration of Decius had discovered pride under the disguise of humility or that he could foresee the temporal do minion which might insensibly arise from the claims of spiritual authority we might be less surprised that he should consider the successors of St Peter as the most formidable rivals to those of Au gustus f Valerian The administration of Valerian was distinguished by a levity and and hUso c inconstancy ill suited to the gravity of the Roman Censor In the ceslÂ I

the empire restored peace to the church and the Christians obtained the free exercise of their religion by an edict addressed to the bishops and conceived in such terms as seemed to acknowledge their office and public character 1 The ancient laws without being formally repealed were suffered to A D 260â fink into oblivion and excepting only some hostile intentions which are attributed to the emperor Aureliah  the disciples of Christ passed above forty years in a state of prosperity far more dangerous to their virtue than the severest trials of persecution The story of Paul of Samosata who filled the metropolitan see of Paul of Sa Antioch while the East was in the hands of Odenathus and Zeno manners bia may serve to illustrate the condition and character of the times A D 2 5Â The wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt since it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers nor acquired by the arts of honest industry But Paul considered the service of the church as a very lucrative profession 5 His ecclesiasti cal jurisdiction was venal and rapacious he extorted frequent con tributions from the most opulent of the faithful and converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue By his pride and luxury the Christian religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles His council chamber and his throne the splen dor with which he appeared in public the suppliant crowd who so licited his attention the multitude of letters and petitions to which j he dictated his answers and the perpetual hurry of business in jf which he was

praise os his divine eloquence Against those who resisted his power or refused to flatter his vanity the prelate of Antioch was arrogant rigid and inexorable but he re laxed the discipline and lavished the treasures of the church on his dependent clergy who were permitted to imitate their master in the gratification of every sensual appetite For Paul indulged him self very freely in the pleasures of the table and he had received into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women as the constant companions of his leisure momenta Heisdcgrad Notwithstanding these scandalous vices if Paul of Samosata fceofAn hÂ ad preserved the purity of the orthodox faith his reign over the aTo capital of Syria would have ended only with his life and had a seasonable persecution intervened an effort of courage might perhaps have placed him in the rank of saints and martyrs Some nice and subtle errors which he imprudently adopted and obstinately main tained concerning the doctrine of the Trinity excited the zeal and indignation of the eastern churches ll8 From Egypt to the Euxine sea the bishops were in arms and in motion Several councils were held confutations were published excommunications were pronounced ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused treaties were concluded and violated and at length Paul of Samosata was degraded from his episcopal character by the sentence of seventy or eighty bishops who assembled for that purpose at Antioch and who without consulting the rights of the clergy or people appointed a successor by their own authority The manifest irregularity of this proceeding increased the numbers of the discon tented faction and as Paul who was no stranger to the arts of courts had insinuated himself into the favour of Zenobia he main tained above four years the posteffion of the episcopal house and office The victory of Aurelian changed the face of the East and the two contending parties who applied to each other the epithet of I OF THE ROMAN EMPIRfe 6 of schism and heresy were either commanded or permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror This public arid very singular trial affords a convincing proof that the existence the property the privileges and the internal policy of the Christians were acknowledged if not by the laws at least by the magistrates of the empire As a pagan and as a soldier it could scarcely be expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion whether the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith His determination however The sentence _ is executed by was founded on the general principles of equity and reason He Aurelian considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable A D 74 judges among the Christians and as soon as he was informed that they had unanimously approved the sentence of the council he ac quiesced in their opinion and immediately gave orders that Paul should be compelled to relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office of which in the judgment of his brethren he had been justly deprived But while we applaud the justice we should not overlook the policy of Aurelian who was desirous of restoring and cementing the dependance of provinces on the capital by every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any part

colleagues frequently conferred the most important offices on those persons who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of the Gods but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of the state The bishops held an honourable rank in their respective provinces and were treated with distinction and respect not only by the people but by the magistrates themselves Almost in every city the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the in creasing multitude of proselytes and in their place more stately and capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the faithful The corruption of manners and principles so forcibly lamented by Eusebius  may be considered not only as a conse quence but as a proof of the liberty which the Christians enjoyed and abused under the reign of Diocletian Prosperity had relaxed the nerves of discipline Fraud envy and malice prevailed in every congregation The presbyters aspired to the episcopal office which every day became an object more worthy of their ambition The bishops who contended with each other for ecclesiastical pre eminence OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 56s eminence appeared by their conduct to claim a secular and tyran

seeming security an attentive observer Progress of might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a petition more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured The pT ns 1 zeal and rapid progress of the Christians awakened the Polytheists from their supine indifference in the cause of those deities whom custom and education had taught them to revere The mutual pro vocations of a religious war which had already continued above two hundred years exasperated the animosity of the contending parties The Pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent andv obscure sect which

perhaps they despised against the Christians whom they had reason to fear These fashionable philosophers prosecuted the de sign of extracting allegorical wisdom from the fictions of the Greek poets instituted mysterious rites of devotion for the use of their chosen disciples recommended the worship of the ancient gods as the emblems or ministers of the supreme deity and composed against the faith of the gospel many elaborate treatises which have since been committed to the flames by the prudence of orthodox emperors M Although the policy of Diocletian and the humanity of Con stantius inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims of tolera tion it was soon discovered that their two associates Maximian and Galerius entertained the most implacable aversion for the nnme and religion of the Christians The minds of those prin ces had never been enlightened by science education had never softened their temper They owed their greatness to their swords and in their most elevated

desertion 4S Examples of such a nature savour much less of religious persecution than of martial or even civil law but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors to justify the severity of Galerius who dismissed a great number of Christian officers from their employments and to authorize the opinion that a sect of enthusiasts which avowed principles so re pugnant to the public safety

blies of the bistiops to whose decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obedience Arguments like these may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new system of persecution but though we may suspect it is not in our power to relate the secret intrigues of the palace the private views and resentments the jealousy of women or eu nuchs and all those trifling but decisive causes which so often in fluence the fate of empires and the counsels of the wisest mo narchs V Demolition of The pleasure of the emperors was at length signified to the Nkomedia Christians who during the course of this melancholy winter had 23 dFebruary exPe ed with anxiety the result of so many secret consultations The twenty third of February which coincided with the Roman festival of the Terminalia 4 was appointed whether from acci dent or design to set bounds to the progress of Christianity At the earliest dawn of day the PrÃ torian prÃ fect 9 accompanied by several generals tribunes and officers of the revenue repaired to the principal church of Nicomedia which was situated on an emi nence in the most populous and beautiful part of the city The doors were instantly broke open they rushed into the sanctuary and as they searched in vain for some visible object of worship they were OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 9 were obliged to content themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of holy scripture The ministers of Diocletian were followed by a numerous body of guards and pioneers who marched in order of battle and were provided with all the instruments used in the destruction of fortified cities By their incessant labour a sacred edifice which towered above the imperial palace and had long excited the indignation and envy of the Gentiles was in a few hours levelled with the ground 5Â  The next day the general edict of persecution was published 151 The first edict and though Diocletian still averse to the effusion of blood had TOO Christians derated the fury of Galerius who proposed that every one refusing bruary Â to offer sacrifice should immediately be burnt alive the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the Christians might be deemed suffi ciently rigorous and effectual It was enacted that their churches in all the provinces of the empire should be demolished to their foundations and the punishment of death was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies for the pur pose of religious worship The philosophers who now assumed the unworthy office of directing the blind zeal of persecution had di ligently studied the nature and genius of the Christian religion â and  as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets the evangelists and the apostles they most probably suggested the order that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates who were com manded under the severest penalties to burn them in a pub lib and  solemn manner By the fame edict the property of the church was at once confiscated and the several parts of which it might consist were either fold to the highest bidder united to thfe imperial domain bestowed on the citie and corporations or granted tathe solicitations of rapacious courtiers After taking such effect tual measures to abolish thei worship and to dissolve the goverrr j to t I 4 D ment 7o THE DECLINE AND FALL ment of the Christians it was thought necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of Nature of Rome and of their ancestors Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honours or employments slaves were for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom and the whole bo y of the people were put out of the protection of the law The judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a Christian But the Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themselves had suffered and thus those un fortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity while they were ex cluded from the benefits of public justice This new species of mar tyrdom so painful and lingering so obscure and ignominious was perhaps the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful nor can it be doubted that the pallions and interest of mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors But the policy of a well ordered government must sometimes have in terposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians nor was it possible for the Roman princes entirely to remove the apprehension of punishment or to connive at every act of fraud and violence with out exposing their own authority and the rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers f Zeal and pj This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view in the most christian conspicuous place of Nicomedia before it was torn down by the hands of a Christian who expressed at the fame time by the bit terest invectives his contempt as well as abhorrence for such im pious and tyrannical governors His offence according to the mildest laws amounted to treason and deserved death And if it fee true that he was a person of rank and education those circum stances could serve only to aggravate his guilt He was burnt or rather roasted by a slow sire and bis executioners zealous to re venge the personal insult which had been offered to the emperors exhausted OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE exhausted every refinement of cruelty without being able to subdue his patience or to alter the steady and insulting smile which in his dying agonies he still preserved in his countenance The Christians though they confessed that his conduct had not been strictly con formable to the laws of prudence admired the divine fervour of his zeal and the excess commendations which they lavished on the memory of their hero and martyr contributed to fix a deep im prefllon of terror and hatred in the mind of Diocletian His fears were soon alarmed by the view of a danger from which Fire of the p 0 lace of Nico he very narrowly escaped Within fifteen days the palace of Nico media impu t  ed to the media and even the bedchamber of Diocletian were twice in flames 5 Christians and though both times they were extinguished without any material damage the singular repetition of the fire was justly considered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or ne gligence The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians and it was suggested with some degree of probability that those despe rate fanatics provoked by their present sufferings and apprehensive of impending calamities had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren the eunuchs of the palace against the lives of two emperors whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the church of God Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every breast but especially in that of Diocletian A great number of persons distinguished either by the offices which they had silled or by the favour which they had enjoyed were thrown into prison Every mode of torture was put in practice and the court as well as city was polluted with many bloody executions M But as it was found impossible to extort any discovery of this mysterious transaction it seems incumbent on us either to presume the inno cence or to admire the resolution of the sufferers A few days after wards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia declaring that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of the Christians The ecclesiastical his 4 D 3 torians S72 THE DECLINE AND FALL torians from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect know ledge of this persecution are at a loss how to account for the fears and danger of the emperors Two of these writers a Prince and a Rhetorician weie eye witnesses of the fire of Nico media The one ascribes it to lightning and the divine wrath  the other affirms that it was kindled by the malice of Galeriusjiimself 5S   Executori of  t e aprajnst trie Christians was designed for a general law the first edict Â o r o of the whole empire and as Diocletian and Galerius though they might not wait for the consent were assured of the concurrence of the western princes it would appear more consonant to our ideas of policy that the governors of all the provinces should have received secret instructions to publish on one and the same day this declaration of war within their respective departments It was at least to be expected that the convenience of the public high ways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost dispatch from the palace of Nico media to the extremities of the Roman world and that they would not have suffered fifty days to elapse before the edict was published in Syria and near four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa s6 This delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper of Diocletian who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures of persecution and who was desirous of trying the ex periment under his more immediate eye before he gave way to the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant provinces At first indeed the magistrates were re strained from the effusion of blood but the use of every other severity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal nor could the Christians though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies or to deliver their sacred books to the flames The pious obstinacy of Felix an African bishop appears to have embarrassed the sub ordinate ministers of the government The curator of the city sent 7 him OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 573 him in chains to the proconsul The proconsul transmitted him to the PrÃ torian prÃ fect of Italy and FÃ lix who disdained even to give an evasive answer was at length beheaded at Venufia in Lucania a place on which the birth of Horace has conferred fame This precedent and perhaps some imperial rescript which was issued in consequence of it appeared to authorize the gover nors of provinces in punishing with death the refusal of the Chri stians to deliver up their sacred books There were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown of martyrdom but there were likewise too many who purchased an ignominious life by discovering and betraying the holy scripture into the hands of infidels A great number even of bishops and presbyters acquired by this criminal compliance the opprobrious epithet of Traditors and their offence was productive of much present scandal and of much future discord in the African Church 5 The copies as well as versions of scripture were already so Demolition of multiplied in the empire that the most severe inquisition could no thec utche longer be attended with any fatal consequences and even the sacrifice of those volumes which in every congregation were pre served for public use required the consent of some treacherous and unworthy Christians But the ruin of the churches was easily effected by the authority of the government and by the labour of the Pagans In some provinces however the magistrates con tented themselves with shutting up the places of religious worship In others they more literally complied with the terms of the edict and after taking away the doors the benches and the pulpit which they burnt as it were in a funeral pile they completely demolislied the remainder of the edifice 59 It is perhaps to this melancholy occasion that we should apply a very remarkable story which is related with so many circumstances of variety and impro bability that it serves rather to excite than to satisfy our curiosity In 574 THE DECLINE AND FALL la a small town in Phrygia of whose name as well as situation we are left ignorant it should seern that the magistrates and the body of the people had embraced the Christian faith and as some resistance might be apprehended to the execution of the edict the governor of the province was supported by a nuraeroua detach ment of legionaries On their approach the citizens threw them selves into the church with the resolution either of defending by arms that sacred edifice or of perishing in its ruins They indignantly rejected the notice and permission which was given them to retire till the soldiers provoked by their obstinate refusal set fire to the building on all sides and consumed by this extra ordinary kind of martyrdom a great number of Phrygians with their wives and children 6o Subsequent Some flight disturbances though they were suppressed almost as soon as excited in Syria and the frontiers of Armenia afforded the enemies of the church a very plausible occasion to insinuate that those troubles had been secretly fomented by the intrigues of the bisliops who had already forgotten their ostentatious professions of passive and unlimited obedience 5 The resentment or the fears of Diocletian at length transported him beyond the bounds of mode ration which he had hitherto preserved and he declared in a scries of cruel edicts his intention of abolishing the Christian name By the first of these edicts the governors of the provinces were directed to apprehend all persons of the ecclesiastical order and the prisons destined for the vilest criminals were soon filled with a multi_ tude of bissiops presbyters deacons readers and exorcists By a second edict the magistrates were commanded to employ every method of severity which might reclaim them from their odious superstition and oblige them to return to the established worship of the gods This rigorous order was extended by a subsequent edict to the whole body of Christians who were exposed to a vio lent and general persecution 6 Instead of those salutary restraints which OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE S7S which had required the direct and solemn testimony of an accuser it became the duty as well as interest of the imperial officers to discover to pursue and to torment the most obnoxious among the faithful Heavy penalties were denounced against all who should presume to save a proscribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods and of the emperors Yet notwithstanding the severity of this law the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans in concealing their friends or relations affords an honourable proof that the rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the senti ments of nature and humanity 6 Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts against the Chri Geneial idea  r   of the perse ftians than as if he had been desirous of committing to other cution hands the work of persecution he divested himself of the imperial purple The character and situation of his colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce and sometimes inclined them to suspend the execution of these rigorous laws nor can we ac quire a just and distinct idea of this important period of eccle siastical history unless we separately consider the state of Chri stianity in the different parts of the empire during the space of ten years which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian and the final peace of the ehurch The mild and humane temper of Cbnstantius Was averse to the in the western oppression of any part of his subjects The principal offices of his CoMta palace were exercised by Christians He loved their persons esteemed Jj 00 their fidelity and entertained not any dislike to their religious prin ciples But as long as Constantius remained in the subordinate station of CÃ sar it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of Diocletian or to disobey the commands of Maxhnian Hi authority contributed however to alleviate the sufferings which he pitied and abhorred He consented with reluctance to the ruin of the churches  but he ventured to protect the Christians themselves from the fury of the populace and from the rigour of the laws  S The Â 5 THE DECLINE AND FALL The provinces of Gaul under which we may probably include those of Britain were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they â enjoyed to the gentle interposition of their sovereign 6 Bat Datianus the president or governor of Spain actuated either by Zeal or policy chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors than to understand the secret intentions of Constantius and it can fcaicely be doubted that his provincial administration was stained w th the blood of a few martyrs 65 The eleva tion of Constantius to the supreme and independent dignity of Augustus gave a free scope to the exercise of his virtues and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from establisliing a system of toleration of which he left the precept and the example to his son Constantine His fortunate son who from the first moment of his accession declared himself the protector of the church at length deserved the appellation of the first emperor who publickly professed and established the Christian religion The motives of his conversion as they may variously be deduced from faith from virtue from policy or from remorse and the progress of the revolution which under his powerful influence and that of his sons rendered Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire will form a very interesting and important chapter in the second volume of this history At present it may be sufficient to observe that every victory of Con stantine was productive of some relief or benefit to the church in Italy and The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced a short but vio Maximun l nt persecution The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were strictly and cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian who had long hated the Christians and who delighted in acts of blood and violence 1st the autumn of the first year of the persecution the two emperors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph several pppressive laws appear to have issued from their secret consultations and the diligence of the magistrates was animated by the presence of their sovereigns After Diocletian had divested himself of the  i purple and aeveru OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 577 purple Italy and Africa were administered under the name of Severus and were exposed without defence to the implacable resentment of his master Galerius Among the martyrs of Rome Adauctus deserves the notice of posterity He was of a noble family in Italy and had raised himself through the successive honours of the palace to the important office of treasurer of the private demesnes Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only person of rank and distinction who appears to have suffered death during the whole course of this general persecution 6 The revolt of Maxentius immediately restored peace to the under churches of Italy and Africa and the fame tyrant who oppressed every other class of his subjects mewed himself just humane and even partial towards the afflicted Christians He depended on their gratitude and affection and very naturally presumed that the iajuries which they had suffered and the dangers which they still apprehended from his most inveterate enemy would secure the fidelity of a party already considerable by their numbers and opu lence 67 Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the bissiops of Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof of his tolera tion since it is probable that the most orthodox princes would adopt the fame measures with regard to their establissied clergy Mar cellus the former of those prelates had thrown the capital into confusion by the severe pennance which he imposed on a great number of Christians who during the late persecution had re nounced or dissembled their religion The rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions the blood of the faithful was shed by each other s hands and the exile of Marcellus whose pru dence seems to have been less eminent than his zeal was found to be the only measure capable of restoring peace to the distracted church of Rome 6 The behaviour of Mensurius bishop of Car thage appears to have been still more reprehensible A deacon of that city had publissied a libel against the emperor The offender Vol I 4 E took THE DECLINE AND FALL took refuge in the episcopal palace and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities the bishop refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice For this treason able resistance Mensurius was summoned to court and instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or banishment he was permitted after a short examination to return to his diocese 6 Such was die happy condition of the Christian subjects of Maxentius that whenever they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of martyrs they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant provinces of the East A story is related of Aglae a Roman lady descended from a consular family and possessed of so ample an estate that it required the management of seventy three stewards Among these Boniface was the favourite of his mistress and as Aglae mixed love with devotion it is reported that he was admitted to share her bed Her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the East She intrusted Boniface with a considerable sum of gold and a large quantity of aromaticsj and her lover attended by twelve horsemen and three covered chariots undertook a remote pilgrimage as far as Tarslis iniGUiaiR 0 r andtheEati ne sanguinary temper of Galerius the first and principal au erfula ds thor osuhe persecution was formidable to those Christians whom Ifeximin tftejr misfortunes had placed within the limits of his dominions and it may fairly be presumed that many persons of a middle rank who were not confined by the chains either of wealth on of poverty very frequently deserted their native country and sought a refuge inr the milder climate of the Welh As long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum he could with difficulty either find or make a considerable number of martyrs in a warlike country which had entertained the missionaries of the gospel with marc coldness and reluctance than any other part of the empire But when Galerius had obtained the supreme power and the government of Off THE ROMAN EMPIRE 579 of the East he indulged in their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty not only in the provinces of Thrace and Asia which acknowledged his immediate jurisdiction but in those of Syria Palestine and Egypt where Maximin gratified his own inclination by yielding a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor  The frequent disappointments of his ambitious views the experience of six years of persecution and the salutary reflections which a lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of Galerius at length convinced him that the most violent efforts of despotism are insufficient to extirpate a whole people or to subdue their religious prejudices Desirous of repairing the mischief that he had occasioned he published in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine a general edict which after a pompous recital of the imperial titles proceeded in the following manner Among the important cares which have occupied our mind fof Galerius pob     e    l foe an edict u the utility and preservation or the empire it was our intention to of toleration correct and re establish all things according to the ancient laws  and

fathers and presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity had invented extravagant laws and n opinions according to the dictates of their fancy and had col lected a various society from the different provinces of our em pire The edicts which we have published to enforce the wor ship of the gods having exposed many of the Christians to danger and distress many having suffered death and many more who still persist in their impious folly being left destitute of atty l public exercise of religion we are disposed to extend to those  unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency We permit them therefore freely to profess their private opinions and i to assemble in their conventicles without fear or molestation 4 E 2 provided 58o THE DECLINE AND FALL  provided always that they preserve a due respect to the established laws and government By another rescript we shall signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates and we hope that M our indulgence will engage the Christians to offer up their prayers to the deity whom they adore for our safety and pro sperity for their own and for that of the republic V It is not usually in the language of edicts and manifestos that we should search for the real character or the secret motives of princes but as these were the words of a dying emperor his situation per haps may be admitted as a pledge of his sincerity Feiceosthe When Galerius subscribed this edict of toleration he was well assured that Licinius would readily comply With the inclinations of his friend and benefactor and that any measures in favour of the Christians would obtain the approbation of Constantine But the emperor would not venture to jnsert in the preamble the name of Maximin whose consent was of the greatest importance and who succeeded a few days afterwards to the provinces of Asia In the first six months however of his new reign Maximin affected toÂ adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor and though he never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict Sabinus his PrÃ torian prÃ fect addressed a circular letter to all the governors and magistrates of the provinces expatiating on the imperial clemency acknowledging the invincible obstinacy of the Christians and directing the officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosecutions and to connive at the secret assemblies of those enthu siasts In consequence of these orders great numbers of Christians were released from prison or delivered from the mines The con fessors singing hymns of triumph returned into their own coun tries and those who had yielded to the violence of the tempest solicited with tears of repentance their re admission into the bosom of the church I7 4 But OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 581 But this treacherous calm was of short duration nor could the Max in pre pares to renew Christians of the East place any confidence in the character of their jhepersceu sovereign Cruelty and superstition were the ruling passions of the foul of Maximin The former suggested the means the latter pointed out the objects of persecution The emperor was devoted to the worship of the gods to the study of magic and to the be lief of oracles The prophets or philosophers whom he revered as the favourites of heaven were frequently raised to the government of provinces and admitted into his most secret councils They easily convinced him that the Christians had been indebted for their victories to theip regular discipline and that the weakness of poly theism had principally stowed from a want of union and subordi nation among the ministers of religion A system of government was therefore instituted which was evidently copied from the policy of the church In all the great cities of the empire the temples wererepaired and beautified by the order of Maximin and the offi ciating priests of the various deities were subjected to the authority of a superior pontiff destined to oppose the bishop and to pro mote the cause of paganism These pontiffs acknowledged in their turn the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high priests of the province who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the em peror himself A white robe was the ensign of their dignity and these new prelates were carefully selected from the most noble and opulent families By the influence of the magistrates and of the sacerdotal order a great number of dutiful addresses were obtained particularly from the cities of Nicomedia Antioch and Tyre which artfully represented the well known intentions of the court as the general fense of the people solicited the emperor to consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his clemency expressed their abhorrence of the Christians and humbly prayed that those impi ous sectaries might at least he excluded from the limits of their respective territories The answer of Maximin to the address which he 58 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL End of the persecutions Probable ac count of the sufferings of the martyrs and confes sors he obtained from the citizens of Tyre is still extant He praises their zeal and devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction descants on the obstinate impiety of the Christians and betrays by the readiness with which he consents to their banishment that he considered him self as receiving rather than as conferring an obligation The priests as well as the magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts which were engraved on tables of brass and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effusion of blood the most cruel and ignominious punishments were inflicted on the refractory Christians The Asiatic Christians had every thing to dread from the severity of a bigoted monarch who prepared his measures of violence with such deliberate policy But a few months had scarcely elapsed be fore the edicts publistied by the two western emperors obliged Maxi min to suspend the prosecution of his designs the civil war which he so rashly undertook against Licinius employed all his attention and the defeat and death of Maximin soon delivered the church from the last and most implacable of her enemies 7 s In this general view of the persecution which was first authorized by the edicts of Diodesian I have purposely refrained from describ ing the particular sufferings and deaths of the Christian martyrs It would have been an easy task from the history of Eusebius from the declamations of Lactantius and from the most ancient acts to collect a long series of horrid and disgustful pictures and to fill many pages with racks and scourges with iron hooks and red hot beds and with all the variety of tortures which fire and steel savage beasts and more savage executioners could inflict on the human body These melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and miracles destined either to delay the death to celebrate the triumph or to discover the relics of those canonized saints who suffered for the name of Christ But I cannot determine what I ought to transcribe till I am satisfied how much I ought to believe The gravest OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE gravest of the ecclesiastical historians Eusebius himself very frankly confesses that he has related whatever might redound to the glory and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace of reli gion 7 Such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history has not paid a very strict regard to the observance of the other and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of Eusebius which was less tinctured with credulity and more practised in the arts of courts than that of almost any of his contemporaries On some particular occasions when the ma gistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest or resentment when the zeal of the martyrs urged them to forget the rules of prudence and perhaps of decency to overturn the altars to pdur out imprecations against the emperors ot to strike the judge as he fit on his tribunal it maybe presumed that every mode of tOrttire which cruelty could invent or constancy could endure was exhausted on those devoted victims 78 Two circumstances how ever have been unwarily mentioned which insinuate that the ge neral treatment of the Christians who had been apprehended by the officers of justicewas less intolerable than it is usually imagined to hare been r The confessors who were condemned to work in the mines were permitted by the hurtianity or the negligence of their keepers to build chapels and freely to profess their religion in the midst0 of those dreary habitations 7 2 The Bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians who vo luntarily threwthemsclves into th e tiaffdVof tHemagiffrates Softie of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debtfc who blindly fought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death Others were1 allured by the hope that a short eonsinernent would expiate the sins of a whole life and others again were actuated by the less honour able motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence arfdJ perhaps a cOftsi drrable profit from the alms which the charity of the faithful bei z stowed DECLINE AND FALL THE stowed on the prisoners After the church had triumphed over all her enemies the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering A conve nient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs whose wounds had been instantly healed whose strength had been renewed and whose lost members had miracu lously been restored were of sufficient weight to remove every diffi culty and to silence every objection The most extravagant legends as they conduced to the honour of the church were applauded by the credulous multitude countenanced by the power of the clergy and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment of pain and torture are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian his associates and his successors The recent legendaries record whole armies and cities which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing rage of persecution The more ancient writers content themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical in vectives without condescending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel From the history of Eusebius it may however be col lected that only nine bishops were punished with death and we are assured by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine that no more than ninety two Christians were intitled to that ho nourable appellation 8 As we are unacquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time it is not in our power to draw any useful inferences from the former of these facts but the latter may serve to justify a very important and pro bable conclusion According to the distribution of Roman provinces I Palestine OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire Sx and since there were some governors who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful J it is reasonable to believe that the country which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Ga leriusand Maximin the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen hundred a number which if it is equally divided between the ten years of the persecution will allow an annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs Allotting the fame proportion to the provinces of Italy Africa and perhaps Spain where at the end of two or three years the rigour of the penal laws was either suspended or abolished the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicial sentence will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons Since it cannot be doubted that the Ghristians were more numerous and their enemies more exasperated in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any former persecution this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of pri mitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into the world We hall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth which ob Conclusion trudes ijself on the reluctant mind that even admitting without hesitation or inquiry all that history has recorded or devotion has feigned on the subject of martyrdoms it must still be acknowledged that the Christians in the course of their intestine dissensions have â inflicted far greater severities on each other than they had expe rienced from the zeal of infidels During the ages of ignorance â which followed the subversion of the Roman empire in the West the bishops of the imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the Latin church The fabric of super stition which they had erected and which might long have defied Vol I 4  he THE DECLINE AND FALL c the feeble efforts of reason was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics who from the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed the popular character of reformers The church of Rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud j a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscrip tions wars massacres and the institution of the holy office And as the reformers were animated by the love of civil as well as of religious freedom the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of the clergy and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual censures In the Netherlands alone more than one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles the Fifth are said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner and this ex traordinary number is attested by Grotius  a man of genius and learning who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contend ing sects and who composed the annals of his own age and country at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of intelligence and increased the danger of detection If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotiue it must be allowed that the number of Protestants who were executed in a single province and a single reign far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries and of the Roman empire But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the Reformers 8J we shall be naturally led to inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly bishop and a passionate declaimer who under the protection of Constantine enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions which Christianity had experienced from the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gra cious sovereign N O E S ADVERTISEMENT DILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an historical writer may ascribe to himself if any merit indeed can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty I may therefore be allowed to say that I have carefully examined all the original materials that could illustrate the subject which I had undertaken to treat Should I ever complete the extensive design which has been flcetched out in the preface I might per haps conclude it with a critical account of the authors consulted during the progress of the whole work j and however such an attempt might incur the censure of ostentation I am persuaded that it would be susceptible of entertainment as well as information At present I shall content myself with a single observation The Biographers who under the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine composed or rather compiled the lives of the emperors from Hadrian to the sons of Carus are usually mentioned under the names of Ã lius Spartianus Julius Capitolinus Ã lius Lampridius Vulcatius Gallicanus Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus But there is so much perplexity in the titles of

in Palestine during the nthflt course of the persecution The vth chapter Uxxviii NOTES ON THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER of his viiith book which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt may seem to contradict our mo derate computation but it will only lead us to ad mire the artful management of the historian Chusing for the scene of the most exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered country of the Ro man empire he relates that in Thebais from ten to one hundred persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day But when he pro ceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt his language insensibly becomes more cautious and mo derate Instead of a large but definite number he speaks of many christians and most artfully selects two ambiguous words jaus and pÅ o MiKuroj which may signify either what he had seen or what he had heard either the expectation or the execution of the punilhmedt Having thus provided a secure evasion he commits the equivo cal passage to his readers and translators justly con ceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the most favourable fense There was perhaps some malice in the remark of Theodorus Metochita that all who like Eufebius had been conversant with the Egyptians delighted in an obscure and intri cate style See Valesius ad loc  182 When Palestine was divided into three the prefecture of the east contained orty
