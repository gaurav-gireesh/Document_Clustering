transactions VoIo book XV geses king of the Parthians began tov o raise new commotions in the East The hi success of Corbulo alarmed his jealousy Â e he saw with wounded pride the defeat of his brother Tiridates and in his room Tigranes an alien prince a seated on the throne of Armenia The honour of the Arsacides was tarnished by these events and he was determined to restore its former lustre But the struggle was to be with a great and powerful empire Treaties of alliance long in force and long respected by the two nations held him in suspense By nature anxious and irresolute he 6 THE ANNALS rook formed no settled plan  He was at vari XV r ance with the Hyrcanians and after a long and obstinate conflict that brave and powerful nation still made head against him While he continued wavering fresh intelligence fired him with indignation Tigranes marched his army into the terri tory of the Adiabenians a people border ing on Armenia and laid waste their coun try The enterprise did not resemble the sudden incursion of Barbarians roving in quest of prey  a regular war seemed to be declared in form The chiefs of the Adia benians saw with resentment their lands made a scene of desolation not by a Ro man army but by a foreigner a despi cable hostage who for years had lived at Rome undistinguished from the common slaves Monobazus the sovereign of the pro  vince inflamed the discontents of the people and at the same time roused the pride of Vologeses by frequent messages â importing that he knew not which way to turn nor from what quarter to expect  relief Armenia he said was lost and the OF TACITUS  â neighbouring states if not reinforced by K the Parthians niust be all involved hi the same calamity perhaps with the consent of the people as Rome it was well known made a distinction between the nations that fell by conquest and those that sub mitted at discretion Tiridates by his be haviour added force to these complaints Driven from his throne he appeared with all the silent dignity of distress or if he spoke occasionally his words were few short and sententious  Mighty king  doms he said  are not supported by  inactivity Men and arms and warlike  preparations are necessary The con  queror has always justice on his side  In a private station to defend their pro  perty is the virtue of individuals but  to invade the possessions of others is the  prerogative and the glory of kings II Roused by these incentives Volo geses summoned council and seating Tiridates next himself spoke in substance as follows  You see before you a prince descended from the same father with  myself Acknowledging the right of pri 8  THE ANNALS B Â Â K  mogeniture he ceded to me the diadem 1 of Parthia in return I placed him on  the throne of Armenia the third king  dom among the eastern nations Media  in fact is the second and Pacorus at  that time was in possession By this  arrangement I provided for my family  and by the measure extinguished for  ever those unnatural jealousies which  formerly envenomed brothers against  brothers This system it seems has  given umbrage to the Romans they de  clare against it and though they never  broke with Parthia without paying dearly  for their temerity they now are willing  to provoke a war and rush on their own destruction Thus much I am willing  to declare the possessions which have  descended to me from my ancestors  shall never be dismembered but I had rather maintain them by the justice of my cause than by the decision of the  sword I avow the principle and if in  consequence of it I have been too much  inclined to pacific measures the vigour  of my future conduct shall make atone  nient The national honour in the OF TACITUS 9  mean time has suffered no diminution BÂ K Your glory is unimpaired and I have v v  added to it the virtues of moderation Â l a a  virtues which the gods approve and 62  which no sovereign however great and  flourishing ought to despise Having thus delivered his sentiments he placed the regal diadem on the head of Tiridates and at the same time gave to Moneses an officer of distinguished rank the command of the cavalry which by established usage is always appointed to attend the person of the monarch He added the auxiliaries sent by the Adia benians and with that force ordered him to march against Tigranes in order to ex terminate the usurper from the throne of Armenia In the mean time he proposed to compromise the war with the Hyrcanians and fall with the whole weight of his king dom on the Roman provinces 111 Cqrbulo was no sooner apprised of these transactions than he dispatched to support Tigranes two legions under the command of Verulanus Severus autj Vettius 10 THE ANNALS Â Â K Bolanus In their private instructions those officers had it in command to proceed with caution and act on the defensive without pushing on their operations with too much vigour A decisive campaign was not Corbulo s plan He wished to protract the war and in the mean time stated in his letters to the emperor the necessity of ap pointing a commander with a special com mission to protect Armenia as he foresaw a storm gathering in the province of Syria If Vologeses made an irruption in that quarter a powerful army would be wanted to repel the invader With the rest of his legions he formed a chain of posts along the banks of the Euphrates and having made a powerful levy of provincial forces he secured all the passes against the in roads of the enemy In order to make sure of water in a country not well sup plied by nature he erected strong castles near the springs and fountains and where the stations were inconvenient he choaked up a number of rivulets with heaps of sand with intent to conceal their source from th Parthian army OF TACITUS 11  Corbulo was thus concert ing measures for the defence of Syria IV While Corbulo was thus concert BÂ K XV A U C Moneses advanced by rapid marches and 8i5 with all his forces entered Armenia He 62 hoped to outstrip the fame that flies before an enterprising general and to fall upon Tigranes by surprise That prince aware of the design had thrown himself into the city of Tigranocerta a place surrounded by high walls a and defended by a nu merous garrison The river Nicephorius b with a current sufficiently broad washes a considerable part of the walls A deep trench inclosed the rest There was a com petent number of soldiers to man the works and provisions had been laid in with due precaution Some of the foraging parties having rashly ventured too far were sur rounded by the enemy This check how ever instead of disheartening the garrison served only to inspire them with a spirit of revenge The operations of a siege are ill suited to the genius of the Parthians whose courage always fails in a close engagement A few arrows thrown at random made no impression on men sheltered by their forti fications The besiegers could only amuse 12 THE ANNALS book themselves with a feeble attack Ah at v o tempt was made by the Adiabenians to si carry the works by assault They ad Â â variced their scaling ladders arid other military engines but were soon repulsed and the garrison sallying out the wholes corps was cut to pieces V Corbulo was not of a temper to be elated with success He chose to act with moderation in prosperity and accordingly dispatched an embassy to expostulate with Vologeses on the violence with which he had invaded a Roman province and not only besieged the cohorts of the empire but also a king in alliance with Rome If the Parthian prince did not raise the siege he threatened to advance with the strength of his army and encamp in the heart of the country Casperius a centurion was charged with this commission He met the king in the city of Nisibis a distant about seven and thirty miles from Tigra nocerta and there delivered his orders in a tone of firmness To avoid a war with Rome had been for some time the fixed resolution of Vologeses and the success of OF TACITUS 13 the present enterprise gave him no reason BÂ X K to alter his sentiments A U C 815â A D The siege promised no kind of advant 62 age Tigranes possessed a strong hold well garrisoned and provided with ample sup plies the forces that attempted to storm the works met with a total overthrow the Roman legions were in possession of Ar menia and others were in readiness not only to cover the province of Syria but to push the war into the Parthian territories iis cavalry suffered for want of forage and all vegetation being destroyed by a swarm of locusts neither grass nor foliage could be found Determined by these considera tions yet disguising his fear Vologeses with the specious appearance of a pacific disposition returned for answer to Cas perius that he should send ambassadors to Rome with instructions to solicit the cession pf Armenia and the re establishment of peace between the two nations Mean while he sent dispatches to Mpneses with orders to abandon the siege of Tjgranocerta and without farther delay returned to his capital 14  THE ANNALS  xvK  Thjese events ascribed by the gene ral voice to the conduct of the general arid the terror impressed on the mind of Vo logeses were extolled in terms of the high est commendation And yet malignity was at work Some would have it  That  there was at the bottom a secret compact  to make an end of the war According 6 to their sinister interpretation it was sti  pulated that Vologeses should return to  his own dominions and that Armenia  should be evacuated by Tigranes With  what other view were the Roman soldiers  withdrawn from Tigranocerta  Why give  up by an ill judged peace what had  been so well defended in time of war  â Could the army find at the extremity of  Cappadocia in huts suddenly thrown up  better winter quarters than in the capital  of a kingdom which had been preserved  by force of arms  Peace is held forth  but it is in fact no more than a truce a  suspension of arms that Vologeses may  have to contend with another general  and that Corbulo should not be obliged  to hazard the great renown which he had OF TACITUS 15  acquired during a service of Â o many book  years The fact was Corbulo as we have stated required a new commander for the special purpose of defending Armenia and the nomination of Caesennius Partus was already announced That officer arrived in a short time A division of the forces was allot ted to each commander The fourth and twelfth legions with the fifth lately arrived from Msesia and a body of auxiliaries from Pbntus from G alalia and Cappadocia were put under the command of Paetus The third the sixth and tenth legions with the forces of Syria were assigned to Cor bulo Both commanders were to act in concert or to push the war in different quarters as the occasion might require But the spirit of Corbulo could not brook a rival and Paetus though to be second in command sunder such a general would have fteen his highest glory began to aspire above himself lie despised the fame ac quired by Corbulo declaring all his best exploits to be no better than boasted vic tories without bloodshed and without iQ THE ANNALS book b00ty mere pretended sieges in which i r J not a single place was carried by assault a v c  Â r  8i5 For himself he was resolved to carry on 2 the war for more substantial purposes By imposing tributes and taxes on the van quished he meant to reduce them to sub jection and for the shadow of an oriental king he would establish the rights of con quest and the authority of the Roman name  VII Ix this juncture the ambassadors who had been sent by Vologeses to treat with Nero returned back to their own country Their negotiation was unsuccess ful and the Parthians declared war Psetus embraced the opportunity to signalise his valour He entered Armenia at the head of two legions the fourth commanded by Funisulanus Vettonianus aud the twelfth by Calavius Sabinus Hishrst approach Was attended with unpropitious omens In r passing over a bridge which lay across the Euphrates the horse that carried the con sular ornaments taking fright without any apparent cause broke from the ranks and fled at full speed A victim likewise in N OF TACITUS  17 tended for sacrifice standing near the un BooK finished fortifications of the winter camp vO A O C escaped out of the entrenchments Nor sis was this all the javelins in the hands â of the soldiers emitted sudden flashes of fire and this prodigy was the more alarm ing as the Parthians brandished the same weapon VIII Portents and prodigies had no effect on Paetus Without waiting to fortify his winter encampment and without pro viding a sufficient store of grain he march ed his army over Mount Taurus determined as he gave out to recover Tigranocerta and lay waste the country through which Cor bulo had passed with vain parade In his progress some forts and castles were storm ed and it is certain that his share of glory and of booty would have been consider able if to enjoy the former with modera tion and to secure the latter had been his talent He over ran by rapid marches vast tracts of country where no conquest could he maintained His provisions in the mean time went to decay and the winter season approaching fast he was obliged to return VOL iv c 18 THE ANNALS â book with his army His dispatches to Nero w were in a style as grand as if he had ended A U C  Â 8i5 the Mar high sounding pompous full of â â â vain glory but without any solid ad vantage a IX In the mean time Corbulo never neglected the banks of the Euphrates To his former chain of posts he added new stations and lest the enemy who shewed themselves in detached parties on the op posite plains should be able to obstruct the building of a bridge over the river he ordered a number of vessels of large size to be braced together with great beams and on that foundation raised a superstructure of towers armed with slings and warlike engines From this floating battery he annoyed the enemy with a discharge of stones and javelins thrown to such a lengthy that the Parthians could not re taliate with their darts Under this shelter the bridge was finished The allied cohorts passed over to the opposite hills The legions followed and pitched their camp The whole of these operations was executed with such rapidity and so formidable a  Â f A U C OF TACITUS display of strength that the Parthian abandoned their enterprise and without attempting any thing against the Syrians si drew off their forces to the invasion of â â Armenia I XvP etus had fixed his head quarters m that country little aware of the storm ready to burst upon him and so much off his guard that he suffered the fifth legion to remain in Pontus at a considerable di stance while he still weakened his numbers by granting leave of absence to his soldiers without reserve In this situation he re ceived intelligence of the approach of Vo logeses with a powerful army V He called the twelfth legion to his assistance and by the necessity of that reinforcement betray ed to the enemy the feeble condition of his army He was notwithstanding suffici ently strong to maintain his post and baffle all the efforts of the Parthians had it been in the genius of the man to pursue with firmness either his own idea or the counsel of others But in pressing exigencies he no sooner embraced the plan recommended by officers of known experience than his c 2  â 20 THE ANNALS book little spirit was stung with jealousy and v v 0 lest he should be thought to stand in need A U C 815 of advice he was sure to adopt very dif Â 2 ferent measures always changing for the worse On the first approach of the Parthians he sallied out of his entrenchments deter mined to hazard a battle Ditches and ramparts he said were not given to him in commission nor had he any need of that defence the soldier and the sword were all he wanted In this vapouring strairi he led his legions to the field but a cen turion and a few soldiers who had been sent to reconnoitre the enemy being cut off his courage failed and he sounded a retreat He was no sooner in his camp than perceiving that Vologeses had not pressed on the rear he once more grew bold and in a fit of valour ordered three thousand of his best infantry to take post on the next eminence of Mount Taurus to dispute the pass with the Parthian king The Pannonians who formed the strength of his cavalry were drawn up on the open plain He placed his wife and her infant OF TACITUS Jl son in a castle called Arsamosata a and book left a cohort to defend the place In this wv J    i â A U C manner he contrived to divide an army Â u which acting with united force would have Â â been able to repel the attack of a wild and desultory enemy When pressed by Volo geses we are told it was with difficulty that he could submit to acquaint Corbulo with his situation That officer did not hurry to his assistance To augment the glory of delivering him he was willing to let the danger increase In the mean time he ordered a detachment of a thousand men drafted from each of his three legions and a body of eight hundred horse with an equal number from the cohorts to hold themselves in readiness for a sudden enterprise XI Vologeses knew from his scouts that his passage over Mount Taurus was obstructed by the Roman infantry and that the plain was occupied by the Pan nonian horse but the news did not deter him from pursuing his march He fell with impetuous fury on the cavalry who fled with precipitation The legionary 22 THE ANNALS book soldiers in like manner abandoned their XV r j post A tower commanded by Tarquitius 81 Crescus a centurion was the only place 62 that held out That officer made several sallies with success routing such of the enemy as dared to approach the walls and pursuing the run aways with great slaugh ter till by a volley of combustibles thrown in by the besiegers the works were set on fire The gallant centurion perished in the flames Some of the garrison escaped un hurt and made the best of their Avay to distant wilds The wounded returned to the camp and there related wonders mag nifying beyond all bounds the valour of the Parthian king the number of his troops and their ferocity in battle A panic per vaded the army Men who feared for themselyes swallowed all that was said with easy credulity Paetus felt the pressure of his misfortunes He seemed to resign the command unable to struggle with ad versity He sent again to Corbulo with earnest prayers entreating him to save the Roman eagles with the standards of an unfortunate army and the army itself from OF TACITUS Â 3 impending ruin In the mean time he and book his men would hold out to the last deter vâ â â a v c mined to live or die in the service of their w i q country Â â XII Corbulo as usual firm and col lected in the moment of danger prepared for the expedition Having left a suffici ent force to guard his posts on the banks of the Euphrates he moved forward to wards Armenia taking the shortest route through Commagena and next through Cappadocia both fertile countries and capable of furnishing supplies for his army Besides the usual train attending on a march he took with him a number of camels loaded with grain to answer the double purpose of preventing the want of provisions and of striking the enemy with the terror of an unusual appearance Pac tius a centurion of principal rank a waÂ the first from the vanquished army that encountered Corbulo on his march The common men came up soon after all en deavouring by various excuses to palliate their disgrace The general ordered them to join their colours and try to gain their 24 THE ANNALS book pardon from Paetus The merciful disposi tion of that officer might incline him to forgive but for himself he favoured none but such as conquered by their valour He then addressed his own legions visiting the ranks and inspiring all with zeal and ardour He called to mind their past ex ploits and opened to their view a new field of glory  It is not he said  the towns  and villages of Armenia that now de  mand our swords a Roman camp in  vokes our aid and two legions look to us for relief Their delivery from the Bar  barians will be the reward of victory If  to a private soldier the civic crown b  delivered by the hand of his general is  the brightest recompense for the life of a  citizen saved how much greater will be  the glory of the present enterprise in u which the number of the distressed is  equal to those who bring relief and by  consequence every soldier in this army  may save his man  By this discourse one general spirit was diffused through the ranks The men had private motives to inflame their courage they felt for their brothers they wished to succour their re OF TACITUS 25 lations and without halting night or day book XV pursued their march with alacrity and    A V C vigour sis A D 62 XIII Meanwhile Vologeses pressed on the siege He assaulted the entrench ments he endeavoured to storm a castle where the weaker sex the aged and infirm were lodged for security In these several attacks he came to a closer engagement than usually consists with the military genius of his country By a show of te merity he hoped to bring on a decisive action The Romans remained close in their tents content with a safe post within their entrenchments some in deference to the orders of their general others through want of spirit tamely waiting to be relieved by Corbulo If in the mean time the enemy overpowered them they called to mind by way of consolation the example of two Roman armies that passed under the yoke one at Caudium a and the other at Numantia By those two events submission in their present distress would be fully justified since neither the Sam jaites nor the Carthaginians those famous oQ THE ANNALS book rivals of the Roman republic could be compared with the extensive power of the Parthian empire and moreover the boasted virtue of the ancient Romans however decorated by the praises of posterity was always pliant in misfortune and willing to make terms with the conqueror By this unwarlike spirit of his army Paetus Avas driven to despair He wrote to Vologeses His letter was more in the style of reproach than the language of a suppliant  Ho  stilities he said  were commenced by  the Parthians to wrest the kingdom of f Armenia from the Romans a kingdom f always in the power of the emperor or  governed by kings invested by him with  the regal diadem Peace is equally the f interest of both nations From the present  juncture no conclusion can be drawn P since the whole weight of Parthia is em  ployed against two legions and Rome  has it still in her power to arm in her  cause the remaining nations of the  world  XIV Vologeses without entering into  the question of right returned for answer OF TACITUS qj  That he must wait for his two brothers BOOK  Pacorus and Tiridates when they ar j j  rived a convention might be held and 3Â  there the rights of Armenia would be A v adjusted The gods would then decide  the fate of the Roman legions Paetus sent another embassy requesting an inter view The king sent Vasaces his general of the cavalry to act in the royal name At that meeting Paetus cited a number of ancient precedents He talked of Lucul Jus Pompey and the emperors of Rome who had dealt out the sceptre of Armenia Vasaces coolly answered that some shadow of right must be allowed to have been claimed by the Romans but the substan tial power was always vested in the Par r thian kings After much debate it was agreed that on the next day Monobazus the Adiabenian should attend as a witness to the compact In his presence it was agreed that the siege being raised the Ro man legions should forthwith evacuate Ar  menia that the strong holds with thehyJ stores and magazines should be delivered up to the Parthians and these conditions duly performed Vologeses was to be at 25 THE ANNALS book liberty by his ambassadors to negooiate with Nero XV These preliminaries being settled Paetus ordered a bridge to be built over O the Arsanias Â a river that flowed by the side of his camp For this work his pre text was that it would be convenient to his army when the march began but the fact was the Parthians knowing the utility of a bridge had made it an article of the treaty intending at the same time that it should remain a monument of their victory The Roman troops instead of using the bridge filed off another way A report b was spread abroad that the legions had passed under the yoke and in addition to that disgrace suffered all the humiliating circumstances which usually attend the overthrow of an army The Armenians gave some colour to the report Before the Romans marched out they entered the entrenchments and formed a line on each side in order to fix on the slaves and beasts of burthen that formerly belonged to them selves Not content with seizing what they called their own property they laict OF TACITUS 29 violent hands on the apparel of the soldiers book who yielded with fear and trembling to1 avoid a new cause of quarrel 8i5 63 Volageses as a monument of his victory raised a pile of dead bodies and arms taken from the enemy but declined to be a spectator of the legions in their flight He first indulged his pride and then sought the fame of moderation He waded across the Arsanias mounted on an elephant while his train and his near relations fol lowed him on horseback The reason was a report prevailed that by the fraudulent contrivance of the builders the whole fabric of the bridge would give way at once but by those who made the expe riment it was found to be a firm and solid structure XVI The besieged it is now clear were provided with grain in such abund ance that on their departure they burned  their magazines and on the other hand â the account given by Corbulo it ap pears that the Parthians having consumed tteir whole stock of provisions were on the 50 THE ANNALS book point of raising the siege at the very time XV when he was within three days march of 5i5 the place Upon the same authority it w may be averred as a fact that Paetus under the sanction of a solemn oath sworn under the eagles and in the presence of wit nesses sent by Vologeses took upon him to engage that no Roman should set his foot within the territories of Armenia till Nero s pleasure touching the terms of the treaty should arrive from Rome These asser tions it may be said were suggested by malignity to aggravate the infamy of an tmwarlike officer but it is now known beyond the possibility of a doubt that Paetus made a forced march of no less than forty miles in one day leaving behind him the sick and wounded and flying with as much disorder and confusion as if he had been routed in the field of battle Corbulo met the fugitives on the banks of the Eu phrates He received them without pa rade and without that display of military ppmp which might seem a triumph over the fate of the vanquished His men beheld with regret the disgrace of their fellow soldiers and tears gushed from every â OF TACITUS 31 eye The usual forms of military saluta book tion were suppressed by the general condol v j encei The pride of courage and the sense 8is  Â AD of glory which in the day of prosperity 6a are natural passions were now converted into grief and sympathy The lower the condition of the soldier the more sincere his sorrow In that class of men the honest emotions of the heart appeared without disguise j â XVII The conference between the two commanders was short and without cere mony Corbulo complained that all his labours were rendered abortive whereas the war might have been terminated by the total overthrow of the Paithians Paetus observed in reply that all things were still in the same condition He proposed to turn the eagles against the enemy and since Vologeses had withdrawn his forces by their joint force Armenia would be easily reduced Corbulo rejected the offer He had no such orders from the emperor It was the danger in which the legions were involved that drew him out of his province and since it was uncertain where 32 THE ANNALS book the Pafthians would make their next ate XV v w tempt he was determined to return into A IT C sis Syria with his army and if his infantry Â a harassed out with fatiguing marches could keep pace with the Parthian cavalry who with their usual velocity could traverse the open plains he should hold himself indebt ed to his own good fortune for so signal an event Partus fixed his winter quarters in Cappadocia Vologeses sent dispatches to Corbulo requiring that the strong holds and fortresses on the banks of the Eu phrates should be rased to the ground and the river left as heretofore the common boundary of the two empires Corbulo had no objection provided both parties withdrew their garrisons and left Armenia a free and independant country The Par thian monarch after some hesitation ac ceded to the terms The castles erect ed by Corbulo s order on the banks of the Euphrates were all demolished and the Armenians were left to their natural liberty XVIII Meanwhile trophies of vic tory were erected at Rome and triumphal OF TACITUS S3 arches on the mount of the capitol This book XV was ordered by the senate while the war Â Â N j was still depending nor was the work dis eii  continued when the event was known The c public eye was amused at the expence of truth To add to the imposition and to appear free from all solicitude about fo reign affairs Nero ordered all the damaged grain that lay in the public stores to be thrown into the Tiber By this act of ostentation an idea of great abundance was to be impressed on the minds of the people Nor did he suffer the price of corn to be raised though near two hundred vessels loaded with grain were lost in the harbour by the violence of a storm and a hundred more working their way up the Tiber were destroyed by the accident of fire At the same time Nero committed the care of the public imposts to three men of consular rank namely Lucius Piso Ducennius Geminus and Pompeius Paullinus In making this arrangement he animadverted with severity on the conduct of former em perors whose extravagance made heavy anticipations of the revenue whereas he himself by his frugality paid annually into VOL IV D 34  THE ANNALS book the treasury for the exigencies of the state xv  â b iâ â i six millions ot sesterces A U C 815 A D 62 XIX A custom highly unjust and prejudicial to the rights of others was at this time in general vogue When the time drew near for the election of magi strates or the allotment of provinces it was the practice of men who had no issue a to become fathers by adoption Having served their turn in a contest with real parents for the praetorship and the ad ministration of provinces they emanci pated their pretended sons and resumed their former state Against this abuse warm remonstrances were made to the senate The complainants urged the rights of nature the care and expence of rearing children while the compensation by law established b was wrested from them by fraud by artifice and the facility of feigned adoptions It was surely a sufficient ad vantage to such as had no children that they could live free from all charge and solicitude without leaving the road to favour to preferment and honours open to them in common with men who are of OF TACITUS 35 service to the community Real parents book are taught by the laws to expect the re Â vâ Â ward due to useful members of the com sii A D munity but the laws are eluded and the 62 promised reward is snatched away if such as have raised no heirs to themselves are allowed to become parents without pater nal affection and childless again without regret The deception of a moment serves to counterbalance whole years of expecta tion and the true father sees all his hopes defeated The senate passed a decree by which it was provided that in all cases either of election to the magistracy or succession by testament no regard should be paid to adoptions merely colourable XX Claudius Timarchus a native of Crete was cited to answer a prosecution commenced against him Besides the al legations usually laid to the charge of such as rise in the provinces to overgrown wealth and become the oppressors of their inferior neighbours all expression that fell from him excited the indignation of the senate This man it seems bad made it his boast that addresses of public thanks d2 36 THE ANNALS book to the proconsular governors of Crete v depended entirely on his weight and in 8i5 fluence Paetus Thrasca seized this op 63 portunity to convert the incident to the public good He gave his opinion that the offender ought to be banished from the isle of Crete and proceeded as follows  Experience has taught us conscript fa  thers that the wisest laws and the best  examples of virtue owe their origin to the  actual commission of crimes and misde  meanours Men of integrity make it  their study on such occasions to deduce  good from evil To the corrupt prac  tices of public orators we are indebted  for the Cincian law o and for the Julian  to the intrigues and open bribery of the  candidates for public honours The Cal  purnian regulations b were produced by  the avarice and rapacity of the magi  strates Guilt must precede the punish  ment and reformation grows out of  abuse We have now before us the  pride and insolence of petty tyrants in  the provinces Â To check the mischief  let us come to a resolution consistent  with good faith and worthy of the Ro OF TACITUS 57 man name Protection is due to our book  allies but let us remember that to otnJ A C C 44 adorn our names we are not to depend on Â ii  A o  the voice of foreign nations Our fellow Â â 44 citizens are the best judges of our con  duct XXI  The old republic was not con  tent with sending jmetors and consuls to 44 administer the provinces Men who su  stained no public character were often  commissioned to visit the remotest colo  nies in order to report the condition of  each and the temper with which the  people submitted to the authority of 44 government By the judgment of indi  viduals whole nations were kept in awe  What is our practice now  We pay court  to the colonies we flatter tlie provinces  and by the influence of some powerful 44 leader we receive public thanks for our 44 administration In like manner accusa 44 tions are framed at the will and pleasure 44 of some overgrown provincial Let the 44 right of complaining still remain and by 44 exercising that right let the provinces 44 shew their importance but let them rrot â 38 THE ANNALS book by false encomiums impose upon our i v j  judgment The praise that springs from sis cabal and faction is more pernicious 62  than even malice or cruelty Let both  be suppressed More mischief is done  by the governor who wishes to oblige  than by him who shews himself not afraid  of offending It is the misfortune of  certain virtues to provoke ill will In  that class may be reckoned inflexible  severity and the firmness that never yields i to intrigue or the arts of designing men  Hence it happens that every new go  vernor opens a promising scene but the  last act seldom corresponds with the  outset In the end we see an humble  candidate for the suffrages of the pro  vince Remove the evil and government  in every quarter will be more upright â more just more uniform By prosecu  tions avarice and rapine have received a  check Abolish the custom of giving  public thanks and you suppress the piti  ful ambition which for vain applause  can stoop to mean compliances XXII This speech was received with OF TACITUS 39 the unanimous assent of the fathers The book XV proposition notwithstanding could not be formed into a decree the consuls refusing to make their report The prince inter posed in the business and with his autho rity a law was passed forbidding any per son whatever to move in a provincial as sembly a for a vote of thanks to the pro consul or pnetor or to send a deputation to Rome for that purpose During the same consulship the gymnasium or place of athletic exercises was struck with light ning and burnt to the ground The statue of Nero was found in the ruins melted down to a shapeless mass The celebrated city of Pompeii b in Campania was over thrown by an earthquake and well nigh demolished Ladia the vestal virgin de parted this life and Cornelia descended from the family of the Cossi succeeded to the vacant office XXIII During the consulship ofA u c Memmius Regulus and Verginius Rufus ad Poppaea was delivered of a daughter The exultation of Nero was be ond all mortal joy He called the new born infant Air 40 THE ANNALS book gusta and gave the same title to her mo v y Â j ther The child was brought into the world A V C  8i6 at Antiura where Nero himself was born A D ea The senate before the birth had offered vows to the gods for the safe delivery of Poppaea They fulfilled their obligations and voted additional honours Days of supplication were appointed a temple was voted to the goddess of fecundity athletic sports were instituted on the model of the religious games practised at Antium golden statues to the two goddesses of fortune a were to be erected on the throne of Ju piter Capitolinus and in honour of the Claudian and Domitian families li Cir eensian games were to be celebrated at Antium in imitation of the public specta cles exhibited at Bovillae to commemorate the Julian race But these honours were of short duration the infant died in less than four months and the monuments of human vanity faded away But new modes of flattery were soon displayed the child was canonized for a goddess a temple was decreed to her with an altar a bed of state a priest and religious cere monies OF TACITUS 41 Nero s grief like his joy at the birth was book without bounds or measure At the time when the senate went in crowds to Antium to congratulate the prince on the delivery of Poppaea a circumstance occurred worthy of notice Paetus Thrasca was ordered by Nero not to appear upon that occasion The affront was deemed a prelude to the ruin of that eminent citizen He received the mandate with his usual firmness calm and undismayed A report prevailed soon after that Nero in conversation with Se neca made it his boast that he was recon ciled to Thrasca and in return the philoso pher wished him joy In consequence of this incident the glory of those excellent men rose to the highest pitch but their danger kept pace with their glory XXIV In the beginning of the spring ambassadors from Vologeses arrived at Rome â Avith letters from the king their roaster in substance declaring  that he  would not revive the question of right  so often urged and fully discussed since  the gods the sovereign arbiters of nations  had delivered Armenia into the hands of 42 THE ANNALS XV book  the Parthians not Avithout disgrace to  the Roman name Tigranes had been  hemmed in by a close blockade Partus  and his legions Were enveloped in the  like distress and in the moment when  destruction hung over them the whole  army was suffered to decamp The Par  thians displayed at once their superior  valour and their moderation But even  in the present juncture Tiridates had no  objection to a long journey to Rome in  order to be there invested with the sove  reignty but being of the order of the  Magi the duties of the sacerdotal func  tion a required his personal attendance  He was willing however to proceed to  the Roman camp and there receive the  regal diadem under the eagles and the  images of the emperor in the presence  of the lesions  XXV The style of this letter differed essentially from the account transmitted by Paetus avIio represented the affairs of the east in a nourishing situation To ascertain the truth a centurion who had travelled with the ambassadors was inter OF TACITUS â 43 xv A U Câ rogated concerning the state of Armenia boÂ k The Romans he replied have evacuated the country Nero felt the insulting mockery sie of being asked to yield what the Barba vx rians had seized by force He summoned a council of the leading men at Rome to determine by their advice which was most eligible a difficult and laborious war or an ignominious peace All declared for war The conduct of it was committed to Cor bulo who by the experience of so many years knew both the temper of the Roman army and the genius of the enemy The misconduct of Paetus had brought disgrace on the Roman name and to hazard the same calamities from the incapacity of an other officer was not advisable The Parthian deputies received their answer but were dismissed with handsome presents leaving them room to infer from the mild behaviour of the emperor that Tiridates if he made the l equest in person might succeed to the extent of his wishes The civil administration of Syria was com mitted to Cestius but the whole military authority was assigned to Corbulo The 44 THE ANNALS book fifteenth legion then in Pannonia under the command of Marius Celsus was ordered to join the army Directions were also given to the kings and tetrarchs of the east as also to the governors and imperial procurators of the several provinces in those parts to submit in every thing to the commander in chief Corbulo was now invested with powers little short of what the Roman people committed to Pompey a in the war against the pirates Paetus in the mean time re turned to Rome not without apprehensions of being called to a severe account Nero appeased his fears content with a few sallies of mirth and ridicule His words Were  I make haste to pardon you lest a  state of suspense should injure a man of  your sensibility Since you are so apt  to take fright delay on my part might  hurt your nerves and bring on a fit of  illness XXVI Corbulo expected no advant age to the service from the fourth and twelfth legions the bravest of their men being all cut off and the survivors still re maining covered with consternation He OF TACITUS  45 removed them into Syria and in ex book change reinforced himself with the sixth legion and the third both in full vigour Ve inured to hardship and no less distinguish 63 ed by their success than by their valour To these he added the fifth legion which happened to be quartered in Pontus and by consequence had not suffered in the late defeat The fifteenth legion had lately joined the army as also a body of select troops from Illyricum and Egypt with the cavalry the cohorts and auxiliaries sent b 1 the confederate kings The whole force assembled at Melitene a where Corbulo proposed to cross the Euphrates His first care was to purify his army by a solemn lustration b Those rites perform ed he called his men to a meeting and in a spirited harangue painted forth the au spicious government of the reigning prince he mentioned his own exploits and im puted to the imbecility of Paetus all the disasters that happened The whole of his discourse wras delivered in a style of au thority the true eloquence of a soldier XXVII He began his march without 46 THE ANNALS book delay and chose the road formerly travers ed by Lucullus a having first given orders to his men to open the passes and remove the obstructions with which time and long disuse had choaked up part of the way He heard that ambassadors from Tiridates and Vologeses were advancing with over tures of peace and having no inclination to treat them with disdain he sent forward some chosen centurions with instructions neither harsh nor arrogant in substance stating  that the misunderstanding be  tween the two nations might still be com  promised without proceeding to the de  cision of the sword Both armies had  fought with alternate vicissitudes of for  tune in some instances favourable to the  Romans in others to the Parthians and  from those events both sides might derive  a lesson against the pride and insolence  of victory It was the interest of Tiri  dates to receive at the hands of the Ro  man emperor a kingdom in a flourishing  state before hostile armies laid a scene  of desolation and Vologeses would con  suit his own advantage as well as that of  his people by preferring the friendship OF TACITUS 47  of Rome to wild ambition and the havoc book XV  of a destructive war The internal dis 1  sensions that distract the kingdom of iie  Parthia are too well known It is also 63  known that Vologcses has for his subjects  fierce and barbarous nations whom no  law can check no government can con  troul Nero on the contrary sees a  settled calm throughout the Roman  world and except the rupture with  Parthia has no other war upon his  hands Such was Corbulo s answer To give it weight he added the terrors of the  sword The grandees of Armenia who had been the first to revolt were driven out of their possessions and their castles were levelled to the ground Between the weak who made no resistance and the brave and resolute no distinction was made All were involved in one common danger no place was safe hills and mountains no less than the open plain were filled with consternation XXVIII The name of Corbulo was not as is usual among adverse nations hated by the enemy He was on the contrary 48 THE ANNALS book held in high esteem and by consequence his advice had great weight with the Bar A U C 816 barians Vologeses did not wish for a gene A D  63 ral war He desired a truce in favour of some particular provinces Tiridates pro posed an interview with the Roman gene ral An early day was appointed The place for the congress was chosen by the prince on the very spot were Paetus and his legions were invested The scene of their late victory flattered the pride of the Barbarians Corbulo did not decline the meeting The face of things he knew was changed and the reverse of fortune was glorious to himself The disgrace of Paetus gave him no anxiety Having re solved to pay the last funeral rites to the slaughtered soldiers whose bodies lay weltering on the field he chose for that purpose the sou of the vanquished gene ral then a military tribune and ordered him to march at the head of the companies appointed to perform that melancholy duty On the day fixed for the conven tion a Tiberius Alexander a Roman knight Avho had been sent by Nero bo superintend the operations of the campaign OF TACITUS 49 A U C 8i6 A D and with him Vivianus Annius son in book XV law to Corbulo but not yet of senatorian age Z though in the absence of his su 8i6 perior officer he was appointed to com 63 inand the fifth legion arrived in the camp of Tiridates in the character of hostages chosen not only to remove from the mind of the prince all suspicion but at the same time to do him honour The Parthian and the Roman general proceeded to the inter view each attended by twenty horsemen As soon as they drew near Tiridates leaped from his horse Corbulo returned the com pliment They advanced on foot and took each other by the hand XXIX The Roman general addressed the prince He praised the judgment of a young man who had the moderation to prefer pacific measures to the calamities of war Tiridates expatiated on the splen dour of his illustrious line and then taking a milder tone agreed to set out on a journey to Rome In a juncture when the affairs of Parthia were in a flourishing state a prince descended from the Arsacides humbling himself before the emperor VOL IV E 50 THE ANNALS book would present to the Roman people a new unro scene of glory It was then settled as a Â i6 preliminary article that Tiridates should is lay down the regal diadem at the foot of Nero s statue and never again resume it till delivered to him by the hand of the emperor The parties embraced each other and the convention ended In a few days afterwards the two armies were drawn out with great military pomp On one side stood the Parthian cavalry ranged in battalions with all the pride of eastern magnificence The Roman legions appeared on the opposite ground the eagles glittering to the eye the banners displayed and the images of the gods in regular order forming a kind of temple In the centre stood a tribunal and upon it a currule chair supporting the statue of Nero Tiridates approached Having im molated victims with the usual rites he took the diadem from his brow and laid it at the foot of the statue The spectators gazed with earnest ardour and every bosom heaved with mixed emotions The place where the legions were besieged and forced  OF TACITUS 51 to capitulate was before the eye and the book same spot exhibited a reverse of fortune v s They saw Tiridates on the poirit of setting si6 out for Rome a spectacle to the nations 63 through which he was to pass and to ex hibit in the presence of Nero the humble condition of a suppliant prince how little better than a captive XXX To the glory resulting from these events Corbulo added the graceful qualities of affability and condescension He in vited Tiridates to a banquets The prince was struck with the novelty of Roman manners Every object awakened his curiosity He desired to know the reason of all that he observed When the watch a was stationed why was it announced by a centurion  Why did the company when the banquet closed rise from table at the sound of a trumpet And why was the fire on the augural altar lighted with a torch The Roman general answered all enquiries not without partiality for his country He aggrandized every thing and gave the Parthian the noblest idea of the manners and institutions of the ancient e 2 52 THE ANNALS book Romans On the following day Tiridates XV desired reasonable time to prepare for so long a journey and before he undertook it desired that he might be at liberty to visit his mother and his brothers His re quest was granted The prince delivered up his daughter as a hostage and dis patched letters to Nero in terms of sub mission XXXI He met his two brothers Pacorus in Media and Vologeses at Ecbatana a The Parthian king was not inattentive to the interest of Tiridates He had already sent dispatches to Corbulo requesting that his brother should not be disgraced by any circumstance that looked like a badge of slavery that he should not be obliged to surrender his sword that the honour of embracing the governors 6 of the several provinces should not be denied to him that he should not undergo the humiliating affront of waiting at their gates or in their antichambers and that at Rome he should be treated with all the marks of distinction usually paid to the consuls The truth is the Parthian king trained up in all the OF TACITUS 3 pride of despotism knew but little of the book Romans He was not informed that it is v v o AUG the character and policy of that people to sii maintain with zeal the substantial interests Â â of the empire without any regard to petty formalities the mere shadow of dominion XXXII In the course of the year Nero granted the rights and privileges of Latium to the maritime nations a at the foot of the Alps He likewise assigned to the Roman knights distinct seats in the circus advancing them before the space allotted to the populace Till this regulation took place the knights were mixed indiscri minately with the multitude the Roscian law b extending to no more than fourteen rows of the theatre A spectacle of gladi ators was exhibited this year in nothing inferior to the magnificence displayed on former occasions but a number of sena tors and women of illustrious rank de scended into the arena c and by exhibit ing their persons in the lists brought dis grace on themselves and their families XXXIII In the consulship of Caius A c A D 64 54 THE ANNALS book Laecanius and Marcus Licinius Nero s XV u vo passion for theatrical fame broke out with 8i7 a degree of vehemence not to be resisted A D  64 He had hitherto performed in private only during the sports of the Roman youth called the juvenalia but upon those occasions he was confined to his own palace or his gardens a sphere too limited for such bright ambition and so fine a voice He glowed with impatience to pre sent himself before the public eye but had not yet the courage to make his first appearance at Rome Naples was deemed a Greek city and for that reason a proper place to begin his career of glory With the laurels which he was there to acquire he might pass over into Greece and after gaining by victory in song the glorious crown which antiquity considered as a sacred prize he might return to Rome with his honours blooming round him and by his celebrity inflame the curiosity of the populace With this idea he pursued his plan The theatre at Naples was crowded with spectators Not only the inhabitants of the city but a prodigious multitude from all the municipal towns and colonies OF TACITUS 55 in the neighbourhood nocked together b oo k XV attracted by the novelty of a spectacle so very extraordinary All who followed the 8i7 prince to pay their court or as persons Â â belonging to his train attended on the oc casion The menial servants and even the common soldiers were admitted to enjoy the pleasures of the day XXXIV The theatre of course was crowded An accident happened which men in general considered as an evil omen with the emperor it passed for a certain sign of the favour and protection of the gods As soon as the audience dispersed the theatre tumbled to pieces No other mischief followed Nero seized the op portunity to compose hymns of gratitude He sung them himself celebrating with melodious airs his happy escape from the ruin Being noAv determined to cross the Adriatic he stopt at Beneventum At that place Vatinius entertained him with a shew of gladiators Of all the detestable characters that disgraced the court of Nero this man was the most pernicious He was bred up in a shoe maker s stall 56 THE ANNALS xv book Deformed in his person he possessed a vein of ribaldry and vulgar humour which qualified him to succeed as buffoon In the character of a jester he recommended himself to notice but soon forsook his scurrility for the trade of an informer and having by the ruin of the worthiest citizens arrived at eminence in guilt he rose to wealth and power the most dangerous miscreant of that evil period XXXV Nero was a constant spectator of the sports exhibited at Beneventum but even amidst his diversions his heart knew no pause from cruelty He com pelled Torquatus Silanus to put an end to his life for no other reason than because he united to the splendor of the Junian family the honour of being great grandson to Augustus a The prosecutors suborned for the business alleged against him that having prodigally wasted his fortune in gifts and largesses he had no resource left but war and civil commotion With that design he retained about his person men of rank and distinction employed in various offices he had his secretaries his treasurers OF TACITUS 57 and paymasters all in the style of imperial book Al dignity even then anticipating what his ambition aimed at This charge being in made in form such of his freedmen as were  known to be in the confidence of their master were seized and loaded with fetters Silanus saw that his doom was impending and to prevent the sentence of condemna tion opened the veins of both his arms Nero according to his custom expressed himself in terms of lenity  The guilt of  Silanus he said  was manifest and  though by an act of despair he shewed  that his crimes admitted no defence his  life would have been spared had he  thought proper to trust to the clemency  of his judge XXXVI In a short time after Nero for reasons not sufficiently explained resolved to defer his expedition into Greece He returned to Rome cherishing in imagina tion a new design to visit the eastern na tions and Egypt in particular This pro ject had been for some time settled in his mind He announced it by a proclama tion in which he assured the people that 58 THE ANNALS book his absence would be of short duration XV vvv and in the interval the peace and good an order of the commonwealth would be in 64 no kind of danger For the success of his voyage he went to offer up prayers in the capitol He proceeded thence to the temple of Vesta Being there seized with a sudden tremor in every joint arising either from a superstitious fear of the god dess or from a troubled conscience which never ceased to goad and persecute him he renounced his enterprise altogether artfully pretending that the love of his country which he felt warm at his heart was dearer to him than all other consider ations  I have seen he said â the de  jected looks of the people I have heard  the murmurs of complaint the idea of  so long a voyage afflicts the citizens and  indeed how should it be otherwise when  the shortest excursion I could make was  always sure to depress their spirits  The sight of their prince has at all times  been their comfort and their best sup  port In private families the pledges of  natural affection can soften the resolu r  tions of a father and mould him to their OF TACITUS 59  purpose the people of Rome have the book  same ascendant over the mind of their v v Â A C C  sovereign I feel their influence I vield Â â 3 A D  to their wishes M ith these and such 6 like expressions he amused the multitude Their love of public spectacles made them eager for his presence and above all they dreaded if he left the capitol a dearth of provisions The senate and the leading men looked on with indifference unable to decide which was most to be dreaded his presence in the city or his tyranny at a distance They agreed at length as in alarming cases fear is always in haste to conclude that what happened was the worst evil that could befall them XXXVII Nero wished it to be bo lieved that Rome was the place in which he most delighted To diffuse this opinion he established convivial meetings in all the squares and public places a The whole city seemed to be his house Of the vari ous feasts given upon this occasion that which was prepared for the prince by Ti gellinus exceeded in profusion and luxury every thing of the kind I shall here give ft THE ANNALS book a description of this celebrated entertain XV r v o merit that the reader from one example 8 i may form his idea of the prodigality of the 64 times and that history may not be en cumbered with a repetition of the same enormities Tigellinus gave his banquet on the lake of Agrippa b on a platform of prodigious size c built for the reception of the guests To move this magnificent edifice to and fro on the water he prepared a number of boats superbly decorated with gold and ivory The rowers were a band of Pathics Each had his station according to his age or his skill in the science of debauchery The country round was ransacked for game and animals of the chase Fish was brought from every sea and even from the ocean b On the borders of the lake brothels were erected and filled with wo men of illustrious rank On the opposite bank was seen a band of harlots who made no secret of their vices or their persons In wanton dance and lascivious attitudes they displayed their naked charms When night came on a sudden illumination from OF TACITUS 61 the adjacent groves and buildings blazed bo ok XV over the lake A concert of music vocal A U C and instrumental enlivened the scene in A D Nero rioted in all kinds of lascivious plea 64 sure Between lawful and unlawful gra tifications he made no distinction Cor ruption seemed to be at a stand if at the end of a few days he had not devised a new abomination to fill the measure of his crimes He personated a woman and in that character was given in marriage to one of his infamous herd a Pathic named Py thagoras d The emperor of Rome with the affected airs of female delicacy put on the nuptial veil The augurs assisted at the ceremony  the portion of the bride was openly paid e the genial bed was dis played to view nuptial torches were light ed up the whole was public not even ex cepting the endearments which in a natural marriage decency reserves for the shades of night XXXVIII A dreadful calamity fol lowed in a short time after by some as cribed to chance and by others a to the execrable wickedness of Nero The au 62 fHE ANNALS book thority of historians is on both sides and which preponderates it is not easy to de 1 termine It is however certain that of all the disasters that ever befel the city of Rome from the rage of fire this was the worst the most violent and destructive The flame broke out in that part of the circus which adjoins on one side to mount Palatine and on the other to mount Cae lius It caught a number of shops stored with combustible goods and gathering force from the winds spread with rapidity from one end of the circus to the other Neither the thick walls of houses nor the inclosure of temples nor any other build ing could check the rapid progress of the flames A dreadful conflagration follow ed The level parts of the city were de stroyed The fire communicated to the higher buildings and again laying hold of inferior places spread with a degree of velocity that nothing could resist The form of the streets long and narrow with frequent windings and no regular opening according to the plan of ancient Rome b contributed to increase the mischief The shrieks and lamentations of women the OF TACITUS Â 3 infirmities of age and the weakness of the book young and tender added misery to the dreadful scene Some endeavoured to pro vide for themselves others to save their friends in one part dragging along the lame and impotent in another waiting to receive the tardy or expecting relief themselves they hurried they lingered they obstructed one another they looked behind and the fire broke out in front they escaped from the flames and in their place of refuge found no safety 4he fire raged in every quarter all were involved in one general conflagration The unhappy wretches fled to places remote and thought themselves secure but soon perceived the flames raging round them Which way to turn what to avoid or what to seek no one could tell They crowded the streets they fell prostrate on the ground they lay stretched in the fields in consternation and dismay resigned to their fate Numbers lost their whole sub stance even the tools and implements by which they gained their livelihood and in that distress did not wish to survive Others 64  THE ANNALS book wild with affliction for their friends and xv relations whom they could not save em braced a voluntary death and perished in the flames During the whole of this dis mal scene no man dared to attempt any thing that might check the violence of the dreadful calamity A crew of incendiaries stood near at hand denouncing vengeance on all who offered to interfere Some were so abandoned as to heap fuel on the flames They threw in firebrands and flaming torches proclaiming aloud that they had authority for what they did Whether in fact they had received such horrible or ders or under that device meant to plun der with greater licentiousness cannot now be known XXXIX During the whole of this terrible conflagration Nero remained at Antium without a thought of returning to the city till the fire approached the build ing by which he had communicated the gardens of Maecenas a with the imperial palace All help however was too late The palace the contiguous edifices and every house adjoining were laid in ruins OF TACITUS 65 To relieve the unhappy people wandering BÂ Â K in distress without a place of shelter he 0 1 A U C opened the field of Mars as also the mag â nificent buildings raised by Agrippa 6 64 and even his own imperial gardens c He ordered a number of sheds to be thrown up with all possible dispatch for the use of the populace Household utensils and all kinds of necessary implements were brought from Ostia and other cities in the neighbourhood The price of grain was reduced to three sesterces For acts like these munificent and well timed Nero might hope for a return of popular favour but his expectations were in vain no man was touched with gratitude A report prevailed d that while the city was in a blaze Nero went to his own theatre and there mounting the stage sung the de struction of Troy as a happy allusion to the present misfortune XL On the sixth day the fire was sub dued at the foot of mount Esquiline This was effected by demolishing a number of buildings and thereby leaving a void space where for want of materials the flame ex vol iv F 66 THE ANNALS book pifed The minds of men had scarce be XV o rogun to recover from their consternation an when the fire broke out a second time with AD  6 no less fury than before This happened however in a more open quarter where fewer lives were lost but the temples of the gods the porticos and buildings raised for the decoration of the city were levelled to the ground The popular odium was now more inflamed than ever as this se cond alarm began in the house of Tigel linus formerly the mansion of iEmilius A suspicion prevailed that to build a new  city and give it his own name was the ambition of Nero Of the fourteen quar ters into which Rome was divided four only were left entire three were reduced to ashes and the remaining seven pre sented nothing better than a heap of shat tered houses half in ruins XLI The number of houses temples and insulated mansions destroyed by the fire cannot be ascertained But the most venerable monuments of antiquity which the worship of ages had rendered sacred were laid in ruins amongst these were the OF TACITUS 67 temple dedicated to the moon by ServiussooK  J XV Tullius the fane and the great altar con J A U C secrated by Evander the Arcadian to Her sii   A D cules his visitor and his guest a the w chapel of Jupiter Stator b built by Romulus the palace of Numa and the temple of Vesta c with the tutelar gods of Rome With these were consumed the trophies of so many victories the inimitable works of the Grecian artists with the pre cious monuments of literature and ancient genius all at present remembered by men advanced in years but irrecoverably lost Not even the splendour with which the new city rose out of the ruins of the old could compensate for that lamented dis aster It did not escape observation that the fire broke out on the fourteenth before the calends of July d a day remarkable for the conflagration kindled by the Se nones when those Barbarians took the city of Rome by storm and burnt it to the ground Men of reflection who refined on every thing with minute curiosity calcu lated the number of years months and days from the foundation of Rome to the firing of it by the Gauls and from that f2 THE ANNALS book calamity to the present they found the in terval of time precisely the same A U C 817 A D  XLII Nero did not blush to convert to his own use the public ruins of his country He built a magnificent palace a in which  the objects that excited admiration were neither gold nor precious stones Those decorations long since introduced by lux ury were grown stale and hackneyed to the eye A different species of magnifi cence was now consulted expansive lakes and fields of vast extent were intermixed with pleasing variety woods and forests stretched to an immeasurable length pre senting gloom and solitude amidst scenes of open space where the eye wandered with surprize over an unbounded prospect This prodigious plan was carried on under the direction of two surveyors whose names were Severus and Celer Bold and origi nal in their projects these men undertook to conquer nature and to perform wonders even beyond the imagination and the riches of the prince They promised to form a navigable canal from the lake Avernus b Â to the mouth of the Tiber The expert OF TACITUS 69 ment like the genius of the men was bold book and grand but it was to be carried over a XV 1 c 1 11 1  A U C long tract or barren land and in some w places through opposing mountains The 6 country round was parched and dry witta out one humid spot except the Pomptinian marsh c from which water could be ex pected A scheme so vast could not be accomplished without immoderate labour and if practicable the end was in no pro portion to the expence and labour But the prodigious and almost impossible had charms for the enterprising spirit of Nero He began to hew a passage through the hills that surround the lake A vermis and some traces of his deluded hopes are visible at this day â 1 XLIII The ground which after mark ing out his own domain Nero left to the public was not laid out for the new city in a hurry and without judgment as was the case after the irruption of the Gauls A regular plan was formed the streets were made wide and long the elevation a of the houses was defined with an open area before the doors and porticos b to secure 70 THE ANNALS book and adorn the front The expence of the XV u v o porticos Nero undertook to defray out of 817  his own revenue He promised besides 64 as soon as the work was finished to clear the ground and leave a clear space to every house without any charge to the occupier In order to excite a spirit of industry and emulation he held forth rewards propor tioned to the rank of each individual pro vided the buildings were finished in a limited time The rubbish by his order was removed to the marshes of Ostia and the ships that brought corn up the river were to return loaded with the refuse of the workmen Add to all this the several houses built on a new principle were to be raised to a certain elevation without beams or wood work on arches of stone from the quarries of c Alba or Gabii those ma terials being impervious and of a nature to resist the force of fire The springs of wa ter which had been before that time inter cepted by individuals for their separate use were no longer suffered to be diverted From their channel but left to the care of commissioners that the public might be properly supplied and in case of fire have OF TACITUS 71 a reservoir at hand to stop the progress of book the mischief u v j a u c 817 It was also settled that the houses should e no longer be contiguous with slight party walls to divide them d but every house was to stand detached surrounded and in sulated by its own inclosure These regu lations it must be admitted were of public utility and added much to the embellish ment of the new city But still the old plan of Rome was not without its advo cates It was thought more conducive to the health e of the inhabitants The nar rowness of the streets and the elevation of the buildings served to exclude the rays of the sun whereas the more open space having neither shade nor shelter left men exposed to the intense heat of the day XLIV These several regulations were no doubt the best that human wisdom could suggest The next care was to pro pitiate the gods The Sibylline books were consulted and the consequence was that supplications were decreed to Vulcan to Ceres and Proserpine A band of ma 72 THE ANNALS book trons offered their prayers and sacrifices to Juno first in the capitol and next on the nearest margin of the sea where they sup plied themselves with water to sprinkle the temple and the statue of the goddess A select number of women who had hus bands actually living laid the deities on their sacred beds a and kept midnight vigils with the usual solemnity But neither these religious ceremonies nor the liberal donations of the prince could ef face from the minds of men the prevailing opinion that Rome was set on fire by his own orders The infamy of that horrible transaction still adhered to him In order if possible to remove the imputation he determined to transfer the guilt to others For this purpose he punished with exqui site torture a race of men detested for their evil practices b by vulgar appellation commonly called Christians The name was derived from Christ who in the reign of Tiberius suffered under Pon tius Pilate the procurator of Judaea By that event the sect of which he was the founder received a blow which for a time OF TACITUS 73 checked the growth of a dangerous super book stition c but it revived soon after and t v o spread with recruited vigour not only in aiV Judaea the soil that gave it birth but even 64 in the city of Rome the common sink into which every thing infamous and abominable flows like a torrent from all quarters of the world Nero proceeded with his usual ar tifice He found a set of profligate and abandoned wretches avIio were induced to confess themselves guilty and on the evi dence of such men a number of Christians were convicted not indeed upon clear evidence of their having set the city on fire but rather on account of their sullen hatred of the whole human race d They were put to death with exquisite cruelty and to their sufferings Nero added mockery and derision Some were covered with the skins of wild beasts and left to be devoured by dogs others were nailed to the cross numbers were burnt alive and many co  vered over with inflammable matter were lighted up when the day declined to serve as torches during the night e For the convenience of seeing this tragic 74 THE ANNALS book spectacle the emperor lent his own gai t v o dens He added the sports of the circus en and assisted in person sometimes driving a w curricle and occasionally mixing with the rabble in his coachman s dress At length the cruelty of these proceedings filled every breast with compassion Humanity re lented in favour of the Christians The manners of that people were no doubt of a pernicious tendency and their crimes called for the hand of justice but it was evident that they fell a sacrifice not for the public good but to glut the rage and cruelty of one man only x XLV Meanwhile to supply the un bounded prodigality of the prince all Italy was ravaged the provinces were plunder ed  and the allies of Rome with the several places that enjoyed the title of free cities were put under contribution The very gods were taxed Their temples in the city were rifled of their treasures and heaps of massy gold which through a series of ages the virtue of the Roman people either re turning thanks for victories or performing their vows made in the hour of distress had OF TACITUS 75 dedicated to religious uses were now pror book duced to answer the dernands of riot and u r j extravagance Jn Greece and Asia ra Asn C A D parity was not content with seizing the  votive offerings that adorned the temples but even the very statues of the gods were deemed lawful prey To carry this im pious robbery into execution Acratus and Secundus Carinas were sent with a special commission the former one of Nero s freedmen of a genius ready for any black design the latter a man of literature with the Greek philosophy fluent in his mouth and not one virtue at his heart It was a report current at the time that Seneca wishing to throw from himself all responsi bility for these impious acts desired leave to retire to some part of Italy Not being able to succeed in his request he feigned a nervous disorder and never stirred out of his room If credit be due to some writers a dose of poison was prepared for him by Cleonicus one of his freedmen by the in stigation of Nero The philosopher how ever warned by the same servant whose courage failed him or perhaps shielded from danger by his own wary disposition JQ THE ANNALS book escaped the snare He lived at that very XV time on the most simple diet wild apples sVr1 that grew in the woods were his food and A u c A D Â 4 water from the clear purling stream served to quench his thirst XLVI About the same time a body of gladiators detained in custody at Prae neste a made an attempt to recover their liberty The military guard was called out and the tumult died away The in cident notwithstanding revived the me mory of Spartacus b The calamities that followed the daring enterprise of that adventurer became the general topic and filled the minds of all with dreadful ap prehensions Such is the genius of the populace ever prone to sudden innova tions yet terrified at the approach of danger In a few days after advice was received that the fleet had suffered by a violent storm This was not an event of war for there never was a period of such profound tranquillity but Nero had order ed the ships on a stated day to assemble on the coast of Campania The dangers of the sea never entered into his considera OF TACITUS 77 tion His orders were peremptory The book XV pilots to mark their zeal set sail in tern A U C pestuous weather from the port of Formia c 8i7  While they were endeavouring to double c the cape of Misenum a squall of wind from the south threw them on the coast of Cuma where a number of the larger gallies and almost all the smaller vessels were dashed to pieces 1 XLVII Towards the close of the year omens and prodigies filled the minds of the people with apprehensions of impending mischief Such dreadful peals of thunder were never known A comet appeared and that phenomenon was a certain prelude to some bloody act to be committed by Nero Monstrous births such as men and beasts with double heads were seen in the streets and public ways and in the midst of sa crifices which required victims big with young the like conceptions fell from the entrails of animals slain at the altar In the territory of Placentia a a calf was dropped with its head growing at the ex treme part of the leg The construction of the soothsayers was that another head 78 THE ANNALS o o k was preparing For the government of the XV world but would prove weak insufficient A U C 8i7 and be soon detected like the monstrous A D   m  productions which did not rest concealed in the womb but came before their time and lay exposed to public view near the high road A c XLVIII Silius Nerva and Atticus O JO AD 65 Vestinus entered on their consulship In that juncture a deep conspiracy was formed and carried on with such a spirit of enter prise that in the moment of its birth it was almost ripe for execution Senators Ro man knights military men and even women gave in their names with emulation all incited by their zeal for Caius Piso and their detestation of Nero Piso was de scended from the house of Calpurnius by his paternal line related to the first families in Rome His virtues or his amiable qualities that resembled virtues made him the idol of the people An orator of high distinction he employed his eloquence in the defence of his fellow citizens possessed of great wealth he was generous to his friends by nature courteous he was affable OF TACITUS 7Â and polite to all To these accomplish b o o k ments he united a graceful figure and an engaging countenance In his moral con 8iÂ duct neither strict nor regular he led a Â life of voluptuous ease fond of pomp and  splendour and at times free and luxurious in his pleasures His irregularities served to grace his character At a time when vice had charms for all orders of men it  was not expected that the sovereign should lead a life of austerity and self denial XLIX The conspiracy did not origin ate from the ambition of Piso Among so many bold and generous spirits it is not easy to name the person who first set the whole in motion Subrius Flavius a tri bune of the praetorian guards and Sulpicius Asper were the active leaders The firmness with which they afterwards met their fate sufficiently marks their characters Annaeus Lucan the celebrated poet and Plautius Lateranus consul elect entered into the plot with ardour and inflamed resentment Lucan had personal provocations Nero was an enemy to his rising fame not being able to vie with that eminent genius he 80  THE ANNALS book ordered him not to make his verses public XV  i j determined to silence what he vainly strove sis to emulate Lateranus brought with him 65 no private animosity he acted on nobler principles the love of his country inspired him and he knew no other motive Flavius Scevinus and Afranius Quinctianus both of senatorian rank stood forward to guide the enterprise with a degree of spirit little expected from the tenour of their lives Scevinus addicted to his pleasures passed his days in luxury sloth and languor Quinctianus was decried for the effeminacy of his manners Nero had lampooned him in a copy of defamatory verses and to re venge the injury Quinctianus became a patriot L The conspirators had frequent meet ings They inveighed against the vices of Nero they painted forth in glaring colours all his atrocious deeds by which the em pire was brought to the brink of ruin they urged the necessity of choosing a successor equal to the task of restoring a distressed and tottering state and in the interval enlisted in their confederacy several Ro OF TACITUS 81 man knights namely Tullius Senecio Cer book varius Proculus Vulcatius Araricus Julius Tugurinus Munatius Gratus Antonius sis    a o Natalis and Martius Festus Senecio the â first in the list had lived in the closest in timacy with the prince and being still obliged to wear the mask he found the interval big with anxiety mistrust and danger Antonius Natalis was the bosom friend land confidential agent of Piso the rest had their separate views and in a re volution hoped to find their private ad vantage There were besides Subrius Flavius and Sulpicius Asper already men tioned a number of military men ready to draw their swords in the cause In this class were Granius Silvanus and Statius Proximus both tribunes of the praetorian bands Maximus Scaiirus and Venefus Paullus two centurions But the main strength and pillar of the party was Fenius Rums1 a commander in chief of the Prae torian guards a man of principle and for the integrity of his conduct esteemed and Honoured by the people But Tigellinus1 Stood in higher favour with the prince and by his cruel devices no less than by his vol iv o 82 THE ANNALS book taste for riot and debauchery so ingratiat u vO ed himself that he was able to supplant sis  the praetorian praefect and by secret accu â 5 sations to endanger his life He represent ed him to Nero as the favoured lover of Agrippina b still cherishing a regard for her memory and lying in wait for an op portunity to revenge her wrongs Rufus inclined to the discontented party and at length declared himself willing to assist their enterprise Encouraged by this accession of strength the conspirators began to think of the decisive blow and to deliberate about the time and place We are told that Subrius Flavius resolved to take to himself the glory of the deed Two different schemes occurred to him One was while the prince was singing on the stage to dispatch him in sight of the whole theatre His second project was while Nero was rambling abroad in his midnight frolics to set fire to the palace and in the tumult to take him by sur prise unattended by his guards The last seemed to be the safest measure The tyrant unseen and unassisted would fall a  i OF TACITUS 83 r devoted victim and die in solitude On book XV the other hand the idea of a brave exploit v v j performed in the presence of applauding sis 0 numbers fired the generous ardour of that Â heroic mind But prudential considera tions had too much weight He wished to gain immortal fame and he thought of his own personal safety a tame reflection always adverse to every great and noble enterprise LI While the conspirators lingered in suspense prolonging the awful period of their hopes and fears a woman of the name of Epicharis apprised of the plot by what means is still a mystery began to animate their drooping spirit and to blame their cold delay What made her conduct sin gular on this occasion was that before this time not one great or honourable sentK â ment was ever known to have entered her heart Seeing the business languish she retired in disgust and went into Campania But a spirit like hers could not be at rest She endeavoured to seduce the officers of the fleet then lying at Misenum She be gan her approaches to Volusius Proculus g 2 84 THE ANNALS book an officer who had under his command a XV i thousand marines He was one of the as sis sassins employed in the tragic catastrophe 65 of Nero s mother His reward he thought was in no proportion to the magnitude of the crime Being known to Epicharis or having then contracted a recent friendship he began to disclose the secrets of his heart He enumerated his exploits in Nero s serv ice and complained of the ingratitude with which he was ill requited avowing at the same time a fixed resolution to revenge himself whenever an opportunity offered The woman from this discourse conceived hopes of gaining a proselyte and by his means a number of others She saw that a revolt in the fleet would be of the greatest moment Nero was fond of sailing parties on the coast of Misenum and Puteoli and would by consequence put himself in the power of the mariners Epicharis entered into close conference with Proculus she recapitulated the va rious acts of cruelty committed by Nero The fathers she said had no doubt re maining they were of one mind all OF TACITUS 85 agreed that a tyrant who overturned the book laws and constitution of his country oughtÂ â v Â to fall a sacrifice to an injured people sis She added that Proculus would do well to Â â co operate with the friends of liberty If he kindled the same spirit in the minds of the soldiers a sure reward would wait him In the fervour of her zeal she had the prud ence to conceal the names of the conspira tors That precaution served to screen her afterwards when the marine officer turned informer and betrayed the whole to Nero She was cited to answer and confronted with her accuser but the charge resting entirely on the evidence of one man without a circumstance to sup port it was easily eluded Epicharis not withstanding was detained in custody Nero s suspicions were not to be removed The accusation was destitute of proof but he was not the less inclined to believe the worst LII The undaunted firmness of Epi charis did not quiet the apprehensions of the conspirators Dreading a discovery they determined to execute their purpose 86 THE ANNALS book without delay The place they fixed upon vâ v was a villa belonsrino to Piso in the neigh a u c sis bourhood of Baiee where the emperor at Â â tracted by the beauties of that delightful spot was used to enjoy the pleasure of bathing and his convivial parties divested of his guards and unincumbered by the parade of state Piso objected to the measure  What would the world say if  his table were imbrued with blood and  the gods of hospitality violated by the  murder of a prince however detested for  his atrocious deeds  Rome was the proper  theatre for such a catastrophe The  scene should be in his own palace that  haughty mansion built with the spoils of  plundered citizens The blow for liberty  would be still more noble before an as  sembly of the people The actions of  men who dared nobly for the public  should be seen by the public eye Such were the objections advanced by Piso in the presence of the conspirators in his heart he had other reasons He dreaded Lucius Silanus a knowing his high de  scent and the rare accomplishments which OF TACITUS 87 he had acquired under the care of CaiussooK Cassius b who had trained him from his v i  A U C youth and formed his mind to every thing m great and honourable A man thus dis Â tinguished might aspire to the imperial dig nity All who stood aloof from the con spiracy would be ready to second his am bition and most probably would be join ed by others whom the fate of a devoted prince cut off by treachery might touch with compassion Piso was supposed to have another secret motive he knew the genius and the ardent spirit of Vestinus the consul A man of his character might think of restoring the old republic or be for choosing another emperor to shew mankind that the sovereign power was a gift to be disposed of according to his will and pleasure Vestinus in fact had no share in the conspiracy though he was afterwards charged as an accomplice and under that pretence doomed to death by the unappeasable malice and the cruelty of Nero LIII At length the conspirators fixed their day They chose the time of the 88 THE ANNALS pook public games which were soon to be per 1 formed in the circus according to esablish A U C sis ed usage in honour of Ceres During that 5 festival the emperor who rarely shewed himself to the people but remained se questered in his palace or his gardens would not fail to attend his favourite di versions and in that scene of gaiety access to his person would not be difficult Th e assault was to be made in the follow ing manner Lateranus a man of un daunted resolution and an athletic form was to approach the prince with an humble air of supplication as if to entreat relief for himself and family and in the act of fall ing at his feet to overthrow him by some sudden exertion and by his weight keep him stretched on the ground In that con dition the tribunes the centurions and the rest of the conspirators as the opportunity offered and as courage prompted were to fall on and sacrifice their victim to the just resentments of the people Scevinus claimed the honour of being the first to strike For this purpose he had taken a dagger from the temple of OF TACITUg 89 Health in Etmria or as some writers will book have it from the temple of Fortune in Y the city of Ferentum This instrument he sis  A Â earned constantly about him as a sacred Â 5 weapon dedicated to the cause of liberty It was further settled that during the tumult Piso was to take his post in the temple of Ceres and there remain till such time as Fenius and his confederates should call him forth and conduct him to the camp To conciliate the favour of the people Antonia the daughter of the late emperor was to appear in the cavalcade This last circumstance since it is related by Pliny must rest upon his authority If it came from a less respectable quarter I should not think myself at liberty to sup press it but it may be proper to ask Is it probable that Antonia woidd hazard her reputation and even her life in a project so uncertain and so big with danger  Is is probable that Piso distinguished by his conjugal affection could agree at once to abandon a wife whom he loved and marry another to gratify his own wild ambition  But it may be said of all the passions that inflame the human mind ambition is the gO THE ANNALS XV book most fierce and ardent of power to ex tinguish every other sentiment LIV In a conspiracy like the present so widely diffused among persons of differ ent ages rank sex and condition some of them poor and others rich it may well be matter of wonder that nothing transpired till the discovery burst out at once from the house of Scevinus This active partisan on the day preceding the intended execu tion of the plot had a long conference with Antonius Natalis after which he returned home and having sealed his will unsheath ed his sacred dagger already mentioned Finding it blunted by long disuse he gave it to Milichus his freedman to be well whetted and sharpened at the point In the mean time he went to his meal more sumptuously served than had been his custom To his favourite slaves he granted their freedom and among the rest distri buted sums of money He affected an air of gaiety he talked of indifferent things with counterfeited cheerfulness but a cloud hung over him and too plainly shewed that some grand design was la OF TACITUS 91 homing in his breast He desired the same book   XV Milichus to prepare bandages for the brae A U C ing of wounds and applications to stop si s the effusion of blood If this man was Â before that time apprised of the plot he had till then acted with integrity but the more probable opinion is that he was never trusted and now from all the cir â cumstances drew his own conclusion The reward of treachery no sooner pre sented itself to the servile mind of an en franchised slave than he saw wealth and power inviting him to betray his master The temptation was bright and dazzling every principle gave way the life of his patron was set at nought and for the gift of freedom no sense of gratitude remained He advised with his wife and female ad vice was the worst he could take The woman with all the art and malice of her sex alarmed his fears Other slaves she said and other freedmen had an eye on all that passed The silence of one could be of no use The whole would be brought to light and he who first made the dis covery would be entitled to the reward THE ANNALS XV book LV At the daivn of day Milichus made the best of his way to the gardens of Ser vilius Being refused admittance he de clared that he had business of the first im portance nothing less than the discovery of a dark and dangerous conspiracy The porter conducted him to Epaphroditus one of Nero s freedmen who introduced him to the presence of his master Milichus informed the emperor of his danger and laid open the machinations of his enemies with all that he knew and all that he con jectured He produced the dagger de stined to give the mortal stab and desired to be confronted with the criminal Scevinus was seized by the soldiers and dragged in custody to answer the charge  The dagger he said  was a sacred  relic left to him by his ancestors He  had preserved it with veneration and  kept it safe in his chamber till the  perfidy of a slave surreptitiously convey  ed it away As to his will he had often  changed it often signed and sealed a new  one without any distinction of days  He had been always generous to his do OF TACITUS 93  mestics nor was it now for the first time book XV  that he had given freedom to some and  to others liberal donations If in the last sis  instance his bounty exceeded the former 65  measure the reason was that being re  duced in his circumstances and pressed  by his debts he was afraid that his will  would be declared void in favour of his  creditors With regard to his table it  was well known that his style of living  had ever been elegant and even profuse  to a degree that drew upon him the cen  sure of rigid moralists To the prepara  tion of bandages and styptics he was an  utter stranger None were made by his  order The whole was the invention of a  vile informer who found himself desti  tute of proof and to prop his infamous  calumny dared to fabricate a new charge  at once the author and the witness of a  lie This defence was uttered by Sce vinus in a tone of firmness and the intre pidity of his manner gave it strength and credit He pronounced the informer a notorious profligate and by consequence an incompetent witness This he urged w4th such an air of confidence and with so Q4 THE ANNALS book much energy that the information would have fallen to the ground if the wife of Milichus had not observed in the presence of her husband that a long and secret in terview had taken place between the pri soner and Natalis both connected in the closest friendship with Caius Piso LVI Natalis was cited to appear Scevinus and he were examined apart touching their late meeting What was their business  and what was the convers ation that passed between them Their answers did not agree Fresh suspicions arose and both were loaded with irons At the sight of the rack their resolution failed Natalis was the first to confess the guilt He knew all the particulars of the conspiracy and was by consequence able to support his information He named Caius Piso and proceeded next to Seneca He had probably been employed as a messenger between Seneca and Piso or knowing the inveterate rancour with which Nero sought the destruction of his tutor he intended by that charge however false to make terms for himself Scevinus as OF TACITUS 95 soon as he heard that Natalis had made a book â â xv discovery saw the inutility of remaining u v o silent Thinking the whole conspiracy si s  detected he yielded to his fears and Â following a mean example of pusillanimity discovered his accomplices Three of the number namely Lucan Quinctianus and Senecio persisted for some time to deny the whole with undaunted firmness till in duced at length by a promise of pardon they thought they could not do enough to atone for their obstinacy Lucan did not scruple to impeach a his own mother whose name was Acilia Quinctianus gave information against Glicius Gallus his dearest friend and Senecio in like manner betrayed Annius Pollio LVII Nero did not forget that Epi charis was still detained in custody on the evidence of Volusius Proculus The weak ness of a female frame he imagined would not be able to endure the pangs of the rack He therefore ordered her to be put to the most exquisite torture But neither stripes nor fire nor the brutal rage of the executioners who were determined not to qQ THE ANNALS book be baffled by a woman could subdue a XV v 0 mind like hers firm constant and un A U C sis daunted to the last Not a word was ex A D Â torted from her Her misery ended for that day On the next the same cruelty was prepared Epicharis had no strength left Her limbs were rent and dislocated The executioners provided a chair to con vey her to the place of torture While they were conducting her she took from her breast the girdle that braced her garment and having fastened one end of it to the top of the chair made a noose for he neck and throwing herself from her seat hung suspended with the whole weight of her body In her mangled condition the remains of life were soon extinguished Such was the fate of this magnanimous woman She left behind her a glorious ex ample of truth and constancy the more striking as this generous part was acted by an enfranchised slave to save the lives of men in no degree related to her and almost unknown With heroic fortitude she endured the worst that malice could inflict at a time when men of illustrious OF TACITUS 97 birth when officers Roman knights and book senators untried by the pangs of torture ro betrayed with a kind of emulation their sis friends their relations and all that was es dear to them Quinctianus Senecio and even Lucan continued to give in the names of the conspirators Every new discovery filled Nero with consternation though he had doubled his guard and taken every precaution to secure his person LVIIL Parties of soldiers under arms were stationed in every quarter on the walls of Rome on the sea coast and along the banks of the Tiber The city presented the appearance of a garrisoned town The forum and the open squares were filled with cohorts of horse and foot The neigh bouring villages and the country round were invested Even private houses were secured The German soldiers ordered out on duty mixed with the rest of the army Being foreigners Nero depended on their fidelity The conspirators were led forth in a long procession to the tri bunal of the prince They stood in crowds at his garden gate waiting their turn to be VOL IV H Â 8 THE ANNALS XV b 09 k summoned before him In regular suc cession they were admitted to an audience and every trifle was magnified into a crime A smile a look a whisper a casual meet ing at a convivial party or a public show was evidence of treason Nor was it suf ficient that Nero and Tigellinus were keen and vehement in their enquiries Fenius Rufus took an active part Having hitherto escaped detection he thought that violence against his accomplices would be the best way to skreen himself While he was eagerly pressing them with questions Sub rius Flavius the praetorian tribune by signs and tokens signified to him his intention to cut off the tyrant in the midst of the examination He had his hand on the hilt of his sword when Rufus checked the brave design LIX On the first detection of the plot while Milichus was giving his evidence and Scevinus was still wavering and irre solute some of the conspirators exhorted Piso to shew himself in the camp or to mount the public rostra in order to gain the affections of the army and the people OF TACITUS 99  Let your friends they said  assemble book  in a body let them stand forth in your1 A U C cause and they will be joined by num sis   bers The fame of an impending revo  lution would excite a general spirit and  fame in great undertakings has been often  known to decide the event Nero will  be taken by surprise on his part no  measures are concerted In sudden  commotions the bravest are often struck  with terror and if courage may be thus  overpowered what will be the case of a  theatrical emperor a scenic performer a  vile comedian assisted by Tigellinus and  his band of harlots  In all great enter  prises the attempt appears impracticable  to little minds but the brave and valiant  know that to dare is to conquer In a  plot in which numbers were embarked  the silence of all could not be expected  The mind will waver and the body will  shrink from pain There is no secret so  deeply laid but bribery will draw it forth  or cruelty can extort it The guards in  a short time might seize Piso himself  and drag him to an ignominious death  How much more glorious to fall bravely A D 65 11 2 103 THE ANNALS book finish by the sword Natalis was the only vâ vâ person who had mentioned his name The 8i8 chief head of his accusation Was That A D Â  he himself had been sent on a visit to  Seneca then confined by illness with in  structions to mention to him that Piso  often called at his house but never could  gain admittance though it was the in  terest of both to live on terms of mutual  friendship To this Seneca made an swer  That private interviews could be of  no service to either but still his happi  ness was grafted on the safety of Piso Granius Silvanus a tribune of the praeto rian guards Avas dispatched to Seneca with directions to let him know what was alleged against him and to enquire whether he ad mitted the conversation stated by Natalis with the answers given by himself Seneca by design or accident was that very day on his return from Campania He stopt at a villa of his own a about four miles from Rome Towards the close of day the tribune arrived and beset the house with a band of soldiers Seneca was at supper with his wife Pompeia Paulina and two OF TACITUS 103 of his friends when Silvanus entered the book XV room and reported the orders of thev v o a u c emperor sis x A D 65 LXI Seneca did not hesitate tp ac knowledge that Natalis had been at his house with a complaint that Piso s visits were not received His apology he said imported no more than want of health the love of ease and the necessity of attending to a weak and crazy constitution  That  he should prefer the interest of a private  citizen to his own safety was too absurd  to be believed He had no motives to  induce him to pay such a compliment  to any man adulation was no part of his  character This is a truth well known  to Nero himself he can tell you that on  various occasions he found in Seneca a  man who spoke his mind with freedom  and disdained the arts of servile flattery Silvanus returned to Rome He found the prince in company with Poppaea and Ti gellinus who as often as cruelty was in agitation formed the cabinet council In their presence the messenger reported his answer Nero asked  Does Seneca pre 104 THE ANNALS b o o k  pare to end his days by a voluntary death   He shewed said the tribune  no symp  torn of fear no token of sorrow no deject  ed passion his words and looks bespoke  a mind serene erect and firm  Return said Nero  and tell him he must resolve  to die Silvanus according to the ac count of Fabius Rusticus chose to go back by a different road He went through a private way to Fenius Rufus to advise with that officer whether he should execute the emperor s orders Rufus told him that he must obey Such was the degenerate spirit of the times A general panic took pos session of every mind This very Silvanus was one of the conspirators and yet was base enough to be an instrument of the cruelty which he had combined to revenge He had however the decency to avoid the shock of seeing Seneca and of deliver ing in person the fatal message He sent a centurion to perform that office for him LXII Seneca heard the message with calm composure He called for his will and being deprived of that right of a Ro man citizen by the centurion he turned to OF TACITUS 103 his friends and  You see he said  that book XV  I am not at liberty to requite your ser Â v  vices with the last marks of my esteem sis  One thing however still remains I leave cs  you the example of my life the best and  most precious legacy now in my power  Cherish it in your memory and you will  gain at once the applause due to virtue  and the fame of a sincere and generous  friendship All who were present melted into tears He endeavoured to assuage their sorrows he offered his advice with mild persuasion he used the tone of au thority  Where he said  are the pre  cepts of philosophy and where the words  of wisdom which for years have taught  us to meet the calamities of life with  firmness and a well prepared spirit  Was  the cruelty of Nero unknown to any of  us  He murdered his mother he destroy  ed his brother and after those deeds of  horror what remains to fill the measure  of his guilt but the death of his guardian  and his tutor LXIII Having delivered himself in 106 THE ANNALS book these pathetic terms he directed his atten XV tion to his wife He clasped her in his A J C sis  arms and in that fond embrace yielded for  A D 65 a while to the tenderness of his nature Re covering his resolution he entreated her to appease her grief and bear in mind that his life was spent in a constant course of honour and of virtue â That consideration would serve to heal affliction and sweeten all her sorrows Paulina Avas still incon solable She was determined to die with her husband she invoked the aid of the ex ecutioners and begged to end her wretched being Seneca saw that she was animated by the love of glory and that generous principle he thought ought not to be re strained The idea of leaving a beloved object exposed to the insults of the world and the malice of her enemies pierced him to the quick  It has been my care he said  to instruct you in that best philo  sophy the art of mitigating the ills of  life but you prefer an honourable death  I will not envy you the vast renown that  must attend your fall Since you will  have it so we will die together We will OF TACITUS 107  leave behind us an example of equal BÂ Â a it constancy but the glory will be all your  A U C own sis a a These words were no sooner uttered than the veins of both their arms were opened At Seneca s time of life the blood was slow and languid The decay of nature and the impoverishing diet a to which he had used himself left him in a feeble condition He ordered the vessels1 of his legs and joints to be punct red After that operation he began to labour with excruciating pains liest his sufferings should overpower the constancy of his wife or the sight of her afflictions prove too much for his own sensibility he persuaded her to retire into another room His eloquence still con tinued to flow with its usual purity He called for his secretaries and dictated while life was ebbing away that farewell discourse

exhausted he requested his friend Statius Annaeus whose fidelity and medical skill he had often experienced to administer a draught of that swift speeding poison a usually given at Athens to the criminals adjudged to death He swallowed the potion but without any immediate effect His limbs were chilled the vessels of his body were closed and the ingredients though keen and subtle could not arrest the principles of life He desired to be placed in a warm bath Being conveyed according to his desire he sprinkled his slaves with the water and  Thus he said  I MAKE LIBATION TO JuPITER THE  deliverer The vapour soon over powered him and he breathed his last His body without any funeral pomp was com mitted to the flames He had given di rections for that purpose in his last will made at a time when he was in the zenith of power and even then looked forward to the close of his days HO THE ANNALS book LXV A report was at that time cur XV rent at Rome that Subrius Flavius and sis  several centurions held a private meeting Â 5 with the knowledge and consent of Seneca and there resolved to open a new and un expected scene The blow for liberty was to be struck in the name of Piso and as soon as the world was freed from the tyranny of Nero Piso was to be the next victim in order to make way for Seneca who for his virtues was to be raised to the highest elevation with an air of inno cence and of a man unconscious of the plot The very words of Flavius were re ported among the people He is supposed to have said  What good end will it an  swer to depose a minstrel if we place u a tragedian in his room The fact was Nero played on his guitar and Piso trod the stage in the buskin of tragedy LXVI The part which the military men had taken in the conspiracy did not long remain a secret The double game played by Fenius Rums at first a confederate in the plot and then a judge pronouncing sentence on his accomplices provoked the OF TACITUS in indignation of all In the examination of book    YV Scevinus that officer pressed his interroga  tories with over acted zeal and by menaces sis endeavoured to extort a confession See 65 vinus answered with a smile  No man

length a soldier of the name of Cassius remarkable for his robust stature and for that reason ordered to attend laid hold of Rufus by the emperor s order and loaded him with irons LXVII The same witnesses gave evid ence against Subrius Flavius In answer to the charge he relied much on his course of life and the dissimilitude of manners between himself and his accusers  Was â it probable that a soldier inured to the 112 THE ANNALS  xv A U C 818 A D profession of arms would associate with an effeminate set of men strangers to sis  danger and to manly enterprise I Find er ing himself pressed by the weight of evid ence he changed his tone and with heroic fortitude avowed the part he had acted Being asked by Nero what could induce him to forget the solemn obligation of his oath   Because he said  I hated I  detested you There was a time when no  soldier in your army was more devoted  to your service and that was as long as  you deserved the esteem of mankind I  began to hate you when you was guilty  of parricide when you murdered your  mother and destroyed your wife when you became a coachman a comedian  and an incendiary  I have given the very words of this intrepid conspirator be cause they were not like those of Seneca published to the world and the rough sentiments of a soldier in his own plain but vigorous language merit the attention of posterity In the whole discovery of the plot no thing made so deep an impression on the OF TACITUS 123 mind of Nero Though his heart never Â ook knew remorse for the worst of crimes his tsj ear unaccustomed to the voice of truth A8i8 tv

Strike said Flavius  and prove your  courage equal to mine The tribune was seized with a tremor in every joint He severed the head at two blows and made a merit of it with Nero giving the name of

rest of the centurions under 8i8 went their fate and all died worthy of A P  65 their characters Fenius Rufus had not equal constancy He betrayed an abject spirit and even in his will was weak enough to bewail his unhappy fate Nero lived in hopes of seeing Vestinus the consul charged as a criminal He knew the cha racter of the man an intrepid dating spirit ambitious and suspected of disaffection The conspirators however had no com munication of counsels with that active magistrate Some declined him on account of former animosities and others because tkey thought him rash and impetuous Njer o s rancour grew out of a close and Ultimate friendship In that familiar inter course Vestinus saw into the very heart of the prince and despised him for his vices Nero shrunk from a man who had the spirit to speak his mind with freedom and in fois sarcastic vein had often made the prince the subject of his raillery and raillery when seasoned with truth never fails to leave a sting that festers in the memory A recent incident gave an edge OF TACITUS 115 to Nero s resentment Vestinus married boor XV Statilia Messalina a though he knew that the prince was one of her lovers sis LXIX No witness appeared against Vestinus no crime was laid to his charge and by consequence no proceeding could be had in due form of law But the will of the tyrant still remained He sent Gerelanus one of the tribunes at the head of a cohort with orders so to take his mea sures that the consul might not be able to stand on the defensive and for that pur pose to invest his house which like a proud citadel overlooked the forum and contained a numerous train of young and hardy slaves in the nature of a garrison Vestinus had that very day discharged all the functions of his consular office He was at table with his friends free from ap prehension or it may be affecting an air of gaiety when the soldiers entered and informed him that the tribune had import ant business with him He rose and left the room The scene of death was instantly laid He was shut up in a chamber a physician attended Ins veins were opened  i 2 11 5 THE ANNALS book he was conducted to a warm bath and XV A U C 818 being put into the water expired without sis 0 a complaint and without a groan His Â guests in the mean time remained in the banqueting room imprisoned by the guards It was late at night before they were releas ed Nero heard the account with pleasure He saw in the sport of his imagination a set of men assembled at a convivial party and every moment expecting their final doom He laughed at their distress and said facetiously  They have paid for their con  sular supper LXX Lucan the famous poet was the next sacrifice to the vengeance of Nero His blood flowed freely from him and being soon well nigh exhausted he perceived that the vital heat had left the extremities of his limbs His hands and feet were chilled but the warmth retiring to his heart he still retained his senses and the vigour of his mind The lines in his poem which describe a soldier dying in the same condition a occurred to his memory He repeated the passage and expired His own verses were the last OF TACITUS liy words he uttered Senecio Quinctianus book and Scevinus suffered in a short time after v v o The dissolute softness of their lives did not 6is disgrace them in their end They met their â fate with resolution The rest of the con spirators were led to execution In their deaths there was nothing that merits par ticular notice â  LXXL While the city presented a scene of blood and funerals darkened all the

sentiment of the heart all concurred in offering thanks to the gods they adorned the prince s house with laurel a they fell at the ty rant s feet they clasped his knees and printed kisses on his hand Nero received this vile adulation as the token of real joy In order to make sure of the people he shewed his clemency to Antonius Natalis and Cervarius Proculus whose merit con sisted altogether in their treachery to their friends To Milichus he granted a rich and H8 THE ANNALS book ample recompense and moreover added the honourable appellation of a Greek name importing the conservator Gra nius Silvanus one of the tribunes engaged in the conspiracy received a free pardon but disdaining to enjoy it he died by his own hand Statius Proxinius had the vanity to follow his example Pompeius Corne

the hand of power Her conduct both in affluence and poverty did honour to her character Rufius Crispinus was likewise banished OF TACITUS Up the conspiracy furnished a pretext but his scr sx having been married to Poppaea was the crime that brought on his ruin Ver ginius  and Musonius Rufus c owed their banishment to the celebrity of their names the former trained the Roman youth to eloquence and the latter formed their minds by his lectures on wisdom and philosophy At one sweep Chividienus Quietus Julius Agrippa Blitius Catulinus Petronius Priscus and Julius Altinus like a colony of criminals were sent to islands in the iEgean sea Cadicia the wife of Scevinus and Ctesonius Maximus were ordered out of Italy without being heard in their defence The sentence of eon demnation was the first notice of any crime alleged against them Acilia the mother of Lucan was neither pardoned nor eon demned She was suffered to live in silent obscurity  i   LXXII Having performed these dreadful exploits Nero called an assembly of the soldiers and after a specious harangue ordered a largess of a thousand sesterces to he paid to eaeh man and the 120 THE ANNALS book corn which they had been used to pur chase at the market price to be distributed as the bounty of the prince He then ordered the senate to be convened with as much importance as if the events of war and splendid victories occasioned the meet ing He granted triumphal ornaments to Petronius Turpilianus a of consular rank to Cocceius Nerva b proctor elect and Tigellinus commander of the praetorian guards The two last were mentioned by him in strains of the highest commendation Not content Avith erecting their statues in the forum adorned with triumphal decora tions he placed them also in the imperial palace Nymphidius c was honoured with the ensigns of consular dignity Of this man who now occurs for the first time since he is to figure hereafter on the stage of public business it may be proper m this place to say a few words i He was the son of an enfranchised female stave distinguished by her beauty and the ease with which she granted her favours to the slaves as well as the freedmen about the court Nymphidius however pre OF TACITUS 121 tended to be of higher origin He called Boot himself the son of Caligula His large v vO stature and the stern cast of his countcn tlf a nce bore some resemblance to that em  peror and in fact as Caligula was never delicate in the choice of his mistresses but was known to share the embraces of com mon harlots it is possible that he might on some occasion indulge his passion with the mother of Nymphidius LXXIII The senate being assembled Nero delivered a speech on the subject of the late transactions and for the informa tion of the people issued a proclamation with a statement of the evidence against the conspirators and their own confession The clamours of the public made this ex pedient necessary While the executions were going on the public voice was loud and violent against Nero the insatiate tyrant who was daily sacrificing to his cruelty or his fears the lives of innocent and illustrious men That a plot was actually formed that it was conducted with resolution and in the end was totally defeated no man who made it his business I2f THE ANNALS book to investigate the truth entertained a doubt XV  urvOat the time and since the death of Nero 8ii  the acknowledgment of all who returned Â from banishment established the fact be yond a controversy Nero was received by the senate with the basest flattery In that assembly the men who had the great est reason to be overwhelmed with grief were the most forward to offer incense to the emperor Junius Gallio a the brother of Seneca was by the loss of that excel lent man so struck with terror that to save his own life he descended to humble sup plications Salienus Clemens rose to op pose him as a parricide and an enemy to the state He continued his invective till the fathers checked his violence It was not now they said a time to gratify per sonal animosity under an appearance of zeal for the public good nor would it be come any man to open again the wounds which the clemency of the prince had closed for ever LXXIV Oblations and public thanks givings were decreed to all the gods and particularly to the Sun in whose temple OF TACITUS 123 situated ia the forum the murder was to boor have been perpetrated if that god had not Â y Â i dispelled the clouds that hung over the ma sis chinations of evil minded men and brought â their dark proceedings into open day light It was further ordered that the sports of the circus in honour of Ceres should be celebrated with an additional number of chariot races that the month of April a should be styled after the name of Nero and that on the spot where Scevinus fur nished himself with a dagger a temple should be erected to the goddess of safety The dagger itself was dedicated in the capitol with an inscription to the avenging god called Jupiter Vinde The inscription at that time had no equivocal meaning but soon after when Julius Vindex b excited a revolt in Gaul it was considered as an omen of im pending vengeance In the journals of the senate I find an entry by which it appears that Cerealis Anicius consul elect moved in his place that a temple should be raised at the public expence to the deified Nero who in 124 THE ANNALS OF TACITUS book his opinion had risen above the condi tion of human nature and was therefore entitled to religious worship This motion was afterwards understood to portend no thing less than

sis of public derision He believed the vision m  ary schemes of Cesellius Bassus a native of Carthage of a crazed imagination who relied on whatever occurred to him in his distempered dreams This man arrived at Rome and by the influence of money well applied gained admission to the pre sence of the emperor The secret which he had to communicate was that on his own estate he had found a cavern of asto nishing depth in which were contained immense stores of gold not wrought into vol IV K JL30 THE ANNALS XVI book the form of coin but in rude and shapeless Â ingots such as were in use in the early ages of the world In one part of the cave were to be seen vast massy heaps and in other places columns of gold towering to a prodigious height the whole an immense treasure reserved in obscurity to add to the splendour of Nero s reign To give probability to his story he pretended that Dido the Phaenician a when she fled from Tyre and founded the city of Car thage deposited her whole stock in the bowels of the earth that so much wealth might neither prove the bane of a new colony nor excite the avarice of the Nu midian princes b of themselves already hostile to her infant state II Nero neither weighed the character of the man nor the circumstances of so wild a report He had not even the pre caution to send commissioners to inform themselves on the spot He helped to spread the report he began to count his riches and dispatched his agents to trans port the treasure to Rome The light galleys were equipped with expedition OF TACITUS 131 and a chosen band of mariners sent on book XVI board Rome in the mean time was dis tracted with hope and fear with doubt and expectation No other subject was talked of The common people with their usual facility believed every thing while men of reflection argued in a different manner It happened that the quinquen nial games a were to close the second lustre of five years During that festival the expected treasure was the subject on which the orators expatiated and the poets ex hausted their invention In their flights of fancy the earth was no longer content with pouring forth fruit and grain and pro ducing metals intermixed with veins of precious ore the present fecundity shewed that the gods were working miracles to bless the reign of Nero These were the bright conceits which flattery displayed with rapture and eloquence adorned with her richest colouring While the passions of Nero stood ready to receive every new device fiction passed for truth and nothing was too hyperbolical for the credulity of the prince k 2 32  The annals III With such immoderate riches in view no wonder that Nero launched out into greater profusion than ever Deluded by his hopes and sure of a supply for years to come he exhausted his treasury a and began to anticipate his imaginary funds He made assignments on the property and granted with generosity what was not in his possession The expectation of enormous wealth made him the bubble of a madman and impoverished the public In the mean time Bassus the grand projector arrived at Carthage In the presence of a number of soldiers and a large body of peasants employed as labourers he dug up his grounds and made his experiment in the adjacent fields disappointed in one place sure of success in another still con fident and still miscarrying till at length finding no subterraneous cave and weary of the fruitless search he abandoned his chimerical hopes coming gradually to his senses yet wondering that of all his dreams the last should be the only one that deceived him Covered with shame and dreading the resentment of the em peror he delivered himself from all his OF TACITUS 133 troubles by a voluntary death Accord book Xvi A U C 8i8 mg to some writers he was instantly seized and

contending for the prizes in the quinquennial games being near at hand the senate with intent to ward off from the emperor a the disgrace of being a candidate offered to adjudge in his favour the victory in song and the crown of eloquence The fathers hoped that honours freely granted would satisfy the prince and prevent a ridiculous dis play of theatrical talents Nero returned for answer that he stood in no need of favour or protection He depended on himself alone and would fairly enter the lists with his competitors The equity of the judges was to decide and by that test he was willing to stand or fall With that spirit he entered the scene and recited a poem of his own composition The peo ple with earnest entreaty prayed that he 134 THE ANNALS book would let them taste the supreme delight o of hearing and enjoying all his divine ac 8i8 complishments Such was the language 65 of the populace In compliance with their wishes he mounted the public stage con forming in all things to the rules of the orchestra where no performer was to sit down nor to wipe the sweat from his face with any thing but his own garment and never to spit or clear his nostrils in sight of the audience Having exhibited his skill he went down on his knee and stretching forth his hands with pretended agitations of hope and fear waited in that humble posture for the decision of the judges The populace accustomed to applaud the notes and gesticulations of the common players paid their tribute of admiration  to the prince with measured cadence in one regular chorus of applause You would have thought their joy sincere and per haps it was so in fact the rabble wished to be diverted at any rate and for the dis grace that befel the state vulgar minds felt no concern V Thinking men were affected in OF TACITUa 135 a very different manner All who came book from the municipal towns or the more re uÂ y w  t  â   a u c mote parts of Italy where some tincture sis of ancient manners still remained and a  considerable number besides who arrived from the provinces on public business or their own private affairs as 3Tet strangers to vice and undebauched by luxury be held the scene with heaviness of heart A spectacle in which the prince exposed his frivolous talents gave them the highest disgust They thought the applause dis honest but they were obliged to concur with the rest They acted their part with warm but aukward zeal Their unprac  tised hands were easily tired they were not able to keep time in the grand concert and exerting themselves without skill they disturbed the general harmony For every blunder they were chastised by the sol diers who were stationed at their posts with orders to take care that the applause should be kept up with spirit without an interval of rest or silence It is a certain fact that several Roman knights endea vouring to make their way through the crowd were crushed to death in the nar 136 THE ANNALS book row passes a and that others who kept u o their seats in the theatre day and night fell A U C 8i8  dangerously ill The dread of being ab 65 sent from such a performance was more i alarming than the worst sickness that could happen Besides the soldiers stationed in the theatre to superintend the audience it is well known that a number of spies lay in ambush to take down the names of the spectators to watch their countenances and note every symptom of disgust or pleasure Offenders of mean condition were punished on the spot Men of dis tinction were overlooked with an air of calm neglect but resentment was only smothered for a time to break out after wards with deadly hate We are told that Vespasian for the crime of being ready to fall asleep was obliged to endure the in sulting language of one Phoebus an im perial freedman and was saved from harsher treatment by the intercession of men of rank and influence The offence however was not entirely forgotten it re mained in store for future vengeance but Vespasian was reserved by his superior destiny for the highest elevation OF TACITUS â  137 VI The public games were followed book XVI by the death of Popprea a She died of  a kick on her womb which Nero gave her sis A D in a sudden passion though she was then 6s advanced in her pregnancy Some writers will have it that she was carried off by a dose of poison but they assert it with more spleen than truth Nero was desir ous of having issue and he loved his wife with sincere affection Her body was not according to the Roman custom b com mitted to the funeral pile but after the manner of the eastern kings embalmed with precious spices c and deposited in the monument of the Julian family The ceremony was performed with great pomp and Nero pronounced the funeral oration He Avas lavish in praise of her beaut and the peculiar happiness of being the mother of an infant d enrolled among the gods was a topic on which he dwelt with plea sure By enlarging on that and other ac cidental circumstances he made a pane gyric in which not one virtue could find a place VII The death of Poppsea occasioned 158 THE ANNALS book a general face of mourning but no real vâ v w grief Men remembered her loose incon 8i8 tinence and having felt her cruelty re ef jbiced in secret at an event that freed the world from a woman of a detested cha racter Nero laboured under a load of reproach and the public resentment rose still higher when it was known that by his orders Cassius did not attend the funeral That illustrious Roman under stood the imperial mandate as the signal of his approaching ruin In fact his doom was fixed in a short time after and Silanus Avas devoted with him The crime of Cas sius a was the splendid fortune which he inherited from his ancestors and the au sterity of his manners Silanus offended by the nobility of his birth and his mo dest merit Nero sent a letter to the senate stating in strong terms the neces sity of removing them both from all civil offices To Cassius he objected that among the images of his ancestors he pre served with veneration the picture of the famous Caius Cassius with this inscription THE LEADER OF THE PARTY That CUV cumstance plainly shewed the sullen spirit OF TACITUS 139 of a man brooding mischief a fierce re book  XVI publican who meditated another civil war wv and a revolt from the house of Caesar But sis A D to revive the name of a daring factious 65 chief was not sufficient for the purposes of a turbulent incendiary he was charged with seducing Lucius Silanus a youth de scended from an illustrious line bold am bitious enterprising and in the hands of ill designing men a fit tool to spread the flame of rebellion VIII Silanus a was no less an ob ject of Nero s hatred It was urged against him as had been formerly done in the case of his uncle Torquatus that he affected the style of imperial dignity and had in his household train his mock treasurers his auditors of accounts and his secretaries of state Nothing could be more destitute of all foundation Silanus saw the tyranny of those disastrous times and from the fate of his uncle received a lesson of prudence Lepida b the wife of Cassius and aunt of â Silanus was also doomed to fall a sacrifice to the unrelenting fury of the prince In formers were suborned to accuse her of in 140 THE ANNALS book cest with her nephew and to swell the xvi  r  charge they imputed to her impious sacri fices magic rites and horrible incanta tions Vulcatius Tullinus and Marcellus Cornelius c of senatorian rank with Cal purnius Fabatus a Roman knight were in volved in the prosecution They appealed to the tribunal of the emperor and by re moving the cause prevented a final sen tence Nero was at that time brooding over crimes of the deepest dye and having nobler game in view he disdained to stoop to an inferior quarry The three last were saved by their want of importance IX C a s s i u s and Silanus were banished by a decree of the senate The case of Lepida was referred to the prince Cas slus in a short time after was transported to the island of Sardinia where Nero was content to leave him to old age and the decay of nature Silanus was conveyed to Ostia there as Was pretended to

dignity to undeserved mis fortune till a centurion employed to com mit the murder rushed upon him abruptly That officer advised him to open his veins  Death said Silanus  has been familiar  to my thoughts but the honour of pre  scribing to me I shall not allow to a ruf  fian and a murderer The centurion seeing that he had to do with a man un armed indeed but robust and vigorous not a symptom of fear in his countenance but on the contrary an eye that sparkled with indignation gave orders to his soldiers to seize their prisoner Silanus stood on the defensive  what man could do without a weapon he bravely dared struggling and dealing his blows about him till he fell by the sword of the centurion like a gal lant officer receiving honourable wounds and facing his enemy to the last X Lucius Vetus and Sextia his mother in law with Pollutia his daughter died with equal fortitude Nero thought them a living reproach to himself for the murder of Rubellius Plautus a the son 142 THE ANNALS book in law of Lucius Vetus The root of bit XVI  terness rankled in Nero s heart till Fortu A U C sis natus one of the manumitted slaves of Â Vetus gave him an opportunity to wreak his vengeance on the whole family The freedinan had been employed by Vetus in the management of his affairs and having defrauded his master he thought it time to add treachery to peculation and give evidence against his patron In this black design he associated with himself one Clau dius Demianus a fellow of an abandoned character who had been charged in Asia while Vetus was proconsul of the province with various crimes and sent to Rome in fetters To forward the prosecution Nero set him at liberty Vetus heard with indignation that the evidence of a freedman was received against the life of his patron and retired to his country seat in the neighbourhood of Formia A band of soldiers followed him and beset his house His daughter was then with him A sense of former injuries was still fresh in her mind She had seen her husband Rubellius Plautus massacred OF TACITUS 143 by a band of ruffians Upon that occa Booic sion she opposed her person to the assas  sins stroke she clung to her

the palace gates and as soon as he came forth she cried aloud  Hear my father hear an innocent man  he was your colleague b in the consul  ship extend your mercy nor let him fall  a sacrifice to the pernicious arts of a  vile abandoned slave She persisted as often as Nero passed to renew her appli cation sometimes in tears and misery of heart often in a tone of vehemence roused by her sufferings

part of his fortune for his grand children would be by making the emperor heir in chief lie rejected that advice as unworthy of his character Having lived his days with a spirit of inde pendance he

author of this innovation His reason for the last was because the two Torquati c suffered in the month of June and that in auspicious name ought therefore to be abolished from the calendar XIII To the blood and horror that made this year for ever memorable we may add the vengeance of Heaven declared in storms and tempests and epidemic disor ders A violent hurricane made the coun try of Campania a scene of desolation whole villages were overthrown planta tions were torn up by the roots and the hopes of the year destroyed The fury of the storm was felt in the neighbourhood of Rome where without any apparent OF TACITUS 14 cause in the atmosphere a contagious book distemper broke out and swept away a vw vast number of the inhabitants The sis  A D houses were filled with dead bodies and Â Â the streets with funeral processions Nei ther sex nor age escaped Slaves and men of ingenuous birth were carried off without distinction amidst the shrieks and lament ations of their wives and children Num bers while they assisted their expiring friends or bewailed their loss were sud denly seized and burnt on the same funeral pile The Roman knights and se nators suffered the common lot of morta lity but death delivered them from the power of the tyrant and for that reason they were not regretted In the course of the year new levies were made in Narbon Gaul and likewise in Asia and Africa in order to recruit the le gions in Illyricum at that time much re duced by the discharge of such as by age or infirmity were rendered unfit for service The city of Lyons having before this time suffered a dreadful disaster a Nero to relieve the inhabitants ordered a remit 12 148 THE ANNALS book tance of forty thousand sesterces being the amount of what that city granted b to the a u c sis  treasury of Rome in a period of detraction A D Â 5 and public distress A u c XIV Caius Suetonius and Lucius 8i9 a d Telesinus entered on the consulship Dur ing their administration Antistius Sosi anus formerly banished Â as has been mentioned for a satirical poem against Nero began to think of regaining his li berty He heard of the high estimation in which informers were held at Rome and the bias of Nero s nature to acts of cruelty A bold and restless spirit like his was ready for any project and he possessed a promp titude of mind that quickly saw how to seize his opportunity There was at that time an exile in the same place famous for his skill in the arts of Chaldean astro logy and on that account intimate with several families His name was Pammenes Antistius entered into a league of friend ship with him Their mutual sufferings en deared them to each other The astrologer had frequent consultations and messengers were every day crowding to his house OF TACITUS 149 Antistius judged that such a concourse book could not be without reasons of important consequence lie found that Pammenes received an annual pension from Anteius a man on account of his attachment to Agrippina obnoxious to the emperor and by his riches likely to tempt the avarice of a prince who had already cut off some of the most opulent and illustrious men in Rome Antistius kept a watchful eye upon his new friend He intercepted letters from Anteius and gained access to other secret papers in which was contained a calcula tion of the nativity of Anteius with many particulars relating to the birth and future fortune of Ostorius Scapula 6 Armed Avith these materials he represented by letters to Nero that he had discoveries of the first importance involving even the safety of the prince and if he might revisit Rome for a few days the whole should be brought to light with all the machinations of Anteius and Ostorius Scapula who beyond all doubt were engaged in a trea sonable design and had been prying into 150 THE ANNALS XVI jboio k their own destiny and that of the imperial 1 house In consequence of these letters a light galley was dispatched and Antistius was conveyed to Kome His arrival and the busmess on which he came were no sooner known than Anteius and Ostorius were considered as devoted victims inso much that the former could not find a friend bold enough to be a witness to his will c till Tigeliinus advised him to settle his affairs without loss of time Anteius swallowed a dose of poison but finding the operation slow and tedious he opened his veins and put a period to his existence XV Ostorius at this time was at a distance from Rome amusing himself on his own estate near the confines of Liguria A centurion was sent with orders to dis patch him Nero had his reasons for de siring this business to be done with expe dition He knew the military character of Ostorius and the high reputation with which he had gained the civic crown in Britain a He dreaded a man renowned in arms remarkable for his bodily vigour and a thorough master of the art of war OF TACITUS 151 From a general of his experience he lived book a r XVI in fear of a sudden attack and the late â â A U C conspiracy kept him in a constant alarm 8i9 The centurion obeyed his orders and hav 66 ing first secured all the avenues round the house communicated the emperors orders Ostorius turned against himself that courage which had often made the enemy fly before him He opened his veins but though the incision was large the blood flowed with languor He called a slave to his assistance and having directed him to hold a poniard with a firm and steady hand he laid hold of the man s arm and applying his throat to the point rushed on certain death XVI If the narrative in which I am engaged presented a detail of foreign Avars and a register of men who died with honour in the service of their country even in that case a continued train of disasters crowding fast upon one another would fatigue the writer and make the reader turn with disgust from so manv tratric issues honourable indeed but dark me lancholy and too much of a colour How 152 THE ANNALS book much more must the uniformity of the xvi  J present subject be found irksome and even repulsive We have nothing before us but tame servility and a deluge of blood spilt by a tyrant in the hour of peace The heart recoils from the dismal story But i let it be remembered by those who may  hereafter think these events worthy of their  notice that I have discharged the duty of an  historian and if in relating the fate of so j many eminent citizens who resigned their lives to the will of one man I mingle tears  with indignation let me be allowed to feel  for the unhappy The truth is the wrath of Heaven was bent against the Roman state j The calamities that followed cannot like  the slaughter of an army or the sacking  of a city be painted forth in one general draught Repeated murders must be given in succession and if the remains of illus  trious men are distinguished by their fune  ral obsequies from the mass of the people  may it not be considered as a tribute duej to their memory that in like manner their deaths should be snatched from oblivion and that history in describing the last act of their lives should give to each luVdi OF TACITUS 153 stinct and proper character for the ia Boos f m formation ot posterity v v o A U C 819 XVII I proceed to add to the list of 66 murdered citizens Annaeus Mela Cerealis Anicius Rufius Crispinus and Petronius In the compass of a few days they were all cut off as it were at one blow Mela and Crispinus were no higher than Roman knights but in fame and dignity of cha racter equal to the most distinguished sena tors Crispinus at one time commanded the prcetorian bands he was afterwards invested with the consular ornaments but lately charged as an accomplice in the conspiracy and banished to the island of Sardinia a At that place he received the emperor s mandate and died by his own hand Mela b was brother to Seneca and Gallic He abstained through life from the pursuit of civil honours vainly flattering himself that a simple knight could rise to the highest splendour and tower above the consular dignity By re maining in his rank he was qualified to act in the administration of the imperial revenue and that employment he thought 154 THE ANNALS book the shortest road to immoderate riches He XVI  r was the father of Lucan the poet and from A U C  L 8iÂ such a son c derived additional lustre 6 When Lucan was no more Mela en deavoured to recover the whole of his property d but proceeding with too much eagerness he provoked the enmity of Fabius Romanus one of the poet s inti mate friends This man framed a charge against the father He accused him of being engaged with his son in the late conspiracy and for that purpose forged several letters in the name of Lucan Nero was eager to seize his prey he panted for his riches and with that view sent the letters as evidence of his guilt Mela had recourse to the mode of death at that time deemed the easiest and for that reason most in vogue He opened his veins and expired By his will he be queathed a large sum to Tigellinus and to his son in law Cossutianus Capito hoping by that bequest to secure the remainder for his family A clause it has been said was added to the will asserting the innocence of the deceased and the flagrant injustice OF TACITUS 155 of cutting him off while such men as Ru book XVI fius Crispinus and Anicius Cerealis were A TT C suffered to live in security though they were sis both envenomed enemies of the prince The 66 clause however was thought to be fabri cated with a view to justify the murder of Crispinus which was already perpetrated and to hasten the sentence then in ao ita tion against Cerealis who in a few days afterwards dispatched himself He fell unlamented The public remembered that he formerly discovered a conspiracy e to Caligula and for that reason no man re gretted him in his end XVIII With regard to Caius Petro nius a his character his course of life and the singularity of his manners seem to merit particular attention He passed his days in sleep and his nights in business or in joy and revelry Indolence was at once his passion and his road to fame What others did by vigour and industry he ac complished by his love of pleasure and luxurious ease Unlike the men who pro fess to understand social enjoyment and ruin their fortunes he led a life of expence 156 THE ANNALS book without profusion an epicure yet not a y prodigal addicted to his appetites but 8i9 with taste and judgment a refined and Â Â â elegant voluptuary Gay and airy in his conversation he charmed by a certain graceful negligence the more engaging as  it flowed from the natural frankness of his disposition With all this delicacy and careless ease he shewed when he was go vernor of Bithynia and afterwards in the year of his consulship that vigour of mind and softness of manners may well unite in the same person With his love of sensu ality he possessed talents for business From his public station he returned to his usual gratifications fond of vice or of plea sures that bordered upon it His gaiety recommended him to the notice of the prince Being in favour at court and cherished as the companion of Nero in all his select parties he was allowed to be the arbiter of taste and elegance Without the sanction of Pctronius nothing was ex quisite nothing rare or delicious Hence the jealousy of Tigellinus who dreaded a rival in the good graces of the OF TACITUS 157 emperor almost his equal in the science book of luxury his superior Tigellinus deter v S o mined to work his downfall and accord 9Â ingly addressed himself to the cruelty of A66Â the prince that master passion to which all other affections and every motive were sure to give way lie charged Petronius with having lived in close intimacy with Scevinus b the conspirator and to give colour to that assertion he bribed a slave to turn informer against his master â The rest of the domestics were loaded with irons Nor was Petronius suffered to make his defence XIX Nero at that time happened to be on one of his excursions into Campania Petronius had followed him as far as Cuma but was not allowed to proceed further than that place He scorned to linger in doubt and fear and yet was not in a hurry to leave a world which he loved He opened his veins and closed them again at intervals losing a small quantity of blood then binding up the orifice as his own inclination prompted He conversed 158 THE ANNALS book during the whole time with his usual gaiety never changing his habitual manner nor talking sentences to shew his contempt of death He listened to his friends who en deavoured to entertain him not with grave discourses on the immortality of the soul or the moral wisdom of philosophers but with strains of poetry and verses of a gay and natural turn He distributed presents to some of his servants and ordered others to be chastised He walked out for his amusement and even lay down to sleep In this last scene of his life he acted with such calm tranquillity that his death though an act of necessity seemed no more than the decline of nature In his will he scorned to follow the example of others who like himself died under the tyrant s stroke he neither flattered the emperor nor Tigellinus nor any of the creatures of the court but having written under the fictitious names of profligate men and women a narrative of Nero s de bauchery and his new modes of vice a he had the spirit to send to the emperor that satirical romance sealed with his own OF TACITUS I59 Seal which he took care to break that book XVI after his death it might not be used for r Â the destruction of any person whatever 8i A D 66 XX Nero saw with surprise his clan destine passions and the secrets of his mid night revels laid open to the world To whom the discovery was to be imputed still remained a doubt Amidst his con jectures Silia who by her marriage with a senator had risen into notice occurred to his memory This woman had often pro cured for the libidinous pleasures of the prince and lived besides in close inti macy with Petronius Nero concluded that she had betrayed him and for that of fence ordered her into banishment Having made that sacrifice to his own resentment he gave another victim to glut the rage of Tigellinus namely Numicius Thermus a man of praetorian rank An accusation preferred against the favourite by a slave enfranchised by Thermus was the cause that provoked the vengeance of Tigellinus For that daring attempt against a man in power the informer suffered on the rack 160 THE ANNALS ook and his patron who had no concern in the business was put to death XXI Nero had not yet satiated his vin dictive fury He had spilt the best blood in Rome and now in the persons of Pectus Thrasea and Bareas Soranus he hoped to destroy virtue itself His rancour to those two illustrious citizens had been long work ing in his heart Thrasea in particular was the devoted object and various mo tives conspired against him When the business of Agrippina a was brought be fore the senate it will be in the memory of the reader that Thrasea withdrew from the  debate Afterwards in the youthful sports called juvenales he seldom attended and never with the alacrity which was ex pected This cold indifference was the more grating to the prince as Thrasea at Padua his native city not only assisted at the games of the c est us originally insti tuted by Antenor the fugitive from Troy but also performed in the habit of a tra gedian It was further remembered that when Antistius the praetor was in danger OF tacitus 161 of being capitally condemned for his verses book levelled at Nero Thrasea was the author of a milder sentence b There was still another circumstance when divine ho nours were decreed to Poppaea he wilfully absented himself nor did he afterwards attend her funeral These offences were not suffered to sink into oblivion The whole was treasured up by Cossutianus Capito c a man who to a bad heart and talents for every species of iniquity united motives of personal ill will to Thrasea which he nourished in secret ever since the victory obtained over him in a charge t f extortion conducted by the deputies from Cilicia and supported with all the credit and eloquence of Thrasea XXII The fertile genius of the pro secutor was not at a loss for new allega tions The heads of his charge were  That Thrasea made it a point to avoid  renewing the oath of fidelity usual at the  beginning of the year a and though a  member of the quindecemviral college  he never assisted at the ceremony of  offering vows for the safety of the prince VOL iv f iSt  THE ANNALS book  and the preservation of that melodious XVI A U C u voice A magistrate formerly of unre al  mitting assiduity he took a part in every Â Â  debate supporting or opposing the most  trifling motions and now what is his  conduct  For three years together he  has not so much as entered the senate b  Even on a late occasion when the busi  ness relating to Silanus and Vetus drew  the fathers to a crowded meeting Thrasea   was not at leisure the affairs of his  clients engrossed his attention and the  patriot was detained from the senate by  his own petty concerns What is this  but a public secession He is at the  head of a faction and if his partisans  take fire from his example a civil war  must be the consequence Caesar and  Cato were the names that formerly kept  the world awake at present in a city  ever rent by discord Nero and Thrasea s  engage the public mind  The popular demagogue has his sec  taries and his followers a set of men  not yet like their master ambitiously  sententious but in imitation of his mien OS TACITUS 163 and manners sullen gloomy and dis BooK contented By the formalities of their â yO  rigid discipline they hope to throw dis sie  grace on the gay and elegant manners of   their sovereign Your preservation Nero  is of no moment to Thrasea he disre  gards your safety he despises your ac  complishments Are your affairs in a  train of prosperity  he is still dejected  Has any untoward event disturbed your  peace of mind  he enjoys your distress  and in secret pampers himself with your â affliction The same spirit that refused  to swear on the acts of Julius Caesar and Augustus denies the divinity of Pop  paea He turns religion to a jest and  sets the laws at defiance The journals  of the Roman people c were never read  by the provinces and the armies with so w much avidity as in the present juncture  and the reason is the history of the  times is the history of Thrasea s con  tumacy  If the system of this wise philosopher  and profound politician merits attention  let us at once embrace his doctrine  if  164 THE ANNALS book otherwise let us take from the friends of XVI    innovation their leader and their oracle The sect whose precepts he affects to  admire has ever been proud and dogma tical busy bold and turbulent It was  that stoic school that formed the Tube  ros d and the Favonii names detested  even by the old republic And what is  now the principle of the whole faction  To subvert the fabric of a great empire they hold forth the name of liberty if  they succeed they will destroy even  liberty itself Of what use can it be to  Nero that he has banished a Cassius if  the followers of Brutus are still allowed  to flourish and multiply their numbers   Upon the whole you have no occasion  Caesar to write to the senate you need  not mention Thrasea to that assembly  leave him to our management and the  judgment of the fathers Nero praised the zeal of Cossutianus and added fury to a mind already bent on mischief To for ward his villany he gave him for a coad jutor Eprius Marcellus an orator of a tur bulent spirit and overbearing eloquence XXIII The prosecution against Bareas OF TACITUS 1 5 Soranus was already in the hands of Osto BÂ rius Sabinus a Roman knight Soranus Â was returned from his proconsular govern Ho ment of Asia His conduct in the province  stood distinguished by justice and the rectitude of his measures but by the jealousy of Nero the virtues of the mini ster were converted into crimes He had opened the port of Ephesus and left unpunished the obstinate resistance of the people of Pergamus who refused to let Acratus a one of the emperor s freed men carry off the statues and pictures that adorned their city This meritorious conduct was an offence not to be forgiven but constructive crimes were to be held forth to the public The heads of the ac i cusation were that Soranus had contracted a close and intimate friendship with Plan tus 6 and had endeavoured by popUlaP arts to incite the eastern provinces to V revolt To decide the fate of twd Upright1 citizens Nero chose a juncture favourable1 to his dark design Tiridates was on fitsâ 1 way to Rome to receive the diadem oF Armenia front the hands of the emperor  He thought it probable tfcat in the spietP i 56 THE ANNALS 50 ok dour of that magnificent scene the horrors AVI Â  v ry Jof domestic cruelty would be lost per A V C   819  haps it seemed a fair opportunity to dis 66 play to a foreign prince the grandeur of a Roman emperor and convince him by the murder of two eminent citizens that the imperial power was nothing short of oriental despotism   XXIV The city went forth in crowds to meet the emperor a and gaze at the eastern monarch Thrasea received orders not to appear on the occasion A mind like his was not to be disconcerted With his usual fortitude he sent a memorial to the prince requesting to know by what act of his life he had deserved such a mark of displeasure He pledged himself if a fair hearing were granted to confute his enemies and place his innocence in the clearest light Nero received the memo rial with eager curiosity expecting to find that Thrasea under the operation of fear had descended to the language of flattery and tarnished his own honour by magni fying the glory of the prince Stung fcby disappointment he refused to grant an OF TACITUS 167 audience The sight of that illustrious book citizen the countenance the spirit and wv A U C the virtue of the man were too much to 8i9  encounter He ordered the senate to be eÂ convened Thrasea in the mean time consulted with his friends which would be most advisable to enter at large into his defence or to behave with silent in dignation They were divided in their opinions XXV Some advised him to enter the senate and confront his enemies in the presence of that assembly  Of his con  stancy no doubt could be entertained  they knew that nothing could fall from  him unworthy of himself Every word  from his lips would tend to augment his  glory When danger threatened to take  shelter in the shade of obscurity were  the act of a degenerate spirit For him  he ought to have the people round him  to behold the scene a great man ad  vancing bravely to meet his fate would  be a spectacle worthy of their applause  The senate would hear with astonish  ment the energy of truth an4 the sub 168 THE ANNALS XVI book Â lime of virtue Every sentiment from  the mouth of Thrasea would rise superior  to humanity and sound to the fathers as  if some god addressed them Even the  heart of Nero might for once relent  Should it happen otherwise should his  obdurate nature still persist posterity  would crown with immortal glory the un  daunted citizen who distinguished him  self from those unhappy victims who  bowed their necks to the tyrant s stroke  and crept in silence to their graves XXVI Others were of a different opinion convinced that his best plan would be to wait the issue at his own house They spoke of Thrasea himself and the dignity of his character in the highest terms but they dreaded that his adversa ries would pour forth a torrent of insolence and opprobrious language  They desired  that he would not suffer his ear to be  wounded with scurrility and vile abuse  Cossutianus and Eprius Marcellus were  not the only enemies of virtue there M were others whose brutal rage might in  cite them to outrage and even violence OF TACITUS iffy to his person The cruelty of Nero left book none at liberty In a general panic w 0 good men might follow the worst ex si9  ample It would become the character i of Thrasea to rescue from infamy that august assembly which his presence had so long adorned If he did not attend the meeting the part which after hear ing Thrasea in his own defence the fathers might have acted will remain problematical and by that uncertainty the honour of the senate may be saved To hope that Nero would blush for hi crimes were to misunderstand his cha racter His unrelenting cruelty would most probably fall on Thrasea s wife on his whole family and all that were dear to him For these reasons an eminent citizen who had ever supported the ho nour of his name and still flourished with unblemished integrity would do well to remember who were the teachers of wisdom that furnished the principles  and the model of his conduct Since he had crowded into his life all their virtues  it would become him to emulate their  glory in his fall THE ANNALS Arulenus Rusticus a assisted at this consultation He was at that time a tri bune of the people a young man of sen timent eager to be in action and warm with the love of glory He offered to in terpose by his tribunitian authority to prevent a decree of the senate  For  bear said Thrasea  and learn young  man to restrain this impetuous ar  dour By a rash opposition you cannot  save your friend and you may bring  down ruin on yourself For me I have  lived my days my course is well nigh  finished it now remains that I reach  the goal with undiminished honour As  to you my friend you have but lately  entered the career of civil dignities Life  is before you and you have not as yet  pledged yourself to the public Ere you  take a decided part it will behove you  to consider well the times upon which  you are fallen and the principles which 4 you mean to avow Having thus de clared his sentiments he gave no opinion concerning the propriety of appearing in the senate but reserved the question for his own private meditation OF TACITUS 171 XXVII On the following day two prae book XVI torian cohorts under arms surrounded the A U C temple of Venus A body of citizens with sip A Dl swords ill concealed beneath their gowns Â invested all the avenues In the forum the open squares and round the adjoining temples bands of soldiers took their sta tion and through that military array the senators were obliged to pass surrounded by soldiers and praetorian guards The as sembly was opened by Nero s quaestor a with a speech in the name of the prince complaining  That the fathers no par ticular name was mentioned deserted  the public interest and by their example  taught the Roman knights to loiter away  their time in sloth and inattention to the  welfare of the state Nor could it be  matter of wonder that the senators from  the distant provinces no longer attended  their duty when men of consular rank  and even of sacerdotal dignity thought  of nothing but the embellishment of their  villas and the beauty of their gardens  and pleasure grounds This message was intended to be a weapon in the hands J72 THE ANNALS book of the accusers and their malice knew how XVI to use it XXVIII Cossutianus took the lead Eprius Marcellus followed him with more force andacrimony The commonwealth he said  is on the brink of ruin Certain  turbulent spirits rear their crest so high  that no room is left for the milder virtues  of the prince The senate for some time  past has been negligent tame and pas  sive Your lenity conscript fathers  your lenity has given encouragement to  sedition It is in consequence of your  indulgence that Thrasea presumes to  trample on the laws that his son in law  Helvidius Priscus a adopts the same per  nicious principles that Paconius Agrip  pinus b with the inveterate hatred  towards the house of Caesar which he  inherits from his father declares open  hostility and that Curtius Montanus c  in seditious verses spreads abroad the  venom of his pen Where is Thrasea  now  I want to see the man of consular rank in his place J want to see the OF TACITUS I75 A U C 8i9  sacerdotal dignitary offering up vows for book  the emperor I want to see the citizen  taking the oaths of fidelity Perhaps  that haughty spirit towers above the laws Â  and the religion of our ancestors per  haps he means to throw off the mask  and own himself a traitor and an enemy  to his county Let him appear in this  assembly let the patriot come let the  leader of faction shew himself the man  who so often played the orator in this  assembly and took under his patronage  the inveterate enemies of the prince  Let us hear his plan of government what  does he wish to change  What abuses  does he mean to reform  If he came  every day with objections the cavilling  spirit of the man might tease perplex â and embarrass us but now his sullen  silence is worse it condemns every thing  in the gross And why all this discon â tent  A settled peace prevails in every  quarter of the empire does that afflict  him  Our armies without the effusion of  Roman blood have been victorious is  that the cause of his disaffection  He  sickens in the midst of prosperity he 174 THE ANNALS

city where he has long lived an alien  the love of his country banished from  his heart and the people odious to his  sight XXIX Marcellus delivered this in vective in a strain of vehemence that gave additional terror to the natural ferocity of a stern and savage countenance His voice grew louder his features more en larged and his eyes flashed with fire The senate heard him but with emotions unfelt before the settled melancholy which that black period made habitual gave way to stronger feelings They saw a band of soldiers round them and they debated in the midst of swords and javelins Thrasea OF TACITUS 175 was absent but the venerable figure of the Â ooc  xvi man presented itself to every imagmation um j They felt for Helvidius Priscus who was sii doomed to suffer not for imputed guilt â but because he was allied to an innocent and virtuous citizen What was the crime of Agrippinus The misfortunes of his father cut off by the cruelty of Tiberius rose in judgment against the son The case of Montanus a was thought hard and oppressive His poetry was a proof of ge nius not of malice and yet for a pre tended libel on the prince a youth of expectation was to be driven from his country XXX Amidst th tumult and distrac tion which this business excited Ostorius Sabinus the accuser of Bareas Soranus entered the senate He opened at once and charged as a crime the friendship that subsisted between Soranus and Rubellius Plautus He added that the whole tenour  of his administration in Asia was directed not for the public good but to promote his own popularity and to spread a spirit  of sedition through the provinces These  176 THE ANNALS ook accusations had been long since fabricated J o and were then grown threadbare but the iVifj prosecutor was ready with a new allega Â

Ser vilia with no other motives than those of filial piety had the imprudence natural at her time of life to apply to a set of for tune tellers in order to satisfy her mind about the fate of her family and to learn whether Nero s resentment was by any pos sibility to be appeased and what would be the issue of the business in the senate She was cited to appear in the senate before the tribunal of the consuls On one side stood the aged father on the other his daughter in the bloom of life not hay ing yet completed her twentieth year but even then in a state of destitution still la menting the fate of her husband Annius Pollio lately torn from her and condemned to banishment She stood in silent sor Â row not daring to lift her eyes to her fa OF TACITUS 177 ther whom by her imprudent zeal she had book involved in new misfortunes A 0 XXXI The accuser pressed her with â Â Â â questions He desired to know whether she had not sold her bridal ornaments her jewels and her necklace to supply herself with money for magic sacrifices  She fell prostrate on the ground and wept in bit terness of heart Her sorrows were too big for utterance She embraced the altars and rising suddenly exclaimed with vehe mence  I have invoked no infernal gods  I have used no unhallowed rites no ma  gic no incantations My unhappy pray  ers asked no more than that you Caesar  and you conscript fathers would extend  your protection to this best of men this  most affectionate parent For him I sold  my jewels for him I disposed of my  bridal ornaments and for him I gave up  the garments suited to my rank In the  same cause I was willing to sacrifice my  life the blood in my veins was at his  service The men whom I consulted were  all strangers to me I had no knowledge  of them They best can tell who they vol IV N 17Â THE ANNALS book are and what they profess The name  of the prince was never mentioned by me  but with that respect which I pay to the  gods What I did was my own act that  miserable man my unhappy father knew  nothing of it If any crime has been  committed he is innocent I and 1 alone  am guilty XXXII Soranus could no longer re strain himself He interrupted his daugh ter crying aloud  She was not with me in  Asia she is too young to have any  knowledge of Rubellius Plautus In the  accusation against her husband she was  not involved her filial piety is her only  crime Distinguish her case from mine  respect the cause of innocence and on  my head let your worst vengeance fall  I am ready to meet my fate With these words he rushed to embrace his child she advanced to meet him but the lictors in terposed to prevent the pathetic scene The witnesses were called in The fathers had hitherto listened to all that passed with emotions of pity but pity was soon converted into a stronger passion The OF TACITUS 179 appearance of Publius Egnatius a the book client of Soranus hired to give evidence v   A U c against his patron and his friend kindled 8i9 a general indignation This man professed ee himself a follower of the stoic sect He had learned in that school to retail the maxims of virtue and could teach his fea tures to assume an air of simplicity while fraud and perfidy and avarice lay lurking at his heart The temptation of money drew forth his hidden character and the hypocrite stood detected His treachery gave a standing lesson to mankind that in the commerce of the world it is not suffi cient to guard against open and avowed iniquity since the professors of friendship can under a counterfeit resemblance of virtue nourish the worst of

freedom than live an ignominious slave All that Nero can do is to shorten my days my memory will subsist and men will continue to talk of me But for the tribe of abject sycophants they will perish and

the doctrines of the Platonic school had the misfortune to be consulted on the subject of a poem which Nero had projected a He spoke his mind with honest freedom and for that offence was immediately banished Nor was the cruelty of the prince appeased by the number that fell a sacrifice he still thirsted for blood but happily a scene of splendour then ready to be displayed engaged his atten tion and gave the people some respite from the rage of an insatiate tyrant Tiri dates who with the consent of his brother Vologeses the Parthian king had agreed with Corbulo to undertake a journey to Rome

his presence The sis  spectacle was magnificent It served at Â once to gratify the pride of a Roman em peror and for a time to sooth the afflic tions of the people Tiridates was attended by a long procession of officers and a mili tary band appointed by Corbulo He had besides not less than three thousand of the Parthian nobility in his train with his wife and the sons c of Vologeses of Paconis and Monobazus His march through the provinces had no appearance of a prince subdued and forced to submit to the will of a conqueror Till he entered the city of Naples all was grandeur and royal mag nificence The act of humiliation still re mained He was to pay homage to the emperor on his knees Mollifying as that circumstance was to an oriental king Tiri dates submitted to prostrate himself at Nero s feet Vologeses had stipulated with Corbulo that his brother should not be compelled to deliver up his sword d and Tiridates called it an ignominious act be neath the dignity of the Arsacidceu Nothing vol iv o 1 4 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appf n could extort his sword He is said to have B XVI 7 vâ v nailed it to the scabbard The magnani A IT c Â J mity with which he refused to comply M obtained the applause of all who beheld a scene so new and magnificent The court set out for Rome Nero thought proper to make some stay at Puteoli e in order to entertain his royal visitor with a show of gladiators The spectacle was exhibited by Patrobius  one of the emperor s freedmen with great cxpence and prodigious pomp The genius of Nero could not lie still on such an oc casion In his opinion it was fit that a foreign prince and his Parthian courtiers should know how well the emperor of Home could sing Tiridates beheld the whole with mixed emotions of wonder ad miration and contempt The example of Nero did not tempt him to exhibit his per son as a show to the people He scorned to descend into the arena but did not think it beneath his dignity to call for his bow and arrow arid from the throne where lie was seated to give a specimen of his dexterity He aimed at the wild beasts OF THE ANNAtS Igg arid the spectators admired his address and appen B XVI A U C the vigour of his arm Historians relate as a fact g that two bulls were transfixed sia by one arrow and died on the spoL â M IIL Nero proceeded with a grand cavalcade on his way to Rome where the most splendid preparations were made for his reception The whole city was illu minated and the houses decorated with garlands and laurel wreaths The peoplef crowded together from all quarters and rent the air with shouts and acclamations while the emperor with Tiridates and the Parthian nobility in his train made his triumphal entry A day was fixed for Tiridates to receive the diadem from the hands of Nero Nothing could equal the pomp and splendour with which that ce remony was performed a On the pre ceding evening the city was again illu minated and the streets adorned with flowers At the dawn of day an incredi ble multitude repaired to the forum the tops of houses were crowded with spec tators and a splendid but theatrical pomp 0 2 196 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVL 00 appen nras exhibited with lavish expencc The â â people dressed in white robes crowned with 8is laurels and ranked in their several tribes A D â walked in procession to their respective seats The praetorian guards with their standards ranged in order and their co lours flying displayed their glittering arms Nero entered the forum in his triumphal habit The whole body of the senate followed in his train He took his seat on a curnle chair amidst the standards and the eagles In a short time after Tiridates made his appearance The soldiers opened their lines he advanced through the ranks with his eastern nobility in his train He approached the rostrum and on his knees offered homage to Nero The people were not able to contain their joy They saw the pride of an oriental king humbled at the feet of the emperor The majesty off Rome filled every imagination A shout burst forth from the enraptured multitude Tifidatefc was astonished at the sound he stood at gaze and his heart shrunk within him Nero raised him from the ground and having clasped him in his arms placed OF THE ANNALS I97 the diadem on his head b amidst the re appbv peated shouts and acclamations of the rv people sip A D IV The Parthian prince not yet re covered from his surprise in the hurry and agitation of his spirits addressed himself to Nero in substance as follows  You  see before you a prince descended from  the line of the Arsacida you behold  the brother of two kings Vologeses and  Pacorus and yet I own myself your  slave You no less than a Mithra are  to me a god I pay you the same vene  ration as I do to the Sun Without your  protection I have no kingdom my rights  must flow from you You are the author  of my fortune and your will is fate An ancient praetor undertook to be inter preter on the occasion The people well convinced that Nero by his vices had for feited all kind of claim to such respectful language received it as the homage of a king to the majesty of the Roman name The speech was sufficiently mean and abp ject but the arrogance and ferocity of Nero s answer b exceeded every tiling J98 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen I congratulate you on the wisdom that i v Â brought you thus far to enjoy the sun 8i9 shine of my presence and my protection Â 6 u The diadem which your father could  not leave you nor your brothers confirm u in your hand is the gift which I bestow  The kingdom of Armenia is yours I  place you on the vacant throne From  this day you and your brothers may  learn that it is mine to raise or depose  the monarchs of the earth as my wisdom Â shall direct Such was the haughty style in which Nero spoke of himself but he did not long support his grandeur The coronation be ing over he adjourned to Pompey s thea tre where the scene was prepared at an enormous expence with the most superb decorations The stage and the whole in side of that noble structure were cased c with gold Such a profusion of wealth and magnificence had never been displayed to view To screen the spectators from the iys of the sun a purple canopy inlaid with golden stars was spread over their Jjeads  In the centre was seen richly envÂ OF THE ANNALS 199 broidered the figure of Nero in the act of appen driving a curricle To the exhibitions of v v Â A U C the theatre the pleasures of the table sue 8i9 r A D ceeded The banquet d was the most Â â sumptuous that taste and luxury could contrive When the appetite of the guests was satisfied the public diversions were once more resumed Nero seized the op portunity to display his talents and he who a little before was master of the uni verse appeared in the characters of cha rioteer comedian singer and buffoon He sung on the stage and drove round the circus in his green livery e The king of Armenia saw the prince who talked of dealing out crowns and sceptres warbling a tune and managing the reins for the entertainment of his subjects Such de spicable talents he knew could neither form a warrior nor a legislator His glory it now was evident depended on the virtue and the genius of men very different from himself How he found a people tame enough to obey and general officers will mg to command his armies was matter of wonder to the Parthian prince Struck vith that idea he could not refrain from 200 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen saying to Nero in the simplicity of hi â heart   You have in Corbulo a most va A U C sik   luable slave The drift and good sense ec of the observation made no impression on a frivolous mind like that of Nero An emperor who placed his glory in being a scenic performer paid no attention to the merit of Corbulo If he understood the reflection of the eastern prince he shewed afterwards that the only use he made of it was to nourish a secret jealousy and plan the ruin of an officer whose fame in arms was too great for a tyrant to endure As soon as the diversions of the theatre and the circus ended Nero thought fit to open a more important scene He pro ceeded with a grand retinue to the capitol where he entered with a branch of laurel jn his hand and as if he had subdued Armenia the charioteer and player of in terludes was saluted Imperator His vanity was now amply gratified but va nity was not the only spring of his actions To be an adept in magic arts had been for some time his predominant passion and as Tiridates brought with him in his train a OF THE ANNALS 201 number of the Parthian Magi he thought appew the opportunity fair to learn all the secrets of an occult science which he believed was not the mere illusion of mathemati cians and pretended philosophers Tiri r dates studied to ingratiate himself and was proud to have the emperor of Rome for his pUpil g By his desire the Magi opened all their stores of knowledge and Nero with the anxiety of a guilty mind was eager to pry into futurity He was master of the Roman world and with the assistance of his oriental teachers flattered himself that he should soon be able to con troul the ways of Providence and give the law to the gods With tins view he passed his time in close conference with a setÂ of Chaldean impostors but Tiridates was not able in return for the kingdom of Arme nia to teach his benefactor the art of holding commerce with evil spirits Nero found the whole to be a system of fraud Instead of being enabled to hold a council with infernal powers he was left to the suggestions of his own heart and the advice of a pernicious crew of abandoned men and women who were the emperor s con 202 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen fidential ministers and the instruments of B XVI every villany V It is certain that Nero s passion for the guitar and stage music was not greater than his ambition to excel in magic incan tations  but though his hopes were frus trated he did not cease to entertain Tiri dates with the most lavish profusion An enormous sum a was issued every day to the Armenian king for the support of his own grandeur and the courtiers in his train At his departure a still larger sum was ordered as a present from the emperor and that he might rebuild the city of Ar taxata Z which had been levelled to the ground a number of artificers were addSd at a vast cxpence to the retinue of the Par thian prince who also engaged a number of others to attend him for stipulated wages to his own country The conse quence of Nero s generosity was that the fixing of a king on the throne of Armenia was a heavier burthen to the Romans thaia any of their most expensive Avars There is reason to think that the A ant OF THE ANNALS 203 of success in the attempt to make Nero appex B XVL believe in the religion of the Magi served in some degree to open the eyes of Tiri 8i9 A U C A D dates and remove the errors of eastern su w perstition In order to visit Rome he had taken a wide compass over an immense tract of country and travelled all the way by land The cause of this circuitous and laborious journey must be referred to the superstition of his native county In the creed of the Parthian Magi the sea was said to be a sacred element c and to spit in it or defile the purity of the wa ters by the superfluities of the human body was held to be profane and impious The design probably was by that doctrine to prevent migration and what at first was policy received in time the sanction of re ligion But Tiridates during his stay at Rome so far weeded out the prejudices of education that he made no scruple to re turn by sea He embarked at Brundu sium d and having crossed the Adria tic arrived at the port of Dyrrachium e From that place he pursued his voyage along the coast of Asia and being safely landedt visited the Roman provinces and 204 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen the most splendid cities on the continent Before he entered the confines of Armenia Corbulo advanced to a meeting In his interview with the Armenian monarch he still maintained that superior character which he had fairly earned by his talents and his virtues Finding an extraordinary number of artificers in the prince s train he resolved to act with due attention to the interest as well as the dignity of the Roman name and with that view having separated such as were hired he suffered none but those who were a donation from Nero to migrate to a foreign country This behaviour gave no offence to Thi dates He took leave of Corbulo with the highest esteem for his many virtues and though he entertained no kind of personal respect for Nero he thought the regal dia dem claimed a return of gratitude and upon that principle as soon as the capital of Armenia was rebuilt instead of calling it Artaxata he gave it the flattering name of Neronia VI Rome having no war upon her hands Nero with airs of self congratula OF THE ANNALS 205 tion as if his vajour had subdued the na appen B XVL tions thought fit to shut the temple of J a u v o1 if us a But that pacific disposition did si 9 not last long Intoxicated by the homage es  which he had received from Tiridates he wanted to renew the same scene of splen dour and vain glory by the humiliation of Vologeses the Parthian king For that pur pose he endeavoured by pressing invita tions to induce that prince to undertake a  journey to Rome At length the eastern monarch gave a decisive answer  You  can cross the sea which I hold to be a  forbidden element come to Asia and  we will then settle the ceremony of our 44 meeting Fired with indignation by that peremptory refusal and the tone of grandeur with which ftâ was delivered Nero was upon the point of declaring war if Other projects had not dazzled his imagin ation He concerted his measures and laid plans of vast ambition but the ca price that dictated them yielded to the first novelty that occurred He intended to open the temple of Janus for four wars at once b The first against the Jews who felt themselves oppressed by the avarice 206 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVf appen and rapacity of Gessius Florus the gover nor of the province and were at that time in open revolt The second enterprise was intended against the Ethiopians the third against the Albanians on the borders of the Caspian sea the fourth to revenge the insult offered to him by the haughty spirit of Vologeses The love of fame whatever he did was the inspiring motive whether he sent forth his armies or drove a chariot or sung a song praise was still the ultimate end If by his victorious arms the Ethiopians and Albanians could be reduced to subjection the glory of en larging the boundaries of the empire was to be the bright reward His exertions were therefore made against the two last mentioned states He sent detachments forward to survey the country he formed flying camps in those distant regions lie began to collect the forces of the empire and not content with drawing from Bri tain from Germany and Illyricum the flower of his armies he formed a new legion composed of men six feet high and this he called the phalanx c of Alex ander the Great OF THE ANNALS 207 Amidst this din of amis and all this

unexpected was not to be neglected Nero was transported with joy he towered above himself and all competition The deputies were admitted to his presence they were caressed invited to his table and all other business however important gave way to the elegant arts The Greeks were skilled in the trade of adulation They beseeched the prince to honour theni with a specimen of his talents Nero sung to his guests they heard they applauded they were thrown into ecstasies He in his turn admired their taste they were the only people who had music in their souls they and they only had an ear for finer sound the true masters of harmony the judges who deserved to hear his exquisite 208 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVL appen powers From that moment all his war B XVI c v o like projects vanished from his mind He 8i9 thought no more of humbling the Par se thian king the Ethiopians and Albanians might enjoy their independent state and Vespasian might take the field against the Jews The fame of a coachman a min strel and a singer was of greater moment He resolved without delay to set out for Greece How the administration was to be conducted during his absence was the first consideration That did not embar rass him long The whole authority and all the functions of the prince were com mitted to Ilelius one of his freedmen That upstart minister with Polycletus his associate had already enriched himself with the plunder of the public and was now with the whole power in his hands to give a full display of his character That point being settled a weightier care still remained An imperial charioteer and a comedian of illustrious rank who was to be nobly covered with Olympic dust and to bring back laurel crowns for his vic tories ih song and pantomime could not undertake such an expedition without the OF THE ANNALS SOp 1 greatest pomp Preparations were accord appeV ingly made The emperor seemed to be o going to an important war e Tigellinus sii put himself at the head of the companions Â of the Augustan order in number not less than five thousand To these were added an incredible multitude of abandoned har lots and the most debauched young men of the time The whole train went forth not in warlike array with swords and pikes and javelins but with softer instru ments  with the sock and buskin with music lutes and guitars The retinue was suited to the dignity of the enterprise An idea of the splendour and magnificence displayed on this occasion may be easily formed when we are told that Nero never travelled with less than a thousand bag gage waggons  the mules all shod with silver and the drivers dressed in scarlet his African slaves adorned with bracelets on their arms and the horses decorated with the richest trappings VII The consuls for this year were a u c ionteius Capito and

marked the conduct of this favourite freedman and debased the peo ple who submitted to so vile a master All degrees and ranks of men the senate and the Roman knights groaned under the iron rod of an ignoble tyrant who confis cated their estates sent them into banish ment or took away their lives at his will and pleasure The people who shudder ed at the presence of the emperor were obliged in misery of heart to lament his absence Nero in the mean time arrived at Cas siopoea b in the isle of Corcyra and there in the temple of Jupiter Cassius c he tuned His harp and sung in the presence of

in the field with a powerful army they had defeated Cestius Gallus with great slaughter and taken an eagle from one of the legions The crisis was big with danger and called for vigor ous measures But Nero did not think that Judaea was the field of glory He gave the command to Vespasian appre hending no danger from a man of obscure descent and austere manners whom he was no longer willing to retain near his person Vespasian departed to take upon him the command in Syria and Nero con tinued his progress through Greece He was received every where with public de monstrations of respect but the

that he had triumphed over the arts and in the pride of his heart resolved to make a progress through the conquered country He took care however not to visit Athens or Lace daemon In the former he dreaded to approach the temple of the Eumenidae A mind lashed and goaded by the whips and stings of a guilty conscience wished to avoid those avenging deities a He was deterred from Lacedasmon by the form of government and the sanctity of the laws established by Lycurgus The place where the Eleusinian mysteries b were cele brated was also forbidden ground Mur derers and parricides were excluded from those religious ceremonies Nero was seized with a fit of remorse Busy reflec tion brought to light the iniquities of his 218 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen conduct in the agitation of his spirits he reviewed those deeds of horror which for A tJ C 82 bore to goad him while his mind was be A P  67 calmed by vanity and pleasure Consci ence may grant a truce to the guilty but never makes a lasting peace Distracted by his fears and sunk in the gloom of superstition c he resolved to consult the oracle at Delphi The Pythian priestess warned him to beware of seventy three years d He received the admonition as a certain promise of long life not then think ing of Galba who had reached his seventy third year and in a short time after suc ceeded to the imperial dignity The oracle pleased him at first by agreeable bodings but did not continue long in his good graces The parricide he was told which he had committed placed him in the same rank with Alcmeon and Orestes who had murdered their mothers Nero kindled with indignation He resolved that the god should feel his resentment and in  his fury disfranchised the territory of Cirrha e which had been appropriated to the temple and was held to be conse crated ground Nor did his phrensy end OF THE ANNALS 219 â iiere The oracle was to be silenced ov appen  B XVL so profaned as to lose its credit With this v A U C intent he ordered a number of men to be 820  A D massacred on the spot and having poured 67Â libations of their blood into the opening of the ground from which the exhalations issued that were supposed to inspire the priestess with enthusiastic fury he closed the orifice and with pride and insolence left a place which had been revered for ages After this exploit he returned to his former luxury and in the gratifications of yice hoped to find some respite from his anxious thoughts But even vice required variety Repetition might pall the sated appetite and if he did not show an inventive genius the flattery of the Greeks was in danger of being exhausted He had made himself at Rome the wife of Pythago ras f but that was become an obsolete story and no longer excited wonder He was determined therefore to resume his sex and many Sporus the eunuch The ceremony was performed g with great pomp and splendour Calvia Crispinilla h was appointed mistress of the wardrobe to the emperor s wife She

of ridicule had still the address to pay their adulation gave away Sporus in marriage to the emperor of Rome It was said upon the occasion that it would have been well for mankind if Nero s father had been married to such a wife IX Nero could not in this unbounded manner riot in vice and folly without vast expence and a prodigious waste of the public treasure To supply his prodigality Melius the freedman who conducted the administration at Rome laboured hard by every iniquitous measure by extortion and cruelty to raise enormous sums of money A tame and complying senate was easily induced by the arts of the prime minister to vote an immense annual sum to be remitted to the emperor during his absence from the capital The rapacity of Helius was not to be appeased The companions of the Augustan society a had bound themselves by a vow to erect OF THE ANNALS 221 a statue to Nero not less than a thousand appen pound weight By that voluntary obli gation they were said to have incurred a debt and were compelled to advance an equivalent sum of money No rank or station was safe from plunder and oppres sion Roman knights and senators fell a sacrifice and their estates were confiscated Sulpicius Camerinus b a man descended from an illustrious family was put to death for an extraordinary reason The surname of Pythicus had been for ages annexed to his ancestors and was consequently an hereditary honour By the fertile inven tion of Helius this was construed into a czime The name might imply a victor in the Pythian games and when Nero with the consenting voice of Greece was de clared universal conqueror to usurp that title was a crime of violated majesty and an impious sacrilege Sulpicius and his son were put to death and their effects were forfeited to the state Wealth in whatever rank was sure to provoke the hand of rapacity and Rome under the government of a presuming and arrogant freedman was a scene of plunder blood and cruelty And yet all that could be 222 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen amassed by those iniquitous means was R VVI uvO not sufficient for the prodigality of Nero 820  The Greeks had flattered his vanity and 67 in return were doomed to feel the hand of oppression The cities which had re vered him as a god had reason in the end to execrate him as a tyrant They saw their best and most distinguished citizens put to death or sent into banishment that the emperor might enjoy the spoils of their plundered property c X The fame of a divine voice and an exquisite hand on the guitar was not suf ficient for the ambition of Nero He wished to distinguish himself by somer unheard of enterprise The grand the vast and almost impossible fired his imagination He arrived at Corinth and was there surprised to see by what a narrow isthmus the two seas were separated Like the hero of Statius the poet he heard the murmur of the billows on the Ionian and the iEgeafi shores in mediis audit duo litora campis The pro ject of piercing through the land and forming a navigable canal to communicate the two seas and render it unnecessary for OF THE ANNAL 223 mariners to sail round the Peloponnesus appen B XVT struck his fancy and fired him with ideas y j of immortal fame a The Greeks op 820 posed the design and endeavoured to Â â dissuade him from undertaking it Th language of superstition was that to at tempt to join what had been severed for ages would be an impious violation of the laws of nature Nero was not to be de terred from his purpose religious prin ciples were urged in vain to conquer na ture were an imperial work and what the gods ordained might be new modelled by his superior judgment He knew besides that the attempt had been made by Demetrius Policrates an eastern king by Julius Caesar and Caligula b and to accomplish an arduous work which those three princes had undertaken with out effect appeared to him the height of human glory He resolved therefore to begin the work without delay Having harangued the praetorian soldiers and urged every topic that could inflame their ardour he provided himself with a golden pick axe for such hands were not to be sullied by baser metal and advancing 224 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen on the shore sung in melodious strains a B XVI hymn to Neptune Amphitrite and all the inferior gods and goddesses who allay or heave the waters of the deep After this ceremony he struck the first stroke into the ground and with a basket of sand on his shoulder marched away in triumph proud of his Herculean labour The na tives of the country saw the frantic enter prise with mixed emotions of fear asto nishment and religious horror They ob served to Nero that of the three princes who had conceived the same design not one died a natural death They told him further that in some places as soon as the axe pierced the ground a stream of blood gushed from the wound hollow groans were heard from subterraneous caverns and various spectres emitting a feeble murmur were seen to glide along the coast These remonstrances made no impression Nero ordered his soldiers to exert their utmost vigour money was levied in every quarter cruelty and ex tortion went hand in hand In order to procure a sufficient number of workmen the jails in all parts of the empire were OF THE ANNALS 225 ransacked and the armies in Syria andAPPE â  â J B XVI Palestine had it in command to send to Corinth all the prisoners taken in battle A83o C The conduct of the war against the Jewish nation had been as mentioned above committed to Vespasian who had already carried his victorious arms through the province of Galilee The enemy as soon as they had intelligence that he was advancing at the head of a powerful army endeavoured to surprise a Roman garrison in the city of Ascalon c but were repulsed with prodigious slaughter Not less than eighteen thousand were put to the sword by the legions who had orders to give no quarter Vespasian found it necessary against a fierce and obstinate race at that time for their manifold crimes devoted to destruction to forget the maxims of Ro man clemency It is certain that those merciful conquerors never spilled so much hostile blood in any of their wars from the first foundation of Rome The city of Gadara d was taken by storm and reduc ed to ashes The garrison and the whole body of the inhabitants perished in the vol IV Q A D 67 226

number not less than fifteen thousand were put to the sword The Samaritans who had collected their forces on Mount Gari zim f were treated with the same severi ty Cerealis who afterwards commanded against Civilis the Batavian chieftain and also in Britain had orders to march with three thousand foot and six hundred horse to attack the fastnesses on the hills and dislodge the enemy He formed lines of circumvallation round the hill and by a close blockade cut off all communication with the adjacent country The Samari tans were reduced by famine to the last distress yet even in that condition held out to the last with determined obstinacy Cerealis ordered his men to advance up the hill The soldiers forced their way up the steep ascent and with resistless valour soon OF THE ANNALS

province and he now commanded the garrison determined to make a vigorous defence and hold out to the last extremity The particulars of the siege are related by himself and therefore need not to be here repeated It will be sufficient to say that he discharged all the duties of an able officer by his own example no less than by his spirited exhortations animating the soldiers and in every part of the works ex citing them to deeds of valour The siege lasted seven and forty days In one of the approaches to the walls Vespasian was wounded by a lance aimed at him from the works  but he bore the pain with such q2 228 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen silent fortitude that no ill consequence B XVI  i â v v followed On the forty seventh day of the 82o siege the inhabitants still refusing to ca n pitulate the signal was given for a general assault Titus at the head of a chosen band scaled the walls and was the first that entered the town In that dreadful crisis it does not appear that Josephus ei ther faced the danger or discharged the functions of a general officer Except the women and children and about twelve hundred prisoners all who were found in the town died in one general carnage Josephus was afterwards found concealed in a cave Vespasian spaTed his life and the historian survived to write an account of the siege intermixed indeed with some romantic circumstances but containing various matter for the information of pos terity The city of Tarichaea which had been the receptacle of a turbulent and seditious rabble from all sides of the coun try was compelled after an obstinate re sistance to open her gates to Titus Ves pasian ordered twelve hundred of the most fierce incendiaries to be put to death as a OF THE ANNALS 22g public example and in compliance with appen Nero s letters sent six thousand prisoners v o m to work at the isthmus of Corinth sao A U 67 XI While Vespasian pursued his con quests and in one campaign overran the province of Galilee Rome was a scene of tumult and distraction Helius reigned like a second emperor the people called him the worst of the two Each day pro duced new proofs of avarice cruelty and all the vices of an upstart slave The se nators began to wake from their lethargy the clamours of the populace were loud and fierce  rage and indignation glowed in every breast and the flame was ready to mount into a blaze The freedman saw his danger He dispatched letters to in form the emperor that the urgency of his affairs required his presence at Rome a But Nero s vast designs were of too much importance His answer to

that victorious general Corbulo 6 had not the good for tune to be remembered with equal mode ration Tiridates had mentioned him with the praise due to his virtue and his fame in arms That commendation was sufficient to provoke the ingratitude of a tyrant who beheld distinguished talents with a jea lous eye and suffered no man to be great and virtuous with impunity Being at length determined to execute the bloody purpose which he had for some time har boured in secret he wrote to Corbulo in terms of great esteem and kindness call ing him his friend and benefactor and ex pressing his ardent wish to have an inter view with a general who had rendered such Signal services to the empire Having sent that insidious invitation he held a private correspondence with Arrius Varus who served in Asia a young man of a daring spirit in haste to rise by his crimes To fabricate a charge against his commanding officer he knew would be the way to ingra v OF THE ANNALS 3 tiate himself with Nero He sent a formal appbn iii i â i B XVI accusation loaded with every crime that v  A U C ealumny could suggest Corbulo fell into wo the snare A mind like his impregnated Â â with honour and heroic fortitude could admit no suspicion of intended treachery He embarked without any retinue and landed at Cenchreae a Corinthian harbour in the iEgean sea Nero was there at the time dressed in his pantomime garb and ready to mount the stage when the arrival of his general officer was announced He felt the indecency of giving an audience in his comedian s dress to a man whom he respected while he hated him To fiÂ e himself from all embarrassment he took the shortest way and sent a death warrant Corbulo saw too late that honesty is too often the dupe of the ignoble mind He scorned to expostulate  I have deserved  this he said and fell upon his sword e The blood of one great man could not appease the cruelty of Nero Whoever was eminent for talents riches or nobility of birth was considered as a state crimi nal In that number were the two Scribo 232 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen nii Rufus and Proculus who had lived B XVI in perfect harmony with mutual esteem and true brotherly affection Their fortunes were a joint stock They assisted each other in the road to honours and both together rose to stations of high authority one on the Upper and the other on the Lower Rhine While they discharged their respective du ties with integrity and unwearied zeal for the public service Pactius Africanus  was their secret enemy This man had the ear of Nero and knew how to transfuse his own malignity into the heart of a prince too fatally prone to evil deeds The virtues of the Scribonii were by his artful misre presentation converted into crimes the happy concord in which they lived was a conspiracy against the state and their fame and credit in the German armies were the means of two ambitious politicians not the end of their actions By conciliat ing the good will of the soldiers they hoped to overturn the government Nero took the alarm and under a specious pretence of doing honour to the two bro thers invited them to his court They pbeyed his orders As soon as they arrived OF THE ANNALS 233 B XVI in Greece a new scene was opened An appen audience was refused they were forbid to appear in the emperor s presence  suborn ed accusations were presented in form and the unhappy brothers found them selves in the sad condition of state crimi nals They desired to be heard in their defence That act of justice was denied They knew that under a despotic prince the interval between the opening of an accusation and the catastrophe is always short They resolved not to wait the ty rant s pleasure but to deliver themselves with Roman fortitude from an ignominious death They opened their veins and ex pired together The fate of Crassus g who derived an illustrious lineage from Pompey the Great and Crassus the Triumvir may be mention ed in this place Historians have not fixed the time of his death with precision but it is certain that he fell a victim to the cruelty of Nero Crassus his father with Scri bonia his mother and a brother who was named Cneius Pompeius Magnus had been cut off by the emperor Claudius  But 234 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI APPEN the family in the opinion of Aquileius vl v w Regulus had not shed blood enough 82o That pernicious informer knew that to be 67 accused was to be condemned He in vented a charge of an atrocious nature and Crassus shared the fate of his murdered family He left two brothers the eldest Crassus Scribonianus the youngest the unfortunate Piso at that time a banished man but afterwards adopted by Galba k too soon to fall from that dangerous emi nence Durjng these bloody tragedies the great business of piercing the isthmus was not ne glected The work began at a place Galled Lechaeum  a sea port on the Ionian sea It went on with strenuous exertion for a number of days A trench was dug four stadia in length with was computed to be a tenth part of the isthmus But the flame of discord was lighted up at Some A storm was gathering in Gaul and com motions shook every part of the empire In that alarming conjuncture Helius thought fit to leave his associate Poly cletus as his vicegerent at Rome and he OF THE ANNALS 233 himself passed over into Greece He met appen r B XVI Nero at Corinth and by giving him in u v o striking colours a dreadful picture of the 826  state of affairs enforced the necessity of Â 7 returning to the capital The grand enter prise was abandoned and the Ionian and iEgean Seas were left to flow in the direc tion which nature had appointed But still there was an object that attracted Ne ro s fond regard The time of celebrating the Isthmian games was near at hand His favourite passion hurried him to the place The pugilist and the charioteer banished from his mind all fear of plots and insur rections He thought of the crowns of victory which he had obtained in every quarter His heart expanded with joy with self congratulation and gratitude to wards a people who had declared him matchless and unrivalled in all the games and exercises throughout the country It behoved so great a conqueror to leave a lasting monument of munificence and imperial grandeur Elate with pride and touched with generous sentiments he re solved to give Greece her liberty With that design he repaired to the forum Nor 236 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen did he suffer his gracious intention to be B XVI uttered by the public cryer Such a gift 820 required the accents of his own heavenly en voice He ascended the tribunal of ha rangues and having declared Greece a free country m set sail for Italy mi  XII The consuls next in office were Â 8 Galerius Trachalus and Silius ltalicus They were both men of genius  both ad dicted to study and distinguished by their extensive literature Trachalus a was an orator in great celebrity always copious and often sublime Silius ltalicus b had also distinguished himself at the bar but not with unblemished reputation He knew that under Nero to be the accuser of in nocence was the road to preferment but Jie returned to the paths of virtue and by his poetry which he published afterwards transmitted his name to posterity During his consulship Nero returned from Greece to close the scene of vice and folly After a tempestuous voyage he arrived at Na ples where the first displays of his genius had been seen in their dawn c His fame was now in its meridian lustre The con OF THE ANNALS 237 Olympic the Pythian and the Isthmian games was to enter the city in queror in the Olympic the Pythian and the appem triumph and for this purpose the usual Vm avenues were not sufficient The occasion â required something new and extraordinary The custom in Greece was to throw down part of the city wall rf that the conqueror in the sacred games might enter through the breach Nero ordered an opening to be made for himself and entered the city in a triumphal car drawn by six milk white horses The splendour of the day exceeded the triumph of Flamminius e or Mummius They had obtained victo ries and subdued a nation but what Ro man triumphed over the arts of Greece Who before Nero was declared the best charioteer and the finest player on the guitar From Naples he went to An tium  his native city and there dis played the same pomp and ceremony But Rome was the place where his pride was to appear in all its grandeur A long procession led the way His crowns of victory in the various games glittered to the eye and inscriptions in glaring letters blazoned forth the fame of Nero the first Â 38 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen Roman who gained the prize of theatrical v xvi Â   talents Festive songs and thanksgiving hymns were sung not to Jupiter A the guardian god of Rome but to Apollo the deity of singers and harpers The tri umphal car in which Augustus had been seen was brought forth on the occasion That

streets resounded with acclamations Io Victory  Victory in the Olympic the Pythian and the Isthmian games Io the conqueror of Greece Happy the people who heard that melodious voice  Victims were slain incense rose to heaven and flowers i covered all the way  Nero returned to his palace Pomp and splendour were at an end the scenes of vanity passed away and he was left at leisure to think and to be wretched He lius had told him that the conjuncture was big with danger Plots insurrections and conspiracies filled his mind with dreadful OF THE ANNALS 339 apprehensions A conspiracy k beyond appen all question was actually formed and â Â ready to break out had it not been dis 82i  covered by a trifling accident It hap Â Â â pened that one of the conspirators  towards the close of day passed by the theatre He saw in one of the porticos a man loaded with fetters and in bitterness of heart bewailing his unhappy lot Upon enquiry it was found that he was to be led into the presence of Nero which he considered as sure destruction The con spirator was touched with compassion He drew nearer to the prisoner and to assuage his fears whispered in his ear  Have a  good heart live till to morrow and you  will have reason to thank me as your de  liverer These were words of comfort to a wretch who expected instant death His hopes revived such welcome tidings filled him with delight and wonder but wonder was the strongest emotion The novelty of an incident so unexpected fixed his attention By what means was he to be delivered from impending ruin No thing but a dark conspiracy could bring about such an event He resolved to re 240 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVf atpen veal all he knew The merit of a disco B XVL  Â â Â very made m time would not only secure 8si his life but lead on to fortune He de A d y 6S sired to be conducted to the prince The conspirator was immediately seized and put to the torture His courage was for some time undaunted unsubdued He denied the whole of the charge But pro Li tracted misery was too much to bear His resolution failed The names of his accomplices were extorted by the violence of pain and all were condemned to suffer A scene of blood was laid and Nero s su perstition ascribed the discovery of the plot to the miraculous interposition of the gods Having conquered his enemies and se cured the future tranquillity of his reign he thought it time to give a loose to his li bidinous passions and pursue his theatri cal amusements For this purpose he re moved to Naples the place of perfect se curity and the seat of pleasure His hal cyon days were soon interrupted A storm had been for some time gathering in Gaul and threatened at length to shake the em OF THE ANNALS 24 pire to its foundation There was in that appen B XVI part of the empire a native of the coun C r j try descended from the kings of Aqui m tain by name m Julius Vindex His fa 68 ther had been raised by Claudius to the dignity of a senator and the son was made governor of a province with the rank and powers of a Roman propraetor This man without an army under his command and without any resources except what he found in his own personal courage and the generous ardour of an independent spirit undertook to free the world from bondage He knew that an enterprise so bold and daring required the co operation of the provinces of Gaul and the Roman legions With that view he sent dispatches to G al ba w at that time governor of the nether most Spain and made him a tender of the imperial dignity Galba deduced his pe digree from the ancient family of the Sul picii his mother by her paternal line was descended from Mummius the conqueror of Corinth and by her mother s side from Quintus Catulus the pride and ornament of the old republic He was consul under Tiberius in the year of Rome seven hun _ VOL IV R 242 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen dred and eighty He commanded in Ger many in the reign of Caligula and after wards under Claudius was proconsul of Africa His illustrious birth his military fame and high credit with the legions in every army pointed him out as the proper person to depose a prince whose cruelty made him detestable and whose folly ren dered even tyranny itself ridiculous Galba received the dispatches sent by Vindex with the frigid caution of a man far advanced in life He was more than seventy years old and that age is not the season of am bition To slide in quiet through the re mainder of his days seemed to be all that he desired from fortune but under that outward calm the sparks of a dying pas sion were rekindled And yet the enter prise proposed to him was big with danger and the issue doubtful Prudence con spired with indolence and he remained silent and inactive The governors of all the other provinces had been in like man ner solicited to enter into the Gallic league they hated Nero  but instead of declaring open hostility they thought it mere advisable to provide for their own OF THE ANNALS 24S safety by sending to Rome the letters appen J J    B XVI which they had received from Vindex â y Â j Galba suppressed his in silence Nero re A8 i c ceived the news with joy and exultation 68 His finances he said were well nigh ex hausted and the forfeited estates of the insurgents would be ways and means by which he intended to fill his treasury He considered Galba s silence as a proof of guilt Without further enquiry he con fiscated all his property at Rome and dis patched assassins with orders to put him to death Vindex in the mean time exerted him self with unremitting vigour to rouse the people of Gaul He went to the various cities and lighted up the flame of war in every quarter He called a public con vention of the states and harangued the assembly in substance as follows o We  live he said not under laws

deputies inflamed with ardour in the cause of liberty returned to their respective cities a warlike spirit was kindled in the mass of the people  a league was formed and the din of arms was heard in every part of the country Galba was informed of all that passed He also knew that he was proscribed by Nero and that his effects were sold by public auction 246 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen The tide of affairs rushed on with a swell b xvi  Â y o that overpowered a mind by nature indo A U C 821 lent and enfeebled by age In the num 68 berof Galba s friends Titus Vinius was the only person that endeavoured to rouse his drooping spirit To hesitate in such a juncture appeared to him a privation of mind nothing short of madness The only question he said was which was most eligi ble to act in conjunction with Vindex or to wage war against him  against a man who wished to depose a tyrant and call to the succession a prince who possessed the virtues of humanity Galba saw the necessity of taking a decided part but his natural irresolution was not easily conquer ed He wished to sound the inclinations of the people and for that purpose sum moned a grand council to meet at New Carthage p in order as he pretended to settle the manumission of slaves His friends knew that greater matters were in agitation and accordingly spread a gene ral alarm On the day appointed an in credible

would assist the orator and inflame the passions of his audience He began his harangue without the usual approaches of a studied introduction The business was of the first importance and he rushed into it at once with warmth and vehemence He painted forth the horrors of Nero s reign the acts of oppression that laid waste the provinces and the murders that thinned the noblest families If proofs

to him he found OF THE ANNALS 251 himself called in a style of contempt 0e appkm nobarbus w and a vile comedian Enrag ed at the indignity offered to his talents he started up in a sudden fury overturned the banqueting table wrote to the senate to exert the strength of the empire and to fire them with indignation added in pa thetic terms  Judge yourselves conscript  fathers judge of the insolence of Vindex  in his own words see the malignity of  that audacious rebel He has dared im  piously to say that I have a bad voice  and play ill on the guitar A complamt of that importance could not fail to make an impression on the fathers They passed a decree declaring Galba a public enemy and promising a reward of ten millions of sesterces for the head of Vindex The Gaul with superior magnanimity offered his own head x to whoever should bring him that of Nero If he freed the world from a monster he set no value on his own life he then would die content Virginius Rufus who at that time com manded on the Upper Rhine had received orders to take the field against the rebels 252 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen in Gaul Whether that officer aspired to B XVL  â  the imperial dignity seems to be a pro blem not solved by any of the historians It is certain that the legions seeing the mi series occasioned by Nero s tyranny and at length disgusted by the contemptible frolics of an emperor who rendered it ridi culous to obey him made a tender of the empire to their own general whom they respected for his military talents and the virtues of moderation Virginius declined the offer If he nourished ambition in his heart he thought it best to suppress it in that juncture and wait for future events It belonged he said to the senate and the senate only not to the legions to dispose of the sovereignty Whatever were his views he still retained a true Roman spi rit and with indignation saw a rebel chieftain and his conquered countrymen joined in a league to give an emperor to the mistress of the world He resolved to collect his forces and march in quest of the enemy Gaul was far from acting with a spirit of union Internal dissen sions divided the states into contending factions The Sequani y the iEdui and OF THE ANNALS 255 Arvemi followed the banners of Vindex appem B XV L The Lingones and the people of Rheims accustomed to slavery and hating the op posite party declared for Nero The cities of Vienne and Lyons which lay contigu ous renewed their ancient animosity the former listing on the side of Vindex the latter with a pretended regard for their oath of fidelity espousing the cause of Nero In that disposition of the public mind Virginius entered Gaul at the head of his legions with a strong reinforcement of Belgic auxiliaries and the Batavian co horts He proceeded by rapid marches to Vesontium z a city in league with Vin dex The inhabitants refused to open their gates Virginius pitched his camp determined to lay siege to the place Vin dex advanced to the relief of his confede rates The two armies were in sight of each other The Gallic chieftain little doubting that the Roman general s opinion of Nero coincided with his own thought it prudent before he tried the issue of a battle to negociate by his deputies He accordingly made his overtures Various messengers passed between the two com 254 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI B XVI appen manders and an interview at last took place The result was an agreement of some kind but what were the terms it is fruitless now to enquire History has left us in the dark All that can be related with certainty is that Virginius began to withdraw his forces and V index with his army made his approach to the walls of the town The legions saw the motions of the enemy and imagining that they meant to offer battle resolved to begin the attack The armies of the Upper and Lower Rhine were not enured to discipline Fierce and disdaining all controul they wanted no or ders from their general A desperate en gagement followed The Gauls were un prepared but their courage braved every danger Both sides fought with impetu ous fury the Gauls resenting the treachery of their enemies the Romans stimulated by their inveterate animosity Blood and carnage covered all the plain The legions cut their way with dreadful slaughter till the Gauls having lost no less than twenty thousand of their bravest troops and see ing inevitable destruction on every side betook themselves to flight Vindex ex OF THE ANNALS 255 erted himself in every quarter of the field appen v X u v xrr B XVI to prevent the massacre but his efforts were in vain He saw the slaughter of his 82i   A D people and concluded that Virginius had es betrayed him and the cause of liberty His enterprise defeated and no hopes of conquest left he resolved not to survive a calamity so unexpected He fell upon his sword and died on the field of battle Meanwhile all Spain was in commotion Galba was employed in schemes of future grandeur He raised a new legion mus tered forces in all quarters and with his utmost art and industry allured the differ ent states to his interest Cornelius Fus cus a young man of illustrious birth went over to Galba and drew with him the pro vince of which he was governor But the great accession of strength was from Lusi tania Otho who had been the favourite of Nero and his constant companion in all his scenes of riot and debauchery had been for some years at the head of that province He was appointed to that sta tion as the reader may remember aa un der colour of doing him honour but in 256 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen fact to remove a rival whom Nero dread B XVI u jed and to leave him at a distance from A U C mi  Rome in a state of honourable banish es ment Otho considered himself as no bet ter than a state prisoner in a remote part of the empire Resentment prompted him to revenge and ambition like his was eager to come forth from obscurity and act a principal part on the great stage of public business He melted down all his massy gold and silver and having con verted it into coin went with his whole treasure and the forces of his province to support the enterprise of an old man who he knew in the course of nature could not long enjoy the supreme authority The other governors and propraetors followed his example The Roman empire seemed to be transferred to Spain Nero was at last sensible of his danger He ordered the legions in Illyricum to advance by ra pid marches into Italy he recalled the troops that had been sent against the Al banians to the borders of the Caspian Sea and he expected the fourteenth legion then in Britain to come without loss of time to his assistance Distracted by the OF THE ANNALS 257 news that filled all Italy he forgot his by appk draulic organ and returned to Rome co ADC vered with consternation His fears were iti soon dispersed Letters from Virginius â Rufus arrived at Rome The death of Vin dex and the total overthrow of his army transported Nero beyond all bounds of joy He called for his musical instru ments he tuned his harp and warbled songs of triumph In Spain the minds of men were affected in a very different manner Galba saw an unexpected reverse of fortune He blamed his own imprudence and accused the folly of an old man who at the close of life was weak enough to listen to the call of ambition To try if possible to retrieve his affairs he sent dispatches to Virgi nius Rufus inviting him to a participation of councils and of future grandeur The offer was rejected It was a maxim with Rufus that the senate and people had the sole right of creating an emperor The civil power he said in every well consti tuted government ought to be supreme to obey is the virtue of a soldier Galba VOL iv s 258 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen had no resource left Half his cavalry 1 shewed themselves alienated from his ser vice and were retained with difficulty Dejected hopeless and expecting certain destruction from the assassins employed by Nero he retired to the city of Clunia bb y and there relapsed into his former indo lence XIII Nero was now at the summit of his wishes He triumphed in the pride of his imagination over all his enemies He had seen on his way from Naples a monu mental sculpture representing a Gaul a overcome by a Roman soldier and dragged along the ground by the hair of his head The gods he said presented that object to him as an omen of victory and their decree was happily fulfilled Amidst all his fran tic joy his worst enemies were in his own breast His vices were undermining him with the army as well as the people He raised immoderate supplies of money and squandered the whole with wild profusion An occurrence happened by which the city was thrown into a violent ferment A ship arrived from Alexandria supposed to OF THE ANNALS 259 be loaded with corn and therefore matter appen B XVI of joy to the populace who dreaded a dearth of provisions It may be easily imagined what a turn their passions took when it was known that the vessel brought a freight of sand b from the banks of the Nile to smooth the arena for wrestlers and gladiators The disappointment excited at first a laugh of scorn and indignation vulgar wit and scurrilous jests made Nero an object of contempt and from con tempt the transition to hatred rage and fury is always sure and often instanta neous The public clamour was loud and violent the people with one voice wished to be delivered from a monster they la mented the loss of Vindex and the prae torian guards who had been the support of a pernicious reign began to murmur dis content and to shew manifest symptoms of disaffection Nymphidius and Tigellinus c who had often figured in scenes of public iniquity were joint praefects of the praetorian camp The former as has been mentioned was the son of a woman who prostituted her person s 2 260 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen to the slaves and freedraen of the emperor B XVl Claudius Having recommended himself by his vices to the favour of Nero he had the ambition to be thought the issue of an intrigue between his mother Nymphidia and Caligula Nymphidius and his col league Tigellinus acted in concert and jointly exerted their pernicious talents They saw the disposition of the soldiers and with the ingratitude of men who had raised themselves by their crimes thought the opportunity fair to strike a stroke of perfidy They began by bribes to insi nuate themselves into the affections of the praetorian guards and when they had suf ficiently prepared them for a revolt whis pered to the senate that Nero was de serted on every side that he had not a friend left and that by consequence the whole legislative authority was in the hands of the fathers That assembly remained for some time in suspense timid waver ing and irresolute The conjuncture was dark and gloomy Nero was alarmed  he paused from his pleasures and saAv that some deep design was m agitation To prevent it by one bold effort he formed a OF THE ANNALS 261 resolution to massacre the senate and after appen B XVI setting fire to the city a second time to let loose his whole collection of wild beasts to devour the people in the general conster nation and save himself by flying into Egypt This horrible scheme was no sooner conceived than brought to light by one of his favourite eunuchs This mis creant had been for some time subservient to the vices of his master and lived with him in the dearest intimacy From a per son so beloved nothing was concealed lie was the confidential friend of the emperor not only in scenes of riot but also in the most important councils But the jealousy of an upstart raised above his base condi tion is easily alarmed The favourite d thought himself slighted His pride was roused and to revenge the injury he dis covered the particulars of the intended massacre A design so black and horrible raised the general indignation  The fathers trem bled for themselves but the habit of slavery had debased their faculties They saw that no time was to be lost and yet could not 262 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen resolve to act with vigour Nymphidius B XVI  tried by every means to inspire them with zeal and courage He had seduced the praetorian guards and to secure their af fections promised in Galba s name but without his authority a reward of thirty thousand sesterces to each praetorian and five thousand to each legionary soldier throughout the armies of the empire a sum so prodigious that as Plutarch ob serves it could not be raised without worse tyranny and more violent rapine than had been felt during the whole reign of Nero The promise proved afterwards fatal to Galba but served the purposes of a man who was bent on the ruin of Nero and by raising the military above the civil au thority intended to introduce into the po litical system two pernicious maxims the first that emperors were to be created in the camp not in the senate and se condly that the imperial dignity was ve nal to be for the future set up to sale and disposed of by the soldiers to the highest bidder Having settled his measures and laid OF THE ANNALS Â 33 the plan of a revolution he did not as yet appei     B xvr think it time to throw off the mask but to â   A U C complete his work chose to proceed by sai fraud and dissimulation Pie went with â Tigellinus to the palace and with an air of deep affliction informed Nero of his danger  All he said  is lost the  people assembled in seditious tumults  call aloud for vengeance the praetorian  guards abandon your cause and the se  nate is ready to pronounce a dreadful  judgment You have only one expe  dient left and that is to make your  escape and seek a retreat in Eg pt In this manner the two men who had been raised from the dregs of the people left their benefactor In all his scenes of vice and cruelty they had been his chief abet tors and they now abandoned him at his utmost need Nero saw the sad reverse of his affairs From his armies he could expect no sup port The troops on their march towards the Caspian sea had been recalled but a long repose was necessary to revive the Spirits of men well nigh exhausted by in 264 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen cessant fatigue The legions from Illyri p XVl    O u v j cum returned with alienated minds Scorn A U C   82i mg to disguise their sentiments they sent Â s a deputation to Virginius on the Upper Rhine expressing their ardent desire that he would yield to the request of the le gions under his command and accept the imperial dignity Eight Batavian cohorts had shewn a spirit of disaffection and the praetorian guards were under the influence of Nymphidius In this desperate situa tion Nero looked round for assistance but he looked in vain He wandered through the apartments of his palace and all was solitude He who but a few days before was the god of the senate and the people was now in dread of being their victim Conscience began to exercise her rights Her voice was heard Nero re viewed his crimes and shuddered with hor ror and remorse He repeated in despair and anguish of heart a line which when personating QEdipus he had often de claimed on the public stage e  My wife  my father and my mother doom me  dead Of all his courtier fry and all his instruments of guilt not one adhered OF THE ANNALS 2 65 to him in the hour of distress except Spo appkw l B XVI rus the eunuch Phaon  an enfran v n â A I C cliised slave and Epaphroditus his secre Â ii tarj He gave orders to the soldiers on es duty to proceed with all expedition to Os tia and prepare a ship that he might em bark for Egypt The men were not willing to obey One of them asked him in half a line g from Virgil  Is it then so wretch  ed a thing to die  He went to the Ser vilian gardens carrying with him a vial of swift speeding poison which had been pre pared by the well known h Locusta but his resolution failed He returned to his chamber and threw himself on his bed The agitations of his mind allowed no rest He started up and called for some friendly hand to end his wretched being That of fice no one was willing to perform and he himself wanted fortitude Driven to the last despair and frantic with remorse and fear he cried out in doleful accents  My  friends desert me and I cannot find an  enemy He rushed forth from his pa lace as if with intent to throw himself into the Tiber He changed his mind and thought of flying into Spain there to sur 266 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI B XVI appen render at discretion to the mercy of Gaiba But no ship was ready at Ostia Various projects presented themselves to his mind in quick succession increasing the tumult of his passions and serving only to distract him more To try his powers of eloquence â was another expedient that occurred to him For that purpose he proposed to go forth in a mourning garb to the forum and there by a pathetic speech obtain his par don from the people Should their obdu rate hearts remain impenetrable to the soft influence of persuasive oratory and refuse to reinstate their emperor in the full enjoy ment of his prerogative he had no doubt but he could at the worst wring from them the government of Egypt where in the character of praefect he might give free scope to his inordinate passions This project seemed to promise success but a ray of reflection struck him with sudden horror The populace without waiting to hear the divine accents of that harmonious voice might break out into open sedition and in their fury tear their prince limb from limb What course could he pursue  Where could he hide himself He looked OF THE ANNALS 2 57 round in wild despair and asked his re APPEx maming companions Is there no lurking u vâ place  no safe recess where I may have mi  â AD time to consider what is to be done  Phaon cs his freedman proposed to conduct him to an obscure villa i which he held in his possession at the distance of about four miles from Rome Nero embraced the offer There was no time to be lost He went forth in all his wretchedness without a shoe to his feet nothing on him but his close tunic no outside garment and no imperial robe In order to disguise himself he snatched an old rusty cloak and throwing it over his shoulders covered his head and held a handkerchief before his face In that condition he mounted his horse submit ting with a dastard spirit to an ignomini ous flight without any attendants except Phaon the freedman Epaphroditus the secretary and Sporus the eunuch with another whose name Aurelius Victor says was Neophytus In this manner Nero passed the last of his nights At the dawn of day the praetorian guards deserted their 268 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI APPEN station at the palace and joined their B XVI comrades in the camp where by the influence and direction of Nymphidius Galba was proclaimed emperor The se nate met and after a short debate con firmed the nomination of the praetorian guards The time was at length arrived when that assembly could act with au thority They resolved to mark the day by a decree worthy of a Roman senate With one voice they declared the tyrant who had trampled on all laws human and divine a public enemy k and by their sentence condemned him to suffer death according to the rigour of ancient laws and the practice of the old republic XIV Nero in the mean time made the best of his way towards the freedman s villa He heard the praetorian camp ring with acclamations and the name of Galba sounded in his ear A man at work in a field adjoining to the road started up at the sound of horsemen pressing forward with expedition and behold he said  Those people are hot in pursuit of Nero Another asked  What do they say of OF THE ANNALS 269  Nero in the city  As they drew near appen J r J B XVL to Phaon s house Nero was alarmed by a w y sudden accident His horse started at a sÂ i A i dead carcass that lay on the side of the â road and the veil in consequence of the violent motion falling from his face a veteran who had been dismissed from the service knew his master and saluted him by his name The fear of being detected made the fugitive prince and his followers push forward with their utmost speed Be ing arrived at a small distance from the house they did not think it safe to enter it in a public manner Nero dismounted and crossed a field overgrown with reeds  Phaon advised him to lie concealed in a sand pit till he prepared a subterraneous passage into the house That said Nero were to bury myself alive He scooped up some water out of a muddy ditch and having allayed his thirst asked in a dole ful tone  Is that the beverage to which  Nero has been used  An opening was made in the wall on one side of the man sion and Nero crept through it He was conducted to a chamber where he saw nothing but wretchedness In that mean 270 APPENlMX TO BOOK XVI appev room he threw himself on a meaner bed w B XVI  v J w v te and asked for some nourishment They A U C mi  offered him bread but it was so black A D 68 that his stomach sickened at the sight The water was foul but thirst obliged him to swallow the nauseous draught His friends saw that no hope was left they dreaded his impending ruin and advised him to rescue himself by one manly deed from an ignominious death Nero signi fied his assent but he studied delay fond to linger still in life Preparations for his funeral were necessary He ordered a trench to be dug suited to the dimensions of his body n a quantity of wood to be collected for the funeral pile and pieces of marble to be brought to form a decent covering for his grave He bewailed his unhappy lot tears gushed at intervals he heaved a piteous sigh and said to his friends o  What a musician the world  will lose I During this scene of delay and coward ice a messenger according to Phaon s or ders arrived with papers from Rome Nero seized the packet He read with OF THE ANNALS  271 eagerness and found himself not only de appen B XVI clared a public enemy but condemned to suffer death with the rigour of ancient usage He asked What kind of death is that  and what is ancient usage  He was told that by the law of the old republic every traitor with his head fastened between two stakes and his body entirely naked suffered the pains of a slow death under the lictor s rod The fear of that ignominious punishment inspired Nero with a short lived passion which for the moment had the ap pearance of courage He drew two daggers which he had brought with him and as if meditating some prodigious deed tried the points of both then calmly replaced them in their scabbards saying  The fatal rao  ment is not yet come He turned to Sporus and requested him to begin the funeral lamentation  Sing the melan  choly dirge  and offer the last obsecfuies  to your friend He cast his eyes around him And why he said why will not some one dispatch himself and teach me how to die  He paused for a moment and shed a flood of tears He started up and cried out in a tone of wild despair  Nero 272 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI B XVI this is infamy  3011 linger in disgrace   this is no time for dejected passions the  moment calls for manly fortitude Those words were no sooner uttered than he heard the sound of horses advanc ing with speed towards the house This he signified by repeating a line from Homer p The fact was the senate had given orders that he should be brought back to Rome to undergo the judgment which they had pronounced and the offi cers charged with that commission were near at hand Nero seized his dagger and stabbed himself in the throat The stroke was too feeble  Epaphroditus lent his assistance and the next blow was a mortal wound A centurion entered the room and seeing Nero in a mangled con dition ran immediately to his assistance preftnding that he came with a friendly hand to bind the wound and save the em peror s life Nero had not breathed his last He raised his languid eyes and faintly said  You come too late is this  your fidelity q  He spoke and expired The ferocity of his nature was still visible OF THE ANNALS 073 in his countenance His eyes fixed ancUwEN 1 â r B XVI glaring and every feature swelled with â râ â

consented that Nero s body should be committed to the flames at the place where he died The funeral rites were performed without delay and with out pomp His remains were conveyed to the monumental

obsequies were performed vâ vJ was the cause of some untoward conse A 82i C quences that afterwards disturbed the 68 commonwealth A doubt remained in the minds of many whether Nero had not made his escape into Asia or Egypt The men who under a corrupt and profligate reign had led a life of pleasure and were by consequence enamoured of Nero s vices paid every mark of respect to his memory willing at the same time to be lieve that he still survived They raised a tomb and for several years u dressed it with the flowers of spring and summer The Parthians honoured his memory and being afterwards deluded by an impostor who assumed the name of Nero were ready with the strength of their nation w to espouse his cause The race of Caesars ended with Nero he was the last and per haps the worst of

the marble scep tre fell from the hands of Augustus By these and such like denunciations the will of the gods was supposed to be revealed and the populace with frantic joy hailed the auspicious aera of returning liberty But no public spirit remained every vir tue was extinguished A people who had been taught to crouch under the yoke of bondage thought no more of a free con stitution With the usual inconstancy of a fickle multitude they relapsed into their habitual servitude and in a strain of fran tic rapture began to roar for a new master The name of Galba echoed through thfc t2 276 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI bTxvi streets of Rome and filled the praetorian camp with shouts of joy and the warmest expressions of zeal and ardour for his ser vice The praetorian guards thought of no thing but the donative promised in his name  and Nymphidius the author of that measurej had no doubt but the soldiers in due time would shew themselves devoted to the man who filled their minds with the dazzling prospect of reward so truly great and magnificent The liberality was his and the difficulty of carrying it into execu tion would fall on Galba Icelus the favourite freedman of Galba made it his business to see Nero s dead body and having enabled himself to be an eye witness of the fact set out for Clu nia in Spain b to inform his master that he was raised to the imperial seat by the voice of the praetorians and the concur rent decree of the senate Nymphidius seized the opportunity to figure as the prin cipal actor on the theatre of public busi ness He had accomplished a great and sudden revolution and being high in fa vour with the praetorian guards found it OF THE ANNALS 277 easy to overawe the senate and make that appen B VVL tame and pliant assembly bend to his will and pleasure The consuls without con sulting the arrogant minister sent their dispatches to Galba with the decree by which he was declared emperor This was considered by this new man as a mark of disrespect c and it was with difficulty that the magistrates appeased his indigna tion Flushed with success and proud of his exploits he began to enlarge his views and preposterously to form schemes of vast ambition Under an emperor of the age of seventy three d worn out with cares and weary of public business he flattered himself that he should be able under the appearance of being the second in the state to wrest into his own hands the su preme authority and should Galba s in firmities sink under the fatigue of a long journey he had the hardiness to aspire to the succession Having conceived this mad project he resolved to remove every obstacle and with that view compelled Tigellinus to resign his commission e of praetorian praefect A colleague acting with himself in joint authority might re 578 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen tard the execution of his designs Men of i v j consular rank who had commanded ar 82i  mies and governed provinces did not 68  blush to pay their court to him The se

and Nymphidius effectually to se duce the vulgar mind encouraged the madness of the times The images and statues of Nero were dragged through the streets and dashed to pieces A crew of vile incendiaries spread consternation through the city  a scene of blood and massacre followed g and the innocent fell in one promiscuous carnage with the guilty Mauricus beheld the phrensy of the multitude with such inward horror that he could not help saying in the senate  Let us take care that we have not reason  to regret the loss of Nero h Nymphidius soon perceived that his hopes of being the only statesman in pow er and of governing the Roman world in OF THE ANNALS 279 the emperor s name could not be enter appen      â  TT B XVI tamed with any prospect or success He knew by certain intelligence that Vinius Laco and Icelus were the men  who stood highest in the esteem of Galba The scheme of supplanting them was there fore abandoned but it made way for a project of the most daring ambition He was resolved to depose the emperor whom he himself had created and by another revolution to seize the imperial dignity To forward this design he sent dispatches to Galba A stating the danger of entering the city at a time when the whole empire was in convulsions Rome he said was in a ferment Clodius Macer excited a re bellion in Africa the German armies were disaffected and the legions in Syria and Judaea prepared to dispute with the prae torian guards the right of creating an em peror In the mean time a dark con spiracy was formed Nymphidius planned his measures with dispatch and vigour de termined to seize the supreme power He drew into his league a number of both sexes all of great consideration and ex tensive influence Claudius Celsus was his 280 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appfn intimate friend but he saw the folly of B XVI the enterprise and with freedom and sin cerity advised Nymphidius to desist from a wild attempt in which he could not ex pect the support of the people or the se nate There is not he said a single fa mily in Rome willing to give the name of Caesar I to the son of Nymphidia That remonstrance had no effect on a mind in flamed with the fever of wild ambition Nymphidius called a meeting of his par ty All agreed that no time was to be lost They resolved to strike the blow that very night and to conduct Nymphidius to the praetorian camp where they had no doubt but with one voice he would be declared emperor of Rome On such an occasion it was necessary that the person raised to that elevation should be prepared to ad dress the soldiers in a suitable style Cin gonius Varro m a corrupt and venal ora tor composed a speech for that purpose and the illiterate emperor was to grace himself with borrowed eloquence The design of the conspirators was not so well concealed but it reached the ear OF THE ANNALS 281   of Antonius Honoratus n a tribune inAPPE the camp who had acquired a great mili r J tary character and was besides respected as for his unblemished honour and unshaken 68 fidelity Towards the close of day he called a meeting of the praetorians and after laying open in detail all the cir cumstances of the plot delivered a speech in substance as follows o  How long my  fellow soldiers shall our folly our mad  ness or our evil genius hurry us on  from one treason to another  A few days  only have elapsed since you deposed  Nero In that business you behaved like fi men who felt for the public good You  had every provocation and the crimes M of that flagitious tyrant justified the act  You are recent from that revolution and â wherefore do you want another  You â declared for Galba and why now aban i don him  Why with unheard of trea  chery betray the emperor whom you  yourselves created  Has he been guilty  of parricide  Has he murdered his mother  and destroyed his wife  Has he exposed  the imperial dignity to contempt and ri M dicule  Has he tuned his harp on the 282 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appfn  stage or driven a curricle in the race   And yet notwithstanding all the flagi tious deeds of that hardened monster in spite of all his vices we supported him  blushing indeed for his follies and smart  ing under his tyranny We adhered to  him with fidelity  and if in the end we  thought fit to create another emperor  Nymphidius was the author of that mea  sure By his artifices we were taught  to believe that Nero deserted us first  and fled to Egypt We concluded that  he had abdicated and by consequence  what we did was an act of necessity  And what is our design at present  What  do we wish  What do we aim at  Must  Galba fall a sacrifice to appease the  manes of Nero  Shall a descendant from  the family of the Servii a relation of  Quintus Catulus and by ties of affinity  connected with Livia p the wife of  Augustus  say my fellow soldiers shall  such a man be deposed and murdered to  make way for the son of Nymphidia   It was his treachery his base ingratitude  that occasioned the death of Nero  let  him suffer the justice due to his crime OF THE ANNALS 283 and let us give proof of our fidelity Let appen b xv r  us deserve the esteem of Galba by de  livering him from a traitor Aa2i A 1 6S This speech made an impression on the soldiers One mind one sentiment per vaded the whole camp Galba was their emperor and they would acknowledge no other This was followed by a general shout Nymphidius heard the sound and proceeded to the camp q Whether he thought that the acclamations of the men were in his favour or that his presence was necessary to quell an insurrection cannot now be known He went attended by a numerous train and a blaze of torches with the speech composed for him by Cin gbnius Varro ready in his hand to be read aloud to the soldiers The gates of the camp were shut and guards were stationed on the ramparts Nymphidius desired to know by whose order they were under arms  The men answered with one voice We are armed in the cause of Galba and we know no other emperor Nymphidius had not the prudence to retire from the walls Dissimulation he thought would â 284 APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI appen cloak his design He commended the xeal TÂ YV 1  of the praetorians and assured them that he and his followers were the avowed friends of Galba The sentinels opened the gates Nymphidius entered with some of his friends the pass was immediately secured and the soldiers attacked him sword in hand He endeavoured to save himself in a tent but was pursued and massacred on the spot His body on the following day was dragged through the camp a spectacle

inauspicious in the open ing of a new reign The cruelty of Nero seemed to be renewed when the people expected a milder government and a re n gular administration of law and justice The fate of Turpilianus filled the city with murmurs of discontent It was known that Tigellinus presided at the execution  and that a man of worth and honour should bleed under the eye of a detested mis creant

to death by his order Betuus Chilo met with the same fate in Gaul Dispatches were also sent to Garrucianus in Africa commanding the immediate ex ecution of Clodius Macer e the proprae tor of the province who was known to have concerted measures for a revolt It happened however that Calvia Crispi nilla f the famous manager of Nero s pleasures arrived in Africa and insinuated herself into the secret councils of the go vernor By her advice he formed a reso OE THE ANNALS 287 lution to establish for himself a new appe province independent of Rome Their u vo scheme for that purpose was to lay

eve of renouncing all subjection to Rome when Papirius a centurion sent by order of Galba gained access to his presence and stabbed him to the heart Fonteius Capito g who commanded the legions on the Lower Rhine was put to death about the same time It was this officer that sent Julius Civilis h a prisoner to Rome during the reign of Nero The charge was without foundation and in time was the fatal cause of the destruc tive war in which Rome was involved by the fierce resentment of that warlike chief Avarice was the vice of Capito He was in haste to grow rich and felt no scruple about the means

make your defence in his  presence The soldier obeyed and was sent to execution This transaction was reported to Fabius Valens i who com manded a legion in Lower Germany an officer of acknowledged ability intrepid active and ambitious  eager in the pursuit of honours and panting to signalize himself by some bold exploit The opportunity now occurred and he resolved to seize it Crispinus a centurion k was devoted to his service In that man he found a ready assassin and Fonteius Capito fell a victim The death of that commander Valens con cluded would be considerable merit with the new emperor He lost no time but sent an express to inform Galba of what he had done with zeal for the service of his sovereign He added in the same let ter that the legions on the Upper Rhine had made a

all danger in that quarter he invited him to an amicable interview having secretly ap pointed Hordeonius Flaccus to succeed to the command of the legions The strata gem succeeded The conqueror of Vindex went to the meeting and found himself the dupe of pretended friendship He met with a cold reception very different from what was due to the man who wished to establish the civil authority and to place the legis lative power of the state in the senate only He lived to be a spectator of the distrac tions and calamities that followed and that he was not an actor in those scenes of blood and

played all the magnificence of Nero s court Galba still preserved his rules of ancient frugality and condemned the vain parade n with inflexible rigour He shew ed himself ready to punish and slow to re ward In his manners no affability no en gaging courtesy During the whole of his march he never once endeavoured by an act of condescension to gain the affections of the people The army in Italy

the summer in the wide parts of the city which lie open to the sun than in the narrow places where the inhabitants are shaded from the intense heat vol iv 3 B  370 NOTES ON THE Section XLIV a The beds on which the gods and goddesses were extended at all public festivals were called Lectistemia See Livy lib v 8 13 b Brotier observes that the Jews in that period of time were guilty of great enormities  and the distinc tion between them and the Christians not being under stood all were considered in the same light despised and hated by the Romans c This was the first persecution of the Christians Nero the declared enemy of human kind waged war against a religion which has since diffused the light of truth and humanised the savages of Europe It is true as Suetonius relates that Claudius banished the Jews who were raising seditious tumults at the instigation of one Chrestus That name it is almost needless to ob serve cannot at least ought not to be confounded with Jesus Christ  who it was well known at Rome had suffered under Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius Chrestus Brotier observes was not an uncommon name among the Greeks and Romans When the Jews were ordered by Claudius to depart from Rome all of that nation who professed themselves followers of Christ were without distinction included in the num ber The edict of the emperor was not pointed against the Christians Nero appears to be the first that attack ed them as the professors of a new religion and when such a man as Tacitus calls It a dangerous superstition exitiubilis superstitio it must be allowed that indirectly an apology is made for Nero But for Tacitus who had opportunities for a fair enquiry and ability to know and decide what excuse can be offered  The vices of the FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS 371 Jews were imputed to the Christians without discrimina tion and Tacitus suffered himself to be hurried away by the torrent of popular prejudice And yet we find that his friend Pliny during his administration in the pro vince of Bithynia thought and acted with moderation The Christians were under a prosecution Pliny in his character of proconsular governor was in doubt how to proceed He wrote to the emperor Trajan on the sub ject and after stating that the real Christians were not to be forced by any means whatever to renounce the ar ticles of their belief he proceeds to the sum total of their guilt which he found to be as follows They met on a stated day before it was light and addressed themselves in a prayer or hymn to Christ as to a God binding themselves by a solemn oath not for any wicked purpose but never to commit any fraud theft or adultery never to falsify their word nor deny a trust reposed in them after which it was their custom to separate and then re assemble to eat their meal together in a manner per fectly harmless and inoffensive They desisted says Pliny from this custom after my edict issued according to your order against the holding of any assemblies what ever Affirmabant hanc fuissc summam vel culpa sua vel erroris quod essent solifi stato die ante lucem conve nire carmenque Christo quasi Deo dicere secum invicem seque sacramento rum in scelus aliquod obstringere sed ne furta ne latrocinia ne adulteria coynmitterent ne fidemfallcrent ne depositum appellati abnegarent qui bus peractis morem sibi discedendi fuisse rursusque toeundi ad capiendum cibum promiscuum tamen et nnoxium  quod ipsumfacere desiisse post edidum mcum quo secundum mandata ua lietarias esse vctueram Plin lib x ep 91 Such is the account of the religion which B b 2 â 372 NOTES ON THE Tacitus calls a pernicious superstition Pliny adds in the same letter that in order to come at the real truth he ordered two female slaves to be put to the torture but he could discover nothing more than a rooted and ex cessive superstition Trajan in his answer to this letter determines that if Christians are brought before the governor and proved to be guilty they must be punished unless they renounce their errors and invoke the gods of Rome In that case they were to be pardoned notwith standing any former suspicion But the emperor says to his minister  I would not have you officiously enter into  any enquiries concerning them Pliny s letter Mr Melmoth observes is esteemed as almost the only ge nuine monument of ecclesiastical antiquity relating to the times immediately succeeding the apostles being wrote not above forty years after the death of Paul It was preserved by the Christians themselves as a clear and unsuspicious evidence of the purity of their doctrines It is therefore with good reason says Brotier that Ter tullian in a strain of exultation declares That the Christ ians  for their innocence their probity justice truth  and for the living God were burnt alive The cruelty  ye persecutors  is all your own  the glory is ours Pro tantd innocentid pro tantd probitate pro justitid pro virtute pro Deo vivo cremamur Crudelitas pcstra gloria est nostra d The Jews as will be seen in the History book v s 5 were charged with harbouring a sullen aversion to wards all mankind It is unnecessary to vindicate die

dignity of the human character without emotions of pity and regret But perhaps without any studied com ment the case admits a plain and obvious apology Two eminent men Natalis and Scevinus had been taken into custody At the sight of the rack their resolution failed and they discovered their accomplices Lucan knew that the same engine of cruelty was ready for himself and his two friends Quinctianus and Senecio All three were tempted by a promise of pardon and they endeavoured to earn it by making discoveries Lucan might think that 374  NOTES ON THE his mother a woman who boasted neither rank nor for tune would not among a great number of daring con spirators be deemed an object worthy of notice  and besides the terrors of the rack may conquer the most he  roic mind When the executioner appears with his tor turing engines it is no longer the moment of courage He who in the ranks of war is ready to face every danger may shrink from the pangs prepared for him in a dungeon

to him If you will not confess you must go to the rack The man replied If it must be so I know not whom I may accuse  perhaps some Lord at this board Sound sense says Judge Foster in the mouth of an enthusiast and a ruffian  In the same distress the same hurry and per turbation of spirit Lucan mentioned his mother He might think that she was not of consequence to provoke resentment and the event shewed if he thought so that his conclusion was right Nero affected to forget her She and Seneca s wife were suffered to live For these reasons the conduct of Lucan may admit of some exte nuation  more especially when he had before his eyes the example of senators and men of consular rank But a late writer thinks he has discovered a better ground of defence He denies the fact and says Tacitus has adopted a gross calumhy invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence But it may be asked If Nero framed the story is it probable that a writer who wages an incessant war against evil men and evil deeds would have descended to be the accomplice of a tyrant  Tacitus through the whole of his narrative has FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS 375 done ample justice to all who died with glory to Epi charis the enfranchised slave who displayed her con stancy in defiance of the keenest torture to Seneca â who left an example of unshaken virtue  to Subrius Flavius whose last words to Nero were  I hated you  when you became a coachman a comedian and an  incendiary to Sulpicius Asper the centurion and above all to Lucan himself who died with undaunted courage repeating a passage from his own poem Let it also be remembered that when Lucan s father suffered death in the following year Tacitus says that the son reflected the highest honour on the father grande adju onentum claritudinis The writer who has treated Lucan with so much candour would neither adopt noi invent a calumny to brand his name in the page of history But to conclude this long note  It is by no means probable that Tacitus who wrote in the reign of Trajan not much more than thirty years after the death of Lucan â would hazard a glaring falsehood in the face of his con temporaries  and it is less probable that Mr Hayley at the distance of more than n 30 years should be better informed than the great historian who lived at the very time of the transaction See Poems by William Hayley Esq vol iii

only because she took the liberty to chide him for returning late from the chariot race He had by her a daughter called Claudia Augusta who died in her infancy Suet in Neron s 35 b The first Romans did not burn their dead but interred them according to the custom of other nations Pliny the elder says that the practice of committing the dead to the funeral pile was not introduced till it was known that the bodies of soldiers who died in foreign wars were dug up by the enemy and exposed to public view And yet Plutarch in his Life of Numa observes that Numa was buried pursuant to his own express in junction directing that his body should not be committed to the flames which shews that burning was known at Rome in that early period The custom of burning the dead was held in abhorrence by several nations and ac cording to Herodotus by the Persians as well as the Egyptians Notwithstanding what Plutarch has said Pliny assures us that before Sylla the dictator the bodies of the deceased were always interred by the Romans and that the reason for burning that extraordinary man was because having dug up the body of Marius he was afraid of being treated in the same way himself and therefore ordered his remains to be consumed to ashes Pliny lib vii s 54 The custom of burning at Rome ceased under the Antonines c Besides the spices with which the body of Poppsea was embalmed a prodigious quantity was burnt on the 382 NOTES ON THE occasion insomuch that Pliny says all Arabia did not produce in an entire year as much as was consumed at the funeral of Poppaea Periti rerum

Seneca and the taste of the age encouraged can not be matter of wonder  but to atone for his faults his poem is a treasure of sentiments worthy of a Roman Lucan taught Corneille to think and to
