opposed the greatness and thft last captive who adorned the triumph of Constantine After a tran quil and prosperous reign the Conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire a new capital a new policy and a new religion and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time He will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline VOL II B 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap After the defeat and abdication of Licinius his  victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of Design of a a city destined to reign in future times the mis aTd 324 tress of the East and to survive the empire and re ligion of Constantine The motives whether of pride or of policy which first induced Diocletian to with draw himself from the ancient seat of government had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors and the habits of forty years Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent king doms which had once acknowledged her supremacy and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince born in the neigh bourhood of the Danube educated in the courts and armies of Asia and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain The Italians who had re ceived Constantine as their deliverer submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome but they were seldom honoured with the presence of their new sovereign During the vigour of his age Constantine according to the various exigencies of peace and war moved with slow dignity or with active diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy But as he gradually reached the summit of pros perity and the decline of life he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne In the choice of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of Europe and Asia to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3 treaty With these views Diocletian had selected chap and embellished the residence of Nicomedia but xiv the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church and Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name During the late operations of the war against Licinius he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate both as a soldier and as a statesman the incomparable po sition of Byzantium and to observe how strongly gj it was guarded by nature against a hostile attack whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse Many ages before Con stantine one of the most judicious historians of an tiquity had described the advantages of a situation from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea and the honours of a flourishing and independent republic If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it Description acquired with the august name of Constantinople Â fT â j the figure of the Imperial city may be represented NorLE under that of an unequal triangle The obtuse EErr_ point which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbour and the southern is washed by the Propontis or sea of Marmara The basis of tbe triangle is opposed to the west and ter minates the continent of Europe But the admira ble form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot without a more ample explanation be clearly or sufficiently understood The winding channel through which the waters The Bos of the Euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course pborus towards the Mediterranean received the appellation of Bosphorus a name not less celebrated in the b 2 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap history than in the fables of antiquity  A crowd of temples and of votive altars profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks attested the un skilfulness the terrors and the devotion of the Grecian navigators who after the example of the Argonauts explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus infested by the obscene harpies t and of the sylvan reign of Amycus who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the Cestus The streights of the Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks which according to the description of the poets had once floated on the face of the waters and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbour of Byzantium the winding length of the Bosphorus extends about six teen miles and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half The new castles of Europe and Asia are constructed on either continent upon the foundations of two celebrated temples of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius The old castles a work of the Greek emperors command the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other These fortresses were restored and strengthened by Mahomet the Second when he meditated the siege of Constantinople but the Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant that near two thousand years before his reign Darius  The Bosphorus has been very minutely described by Dionysius of Byzan tium who lived in the time of Dornitian Hudson Geograph Minor torn iii and by Gilles or Gyllius a French traveller of the XVIth century Tournefort tLettre XV seems to have used his own eyes and the learning of Gyllius t There are very few conjectures so happy as that of Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle

drives them into the sea all contribute to form the striking resemblance OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 had chosen the same situation to connect the two chap continents by a bridge of boats At a small distance X1V from the old castles we discover the little town of Chrysopolis or Scutari which may almost be con sidered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople The Bosphorus as it begins to open into the Pro pontis passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks a few years before the former and the blindness of its founders who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast has been stigmatised by a pro verbial expression of contempt The harbour of Constantinople which may be con The port sidered as an arm of the Bosphorus obtained in a very remote period the denomination of the Golden Horn The curve which it describes might be com pared to the horn of a stag or as it should seem with more propriety to that of an ox The epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople The river Licus formed by the conflux of two little streams pours into the harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess As the vicis situdes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas the constant depth of the harbour allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats and it has been observed that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses while their sterns are floating in the water  From the mouth of the Lycus to that of the harbour this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in length The entrance is about five hundred â Procopius de ffidificiis 1 i c 5 â His description is confirmed by modern travellers See Thevenot part i l  i c 15 Tournefort Lcttre XII Nie buhr

Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont the pontis shores 0f Europe and Asia receding on either side inclose the sea of Marmara which was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis The navigation from the issue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the Propontis may at once descry the high lands of Thrace and Bithynia and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus covered with eternal snows f They leave on the left a deep gulf at the bottom of which Ni comedia was seated the imperial residence of Dio cletian and they pass the small islands of Cyzicus and Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Galli poli where the sea which separates Asia from Eu rope is again contracted into a narrow channel The Belief The geographers who with the most skilful accu I ont racy have surveyed the form and extent of the Hel lespont assign about sixty miles for the winding course and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those celebrated streights But the narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the old Turkish castles between the cities of Cestus and Abydus It was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress It was here likewise in a place where  See Ducange C P 1  i part

into Europe a hundred and seventy my riads of barbarians  A sea contracted within such narrow limits may seem but ill to deserve the sin gular epithet of broad which Homer as well as Orpheus has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature the traveller and especially the poet who sailed along the Hellespont who pursued the windings of the stream

seated on an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the Sigaean to the Rhaetean promontory and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon The first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his in vincible Myrmidons and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the other After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and to the ingra titude of the Greeks his sepulchre was erected on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector and the citizens of  See the

honours Before Constantine gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium he had  conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot from whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin The extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy towards the Rhastean promontory and the tomb of Ajax was first chosen for his new capital and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the streights of the Hellespont rfC fST e are at Present qualified to view the advantage tinopie ous position of Constantinople which appears to have been formed by Nature for the centre and capital of a great monarchy Situated in the forty first degree of latitude the Imperial city commanded from her seven hills the opposite shores of Europe and Asia the climate was healthy and temperate the soil fertile the harbour secure and capacious and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defence The Bosphorus and the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of Constantinople and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to the fleets of com merce The preservation of the eastern provinces may in some degree be ascribed to the policy of Constantine as the barbarians of the Euxine who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the Mediterranean soon desisted from the exercise of piracy and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier When the gates of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut the capital still enjoyed within their spacious inclosure every pro duction which could supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous inhabitants The sea coasts OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 9 of Thrace and Bithynia which languish under the chap weight of Turkish oppression still exhibit a rich X1v prospect of vineyards of gardens and of plentiful harvests and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish that are taken in their stated seasons without skill  and almost without labour But

finished statues of the gods and heroes of the sages and poets of ancient times con tributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople and gave occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus who

have been of a circular or rather elliptical form The two op posite entrances formed triumphal arches the porti coes which inclosed it on every side were filled with statues and the centre of the Forum was occupied by a lofty column of which a mutilated fragment is now degraded by the appellation of the burnt pillar This column was erected on a pedestal of white mar ble twenty feet high and

rays glitter ing on his head The Circus or Hippodrome was a stately building about four hundred paces in length and one hundred in breadth The space between the two metce or goals was filled with statues and obelisks and we may still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity the bodies of three serpents twisted into one pillar of brass Their triple heads had once supported the golden tripod which after the defeat of Xerxes was consecrated in the temple of Delphi by the victorious Greeks The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long since defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors but under the similar appellation of Atmeidan it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses From the throne whence the emperor viewed the Circensian games a winding staircase descended to the palace a mag nificent edifice which scarcely yielded to the residence of Rome itself and which together with the de pendent courts gardens and porticoes covered a considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis between the Hippodrome and the church of St Sophia We might likewise celebrate the baths which still retained the name of Zeuxippus after they had been enriched by the

of plebeian habitations Population The populousness of this favoured city was the next and most serious object of the attention of its founder In the dark ages which succeeded the translation of the empire the remote and the imme diate consequences of that memorable event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the Greeks and the credulity of the Latins It was asserted and believed that all the noble families of Rome the senate and the equestrian order with their innumera ble attendants had followed their emperor to the banks of the Propontis that a spurious race of strangers and plebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient capital and that the lands of Italy long since converted into gardens were at once de prived of cultivation and inhabitants In the course of this history such exaggerations will be reduced to their just value yet since the growth of Constan tinople cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of industry it must be admitted that â See the Notitia Rome only reckoned 1780 large houses damns but the word must have had a more dignified signification No insula are mentioned at Constantinople The old capital consisted of 424

were probably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own re sidence The invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from commands and the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedi ence He bestowed on his favourites the palaces which he had built in the several quarters of the city assigned them lands and pensions for the support of their dignity and alienated the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant hereditary estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital But these encouragements and obligations soon became superfluous and were gradually abolished Wherever the seat of government is fixed a considerable part of the public revenue will be expended by the prince himself by his ministers by the officers of justice and by the domestics of the palace The most wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the powerful motives of interest and duty of amusement and curiosity A third and more numerous class of inhabitants will insensibly be formed of servants of artificers and of merchants who derive their subsist ence from their own labour and from the wants or luxury of the superior ranks In less than a century Constantinople disputed with Rome itself the pre eminence of riches and numbers New piles of buildings crowded together with too little regard to health or convenience scarcely allowed the intervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men of horses and of carriages The allotted space of ground was insufficient to contain the increasing people and the additional foundations which on either side were advanced into the sea might alone have composed a very considerable city 16 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap The frequent and regular distributions of wine and XIV oil of corn or bread of money or provisions had Privileges almost exempted the poorest citizens of Rome from the necessity of labour The magnificence of the first Caesars was in some measure imitated by the founder of Constantinople but his liberality how ever it might excite the applause of the people has incurred the censure of posterity A nation of le gislators and conquerors might assert their claim to the harvests of Africa which had been purchased with their blood and it was artfully contrived by Augustus that in the enjoyment of plenty the Romans should lose the memory of freedom But the prodigality of Constantine could not be excused by any consideration either of public or private in terest and the annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt for the benefit of his new capital was applied to feed a lazy and indolent populace at the expense of the husbandmen of an industrious province Some other regulations of this emperor are less liable to blame but they are less deserving of notice He divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or quar ters dignified the public council with the appellation of Senate communicated to the citizens the privileges of Italy

and freshness of youth the founder prepared to celebrate the dedication of his city The games and largesses which crowned the pomp of this memorable festival may easily be sup posed but there is one circumstance of a more sin gular and permanent nature which ought not en tirely to be overlooked As often as the birth day of the city returned the statue of Constantine framed by his order of gilt wood and bearing in his right hand a small image of the genius of the place was erected on atriumphal car The guards carrying white tapers and clothed in their richest apparel accom panied the solemn procession as it moved through the Hippodrome When it was opposite to the throne of the reigning emperor he rose from his seat and with grateful reverence adored the memory of his predecessor At the festival of the dedication an edict engraved on a column of marble bestowed the title of Second or New Rome on the city of Con stantine But the name of Constantinople has pre vailed over that honourable epithet and after the revolution of fourteen centuries still perpetuates the fame of its author The foundation of a new capital is naturally con Form of go nected with the establishment of a new form of civil n 914 and military administration The distinct view of the complicated system of policy introduced by Dio cletian improved by Constantine and completed by his immediate successors may not only amuse the fancy by the singular picture of a great empire but will tend to illustrate the secret and internal causes of its rapid decay In the pursuit of any remarkable institution we may

find Three ranks a place in the general state of the empire were ac ofhonour curately divided into three classes 1 The Illustri ous 2 The Speclabiles or Respectable And 3 The Clarissimi whom we may translate by the word Honourable In the times of Roman simpli city the last mentioned epithet was used only as a vague expression of deference till it became at length the peculiar and appropriated title of all who were members of the senate and consequently of all who from that venerable body were selected to govern the provinces The vanity of those who from their rank and office might claim a superior distinction above the rest of the senatorial order was long after wards indulged with the new appellation of Respect able but the title of Illustrious was always reserved to some eminent personages who were obeyed or re verenced by the two subordinate classes It was communicated only I To the consuls and patricians II To the praetorian praefects with the prasfects of Rome and Constantinople III To the masters general of the cavalry and the infantry and IV To the seven ministers of the palace who exercised c 2 20 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap their sacred functions about the

honorary codicils the emperors who were fond of multiplying their favours might sometimes gratify the vanity though not the ambition of impatient courtiers The consuls J As lone as the Roman consuls were the first magistrates of a free state they derived their right to power from the choice of the people As long as the emperors condescended to disguise the ser vitude which they imposed the consuls were still elected by the real or apparent suffrage of the senate From the reign of Diocletian even these vestiges of liberty were abolished and the successful candi dates who were invested with the annual honours of the consulship affected to deplore the humiliating condition of their predecessors The Scipios and the Catos had been reduced to solicit the votes of plebeians to pass through the tedious and expensive forms of a popular election and to expose their dig nity to the shame of a public refusal while their own happier fate had reserved them for an age and government in which the rewards of virtue were as signed by the unerring wisdom of a gracious sove reign In the epistles which the emperor addressed to the two consuls elect it was declared that they were created by his sole authority Their names and portraits engraved on gilt tablets of ivory were dispersed over the empire as presents to the pro vinces the cities the magistrates the senate and the people Their solemn inauguration was per formed at the place of the Imperial residence and during a period of one hundred and twenty years Rome was constantly deprived of the presence of her ancient magistrates On the morning of the OF THE ROMAN EM PIKE 21 first of January the consuls assumed the ensigns of chap their dignity Their dress was a robe of purple embroidered in silk and gold and sometimes orna mented with costly gems On this solemn occasion they were attended by the most eminent officers of the state and army in the habit of sena tors and the useless fasces armed with the once formidable axes were borne before them by the lictors The procession moved from the palace to the Forum or principal square of the city where the consuls ascended their tribunal and seated themselves in the curule chairs which were framed after the fashion of ancient times They immediately exer cised an act of jurisdiction by the manumission of a slave who was brought before them for that pur pose and the ceremony was intended to represent the celebrated action of the elder Brutus the author of liberty and of the consulship when he admitted among his fellow citizens the faithful Vindex who had revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins The public festival was continued during several days in all the principal cities in Rome from custom in Constantinople from imitation in Carthage An tioch and Alexandria from the love of pleasure and the superfluity of wealth In the two capitals of the empire the annual games of the theatre the circus and the amphitheatre cost four thousand pounds of gold about one hundred and sixty thou sand pounds sterling and if so heavy an expense surpassed the faculties or the inclination of the ma gistrates themselves the sum was supplied from the Imperial treasury As soon as the consuls had dis charged these customary duties they were at liberty to retire into the shade of private life and to enjoy during the remainder of the year the undisturbed contemplation of their own greatness They no c 3 22 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap longer presided in the national councils they no X1v longer executed the resolutions of peace or war Their abilities unless they were employed in more effective offices were of little moment and their names served only as the legal date of the year in which they had filled the chair of Marius and of Cicero Yet it was still felt and acknowledged in the last period of Roman servitude that this empty name might be compared and even preferred to the possession of substantial power The title of consul was still the most splendid object of ambition the noblest reward of virtue and loyalty The em perors themselves who disdained the faint shadow of the republic were conscious that they acquired an additional splendour and majesty as often as they assumed the annual honours of the consular dignity The patri The proudest and most perfect separation which can be found in any age or country between the nobles and the people is perhaps that of the Patri cians and the Plebeians as it was established in the first age of the Roman republic Wealth and ho nours the offices of the state and the ceremonies of religion were almost exclusively possessed by the former who preserving the purity of their blood with the most insulting jealousy held their clients in a condition of specious vassalage But these di stinctions so incompatible with the spirit of a free people were removed after a long struggle by the persevering efforts of the Tribunes The most active and successful of the Plebeians accumulated wealth aspired to honours deserved triumphs con tracted alliances and after some generations as sumed the pride of ancient nobility The Patrician families on the other hand whose original

of the republic when Caesar and Augustus Claudius and Vespasian created from the body of the senate a competent number of new Patrician families in the hope of perpetuating an order which was still considered as honourable and sacred But these artificial supplies in which the reigning house was always included were rapidly swept away by the rage of tyrants by frequent revo lutions by the change of manners and by the in termixture of nations Little more was left when Constantine ascended the throne than a vague and imperfect tradition that the Patricians had once been the first of the Romans To form a body of nobles whose influence may restrain while it se cures the authority of the monarch would have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of Constantine but had he seriously entertained such a design it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion He revived indeed the title of Patricians but he revived it  as a personal not as an hereditary distinction They yielded only to the transient superiority of the annual consuls but they enjoyed the pre eminence over all the great officers of state with the most familiar access to the person of the prince This honourable rank was bestowed on them for life and as they were usually favourites and ministers who had grown old in the Imperial court the true etymology of the word was perverted by ignorance and flattery and the Patricians of c 4 24 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap Constantine were reverenced as the adopted

Severus to that of Diocletian the guards and the palace the laws and the finances the armies and the provinces were in trusted to their superintending care and like the Vizirs of the East they held with one hand the seal and with the other the standard of the empire The ambition of the prefects always formidable and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served was supported by the strength of the Praetorian bands but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian and finally suppressed by Constantine the prafects who survived their fall were reduced without difficulty to the station of use ful and obedient ministers When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor s person they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the depart ments of the palace They were deprived by Con stantine of all military command as soon as they had ceased to lead into the field under their immediate orders the flower of the Roman troops and at length by a singular revolution the captains of the guards were transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces According to the plan of govern ment instituted by Diocletian the

oppressive administration of justice and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge his despatch of business his seasonable delays and his final sentence were publicly sold

The rudiments of this lucrative science were taught in all the considerable cities of the east and west but the most famous school was that of Berytus on the coast of Phoenicia which flourished above

distinguished by peculiar privileges and two were annually chosen with a salary of sixty pounds of gold to defend the causes of the treasury The first experiment was made of their judicial talents by appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates from thence they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which they had pleaded They obtained the government of a

the instrument of dispute they interpreted the laws according to the dictates of private interest and the same pernicious habits might still adhere to their characters in the public administration of the state The honour of a liberal profession has indeed been vindicated by ancient and modern advocates who have filled the most important stations with pure integrity and consummate wisdom but in the de cline of Roman jurisprudence the ordinary promo tion of lawyers was pregnant with mischief and dis grace The noble art which had once been pre served as the sacred inheritance of the patricians was

peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those troops which were under his immediate in spection they both indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies whether of horse or foot which were united in the same army Their number was soon doubled by the division of the east and west and as separate generals of the same rank and title were appointed on the four important fron tiers of the Rhine of the Upper and the Lower Danube and of the Euphrates the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight masters general of the cavalry and infantry Under their orders thirty five military commanders were stationed in the provinces three in Britain six in Gaul one in Spain one in Italy five on the Upper and four on the Lower Danube in Asia eight three in Egypt and four in Africa The titles of counts and dukes by which they were properly distin guished have obtained in modern languages so very different a sense that the use of them may occasion some surprise But it should be recollected that the second of those appellations is only a corruption of the Latin word which was indiscriminately ap plied to any military chief All these provincial generals were therefore dukes but no more than ten among them were dignified with the rank of counts or companions a title of honour or rather of favour which had been recently invented in the court of Constantine A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the office of the counts and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 85 dukes and besides their pay they received a liberal chap allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred

command which they exercised over the troops of their de partment was independent of the authority of the magistrates About the same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order he instituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers The emulation and sometimes the discord which reigned between two professions of opposite interests and incompati ble manners was productive of beneficial and of per nicious consequences It was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the disturbance or should unite for the service of their country While the one delayed to offer the assistance which the other disdained to solicit the troops very frequently re mained without orders or without supplies the public safety was betrayed and the defenceless sub jects were left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians The divided administration which had been formed by Constantine relaxed the vigour of the state while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch The memory of Constantine has been deservedly Â enction censured for another innovation which corrupted troops military discipline and prepared the ruin of the em pire The nineteen years which preceded his final victory over Licinius had been a period of licence and intestine war The rivals who contended for the

wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order From the reign of Constantine a popular and even legal distinction was admitted between the Palatines and the Borderers the troops of the court as they were improperly styled and the troops of the frontier The former elevated by the superiority of their pay and privileges were permitted except in the ex traordinary emergencies of war to occupy their tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the into lerable weight of quarters The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession and contracted only the vices of civil life They were either de graded by the industry of mechanic trades or ener vated by the luxury of baths and theatres They soon became careless of their martial exercises cu rious in their diet and apparel and while they in spired terror to the subjects of the empire they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers was no longer maintained with the same care or defended with the same vigilance The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier might be sufficient for the ordinary defence But their spirit Was degraded by the humiliating reflection that they who were exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual Warfare were rewarded only with about two thirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court Even the bands or legions OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 37 that were raised the nearest to the level of those un chap worthy favourites were in some measure disgraced XIV by the title of honour which they were allowed to assume It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who should dare to desert their colours to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians or to participate in the spoil The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities and though succeed ing princes laboured to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons the empire till the last moment of its dissolution continued to languish

similar examples there is reason to believe that the constitution of the legionary troops to which they partly owed their valour and discipline was dissolved by Constantine and that the bands of Roman infantry which still assumed the same names and the same honours con sisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men The conspiracy of so many separate detachments each of which was awed by the sense of its own weak ness could easily be checked and the successors of Constantine might indulge their love of ostentation by issuing their orders to one hundred and thirty two legions inscribed on the muster roll of their nu merous armies The remainder of their troops was distributed into several hundred cohorts of infantry and squadrons of cavalry Their arms and titles and ensigns were calculated to inspire terror and to display the variety of nations who marched under the Imperial standard And not a vestige was left of that severe simplicity which in the ages of freedom and victory had distinguished the line of battle of a Roman anny from the confused host of an Asiatic monarch A more particular enumeration drawn from the Notitia might exercise the diligence of an antiquary but the historian will content himself with observing that the number of permanent sta tions or garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire amounted to five hundred and eighty three and that

compensate the hardships and dangers of a military life Yet although the stature was lowered although slaves at least by a tacit connivance were indis criminately received into the ranks the

to the profession of arms as soon as they attained the age of manhood and their cowardly refusal was punished by the loss of honour of fortune or even of life But as the annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service levies of men were frequently required from the provinces and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms or to procure a substitute or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine The sum of forty two pieces of gold to which it was reduced ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers and the reluctance

enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations but in the legions themselves and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire they gra dually learned to despise their manners and to imitate their arts They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of Rome had exacted from their ignorance while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she supported her declining greatness The Barbarian soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced without exception to the most important commands and the names of the tribunes of the counts and dukes and of the generals themselves betray a foreign origin which they no longer con descended to disguise They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen and though most of them preferred the ties of alle giance to those of blood they did not always avoid the guilt or at least the suspicion of holding a trea sonable correspondence with the enemy of inviting his invasion or of sparing his retreat The camps OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 41 and the palace of the son of Constantine were go chap verned by the powerful faction of the Franks who XIv preserved the strictest connexion with each other and with their country and who resented every per sonal affront as a national indignity When the tyrant Caligula was suspected of an intention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the con sular robes the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely excited less astonishment if instead of a horse the noblest chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his choice The revolution of three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people that with the public approbation Constantine showed his successors the example of bestowing the honours of the consul ship on the Barbarians who by their merit and ser vices had deserved to be ranked among the first of the Romans But as these hardy veterans who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of the laws were incapable of exercising any civil offices the powers of the human mind were

illustrious character alone survived the sup pression of his ancient and useless colleagues As the orations which he composed in the name of the emperor acquired the force and at length the form of

he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which in the cor ruption of taste and language still

the expense exceeded the revenue or the revenue fell short of the computation an addi tional tax under the name of superindiction was imposed on the people and the most valuable attri bute of sovereignty was communicated to the Prae torian praefects who on some occasions were per mitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraor dinary exigencies of the public service The execu tion of

reported and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential part of the report an oath was administered to the proprietors which bound them to disclose the true state of their affairs and their attempts to prevaricate or elude the in tention of the legislator were severely watched and punished as a capital crime which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege A large por tion of the tribute was paid in money and of the current coin of the empire gold alone could be legally accepted The remainder of the taxes ac cording to the proportions determined by the annual OF THE ROMAN EM1IRE indiction was furnished in a manner still more direct and still more oppressive According to the different nature of lands their real produce in the various articles of wine or oil corn or barley wood or iron was transported by the labour or at the ex pense of the provincials to the Imperial magazines from whence they were occasionally distributed for the use of the court of the army and of the two capitals Rome and Constantinople The commis sioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind In the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness which in a corrupt and ab solute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud The agriculture of the Roman provinces was insen sibly ruined and in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgive ness of debts or the remission of tributes which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying Ac cording to the new division of Italy the fertile and happy province of Campania the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retirements of the citi zens of Rome extended between the sea and the Aperinine from the Tyber to the Silarus Within sixty years after the death of Constantine and on the evidence of an actual survey an exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and thirty thou sand English acres of desert and uncultivated land which amounted to one eighth of the whole surface of the province As the footsteps of the Barbarians e 3 5i THE DECLINE AND FALL chap had not yet been seen in Italy the cause of this XIv amazing desolation which is recorded in the laws can be ascribed only to the administration of the Roman emperors Either from design or from accident the mode a capitation of assessment seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms of a capitation The re turns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects and the amount of the public impositions The latter of these sums was divided by the former and the esti mate that such a province contained so many capita or heads of tribute and that each head was rated at such a price was universally received not only in the popular but even in the legal computation The value of a tributary head must have varied ac cording to many accidental or at least fluctuating circumstances but some knowledge has been pre served of a very curious fact the more important since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman empire and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the European kingdoms The ra pacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul by exacting twenty five pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head The hu mane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces A moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extravagant oppression and of transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at sixteen pieces of gold or about nine pounds ster ling the common standard perhaps of the impositions of Gaul  But this calculation or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind who â In the calculation of any sum of money under Constantine and his successors we need only refer to the excellent discourse of Mr Greaves on the Denarius From him we may compute the Roman pound of gold the usual method of reckoning large sums at forty pounds sterling and we may fix the currency of the aureus at somewhat more than eleven shillings OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE Â 5 will be at once surprised by the equality and by the chap enormity of the capitation An attempt to explain XIV them may perhaps reflect some light on the interest ing subject of the finances of the declining empire I It is obvious that as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of property the most numerous part of the community would be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling re venue Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation but in the practice this unjust equality was no longer felt as the tribute was col lected on the principle of a real not of a personal imposition Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head or share of taxation while the wealthy provincial in proportion to his fortune alone represented several of those imaginary beings In a poetical request addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the Roman princes who reigned in Gaul Sidonius Appollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster the Geryon of the Grecian fables and intreats the new Hercules that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet but if he had pursued the allusion he must have painted many of the Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra spreading over the face of the country and devouring the sub stance of a hundred families II The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds ster ling even for the average of the capitation of Gaul may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious wealthy and affectionate people The taxes of e 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL France cannot be magnified either by fear or by flattery beyond the annual amount of eighteen mil lions sterling which ought perhaps to be shared among four and twenty millions of inhabitants  Seven millions of these in the capacity of fathers or brothers or husbands may discharge the obliga tions of the remaining multitude of women and chil dren yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable which was regularly imposed on their Gallic ancestors The reason of this difference may be found not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver as in the different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern France In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of eveiy subject the whole mass of taxes whether they â are levied on property or on consumption may be fajrly divided among the whole body of the nation But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world were cultivated by slaves or by peasants whose de pendent condition was a less rigid servitude In such a state the poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their la bour and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honourable or at least of a decent sub sistence the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capita tion The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example The iEdui one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or cities of Gaul occupied an extent of territory which now contains  This assertion however formidable it may seem is founded on the original registers of births deaths and marriages collected by public authority and now deposited in the CimtrSk General at Paris OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 57 tbove five hundred thousand inhabitants in the two chap ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers and _ with the probable accession of those of Chalons and Matron the population would amount to eight hun dred thousand souls In the time of Constantine the territory of the iEdui afforded no more than twenty five thousand heads of capitation of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute  A just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an in genious historian t that the free and tributary citi zens did not surpass the number of half a million and if in the ordinary administration of govern ment their annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a half of our money it would  appear that although the share of each individual was four times as considerable a fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the Impe rial province of Gaul The exactions of Constantius may be calculated set seven millions sterling which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian But this tax or capitation on the proprietors of Capitation land would have suffered a rich and numerous class Industry of free citizens to escape With the view of sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labour and which exists in money or in merchandise the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects t Some ex emptions very strictly confined both in time and place were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts but every other branch of commercial industry was  Eumenius in Panegyr Vet  viii 11 t L Abbe du Bos Hist Critique de la M F torn i p 121 j See Cod Theod 1

announced by the tears and terrors of the citizens who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property had been assessed The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be justified from the charge of passion and prejudice but from the nature of this tribute it seems reasonable to conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting The secret wealth of commerce and the precarious profits of art or labour are susceptible only of a discretionary va luation which is seldom disadvantageous to the in terest of the treasury and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security the payment of the imposition which in the case of a land

consideration of a subject which may be ex amined with impartiality but cannot be viewed with indifference a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of Constantine The eloquent Lactantius in the midst of his court seems impatient to proclaim to the world the glorious exam ple of the sovereign of Gaul who in the first moments of his reign acknowledged and adored the majesty of the true and only God The learned Eusebius has ascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign of the cross which was displayed in

protected by the authority and per X1v haps by the laws of the prince If we may cre dit the assertion of Constantine himself he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted by the hands of Roman sol diers on those citizens whose religion was their only crime In the east and in the west he had seen the dif ferent effects of severity and indulgence and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of Galerius his implacable enemy the latter was re commended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father The son of Constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of per secution and granted the free exercise of their reli gious ceremonies to all those who had already pro fessed themselves members of the church They were soon encouraged to depend on the favour as well as on the justice of their sovereign who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of Christ and for the God of the Christians a D 313 About five months after the conquest of Italy the EdTctrf emperor made a solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated edict of Milan which restored peace to the catholic church In the personal interview of the two western princes Constantine by the ascendant of genius and power obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague Lici nius the union of their names and authority dis armed the fury of Maximin and after the death of the tyrant of the east the edict of Milan was re ceived as a general and fundamental law of the Ro man world The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly deprived It was enacted that the places of worship and public Milan OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE 63 lands which had been confiscated should be restored chap to the church without dispute without delay and XIV without expense and this injunction was accom panied with a gracious promise that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price they should be indemnified from the Imperial treasury These salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the prin ciples of enlarged and equal toleration and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honourable distinction The two emperors proclaim to the wrorld that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Christians and to all others of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer to which he has addicted his mind and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use They carefully explain every ambiguous word remove every exception and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure without any limitation the claims of religious liberty They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration the humane intention of consulting the peace and hap piness of their people and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate the Deity whose seat is in heaven They gratefully ac knowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favour and they trust that the same Providence will for ever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people The conquest of Italy produced a general edict of A D 324 toleration and as soon as the defeat of Licinius had invested Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world he immediately by circular letters exhorted all his subjects to imitate without delay the THE DECLINE AND FALL example of their sovereign and to embrace the di vine truth of Christianity By the edicts of toleration Constantine removed the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto re tarded the progress of Christianity and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission a liberal encouragement to recommend the salutary truths of revelation by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind The exact balance of the two religions continued but a moment The hopes of wealth and honour the example of an emperor and his exhortations diffused conviction among the obsequious crowds which usually fill the apartments of a palace The cities which signalized a forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their temples were distinguished by municipal privileges and rewarded with popular donatives and the new capital of the East gloried in the singular advantage that Constantinople was never profaned by the wor ship of idols The powerful influence of Constantine was not circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life or of his dominions The education which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race of princes whose faith was still more lively and sincere as they imbibed in their earliest infancy the doctrines of Christianity War and commerce had spread the knowledge of the Gospel beyond the con fines of the Roman provinces and the Barbarians who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilized nation of the globe The Goths and Germans who enlisted under the standard of Rome revered the cross which glittered at the head of the legions and their fierce countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of humanity OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 65 The kings of Iberia and Armenia worshipped the chap God of their protector and their subjects who have _ invariably preserved the name of Christians soon formed a sacred and perpetual connexion with their Roman brethren The Christians of Persia were suspected in time of war of preferring their religion to their country but as long as peace subsisted be tween the two empires the persecuting spirit of the Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine The rays of the Gospel illuminated the coast of India The colonies of Jews who had penetrated into Arabia and Ethiopia opposed the progress of Christianity but the labour of the Missionaries was in some measure facilitated by a previous knowledge of the Mosaic revelation and Abyssinia still reveres the memory of Frumentius who in the time of Constantine devoted his life to the conversion of those sequestered regions VOL II 66 THE DECLINE AND FALL CHAPTER XV Character of Constantine â Gothic War â Death ofCon stantine â Division of the Empire among his three Sons â

introduced such important changes ofha mtean nto tne an religious constitution of his coun tine try has fixed the attention and divided the opinions of mankind By the grateful zeal of the Christians the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every attribute of a hero and even of a saint while the discontent of the vanquished party has com pared Constantine to the most abhorred of those tyrants who by their vice and weakness disho noured the Imperial purple The same passions have in some degree been perpetuated to succeeding ge nerations and the character of Constantine is con sidered even in the present age as an object either of satire or of panegyric By the impartial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest ad mirers and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable enemies we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man which the truth and candour of history should adopt without a blush But it would soon appear that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colours and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities must produce a figure monstrous rather than human un less it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights by a careful separation of the different periods of the reign of Constantine OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 67 The person as well as the mind of Constantine chap had been enriched by nature with her choicest en XV dowments His stature was lofty his countenance His virtues majestic his deportment graceful his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise and from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life he preserved the vigour of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance He delighted in the social inter course of familiar conversation and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reseijfre than was required by the severe dignity of his station the courtesy and liberality of his man ners gained the hearts of all who approached him The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected yet he showed on some occasions that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not pre vented him from forming a just estimate of the value of learning and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine In the despatch of business his dili gence was indefatigable and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in read ing writing or meditating in giving audience to ambassadors and in examining the complaints of his subjects Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive and patience to execute the most arduous designs without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamours of the multitude In the field he in fused his own intrepid spirit into the troops whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate ge neral and to his abilities rather than to his fortune we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic f 2 68 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap He loved glory as the reward perhaps as the mo Xv tive of his labours The boundless ambition which from the moment of his accepting the purple at York appears as the ruling passion of his soul may be justified by the dangers of his own situation by the character of his rivals by the consciousness of superior merit and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire In his civil wars against Maxen tius and Licinius he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people who compared the un dissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed to direct the ge neral tenor of the administration of Constantine His vices Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the Tyber or even in the plains of Hadrianople such is the character which with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity But the conclusion  of his reign according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the Roman princes In the life of Augustus we behold the tyrant of the re public converted almost by imperceptible degrees into the father of his country and of human kind In that of Constantine we may contemplate a hero who had so long inspired his subjects with love and his enemies with terror degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch corrupted by his fortune or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimula A D tion The general

boundless liberality of their master usurped with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption A secret but universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration and the emperor himself though he still retained the obedience gradually lost the esteem of his subjects The dress and man ners which towards the decline of life he chose to affect served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind The Asiatic pomp which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of Constan tine He is represented with false hair of various colours laboriously arranged by the skilful artists of the times a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion a profusion of gems and pearls of collars and bracelets and a variegated flowing robe of silk most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold In such apparel scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a Roman veteran A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion and dares to forgive The deaths of Maximian and Li

sufficient time for any Imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple But the royalty of the Flavian line which had been first ennobled by the Gothic Claudius descended through several generations and Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honours which he transmitted to his children The emperor had been twice married Minervina the obscure but lawful object of his youth ful attachment had left him only one son who was called Crispus By Fausta the daughter of Maxi mian he had three daughters and three sons known by the kindred names of Constantine Constantius and Constans The unambitious brothers of the great Constantine Julius Constantius Dalmatius and Hannibalianus were permitted to enjoy the most honourable rank and the most affluent fortune that could be consistent with a private station The youngest of the three lived without a name and died without posterity His two elder brothers obtained in marriage the daughters of wealthy senators and propagated new branches of the Imperial race Gallus and Julian afterwards became the most illustrious of the children of Julius Constantius the Patrician The two sons of Dalmatius who had been decorated OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 71 with the vain title of Censor were named Dalmatius chap and Hannibalianus The two sisters of the great XVl Constantine Anastasia and Eutropia were bestowed on Optatus and Nepotianus two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity His third sister Con stantia was distinguished by her pre eminence of greatness and of misery She remained the

succession Besides the females and the allies of the Flavian house ten or twelve males to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood seemed according to the order of their birth to be destined either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine But in less than thirty years this numerous and increasing family was re duced to the persons of Constantius and

ties of confidence and gratitude he resolved to prevent the mischiefs which might be apprehended from dissatisfied ambition Crispus soon had reason to complain that while his infant brother Con stantius was sent with the title of Caesar to reign over his peculiar department of the Gallic provinces he a prince of mature years who had performed such recent and signal services instead of being raised to the superior rank of Augustus was confined almost a prisoner to his father s court and exposed with out power or defence to every calumny which the malice of his enemies could suggest Under

so universally ac knowledged that the modern Greeks who adore the memory of their founder are reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify They pre tend that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled he published to the world his repentance and remorse â that he mourned forty OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 75 days during which he abstained from the use of the chap bath and all the ordinary comforts of life and that xv for the lasting instruction of posterity he erected a golden statue of Crispus with this memorable in scription To MY SON WHOM I UNJUSTLY CON DEMNED A tale so moral and so interesting would deserve to be supported by less exceptionable autho rity but if we consult the more ancient and au thentic writers they will inform us that the repent ance of Constantine was manifested only in acts of blood and revenge and that he atoned for the mur der of an innocent son by the execution perhaps of a guilty wife They ascribe the misfortunes of Crispus to the arts of his stepmother Fausta whose implacable hatred or whose disappointed love re newed in the palace of Constantine the ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra Like the daughter of Minos the daughter of Maximian ac cused her son in law of an incestuous attempt on the chastity of his father s wife and easily obtained from the jealousy of the emperor a sentence of death against a young prince whom she considered with reason as the most formidable rival of her own children But Helena the aged mother of Constan tine lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson Crispus nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made that Fausta her self entertained a criminal connexion with a slave belonging to the Imperial stables Her condemna  tion and punishment were the instant consequences of the charge and the adulteress was suffocated by the steam of a bath which for that purpose had been heated to an extraordinary degree By some it will perhaps be thought that the remembrance of a con jugal union of twenty years and the honour of their common offspring the destined heirs Â f the throne might have softened the obdurate heart f Constaa 76 THE DECLINE AND TALL chap tine and persuaded him to suffer his wife however Xv guilty she might appear to expiate her offences in a solitary prison But it seems a superfluous labour to weigh the propriety unless we could ascertain the truth of this singular event which is attended with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity Those who have attacked and those who have defended the character of Constantine have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages of two orations pronounced under the succeeding reign The former celebrates the virtues the beauty and the fortune of the em press Fausta the daughter wife sister and mother of so many princes The latter asserts in explicit terms that the mother of the younger Constantine who was slain three years after his father s death survived to weep over the fate of her son Notwith  standing the positive testimony of several writers of the Pagan as well as of the Christian religion there may still remain some reason to believe or at least to suspect that Fausta escaped the blind and suspi cious cruelty of her husband The deaths of a son and of a nephew with the execution of a great num ber of respectable and perhaps innocent friends who were involved in their fall may be sufficient however to justify the discontent of the Roman people and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the palace gate comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of Con  stantine and Nero The Â m By the death of Crispus the inheritance of the phews of empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of Fausta Constantine wliQ een airea jy mentioned under the names of Constantine of Constantius and of Constans These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth the twentieth and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father This conduct though it tended to multiply the future OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE v Tt masters of the Roman world might be excused by chap the partiality of paternal affection but it is not easy XV to understand the motives of the emperor when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus The former was raised by the title of Caesar to an equality with his cousins In favour of the latter Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of Nobi lissimus to which he annexed the flattering distinc tion of a robe of purple and gold But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of King a name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny The use of such a title even as it appears under the reign of Constantine is a strange and unconnected fact which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers The whole empire was deeply interested in the Their edu â cation education of these five youths the acknowledged successors of Constantine The exercises of the body prepared them for the fatigues of war and the duties of active life Those who occasionally mention the education or talents of Constantius allow that he excelled in the gymnastic arts of leaping and run ning that he was a dexterous archer a skilful horseman and a master of all the different weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the in fantry The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed though not perhaps with equal success to improve the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith of the Grecian philosophy and of the Roman juris prudence were invited by the liberality of the em peror who reserved for himself the important task of THE DECLINE AND FALI  instructing the royal youths in the science of govern __ ment and the knowledge of mankind But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience In the free intercourse of private life and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius he had learned to command his own pas sions to encounter those of his equals and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Imperial purple Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the ex pectation of a throne nor would the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated sta tion from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect The indulgence of Constantine admitted them at a very tender age to share the administration of the empire and they studied the art of reigning at the â expense of the people intrusted to their care The younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court in Gaul and his brother Constantius exchanged that department the ancient patrimony of their fa ther for the more opulent but less martial countries of the East Italy the Western Illyricum and Africa were accustomed to revere Constans the third of his sons as the representative of the great Con stantine He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic fron tier to which he annexed the government of Thrace Macedonia and Greece The city of Caesarea was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus and the provinces of Pontus Cappadocia and the Lesser Ar menia were destined to form the extent of his new kingdom For each of these princes a suitable esta blishment was provided A just proportion of guards of legions and of auxiliaries was allotted for their OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE 79 respective dignity and defence The ministers and chap generals who Were placed about their persons were xv such as Constantine could trust to assist and even to control these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power As they advanced in years and experience the limits of their authority were in sensibly enlarged but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus and while he showed the Ccesars to the armies and provinces he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedi ence to its supreme head The tranquillity of the last fourteen years of his reign was scarcely inter rupted by the contemptible insurrection of a camel driver in the island of Cyprus or by the active part which the policy of Constantine engaged him to assume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians Among the different branches of the human race Manners of the Sarmatians form a very remarkable shade as they anf seem to unite the manners of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inha bitants of Europe According to the various accidents of peace and war of alliance or conquest the Sar matians were sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the Vistula and the Volga The care of their numerous flocks and herds the pursuit of game and the exercise of war or rather of rapine directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians The moveable camps or cities the ordinary residence of their wives and children con sisted only of large waggons drawn by oxen and covered in the form of tents The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry and the cus tom of their warriors to lead in their hand one or  Eusebius I iv c 51 52 with a design of exalting the authority and glory of Constantine affirms that he divided the Roman empire as a private citizen might have divided his

retreat with a rapid diligence which surprised the security and eluded the pursuit of a distant enemy Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass which was capable of re sisting a sword or javelin though it was formed only of horses hoofs cut into thin and polished slices carefully laid over each other in the manner ef scales or feathers and strongly sewed upon an under gar ment of coarse linen The offensive arms of the Sarmatians were short daggers long lances and a weighty bow with a quiver of arrows They were reduced to the necessity of employing fish bones for the points of their weapons but the custom of dip ping them in a venomous liquor that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners since a people im pressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey their shaggy beards uncombed locks the furs with which they were covered from head to foot and their fierce countenances which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with horror and dismay Their settle The tender Ovid after a youth spent in the en throne joyment of fame and luxury was condemned to an hopeless exile on the frozen banks of the Danube where he was exposed almost without defence to the fury of these monsters of the desert with whose stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be confounded In his pathetic but some times unmanly lamentations he describes in the most lively colours the dress and manners the arms and inroads of the Getae and Sarmatians who were OF THE ROMAN EMPIRIC 81 associated for the purposes of destruction and from chap the accounts of history there is some reason to be xv lieve that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the em pire Soon after the reign of Augustus they obliged the Dacians who subsisted by fishing on the banks  of the river Teyss or Tibiscus to retire into the hilly country and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the semi circular inclosure of the Carpathian mountains In this advantageous position they watched or sus pended the moment of attack as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbours the Goths and the Germans with a formidable body of cavalry They lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive Vandals who yielded to the pressure of the Gothic power they seem to have chosen a king from that nation and from the illus trious race of the Astingi who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the northern ocean This motive of enmity must have inflamed theTheGothic subjects of contention which perpetually arise on the a d 351 confines of warlike and independent nations The Vandal princes were stimulated by fear and revenge the Gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the Euxine to the frontiers of Germany and the waters of the Maros a

Constantine had declared himself in favour of the weaker party the haughty Araric king of the Goths instead of ex pecting the attack of the Legions boldly passed the Danube and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia To oppose the inroad of this destroying host the aged emperor took the field in person but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign and domestic wars He had the mortification of seeing his troops fly before an incon siderable detachment of the Barbarians who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and igno minious retreat The event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honour of the Roman name and the powers of art and discipline prevailed after an obstinate contest over the efforts of irregular valour The broken army of the Goths abandoned the field of battle the wasted province and the pas sage of the Danube and although the eldest of the a d 332 sons of Constantine was permitted to supply the place Apri120 of his father the merit of the victory which diffused universal joy was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself He contributed at least to improve this advantage by his negotiations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus whose capital situate on the western coast of the Tauric or Crimasan peninsula still re tained some vestiges of a Grecian colony and was governed by a perpetual magistrate assisted by a counsel of senators emphatically styled the Fathers of the City The Chersonites were animated against OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 83 the Goths by the memory of the wars which in the chap preceding century they had maintained with unequal xv forces against the invaders of their country They were connected with the Romans by the mutual benefits of commerce as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures which they purchased with their only productions salt wax and hides Obedient to the requisition of Constantine they prepared under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes a considerable army of which the principal strength consisted in cross bows and military chariots The speedy march and in trepid attack of the Chersonites by diverting the attention of the Goths assisted the operations of the Imperial generals The Goths vanquished on every side were driven into the mountains where in the course of a severe campaign above a hundred thou sand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger Peace was at length granted to their hum ble supplications the eldest son of Araric was ac cepted as the most valuable hostage and Constan tine endeavoured to convince their chiefs by a liberal distribution of honours and rewards how far the friendship Of the Romans was preferable to their en mity In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites the emperor was still more mag nificent The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea A regular subsidy was promised of iron corn oil and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war But it was thought that the Sar matians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliver ance from impending ruin and the emperor per haps with too strict an economy deducted some part g 2 84 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap of the expenses of the war from the customary grati xv fications which were allowed to that turbulent nation Expulsion Exasperated by this apparent neglect the Sarma mafoj tians soon forgot with the levity of Barbarians the a d 334 services which they had so lately received and the dangers which still threatened their safety Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic a renowned warrior who had recently ascended the Gothic throne Wisumar the Vandal king whilst alone and unassisted he defended his dominions with undaunted courage was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the Sarmatian youth The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arm ing their slaves a hardy race of hunters and herds men by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat and expelled the invader from their confines But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy more dangerous and more implacable Enraged by their former servi tude elated by their present glory the slaves under the name of Limigantes claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved Their masters unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants Some of the fugi tive Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious depend ence Under the hostile standard of the Goths A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian mountains among

purpose had been splendidly furnished and illuminated The forms of the court were strictly maintained Every day at the appointed hours the principal officers of the state the army and the household approaching the person of their sovereign with bended knees and a composed countenance offered their respectful ho mage as seriously as if he had been still alive From motives of policy this

nature and they might with decency as well as truth insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic from the discord of so many rival princes who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection The intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy till a loud and unanimous declara tion was procured from the troops that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented mon arch to reign over the Roman empire The younger Dalmatius who was united with his collateral rela tions by the ties of friendship and interest is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great Constantine but on this occasion he does not appear to have concerted any measures for supporting by arms the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular fury they seem to have remained without the power of flight or of resistance in the hands of their implacable enemies Their fate was suspended till the arrival of Constantius the second and perhaps the most favoured of the sons of Con stantine The voice of the dying emperor had recommended Massacre of the care of his funeral to the piety of Constantius   pnnces and that prince by the vicinity of his

xv palace of Constantinople his first care was to remove the apprehensions of his kinsmen by a solemn oath which he pledged for their security His next em ployment was to find some specious pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise The arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character From the hands of the bishop of Nico media Constantius received a fatal scroll affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his brothers and conjured his sons to revenge his death and to consult their own safety by the punishment of the guilty Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to defend their life and honour against so incredible an accusation they were silenced by the furious cla mours of the soldiers who declared themselves at once their enemies their judges and their exe cutioners The spirit and even the forms of legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous massacre which involved the two uncles of Con stantius seven of his cousins of whom Dalmatius and Hannibalianus were the most illustrious the Pa trician Optatus who had married a sister of the late emperor and the Praefect Ablavius whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene we might add that Con stantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus These alli ances which the policy of Constantine regardless of the public prejudice had formed between the several branches of the Imperial house served only to con OF THE K OMANT EMPIRE 89 vinee mankind that these princes were as cold to the chap endearments of conjugal affection as they were in xv sensible to the ties of

was still in the vigour of youth as the date of his accession by a very strange fatality had preceded that of his birth The wife of Hor mouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband s death and

elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the Great King who advanced a third time towards Nisibis at the head of the united forces of Persia and India The ordinary machines invented to batter or undermine the walls were rendered in effectual by the superior skill of the Romans and many days had vainly elapsed when Sapor embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who be lieved that the elements themselves were subject to his power At the stated season of the melting of the snows in Armenia the river Mygdonius which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis forms like the Nile an inundation over the adjacent country By the labour of the Persians the course of the river was stopt below the town and the waters were con fined on every side by solid mounds of earth On this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels filled with soldiers and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight advanced in order of battle and engaged almost upon a level the troops which defended the ramparts The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties till at length a portion of the walls unable to sustain the accumulated pressure gave way at once and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet The Persians were instantly driven to the assault and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the

the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than twenty thousand men Sapor still pressed the reduction of Nisibis with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the Massagetae Alarmed by this intelligence he hastily relinquished the siege and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus The dan ger and difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to conclude or at least to observe a truce with the Roman emperor which was equally grateful to both princes as Constantius himself after the deaths of his two brothers was involved by the revolutions of the west in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength After the partition of the empire three years had civil war scarcely elapsed before the sons of Constantine seemed S nslantine impatient to convince mankind that they were in AIa j 340 capable of contenting themselves with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern The eldest of those princes soon complained that he was de frauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kinsmen

exasperated the fierceness of his temper and he eagerly listened to those favourites who sug gested to him that his honour as well as his interest was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel At the head of a tumultuary band suited for rapine rather than for conquest he suddenly broke into the dominions of Constans by the way of the Julian Alps and the country round Aquileia felt the first effects of his resentment The measures of Constans who then resided in Dacia were directed with more prudence and ability On the news of his brother s invasion he detached a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces But the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the un natural contest By the artful appearances of flight Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade which had been concealed in a wood where the rash youth with a few attendants was surprised surrounded and slain His body after it had been found in the ob scure stream of the Alsa obtained the honours of an Imperial sepulchre but his provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror who refusing to admit his elder brother Constantius to any

of his sons who by their OF THE ROMAN EMPIltE 99 vices and weakness soon lost the esteem and affec chap tions of their people The pride assumed by Con xv stans from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application His fond partiality towards some German captives distinguished only by the charms of youth was an object of scandal to the people and Magnentius an ambitious soldier who was himself of Barbarian extraction was encouraged by the pub lic discontent to assert the honour of the Roman name The chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader main tained the most respectable and important station in the Imperial camp The friendship of Marcellinus count of the sacred largesses supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction The soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude and by the choice of an active and vigilant prince to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a private condition to the throne of the world As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution Marcellinus under the pretence of celebrating his son s birth day gave a splendid entertainment to the illustrious and honourable persons of the court of Gaul which then resided in the city of Autun The intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late hour of the night and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dan gerous and guilty freedom of conversation On a sudden the doors were thrown open and Magnentius who had retired for a few moments returned into the apartment invested with the diadem and purple The conspirators instantly

prompted them xv to join their voices to the general acclamation The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity the gates of the town were shut and before the dawn of day Magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun By his secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favourite amusement of hunting or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature The rapid progress of fame allowed him however an instant for flight though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance Before he could reach a sea port in Spain where he intended to embark he was overtaken near Helena at the foot of the Pyre nees by a party of light

extent of the two great prefectures of Gaul and Italy and the usurper prepared by every act of oppression to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expenses of a civil war The martial countries of Illyricum from the Danube to the extremity of Greece had long obeyed the government of Vetranio an aged general beloved for the simplicity of his manners and who had ac quired some reputation by his experience and services in war Attached by habit by duty and by grati tude to the house of Constantine he immediately â Zosimus I ii p 119 120

his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul But the le gions of Vetranio were seduced rather than provoked by the example of rebellion their leader soon be trayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity and his ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina That cruel and aspiring woman who had obtained from the great Constantine her father the rank of Augusta placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the Illyrian general and seemed to expect from his vic tory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus Perhaps it was without the consent of Constantiria that the new emperor formed a necessary though dishonourable alliance with the usurper of the west whose purple was so recently stained with her brother s blood The intelligence of these important events which Constants refuses to so deeply affected the honour and safety of the Im treat perial house recalled the arms of Constantius from A D 350 the inglorious prosecution of the Persian war He recommended the care of the east to his lieutenants and afterwards to his cousin Gallus whom he raised from a prison to a throne and marched towards Europe with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear of grief and indignation On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio The first author of the conspiracy Marcellinus who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master boldly accepted this dangerous commission and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army These deputies h 3 102 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap were instructed to soothe the resentment and to xv alarm the fears of Constantius They were em powered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes to cement their union by a dou ble marriage of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina and to acknowledge in the treaty the pre eminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the east  Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the west to exert their superior strength and to employ against him that valour those abilities and those legions to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs Such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention the answer of Constantius was de ferred till the next day and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people he thus addressed his council who listened with real or affected credulity Last night said he after I retired to rest the shade of the great Constantine embracing the corpse of my murdered brother rose before my eyes his well known voice awakened me to revenge forbad me to despair of the republic and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms The authority of such a vision or rather of the prince who alleged it silenced every doubt and excluded all negotiation The ignominious terms of peace were rejected with dis dain One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dis missed with the haughty answer of Constantius his colleagues as unworthy of the privileges of the law OF THE ItOMAN EMPIRE 103 of nations were put in irons and the contending chap powers prepared to wage an implacable war  xv Such was the conduct and such perhaps was the Deposes duty of the brother of Constans towards the per Xfixssb fidious usurper of Gaul The situation and character Dec 25 of Vetranio admitted of milder measures and the policy of the eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonist and to separate the forces of Ulyricum from the cause of rebellion It was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of Vetranio who fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honour and interest displayed to the world the in sincerity of his temper and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negotiation Constantius acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war In consequence of this agreement Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica at the head of twenty thousand horse and of a more numerous body of infantry a power so far superior to the forces of Constantius that the Ulyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival who depending on the success of his private negotiations had seduced the troops and undermined the throne of Vetranio The chiefs who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius prepared in his favour a public spectacle calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city In the centre according to the rules of ancient discipline a military tribunal or rather scaffold was erected from  See Peter the Patrician in the Excerpta Legationum p 27 H 4 THE DECLIKE AND FALL whence the emperors were accustomed on solemn and important occasions to harangue the troops The well ordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians with drawn swords or with erected spears the squadrons of cavalry and the cohorts of infantry distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns formed an immense circle round the tribunal and the attentive silence which they preserved was some times interrupted by loud bursts of clamour or of ap plause In the presence of this formidable assembly the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric he acquitted himself under these difficult circumstances with firmness dexterity and elo quence The first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans he insinuated that none except a brother could claim a right to the succession of his brother He dis played with some complacency the glories of his Im perial race and recalled to the memory of the troops the valour the triumphs the liberality of the great Constantine to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity which the in gratitude of his most favoured servants had tempted them to violate The officers who surrounded the tribunal and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the emperor Constantius as their lawful sovereign The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank till the plain of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of  Away with these upstart usurpers Long life and victory to the son of

the courage of Vetranio who stood amidst the defection of his followers in anxious and silent suspense Instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair he tamely submitted to his fate and taking the diadem from his head in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror Constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation and raising from the ground the aged suppliant whom he affected to style by the endearing name of Father he gave him his hand to descend from the throne The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the ab dicated monarch who lived six years in the enjoy ment of ease and affluence He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius and with a very amiable simplicity advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world and to seek for content where alone it could be found in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition The behaviour of Constantius on this memorable M â occasion was celebrated with some appearance of jus Magnentius tice and his courtiers compared the studied orations A D 351 which a Pericles or a Demosthenes addressed to the populace of Athens with the victorious eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and depose the object of their partial choice The approaching contest with Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind The tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter Constantius at the head of a numerous army composed of Gauls and Spa niards of Franks and Saxons of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable enemies of the republic The fertile plains of the Lower Pannonia between the Drave the Save and 106 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap the Danube presented a spacious theatre and the Xv operations of the civil war were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity of the com batants Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which on the same auspicious ground had been obtained by the arms of his father Con stantine Yet by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp he ap peared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position and he employed with that view the various marches evolutions and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer He carried by assault the important town of Siscia made an attack on the city of Sirmium which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp attempted to force a passage over the Save into the eastern provinces of Illyricum and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne During the greater part of the summer the tyrant of Gaul showed himself master of the field The troops of Constantius were harassed and dispirited his re putation declined in the eye of the world and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace which would have resigned to the assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip the Imperial ambassador and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them But the haughty usurper careless of the remon strances of his friends gave orders that Philip should be detained as a captive or at least as a hostage while he despatched an officer to reproach Constantius OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 107 with the weakness of his reign and to insult him chap by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly xv abdicate the purple That he should confide in the justice of his cause and the protection of an avenging Deity was the only answer which honour permitted the emperor to return But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative The negotiation of Philip was not however ineffectual since he de termined Sylvanus the Frank a general of merit and reputation to desert with a considerable body of cavalry a few days before the battle of Mursa The city of Mursa or Essek celebrated in mo Battle of dern times for a bridge of boats five miles in length A iassi over the river Drave and the adjacent morasses  SePt 28 has been always considered as a place of importance in the wars of Hungary Magnentius directing his march towards Mursa set fire to the gates and by a sudden assault had almost scaled the walls of the town The vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames the approach of Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the siege and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphi theatre The field of battle round Mursa was a naked and level plain on this ground the army of Constantius formed with the Drave on their right while their left either from the nature of their dis

Barbarians of Germany supported the renown of their national bravery The engagement soon be came general was maintained with various and singular turns of fortune and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night The signal victory which Constantius obtained is attributed to the arms of his cavalry His cuirassiers are described as so many massy statues of steel glittering with their scaly armour and breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the Gallic legions As soon as the legions gave way the lighter and more active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the intervals and completed the dis order In the mean while the huge bodies of the Germans were exposed almost naked to the dex terity of the oriental archers and whole troops of those Barbarians were urged by anguish and despair to precipitate themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave The number of the slain was computed at fifty four thousand men andthe slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished a circumstance which proves the ob stinacy of the contest and justifies the observation of an ancient writer that the forces of the empire were

of Constantius Two ministers of illustrious rank Domitian the Oriental praefect and Montius quaestor of the palace were empowered by a special commission to visit and reform the state of the East They were instructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and respect and by the gentlest arts of persuasion to engage him to comply with the in vitation of his brother and colleague The rashness of the praefect disappointed these prudent measures and hastened his own ruin as well as that of his enemy On his arrival at Antioch Domitian passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace and al leging a slight pretence of indisposition continued several days in sullen retirement to prepare an in flammatory memorial which he transmitted to the Imperial court Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus the praefect condescended to take his seat in council but his first step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate importing that the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy and threatening that he himself would punish his delay or hesitation by suspending the usual allow ance of his household The nephew and daughter of Constantine who could ill brook the insolence of a subject expressed their resentment by instantly delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard The quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommoda tion They were rendered impracticable by the im

resistance he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the tribune Scudilo who under the semblance of a rough soldier disguised the most artful insinuation and he de pended on the credit of his

apprehensions from the world and perhaps from himself he entertained the people of Constantinople with an exhibition of the games of the circus The progress of the jour ney might however have warned him of the im pending danger In all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence commissioned to seize the offices of government to observe his motions and to prevent the hasty sallies of his despair The persons despatched to secure the provinces which he left behind passed him with cold salutations or affected disdain and the troops whose station lay along the public road were studiously removed on his approach lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war After Gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few days at Hadrianople he received a mandate expressed in the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 121 most haughty and absolute style that his splendid chap retinue should halt in that city while the Cassar him XVL self with only ten post

familiarity and Gallus who dis covered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards and might soon be employed as his executioners began to accuse his fatal rashness and to recollect with ter ror and remorse the conduct by which he had pro voked his fate The dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved was laid aside at Petovjo in Pannonia He was conducted to a palace in the suburbs where the general Barbatio with a select band of soldiers who could neither be moved by pity nor corrupted by rewards expected the arrival of his illustrious victim In the close of the evening he was arrested ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Cassar and hurried away to Pola in Istria a sequestered prison which had been so recently polluted with royal blood The horror which he felt was soon increased by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius who with the assistance of a notary and a tribune proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the East The Cajsar sunk under the weight of shame and guilt confessed all the cri minal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged and by imputing them to the advice of his wife exasperated the indignation of Constantius who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination The emperor was easily convinced that his own

Barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an atonement for the past and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct The generous courtesy which was shown to the first among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Constantius encouraged the more timid or the more obstinate to imitate their example and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains While Constantius gave laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube he distinguished with specious compassion the Sarmatian exiles who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi The emperor embracing a generous but artful system of policy released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating de pendence and restored them by a separate treaty to the dignity of a nation united under the govern ment of a king the friend and ally of the republic He declared his resolution of asserting the justice of their cause and of securing the peace of the pro vinces by the extirpation or at least the banishment of the Limigantes whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin The execu tion of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory The territory of the Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss The marshy lands which lay between those rivers and were often k 3 THE DECLINE AND FALL  covered by their inundations formed an intricate wilderness pervious only to the inhabitants who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses On the approach of Constantius the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers of fraud and of arms but he sternly rejected their suppli cations defeated their rude stratagems and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valour One of their most warlike tribes established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss and the Danube consented to pass the river with the intention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference They soon be came the victims of the perfidy which they meditated Encompassed on every side trampled down by the cavalry slaughtered by the swords of the legions they disdained to ask for mercy and with an un daunted countenance

of the empire invaded the Limigantes on the side of the Teyss and their former masters the free Sarmatians animated by hope and revenge penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians which were seated in the depth of the wilderness and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground which it was dangerous for him to tread In this extremity the bravest of the Li migantes were resolved to die in arms rather than to yield but the milder sentiment enforced by the authority of their elders at length prevailed and the suppliant crowd followed by their wives and children repaired to the Imperial camp to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror After OF THE ROMAN EMPIHE 135

country where they might enjoy a safe and honourable repose The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance but before they could reach at least before they could occupy their destined habitations they returned to the banks of the Danube exaggerating the hardships of their situation and requesting with fervent professions of fidelity that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the Ro man provinces Instead of consulting his own ex perience of their incurable perfidy Constantius list ened to his flatterers who were ready to represent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire The Limigantes were permitted to pass the

when one of the Bar barians casting his shoe into the air exclaimed with a loud voice Marha Marha a word of defiance which was received as the signal of the tumult They rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands but the faithful defence of his guards who died at his feet allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse and to

a secret negotiation with the Satrap Tamsapor These overtures of peace translated into the servile and flattering language of Asia were transmitted to the camp of the Great King who resolved to signify by an ambassador the terms which he was inclined to grant to the sup pliant Romans Narses whom he invested with that character was honourably received in his passage through Antioch and Constantinople he reached Sirmium after a long journey and at his first audi ence respectfully unfolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign Sapor King of Kings and Brother of the Sun and Moon such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity expressed his satisfaction that his brother Constantius C sar had been taught wisdom by adversity As OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 137 the lawful successor of Darius Hystaspes Sapor as chap serted that the river Strymon in Macedonia was the XVL true and ancient boundary of his empire declaring however that as an evidence of his moderation he would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia which had been fraudulently ex torted from his ancestors He alleged that without the restitution of these disputed countries it was im possible to establish any treaty on a solid and per manent basis and he arrogantly threatened that if his ambassador returned in vain he was prepared to take the field in the spring and to support the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms Narses who was endowed with the most polite and amiable manners endeavoured as far as was consistent with his duty to soften the harshness of the message Both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the Imperial council and he was dismissed with the following answer Constantius had a right to dis claim the officiousness of his ministers who had acted without any specific orders from the throne he was not however averse to an equal and ho nourable treaty  but it was highly indecent as well as absurd to propose to the sole and victorious emperor of the Roman world the same conditions  of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time when his power was contracted within the nar row limits of the East the chance of arms was uncertain and Sapor should recollect that if the Romans had sometimes been vanquished in battle they had almost always been successful in the event of a war A few days after the departure of Narses three ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor who was already returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary residence of Ctesiphon A count a notary and a sophist had been selected for this important commission and Constantius 138 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the XVI peace entertained some hopes that the dignity of the first of these ministers the dexterity of the second and the rhetoric of the third would persuade the Persian monarch to abate the rigour of his demands But the progress of their negotiation was opposed and defeated by the hostile arts of Antoninus a Roman subject of Syria who had fled from oppression and was admitted into the councils of Sapor and even to the royal table where according to the custom of the Persians the most important business was frequently discussed The dexterous fugitive promoted his interest by the same conduct which gratified his re venge He incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the favourable opportunity when the bravest of the Palatine troops were em ployed with the emperor in a distant war on the Da nube He pressed Sapor to invade the exhausted and defenceless provinces of the East with the numerous armies of Persia now fortified by the alliance and accession of the fiercest Barbarians The ambassadors of

they incessantly returned to the charge they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter and two rebel legions of Gauls who had been banished into the East signalized their undisciplined courage

the same time constructed and moved forwards on wheels till the soldiers who were provided with every species of missile weapons could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart Every mode of resistance which art could suggest or courage could execute was employed in the defence of Amida and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed by the fire of the Romans But the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted The Persians repaired their losses and pushed their approaches a large breach was made by the battering ram and the strength of the garrison wasted by the sword and by disease yielded to the fury of the assault The soldiers the citizens their wives their children all who had not time to escape through the opposite gate were involved by the conquerors in a promiscuous massacre of Sin But the ruin of Amida was the safety of the Roman gara c     a d 360 provinces As soon as the first transports of victory had subsided Sapor was at leisure to reflect that to chastise a disobedient city he had lost the flower of his troops and the most favourable season for con quest Thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of Amida during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventy three days and the disappointed monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification It was more than probable that the inconstancy of his Bar barian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 143 and that the aged king of the Chionites satiated chap with revenge turned away with horror from a scene XV1 of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation The strength as well as spirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the ensuing spring was no longer equal to the un bounded views of his ambition Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East he was obliged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified cities of Mesopotamia Singara and Bezabde  the one situate in the midst of a sandy desert the other in a small peninsula surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the Tigris Five Roman legions of the diminutive size to which they had been reduced in the age of Constantine were made pri soners and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Persia After dismantling the walls of Singara the conqueror abandoned that solitary and sequestered place but he carefully restored the for tifications of Bezabde and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of veterans amply supplied with every means of defence and animated by high sentiments of honour and fidelity Towards the close of the campaign the arms of Sapor incurred some disgrace by an

parade of military exercise and moved to the sound of flutes in the Pyrrhic dance the public defence was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former general of the East But whenever Ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations when he proposed at the head of a light and active army to wheel round the foot of the mountains to intercept the convoys of the enemy to harass the wide extent of the Persian lines and to relieve the distress of Amida the timid and envious commander alleged that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops Amida was at length taken its bravest de fenders who had escaped the sword of the Barba rians died in the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner and Ursicinus himself after supporting the disgrace of a partial inquiry was punished for the misconduct of Sabinian by the loss of his military rank But Constantius soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had ex torted from his injured lieutenant that as long as such maxims of government were suffered to prevail the emperor himself would find it no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy When he had subdued or pacified the Barbarians of the Danube Constantius proceeded OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE 145 by slow marches into the East and after he had chap wept over the smoking ruins of Amida he formed XVL with a powerful army the siege of Bezabde The walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the battering rams the town was reduced to the last extremity but it was still de fended by the patient and intrepid valour of the gar rison till the approach of the rainy season obliged the emperor to raise the siege and ingloriously to retreat into his winter quarters at Antioch The pride of Constantius and the ingenuity of his cour tiers were at a loss to discover any materials for panegyric in the events of the Persian war while the glory of his cousin Julian to whose military com mand he had intrusted the provinces of Gaul was proclaimed to the world in the simple and concise narrative of his exploits In the blind fury of civil discord

service had thus imprudently pro voked the rapacious spirit of the Barbarians soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies after they had tasted the richness of the Roman soil Regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion these undisci plined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any pro perty

a rude and hasty fortification of large trees which were felled and thrown across the roads The Alemanni were established in the mo dern countries of Alsace and Lorraine the Franks occupied the island

of their devastations was three times more extensive than that of their con quests At a still greater distance the open towns of Gaul were deserted and the inhabitants of the for tified cities who trusted to their strength and vigil ance were obliged to content themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the inclosure of their walls The di minished

and when he awkwardly re XV1 peated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn he exclaimed with a sigh O Plato Plato what a task for a philosopher Yet even this speculative philosophy which men of busi ness are too apt to despise had filled the mind of Julian with the noblest precepts and the most shin ing examples had animated him with the love of virtue the desire of fame and the contempt of death The habits of temperance recommended in the schools are still more essential in the severe discipline of a camp The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep Rejecting with dis dain the delicacies provided for his table he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers During the rigour of a Gallic winter he never suffered a fire in his bed chamber and after a short and interrupted slumber he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor to despatch any urgent business to visit his rounds or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favourite studies  The precepts of eloquence which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude and although Julian from his early habits of conversation and literature was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language he had attained a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue Since Julian was not originally designed for the character of a legislator or a judge it is probable that the â

considerable share of his attention but he de rived from his philosophic studies an inflexible re gard for justice tempered by a disposition to cle mency the knowledge of the general principles of equity and evidence and the faculty of patiently in vestigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be proposed for his discussion The measures of policy and the operations of war must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and character and the unpractised student will often be perplexed in the application of the most perfect theory But in the acquisition of this important science Julian was assisted by the active vigour of his own genius as well as by the wisdom and ex perience of Sallust an officer of rank who soon con ceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friendship and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear His first Immediately after Julian had received the purple S ofau 1 at Milan he was sent into Gaul with a feeble re A d 356 tinue of three hundred and sixty soldiers At Vienna where he passed a painful and anxious win ter

by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison was saved by the generous resolution of a few vete rans who resumed their arms for the defence of their country In his march from Autun through the heart of the Gallic provinces Julian embraced with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage At the head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry he preferred the shorter but the more

and rainy day poured with unexpected fury on the rear guard of the Romans Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied two legions were destroyed and Ju lian was taught by experience that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war In a second and more successful action he recovered and established his military fame but as the agility of the Barbarians saved them from the pursuit his victory was neither bloody nor decisive He advanced however to the banks of the Rhine surveyed the ruins of Cologne convinced himself of the difficulties of the war and retreated on the ap proach of winter discontented with the court with his army and with his own success The power of the enemy was yet unbroken and the Caesar had no sooner separated his troops and fixed his own m quarters at Sens in the centre of Gaul than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of Germans Reduced in this extremity to the re sources of his own mind he displayed a prudent

an insult his person and au thority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions which received a very specious colour from his past conduct towards the princes of the Flavian family Marcellus was re called and gently dismissed from his office In his room Severus was

manni pressed on either side by the Roman arms chap would be soon forced to evacuate the provinces of XVI Gaul and to hasten to the defence of their native country But the hopes of the campaign were de feated by the incapacity or the envy or the secret instructions of Barbatio who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caesar and the secret ally of the Barbarians The negligence with which he per mitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass and to re turn almost before the gates of his camp may be imputed to his want of abilities but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats and a superfluous stock of provisions which would have been of the most essential service to the army of Gaul was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions The Germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them and the ignominious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected support and left him to extricate himself from a hazardous situation where he could neither remain with safety nor retire with honour  As soon as they were delivered from the fears of Battle of invasion the Alemanni prepared to chastise the a euiot Roman

general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the Ale manni The Romans marched in close order and in two columns the cavalry on the right the in fantry on the left and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy that Julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refresh ments of sleep and food Yielding however with some reluctance to the clamours of the soldiers and even to the opinion of his council he exhorted them to justify by their valour the eager impatience which in case of a defeat would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presump tion The trumpets sounded the military shout was heard through the field and the two armies rushed with equal fury to the charge The Caesar who conducted in person his right wing depended on the dexterity of his archers and the weight of his cuirassiers But his ranks were instantly broken by an irregular mixture of light horse and of light in fantry and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of his most renowned cuirassiers The fugitives were stopped and rallied by the presence and authority of Julian who careless of his own safety threw himself before them and urging every OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 153

readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge His third expedition was still more splendid and im portant than the two former The Germans had collected their military powers and moved along the opposite banks of the river with a design of de stroying the bridge and of preventing the passage of the Romans But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion Three hundred light armed and active soldiers were detached in forty small boats to fall down the stream in silence and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity that they had almost surprised the Bar barian chiefs who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation it is sufficient to ob serve that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a Roman camp Fol lowed by twenty thousand captives whom he had rescued from the chains of the Barbarians the

gant a fable was incapable however of deceiving the public credulity or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself Secretly conscious that the applause and favour of the Romans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants who coloured their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candour Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian they acknowledged and even exaggerated his popular fame superior talents and important services But they darkly insinuated that the virtues of the Csesar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his alle giance by the hopes of revenge and independent Fears and greatness The personal fears of Constantius were coZtantius interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety for the

Paris in the administration of power which in his hands was the exercise of virtue he was sur prised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary with positive orders from the emperor which they were directed to execute and he was commanded not to oppose Constantius signified his pleasure that four entire legions the Celtae and Petulants the Heruli and the Batavians should be separated from the standard of Julian under which they had acquired their fame and discipline that in each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths should be selected and that this numerous detachment the strength of the Gallic army should instantly begin their march and exert their utmost diligence to arrive before the opening of the cam paign on the frontiers of Persia The Caesar fore saw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate Most of the auxiliaries who engaged their voluntary service had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps The public faith of Rome and the personal honour of Julian had been pledged for the observance of this condition Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence and excite the resent ment of the independent warriors of Germany who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions The legionaries who enjoyed the title and privileges of

families and friends The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable dan ger As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength the Germans would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears and notwithstanding the abilities and valour of Julian the general of a nominal army to whom the public calamities would be imputed must find himself after a vain resistance either a prisoner in the camp of the Barbarians or a criminal in the palace of Con stantius If Julian complied with the orders which he had received he subscribed his own destruction and that of a people who deserved his affection But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a de claration of war The inexorable jealousy of the emperor the peremptory and perhaps insidious nature of his commands left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation and the depend ent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate Solitude increased the per plexity of Julian he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers who would have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul The moment had been chosen when Lupicinus  â The danger

ministers he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay and reserve for them the merit of the execution Unable to resist unwilling to comply Julian ex pressed in the most serious terms his wish

advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair or loud lamentations while the wives of the soldiers holding their infants in their arms accused the desertion of their husbands in the mixed language of grief of tenderness and of indignation This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the Caesar

murmurs which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition and by the connivance of their tribunes a seasonable libel was secretly dis persed which painted in lively colours the disgrace of the Caesar the oppression of the Gallic army and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia The servants of Constantius were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit They pressed the Caesar to hasten the departure of the troops but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious

resort to his standard and that the rich mines of gold and silver would con tribute to the expenses of the civil war He pro posed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the sol diers inspired them with a just confidence in their general and in themselves and exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy moderate to their fellow citizens and obe dient to their officers His spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations and the same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius when he summoned them to leave Gaul now declared with alacrity that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or Asia The oath of fidelity was administered and the soldiers clash ing their shields and pointing their  drawn swords to their throats devoted themselves with horrid impre cations to the service of a leader whom they cele brated as the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror of the Germans This solemn engagement which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty was singly opposed by Nebridius who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect That faithful minister alone and unassisted asserted the rights of Constantius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude to whose fury he had almost fallen an honourable but useless sacrifice After losing one of his hands by the stroke of a sword he

through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum A similar division of troops under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways through the Alps and the northern confines of Italy The instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and prep cision to hasten their march in close and compact columns which according to the disposition of the ground might readily be changed into any order of battle to secure themselves against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival to elude examination by their sudden departure to spread the opinion of their strength and the terror of his name and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium For himself Julian had reserved

course without reflecting whether he traversed the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians and at length emerged between Ratisbon and Vienna at the place where he designed to embark his troops on the Danube By a well concerted stratagem he seized a fleet of light brigantines as it lay at anchor secured a supply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate but voracious appetite of a Gallic army and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube The labours of his mariners who plied their oars with incessant diligence and the steady continuance of a favourable wind carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days  and he had already disembarked his troops at Bono nia only nineteen miles from Sirmium before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine In the course of this long and rapid navigation the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise and though he accepted the deputation of some cities which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission he passed before the hostile stations which were placed along the river without indulging the temptation of signalizing an useless and ill timed valour The banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators who gazed on the military pomp  Zosimus alone 1 iii p 156 has specified this interesting circumstance OP THE ROMAN

believe He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus an active officer whom Julian as soon as he landed at Bononia had pushed forwards with some light infantry The captive general uncertain of his life or death was hastily thrown upon a horse and conducted to the presence of Julian who kindly raised him from the ground and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupify his faculties But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want of discretion by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured with a handful of men to expose his person in the midst of his enemies Reserve for your master Constantius these timid remonstrances replied Julian with a smile of contempt when I gave you my purple to kiss I received you not as a counsellor but as a suppliant Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt and that boldness only could command success he instantly advanced at the head of three thousand soldiers to attack the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium he was received by the joyful acclamations of the army and people who crowned with flowers and holding lighted tapers in their hands conducted their ac knowledged sovereign to his Imperial residence Two days were devoted to the public joy which was n 3 182 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap celebrated by the games of the Circus but early on XVIL the morning of the third day Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of

declivity on the side of the latter The defence of this important post was intrusted to the brave Nevitta who as well as the generals of the Italian division successfully exe cuted the plan of the march and junction which their master had so ably conceived Hejustifies The homage which Julian obtained from the fears his cause  n or the inclination of the people extended far beyond the immediate

Disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt Constan tius professed his intention of returning into Europe and of giving chase to Julian for he never spoke of this military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party In the camp of Hierapolis in Syria he communicated this design to his army slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Csesar and ventured to assure them that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed to meet them in the field they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset The

Sirmium but he suspected with reason the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the em peror and it was thought expedient under the pre tence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier to dismiss them from the most important scene of ac tion They advanced with reluctance as far as the confines of Italy but as they dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the Germans they resolved by the instigation of one of their tri bunes to halt at Aquileia and to erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the extent of the mischief and the necessity of applying an im mediate remedy By his order Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy and the siege of Aqui leia was formed with diligence and prosecuted with vigour But the legionaries who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline conducted the de fence of the place with skill and perseverance in r vited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their courage and loyalty and threatened the retreat of Julian if he should be forced to yield to the supe rior numbers of the armies of the East But the humanity of Julian was preserved from corT the cruel alternative which he pathetically laments stantius of destroying or of being himself destroyed and nov s the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman empire from the calamities of civil war The approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch and his favourites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge A slight fever which was

merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity the last of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world with the remark that he inherited the defects without the abilities of his father Before Constantius expired he is said to have named Julian for his successor nor does it seem improbable that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife whom he left with child may have pre vailed in his last moments over the harsher pas sions of hatred and revenge Eusebius and his guilty associates made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs by the election of another emperor but their intrigues were rejected with dis dain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord and two officers of rank were instantly despatched to assure Julian that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service The mili tary designs of that prince who had formed three different attacks against Thrace were prevented by this fortunate event Without shedding the blood of his fellow citizens he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict and acquired the advantages of a complete victory Impatient to visit the place of his birth and the new capital

the funeral as far as the church of the Holy Apostles where the body was deposited and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his Im perial

to the dangers of Imperial greatness and to make himself accountable to the world and to pos terity for the happiness of millions  Julian re pollected with terror the observation of his master Plato that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior species and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the Gods or of the Genii From this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part that he should extinguish his appetites enlighten his understanding regulate his passions and subdue the wild beast which according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot The throne of Julian which the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis was the seat of reason of virtue and perhaps of vanity He despised the honours renounced the pleasures and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem had they been obliged

more rapidly than they could be taken in short hand by the diligence of his secretaries He possessed such flexibility of thought and such firmness of at tention that he could employ his hand to write his ear to listen and his voice to dictate and pursue at once three several trains of ideas without hesita tion and without error While his ministers re Â  posed the prince flew with agility from one labour to another and after a hasty dinner retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to inter rupt the prosecution of his studies The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion and except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female companion He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries who had slept the pre ceding day and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupations The predecessors of Julian his uncle his brother and his cousin

greatest part of the day as idle spectators and as a XVIL part of the splendid spectacle till the ordinary round of twenty four races was completely finished On solemn festivals Julian who felt and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements condescended to appear in the Circus and after bestowing a careless glance on five or six of the races he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philo sopher who considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind By this avarice of time he seemed to protract

his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue was distinguished by the op pressive magnificence of his dress his table his buildings and his train The stately palaces erected by Constantine and his

fish from the most re mote seas fruits out of their natural season winter roses and summer snows The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions yet the smallest part of this

even titular employments and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained without the ne cessity of labour from the public revenue The waste of an enormous household the increase of fees and perquisites which were soon claimed as a lawful debt and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favour suddenly enriched these haughty menials They abused their fortune without considering their past or their future condition and their rapine and ve nality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations Their

the contempt and indignation of Julian who usually slept on the ground who yielded with re luctance to the indispensable calls of nature and who placed his vanity not in emulating but in de spising the pomp of royalty By the total extirpa tion of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent he was impatient to relieve the di stress and to appease the murmurs of the people who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state But in the execution of this salutary work Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderate severity By a single edict he reduced the palace of Constantinople to an immense desert and dis missed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependents without providing any just or at least benevolent exceptions for the age the services or the poverty of the faithful domestics of the Im perial family Such indeed was the temper of Ju lian who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics the curls and paint the collars and bracelets which had appeared so ridiculous in the person of Constantine were con sistently rejected by his philosophic successor But with the fopperies Julian affected to renounce the decencies of dress and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness In a satirical performance which was designed for the public eye the emperor descants with pleasure and even with pride on the  length of his nails and the inky blackness of his hands protests that although the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 1 3 greatest part of his body was covered with hair the chap

those men should be oppressed they are accused and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial To conduct this inquiry Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemn ing his personal enemies he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence without delay and without appeal The  â    In the Misopogon p 338 339 he draws a very singular picture of him self and the following

seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench was supposed to possess the secret of the commission the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands encompassed the tribunal and the

Taurus the faithful minister when he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign But the guilt of Florentius justified

Antioch Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province Gaudentius had long practised the arts of calumny against the innocent the virtuous and even the person of Julian himself Yet the cir cumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed that these wicked men obtained in the public opinion the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of Constantius The rest of his servants were protected by a general act of oblivion and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had accepted either to defend the oppressed or to oppress the friendless This measure which on the soundest principles of policy may deserve our appro bation was executed in a manner which seemed to Ammion xx 7 o 2 196 THE

hero could despise the ambitious projects which Surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a purple garment and this indiscreet

after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise instead of a death of torture which they deserved and expected pronounced a sentence of exile against the two prin cipal

in the empire A motive of superstition pre vented the execution of the design which Julian had frequently meditated of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem but he absolutely refused the title of Dominus or Lord a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin The office or rather the name of consul was cherished by a prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic and the same behaviour which had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by Julian from choice and a d 363 inclination On the calends of January at break of Jan  day the new consuls Mamertinus and Nevitta has tened to the palace to salute the emperor As soon as he was informed of their approach he leaped from his throne eagerly advanced to meet them and com pelled the blushing magistrates to receive the demon strations of his affected humility From the palace they proceeded to the senate The emperor on foot marched before their litters and the gazing multi tude admired the image of ancient times or secretly blamed a conduct which in their eyes degraded the majesty of the purple But the behaviour of Julian was uniformly supported During the games of the Circus he had imprudently or designedly performed the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold and embraced this public occasion of declaring  That sentiment is expressed almost in

spirit of his administration and his regard for the place of his nativity induced Julian to confer on the senate of Constantinople the same honours privileges and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome A legal fiction was introduced and gradually established that one half of the national council had migrated into the East and the despotic successors of Julian accepting the title of senators acknowledged them selves the members of a respectable body which was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name From Constantinople the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of ih provinces He abolished by repeated edicts the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had with drawn so many idle citizens from the service of their country and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties he restored the strength the splendour or according to the glowing expression of Libanius the soul of the expiring cities of his empire The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender His care of compassion in the mind of Julian which kindled cities 16â 1 into rapture when he recollected the gods the heroes and the men superior to heroes and to gods who had bequeathed to the latest posterity the mo numents of their genius or the example of their vir tues He relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor Argos for her deliverer The pride of Corinth again rising from her ruins with the honours of a Roman colony exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics for the purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus which  Zosimus 1 iii p 158 o 4 THE DECLINE AND FALL cmap were celebrated in the amphitheatre with the hunting XVI1  of bears and panthers From this tribute the cities of Elis of Delphi and of Argos which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of per petuating the Olympic the Pythian and the Nemean games claimed a just exemption The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians but the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided Seven years after this sentence Julian allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal and his eloquence was interposed most probably with success in the defence of a city which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon and had given to Macedonia a race of kings and con querors Julian an The laborious administration of military and civil judge affairs which were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire exercised the abilities of Julian but he frequently assumed the two characters of orator and of judge which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe The arts of per suasion so diligently cultivated by the first Caesars were neglected by the military ignorance and Asiatic pride of their successors and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers whom they feared they treated with silent disdain the senators whom they despised The assemblies of the senate which Con stantius had avoided were considered by Julian as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a republican and the ta lents of a rhetorician He alternately practised as in a school of declamation the several modes of praise of censure of exhortation and his friend Libanius has remarked that the study of Homer OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 201 taught him to imitate the simple concise style of chap Menelaus the copiousness of Nestor whose words XVI1 descended like the flakes of a winter s snow or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses The functions of a judge which are sometimes incompati ble with those of a prince were exercised by Julian not only as a duty but as an amusement and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian prasfects he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates who laboured to disguise the truth of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws He some times forgot the gravity of his station asked indis creet or unseasonable questions and betrayed by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges the advocates and their clients But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage and even to solicit the reproof of his friends and ministers and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions the spectators could observe the shame as well as the gratitude of their monarch The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on the princi ples of justice and he had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the specious forms of compassion and equity He decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties and the poor whom he wished to relieve were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a noble and wealthy adversary He carefully distin guished the judge from the

irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory or the  See Appendix at the end of the volume 204 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap shame of a repulse to violate the laws of prudence XVIIL and even of justice The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from the early period of his life when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family The names of Christ and of Constantius the ideas of slavery and of religion were soon asso ciated in a youthful imagination which was suscepti ble of the most lively impressions The care of his infancy was intrusted to Eusebius the Arian bishop of Nicomedia who was related to him on the side of his mother He was educated in the Lesser Asia amidst the scandals of the Arian controversy The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops the incessant alterations of their creeds and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian that they nei ther understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended Instead of listening to the proofs of Christianity with that favourable atten tion which adds weight to the most respectable evi dence he heard with suspicion and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion The creed which Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions and by a strange contradiction he disdained the salutary yoke of the Gospel whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo One of the orations of Julian is consecrated to the honour of Cybele the mother of the gods who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian boy The pious emperor condescends to relate without abhish and without a smile the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tybcr OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 205 and the stupendous miracle which convinced the chap senate and people of Rome that the lump of clay xviIL which their ambassadors had transported over the seas was endowed with life and sentiment and divine power For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments of the city and censures with some acrimony the sickly and affected taste of those men who impertinently derided the sacred traditions of their ancestors But as those traditions of pagan mythology were variously related the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances and as they trans lated an arbitrary cipher they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to their favourite system of religion and philosophy The lascivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery of some moral precept or some phy sical truth and the indecent fable of Atys ex plained the revolution of the sun between the tropics or the separation of the human soul from vice and error t By the hands of Maximus the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic science Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus in the twentieth year of his age His residence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis which amidst the general decay of the Graecian worship still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity and such was the zeal of Julian that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul for the

the senses or the imagina tion of the credulous aspirant till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light In the caverns of Ephesus and Eleusis the mind of Julian was penetrated with sin cere deep and unalterable enthusiasm though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed or at least suspected in the characters of the most con scientious fanatics From that moment he conse crated his life to the service of the gods and while the occupations of war of government and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time a stated portion of the hours of the night was in variably reserved for the exercise of private devotion The temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious ab stinence and it was in honour of Pan or Mercury of Hecate or Isis that Julian on particular days denied himself the use of some particular food which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities By these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honoured by the celestial powers Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian him self we may learn from his faithful friend the orator Libanius that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses that they descended OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 207 upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their fa chap vourite hero that they gently interrupted his slum XVIH bers by touching his hand or his hair that they warned him of every impending danger and con ducted him by their infallible wisdom in every action of his life and that he had acquired such an inti mate knowledge of his heavenly guests as readily to distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules  The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy and his death could alone have ap peased the just apprehensions of the Christians But the young prince who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr consulted his safety by dis sembling his religion and the easy temper of poly theism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a sub ject not of censure but of praise The dissimulation of Julian lasted above ten years from his secret initiation at Ephesus to the begin ning of the civil war when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of Con stants This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting on solemn festi vals at the assemblies of the Christians Julian re turned with the impatience of a lover to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury But as every act of dis simulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit  the profession of Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion which oppressed the freedom of his mind and compelled him to hold a conduct â

to justify his dissent from Christianity which was supported by the number of its converts by the chain of prophecy the splendour of miracles and the weight of evidence The ela borate work  which he composed amidst the pre parations of the Persian war contained the substance of those arguments which he had long revolved in his mind Some fragments have been transcribed and preserved by his

his writings to the public attention and in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of Julian The minds of the

perhaps with impatience that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods But the hopes as well as the fears of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the prudent humanity of a prince who was careful of his own fame of the public peace and of the rights of mankind Actuated by these motives and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign Julian surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration As soon as he ascended the throne he assumed according to the custom of his predecessors the cha racter of Supreme Pontiff not only as the most honourable title of Imperial greatness but as a sacred and important office the duties of which he was re solved to execute with pious diligence Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch distin guished by the splendour of his purple and encom passed by the golden shields of his guards Julian solicited with respectful eagerness the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests of inferior ministers and of female dancers who were dedicated to the service of the Temple it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood to blow the fire to handle the knife to slaughter the victim vol ii r THE DECLINE AND FALL and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal to draw forth the heart or liver and to read with the consummate skill of an ha ruspex the imaginary signs of future events The wisest of the Pagans censured this extravagant su perstition which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency Under the reign of a prince who practised the rigid maxims of economy the expense of religious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates to bleed on the altars of the gods a hundred oxen were frequently sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day and it soon be came a popular jest that if he should return with conquest from the Persian war the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished Julian chose his favourites among the sages who were deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divina tion and every impostor who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity was assured of enjoying the present hour in honour and affluence Among the philosophers Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of his royal disciple who communicated with unreserved confidence his ac tions his sentiments and his religious designs dur ing the anxious suspense of the civil war As soon as Julian had taken possession of the palace of Con stantinople he despatched an honourable and press ing invitation to Maximus who then resided at Sardes in Lydia with Chrysanthius the associate of his art and studies The prudent and super stitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed itself according to the rules of di vination with the most threatening and malignant aspect but his companion whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast persisted in his interrogations till he OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE had extorted from the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes and those of the emperor The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of philosophic vanity and the magistrates vied with each other in the honourable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse advanced to meet him and after a tender embrace conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly where he publicly acknowledged the be nefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher Maximus  who soon acquired the confidence and influenced the councils of Julian was insensibly corrupted by the temptations of a court His dress became more splendid his de meanour more lofty and he was exposed under a succeeding reign to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato had accumu lated in the short duration of his favour a very scandalous proportion of wealth Of the other phi losophers and sophists who were invited to the Im perial residence by the choice of Julian or by the success of Maximus few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation The liberal gifts of money lands and houses were insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions The penetration of Julian could not always be de ceived but he was unwilling to despise the charac ters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem  Eunapius in Maximo p

and he was apprehensive of degrading in the eyes of the profane the honour of letters and of religion Conver The favour of Julian was almost equally divided Mons between the Pagans who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors and the Christians who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign The acquisition of new proselytes gratified the ruling passions of his soul superstition and vanity and he was heard to declare with the enthusiasm of a mis sionary that if he could render each individual richer than Midas and every city greater than Ba bylon he should not esteem himself the benefactor of mankind unless at the same time he could re claim his subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods A prince who had studied human nature and who possessed the treasures of the Roman empire could adapt his arguments his promises and his rewards to every order of Chris tians and the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects of a candidate or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal As the army is the most forcible engine of absolute power Julian applied himself with peculiar diligence to corrupt the religion of his troops without whose hearty con currence every measure must be dangerous and un successful and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the faith as well as to the fortunes of their victorious leader and even before the death of Constantius he had the satisfaction of announcing to his friends that they assisted with fervent devotion and voracious appe tite at the sacrifices which were repeatedly offered in his camp of whole hecatombs of fat oxen The armies of the East which had been trained under OF THE

homage and rewarded the merit of the troops His throne of state was en circled with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic the holy name of Christ was erazed from the Labarum and the symbols of war of majesty and of pagan superstition were so dexterously blended that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry when he respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign The soldiers passed successively in review and each of them before he received from the hand of Julian a liberal donative proportioned to his rank and services was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar Some Christian confessors might resist and others might repent but the far greater num ber allured by the prospect of gold and awed by the presence of the emperor contracted the criminal engagement and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was enforced by every consider ation of duty and of interest By the frequent re petition of these arts and at the expense of sums which would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia Julian gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of the gods and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman legions It is indeed more than probable that the restoration and encouragement of Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians who from mo tives of temporal advantage had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign and who afterwards returned with the same flexibility of conscience to the faith which was professed by the successors of Julian

blind superstition and abject slavery of those un fortunate exiles must excite the contempt of a philo sophic emperor but they deserved the friendship of Julian by their implacable hatred of the Christian name The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the fecundity of the rebellious church the power of the Jews was not equal to their malice but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder of an apostate and their seditious clamours had often awakened the indolence of the pagan magistrates Under the reign of Constantine the Jews became the subjects of their revolted children nor was it

St Babylas was demolished and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings But the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living Christians who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm The scene of infection was purified according to the forms

filled by a prince of a very different cha racter he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures towards a negotiation of peace But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Meso potamia and who added with a smile of contempt that it was needless to treat by ambassadors as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations The generals were named a formidable army was destined for this important service and Julian marching from Con stantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor ar rived at Antioch about eight months after the death of

advice of his wisest friends who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter quarters to restore the exhausted strength of the 240 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap legions of Gaul and the discipline and spirit of the XIx Eastern troops Julian was persuaded to fix till the Julian pro ensuing spring his residence at Antioch among a Constat people maliciously disposed to deride

mutual satisfaction to the prince and tfodfAn People ne ma ie a very false estimate of his own character and of the manners of Antioch The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opu lence and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Sy rians Fashion was the only law pleasure the only pursuit and the splendour of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch The arts of luxury were honoured the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age an nounced the universal corruption of the capital of the East The love of spectacles was the taste or rather passion of the Syrians the most skilful artists were procured from the adjacent cities a consider able share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the hap piness and as the glory of Antioch The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory and was insensible of such happiness soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate nor admire the severe sim plicity which Julian always maintained and some times affected The days of festivity consecrated by ancient custom to the honour of the gods were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed his philo sophic severity and those festivals were the only OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 241 days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject chap the allurements of pleasure X1X The strongest prejudice was entertained against Their aver the character of an apostate the enemy and successor juiia n Of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very

steps from Constantinople to Antioch and the discon tent of a hungry people was exasperated by the in judicious attempt to relieve their distress The in scarcity of clemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria and the price of bread in the markets ofcontent Antioch had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of com But the fair and reasonable pro portion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly In this unequal contest in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his exclusive property is used by another as a lucrative object of trade and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of life all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish Julian publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine oil and bread but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people With this salutary view the emperor ven tured on a very dangerous and doubtful step of fixing by legal authority the value of corn He enacted that in a time of scarcity it should be sold at a VOL II R THE DECLINE AND FALL price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years and that his own example might strengthen his laws he sent into the market four hundred and twenty two thousand modii or mea sures which were drawn by his order from the grana ries of Hierapolis of Chalcis and even of Egypt The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from the city the accustomed sup ply and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price Julian still continued to applaud his own policy treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy though not the cruelty of his brother Gallus The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his in flexible mind He was persuaded perhaps with truth that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands or were concerned in trade had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense not of public duty but of private interest The whole body consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens were sent under a guard from the palace to the prison and though they were permitted before the close of evening to return to their respective houses the emperor him self could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints which were in dustriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks During the licentious days of the Saturnalia the streets of the city resounded with in solent songs which derided the laws the religion the personal conduct and even the beard of the Of THE ROMAN EMPIRE 243 emperor and the spirit of Antioch was manifested chap by the connivance of the magistrates and the ap X1x plause of the multitude The disciple of Socrates was too deeply affected by these popular insults but the monarch endowed with quick sensibility and possessed of absolute power refused his passions the gratification of revenge A tyrant might have pro scribed without distinction the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch and the unwarlike Sy rians must have patiently submitted to the lust the rapaciousness and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honours and privileges and the courtiers perhaps the subjects of Julian would have applauded an act of justice which asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic But instead of abusing or

dangerous sophist and gradually surpassed in the perfect imitation of his style the most laborious of his domestic pupils  When Julian ascended the throne he declared his impatience to embrace and

reserve their esteem for the su perior qualities of the mind with which they them selves are so plentifully endowed Julian might dis dain the acclamations of a venal court who adored the Imperial purple but he was deeply flattered by the praise the admonition the freedom and the envy of an independent philosopher who refused his favours loved his person celebrated his fame and protected his memory The voluminous writings of Libanius still exist for the most part they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator who culti vated the science of words the productions of a recluse student whose mind regardless of his con temporaries was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence he praised the virtues of his own times he boldly arraigned the abuses of public and private life and he eloquently pleaded the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius It is the common calamity of old age to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable but Libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences to which he had consecrated his genius The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity and his bigotry which darkened the prospect of the visible world did not inspire Li banius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and happiness r 3 246 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap The martial impatience of Julian urged him to XIX take

Christian who received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the elo quent sermon of the apostle of paganism The em peror was received in a manner much more agreeable to his wishes at Batnae a small town pleasantly seated in a grove of cypresses about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities Apollo and Jupiter but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause and he too clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion The ancient and magni ficent temple which had sanctified for so many ages the city of Hierapolis no longer subsisted and the consecrated wealth which afforded a liberal main tenance to more than three hundred priests might hasten its downfal Yet Julian enjoyed the satis faction of embracing a philosopher and a friend whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of Constantius and Gallus as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through Hierapolis In the hurry of military preparation and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform He had now undertaken an important and difficult war and the

city of Mesopotamia at the distance of fourscore miles from Hierapolis The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of Julian but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing the

They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy before they at tempted the passage of the Tigris Their subse quent operations were left to the discretion of the generals but Julian expected that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon about the same time that he himself ad vancing with equal steps along the banks of the Eu phrates should besiege the capital of the Persian Disaffec monarchy The success of this well concerted plan king ofhe depended in a great measure on the powerful and Armenia ready assistance of the king of Armenia who with out exposing the safety of his own dominions might detach an army of four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot to the assistance of the Romans But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus king of Armenia had degenerated still more shamefully than his father Chosroes from the manly virtues of the great Ti ridates and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger and glory he could dis guise his timid indolence by the more decent ex cuses of religion and gratitude He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias the daughter of the prsefect Ablavius and the alli ance of a female who had been educated as the destined wife of the emperor Constans exalted the dignity of a Barbarian king Tiranus professed the Christian religion he reigned over a nation of Christians and he was restrained by every prin ciple of conscience and interest from contributing to the victory which would consummate the ruin of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 249 the church The alienated mind of Tiranus was chap exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian who treated XIx the king of Armenia as his slave and as the enemy of the gods The haughty and threatening style of the Imperial mandates awakened the secret indig nation of a prince who in the humiliating state of dependence was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides the lords of the East and the rivals of the Roman power The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully Military contrived to deceive the spies and to divert the at tions tention of Sapor The legions appeared to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris On a sudden they wheeled to the right traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae and reached on the third day the banks of the Euphrates where the strong town of Nicephorium or Callinicum had been founded by the Macedonian kings From thence the emperor pursued his march above ninety miles along the winding stream of the Euphrates till at length about one month after his departure from Antioch he discovered the towers of Circesium the extreme limit of the Roman dominions The army of Julian the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia consisted of sixty five thousand effective and well disciplined sol diers The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry of Romans and Barbarians had been selected from the different provinces and a just pre eminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate and al most from another world to invade a distant country of whose name and situation they were ignorant The love of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens or roving Arabs 250 THK DECLINE

bottomed boats which might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges The rest of the ships partly constructed of timber and partly co vered with raw hides were laden with an almost in exhaustible supply of arms and engines of utensils and provisions The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers but he prohibited the indulgence of wine and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army The river Chaboras falls into the Euphrates at Circesium and as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march the Ro mans passed the little stream which separated two Julian en mighty and hostile empires The custom of ancient Pereianter discipline required a military oration and Julian lWrif7th embraced every opportunity of displaying his elo quence He animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the Persians and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation or to devote his life in the cause of the re public The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier and the bridge of the Chaboras

the successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia the province of Assyria alone maintained during a third part of the year the luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great King Four considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand mares were constantly kept at the expense of the country for the royal stables and as the daily tribute which was paid to the satrap amounted to one English bushel of silver we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling 256 THE DECLINE

roads were rendered impracticable a flood of waters was poured into the camp and during se veral days the troops of Julian were obliged to con tend with the most discouraging hardships But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries who were inured to toil as well as to danger and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader The damage was gradually repaired the waters were restored to their proper channels whole groves of palm trees were cut down and placed along the broken parts of the road and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders Two cities of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor and they both siege of paid the severe penalty of their rashness At the Pensabor lis cg 0f fifty miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon Perisabor or Anbar held the second rank in the province a city large populous and well fortified surrounded with a double wall almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates and de fended by the valour of a numerous garrison The exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with con tempt and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach that unmindful of his royal birth he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defence till the lucky stroke of a battering ram having opened a large breach by shattering one of the angles of the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 257 wall they hastily retired into the fortifications of the chap interior citadel The soldiers of Julian rushed im XIX petuously into the town and after the full gratifica tion of every military appetite Perisabor was reduced to ashes and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses The contest was continued by an incessant and mu tual discharge of missile weapons and the superiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterba lanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged But as soon as a Hclepolis had been constructed which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts the tremendous aspect of a moving turret that would leave no hope of resistance or of mercy terrified the defenders of the citadel into a humble submission  and the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor Two thousand five hundred per sons of both sexes the feeble remnant of a flourish ing people were permitted to retire the plentiful magazines of corn of arms and of splendid furniture were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor The city or rather fortress of Maogamalcha which 1 8 was defended by sixteen large towers a deep ditch and two strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles as the safeguard of the capital of Persia The emperor apprehensive of leaving such an im portant fortress in his rear immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha and the Roman army was distributed for that purpose into three

more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city Under the direc tion of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus the trenches were opened at a considerable distance and gradually pro longed as far as the edge of the ditch The ditch was speedily filled with earth and by the incessant labour of the troops a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber Three chosen cohorts advancing in a single file silently explored the dark and dangerous passage till their intrepid leader whis pered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city Julian checked their ardour that he might ensure their success and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamour of a general assault The Persians who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an im potent attack celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of Sapor  and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha The city was already taken History has recorded

existed The neighbourhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately pa laces laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an eastern mo narch The

philosophic hero appeared in a more amiable light and his virtues were never more conspicuously displayed than in the last and most active period of his life He practised without effort and almost without merit the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety In the warm climate of Assyria a youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate nor was Julian ever tempted even by a motive of curiosity to visit his female captives With the same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love he sustained the hardships of war When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country their sovereign on foot at the head of his legions shared their fa tigues and animated their diligence In every use ful labour the hand of Julian was prompt and stre nuous and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportuni ties of signalizing his personal valour which in the improved state of the military art can seldom be exerted by a prudent general The emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor insensible of his ex treme danger and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person As he exa mined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha two Persians devoting themselves for their country suddenly rushed upon him with drawn scimitars the emperor dexterously received their blows on his up lifted shield arid with a steady and well aimed thrust laid one of his

Julian derived from his personal merit enabled him to revive and enforce the rigour of ancient discipline He punished with death or ignominy the misbehaviour of three troops of horse who in a skirmish with the Surenas had lost their honour and one of their standards and he distin guished with obsidional crowns the valour of the fore most soldiers who had ascended into the city of Mao gamalcha After the siege of Perisabor the firmness of the emperor was exercised by the insolent avarice of the army who loudly complained that their services were rewarded by a trifling donative of one hundred pieces of silver His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language of a Roman Riches are the object of your desires those riches are in the hands of the Persians and the spoils of this  fruitful country are proposed as the prize of your valour and discipline Believe me added Julian the Roman republic which formerly possessed such  immense treasures is now reduced to want and wretchedness since our princes have been per suaded by weak and interested ministers to pur chase with gold the tranquillity of the Barbarians The revenue is exhausted the cities are ruined the provinces are dispeopled For myself the only inheritance that I have received from my royal an  cestors is a soul incapable of fear and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is seated in the mind I shall not blush to acknowledge an â honourable poverty which in the days of ancient virtue was considered as the glory of Fabricius That glory and that virtue may be your own if you will

Such has been the temper of my reign that I can retire without regret and without apprehension to the obscurity of a private station The modest resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of the Romans who declared their confidence of victory while they fought under the banners of their heroic prince Their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar

manners the primi tive appellation of Coche Coche was situate on the western side of the Tigris  but it was naturally con sidered as a suburb of Ctesiphon with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain the cities which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter re sidence of the Sassanides and the whole circum ference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river by lofty walls and by im practicable morasses Near the ruins of Seleucia the camp of Julian was

the intermediate situation of Coche would have sepa rated the fleet and army of Julian and the rash at tempt of steering against the current of the Tigris and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital must have been attended with the total de struction of the Roman navy The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger and provided the re medy As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and na vigable canal which leaving Coche on the right hand s 4 264 THE DECLINE AND FALL ghap conveyed the waters of the Nahar Malcha into the XIX river Tigris at some distance above the cities From the information of the peasants Julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work which were almost obliterated by design or accident By the indefatigable labour of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordi nary current of the Nahar Malcha a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed and the Ro man fleet steering their triumphant course into the Tigris derided the vain and

ease a field of corn or a legion of Romans In the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was im practicable and the intrepid prince who instantly seized the only possible expedient concealed his de sign till the moment of execution from the know ledge of the Barbarians of his own troops and even of his generals themselves Under the specious pre tence of examining the state of the magazines four score vessels were gradually unladen and a select detachment apparently destined for some secret ex pedition was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 265 amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of mili chap tary games which he insultingly celebrated under the XIX walls of Coche The day was consecrated to pleasure but as soon as the hour of supper was past the em peror summoned the generals to his tent and ac quainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris They stood in silent and respectful astonishment but when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and expe rience the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances Julian contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt that instead of diminishing the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reinforcements and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank The signal was instantly given and obeyed the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night A flame arose on the opposite side  and Julian who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy dexterously con verted their extreme danger into a presage of victory Our fellow soldiers he eagerly exclaimed are already masters of the bank seeâ they make the appointed signal let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage The united and rapid mo tion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current and they reached the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions

Imperial army sounded to battle The Romans after sending up a military shout advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music launched their formidable javelins and rushed forwards with drawn swords to deprive the Barbarians by a closer onset of the advantage of their missile weapons The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself They were pursued to the gates of Ctesi phon and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city if their general Victor who was dan gerously wounded with an arrrow had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt which must be fatal if it were not successful On their side the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventy five men while they affirmed that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred or even six thousand of their bravest soldiers The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an oriental camp large quantities of silver andgold splendid arms and trappings and beds and tables of massy silver The

the camp of the Romans f and by the dissensions of the two generals who were incapable of forming or executing any plan for the public service When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this im

powers which slowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself As the Romans continued their march their long array which was forced to bend or divide according to the varieties of the ground afforded frequent and favourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies The Persians repeatedly charged with fury they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness and the action at Maronga which almost deserved the name of a battle was marked by a considerable loss of sa traps and elephants perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch These splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded and the emperor himself who on all occasions of danger inspired and guided the valour of his

them not to disgrace by unmanly tears the fate of a prince who in a few moments would be united with heaven and with the stars The spectators were silent and Julian en tered into a metaphysical

Romans he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice the jealousy of power the fear of ingratitude and the natural presumption of health of youth and of pros perity His unexpected death left the empire with out a master and without an heir in a state of per plexity and danger which in the space of fourscore years had never been experienced since the election of Diocletian In a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood the superiority of birth was of little moment the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious and the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit or by the hopes of popular favour But the situation of a famished army encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians shortened the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE moments of grief and deliberation In this scene of chap terror and distress the body of the deceased prince XIX according to his own directions was decently em balmed and at the dawn of day the generals con vened a military senate at which the commanders of the legions and the officers both of cavalry and infantry were invited to assist Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals and when the election of an emperor was proposed the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly Victor and Arinthaeus collected the re mains of the court of Constantius the friends of Julian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs Da galaiphus and Nevitta and the most fatal conse quences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions so opposite in their character and in terest in their maxims of government and perhaps in their religious principles The superior virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages and the venerable praefectwould immediately have been declared the successor of Julian if he himself with sincere and modest firm ness had not alleged his age and infirmities so un equal to the weight of the diadem The generals who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer  that they should act as they would have acted in the absence of the emperor that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from the present distress and if they were fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopo tamia they should proceed with united and delibe rate counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign While they debated a few voices saluted

who was no more than first of the domestics with XfX the names of Emperor and Augustus The tumult uary acclamation was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent and passed in a few mi

pro tection he so lately solicited The strongest recom mendation of Jovian was the merit of his father Count Varronian who enjoyed in honourable re tirement the fruit of his long services In the ob scure freedom of a private station the son supported with credit the character of a Christian and a sol dier Without being conspicuous for any of the am bitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind the comely person of Jovian his cheerful temper and familiar wit had gained the affection of his fellow soldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies The pride of this unexpected elevation was mode rated by the just apprehension that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new em peror The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay and the first orders issued by Jovian a few hours after his predecessor had expired were to prosecute a march which could

was thrown into disorder the renowned legions which derived their titles from Diocletian and his warlike colleague were broke and trampled down by the elephants and three tribunes lost their lives in at tempting to stop the flight of their soldiers The battle was at length restored by the persevering valour of the Romans the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants and the army after marching and fighting a long sum mer s day arrived in the evening at Samara on the banks of the Tigris about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon On the ensuing day the Barba rians instead of harassing the march attacked the camp of Jovian which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley From the hills the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legion aries and a body of cavalry which had penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate was cut in pieces after a doubtful conflict near the Imperial tent In the succeeding night the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dykes of the river and the Roman army though incessantly ex posed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens pitched their tents near the city of Dura four days after the death of Julian The Tigris was still on their left their hopes and provisions were almost consumed and the impatient soldiers who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant requested their new sovereign that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river With the assistance of his wisest officers Jovian en deavoured to check their rashness by representing THE DECLINE AND FALL that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigour to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians who had occupied the opposite banks Yielding at length to their clamorous im portunities he consented with reluctance that five hundred Gauls and Germans accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube should attempt the bold adventure which might serve either as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the army In the silence of the night they swam the Tigris surprised an unguarded post of the enemy and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune The success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects who proposed to construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep oxen and goats covered with a floor of earth and fascines Two important days were spent in the ineffectual labour and the Romans who already endured the miseries of famine cast a look of despair on the Tigris and upon the Barbarians whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the distress of the Im perial army In this hopeless situation the fainting spirits of the Romans were revived by the sound of peace The transient presumption of Sapor had vanished he observed with serious concern that in the re petition of doubtful combats he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles his bravest troops and the greatest part of his train of elephants and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair the vicissitudes of fortune and the un exhausted powers of the Roman empire which might soon advance to relieve or to revenge the successor of Julian The Surenas himself accompanied by another satrap appeared in the camp of Jovian and OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 285 declared that the clemency of his sovereign was not chap averse to signify the conditions on which he would XIx consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his captive army The hopes of safety sub dued the firmness of the Romans the emperor was compelled by the advice of his council and the cries of the soldiers to embrace the offer of peace and the praefect Sallust was immediately sent with the general Arinthaeus to understand the pleasure of the Great King The crafty Persian delayed under various pretences the conclusion of the agreement started difficulties required explanations suggested expedients receded from his concessions increased his demands and wasted four days in the arts of negotiation till he had consumed the stock of pro visions which yet remained in the camp of the Ro mans Had Jovian been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure he would have continued his march with unremitting diligence the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians and before the expiration of the fourth day he might have safely reached the fruitful pro vince of Corduene at the distance only of one hun dred miles The irresolute emperor instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy expected his fate with patient resignation and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace which it was no longer in his power to refuse The five provinces beyond the Tigris which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor were restored to the Persian monarchy He acquired by a single article the impregnable city of Nisibis  which had sustained in three successive sieges the effort of his arms Sin gara and the castle of the Moors one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia were likewise dismembered from the empire It was considered as an indulgence that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted 286 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap to retire with their effects but the conqueror rigor XIX ously insisted that the Romans should for ever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia A peace or rather a long truce of thirty years was

to convince the timid monarch that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxuryt Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation we must acknow ledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian The obscure domestic exalted to the throne by for tune rather than by merit was impatient

pride of freedom and the contempt of death Conscious of their su periority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline they disdained to yield they refused to capitulate every obstacle was surmounted

contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumour of his death and they persisted to doubt after they could no longer deny the truth of that fatal event The messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace the voice of fame louder and more sincere revealed the disgrace of the emperor and the conditions of the ignominious treaty The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief with indignation and terror when they were informed that the unworthy successor of Julian re linquished the five provinces which had been ac quired by the victory of Galerius and that he shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the import ant city of Nisibis the firmest bulwark of the pro vinces of the East The deep and dangerous ques tion how far the public faith should be observed when it becomes incompatible with the public safety was freely agitated in popular conversation and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would re deem his pusillanimous behaviour by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy The inflexible spirit of the Ro man senate had always disclaimed the unequal con ditions which were extorted from the distress of her captive armies and if it were necessary to satisfy the national honour by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully ac quiesced in the precedent of ancient times But the emperor whatever might be the limits of his constitutional authority was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state and the same mo tives which had forced him to subscribe now pressed him to execute the treaty of peace He was im patient to secure an empire at the expense of a few OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 291 provinces and the respectable names of religion and chap honour concealed the personal fears and the ambi XIX tion of Jovian Notwithstanding the dutiful solicita tions of the inhabitants decency as well as pru dence forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis but the next morning after his arrival Bi neses the ambassador of Persia entered the place displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King and proclaimed in his name the cruel alter native of exile or servitude The principal citizens of Nisibis who till that fatal moment had confided in the protection of their sovereign threw themselves at his feet They conjured him not to abandon or at least not to deliver a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant exasperated by the three suc cessive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis They still possessed arms and cou rage to repel the invaders of their country they requested only the permission of using them in th eir own defence and as soon as they had asserted their independence they should implore the favour of being again admitted into the rank of his subjects Their arguments their eloquence their tears were ineffectual Jovian alleged with some confusion the sanctity of oaths and as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim O Emperor may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions Jovian who in a few weeks had as sumed the habits of a prince was displeased with freedom and offended with truth and as he rea sonably supposed that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit to the Persian govern ment he published an edict under pain of death that they should leave the city within the term of three days Ammianus has delineated in lively colours u 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL the scene of universal despair which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion The mar tial youth deserted with indignant grief the walls which they had so gloriously defended the discon solate mourner dropt a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a Barbarian master and the aged citizen kissed the threshold and clung to the doors of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude the distinctions of rank and sex and age were lost in the general calamity Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate num ber of horses or waggons they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives They were seated however in a new built quarter of Amida and that rising city with the reinforce ment of a very considerable colony soon recovered its former splendour and became the capital of Me sopotamia  Similar orders were despatched by the emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris Sapor enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory and this ignominious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline and fall of the Roman empire The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces but since the foundation of the city the genius of Rome the god Terminus who guarded the bounda ries of the republic had never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy â Chron Paschal p 300 The ecclesiastical Notitias may be consulted OF THE ROMAN EMPIEE 293 After Jovian had performed those engagements chap which the voice of his people might have tempted XIX him to violate he hastened away from the scene of Reflec his disgrace and proceeded with his whole court to

kinsman was removed from the command of the army under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tar sus in a slow march of fifteen days and as it passed through the cities of the East was saluted by the hostile factions with mournful lamentations and cla morous insults The Pagans already placed their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored It was an ancient custom in the funerals as well and funeral  â ž    of Julian as in the triumphs of the Romans that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of satire and ridi cule and that in the midst of the splendid pageants which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead their imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world This custom was prac tised in the funeral of Julian The comedians who resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre exhibited with the applause of a Christian audience the lively and exaggerated representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor His vari ous character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for pleasantry and ridicule In the exercise of his uncommon talents

laborious efforts of art or even of affectation The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia but his stately tomb which arose in that city on the banks of the cold and lympid Cydnus was displeasing to the faithful friends who loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man The philosopher ex pressed a very reasonable wish that the disciple of Plato might have reposed amidst

and the first moments of peace a d 363 were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic tranquillity of the church and state The indiscretion of his predecessor instead of reconciling had

claims of ancient possession and actual favour In private families the sentiments of nature were ex tinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge the majesty of the laws was violated or abused the cities of the East were stained with blood and the most implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their country Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch the banner of the Cross the Labarum of Constantine which was again displayed at the head of the legions announced to the people the faith of their new emperor As soon as he ascended

it is applied to assist and universal guide the natural descent of its object operates with toWion irresistible weight and Jovian had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were sup ported by the spirit of the times and the zeal and num bers of the most powerful sect Under his reign Chris tianity obtained an easy and lasting victory and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn the genius of paganism which had been fondly raised and eherished by the arts of Julian sunk irrecoverably in the dust In many eities the temples were shut or deserted the philosophers who had abused their tran sient favour thought it prudent to shave their beards and disguise their profession and the Christians re joiced that they were now in a condition to forgive or to revenge the injuries which they had suffered under the preceding reign The consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration in which Jovian explicitly de clared that

chap the indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of XX Antioch He was impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople and to prevent the ambition of some competitor who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe But he soon received the grateful intel ligence that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic ocean By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of Mesopotamia he had delegated the military com mand of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks and to his father in law count Lucillian who had formerly di stinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims in an accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts But the moderation of Jovinus master ge neral of the cavalry who forgave the intention of his disgrace soon appeased the tumult and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers The oath of fidelity was administered and taken with loyal ac clamations and the deputies of the Western armies saluted their new sovereign as he descended from Mount Taurus to

According to others he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapour of charcoal which extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster  But the want of a regular in

the Greek language and the arts of rhetoric but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity he was able as often as the occasion prompted him to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution The laws of martial dis cipline were the only laws that he had studied and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion and it should seem from his subsequent conduct that the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valen tinian was the effect of military spirit rather than of Christian zeal He was pardoned however and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit and in the various events of the Persian war he im proved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine The celerity and success with which he executed an important commission re commended him to the favour of Jovian and to the honourable command of the second school or com pany of Targetteers of the domestic guards In the march from Antioch

intercalation of the Bissextile At length when the hour was supposed to be propitious Valentinian showed himself from a lofty tribunal the judicious choice was applauded and the new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple amidst the acclamations of the troops who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude a busy whisper was accidently started in the ranks and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious clamour that he should name without delay a colleague in the empire The intrepid calmness

The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of the praefect Sallust and his own pressing solicitations that he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state were rejected by Valentinian with the most honourable expressions of friendship and esteem But among the favourites of the late emperor there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition and who could no longer hope to be protected either by favour or justice The greater part of the ministers of the palace and the go vernors of the provinces were removed from their re spective stations yet the eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd and notwithstanding the opposite clamours of zeal and resentment the whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been conducted with a reason able share of wisdom and moderation The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious inter ruption from the sudden illness of the two princes but as soon as their health was restored they left Constantinople in the beginning of the spring In the castle or palace of Mediana only three miles from Naissus they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich prefecture of the East from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike prefectures of Illyricum Italy and Gaul from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas 304 THE DECLINE AND FALL CxxP ne Provmc al administration remained on its former basis but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for two councils and two courts the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation and seven master generals were soon created either of the cavalry or infantry When this important business had been amicably transacted Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time The emper or

an officer with a band of soldiers who in the name of his new sovereigns Valentinian and Valens was de spatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either  Ammianus says in general terms subagrestis

plentiful entertainment he dexterously escaped to the sea coast of the Euxine from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus In that seques tered region he remained many months exposed to the hardships of exile of solitude and of want his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that if any accident should discover his name the faith less Barbarians would violate without much scruple the laws of hospitality In a moment of impatience and despair Procopiqs embarked in a merchant vessel which made sail for Constantinople and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia con tinually changing his habitation and his disguise By degrees he ventured into the capital trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends a senator and an eunuch and conceived some hopes of success from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East They despised the character of Valens which was rude without vigour and feeble without mildness They dreaded the influence of his father in law the Patrician Petronius a cruel and rapacious minister who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian The circumstances were pro VOL II x THE DECLINE AND FALL pitious to the designs of an usurper The hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens in Syria from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops were in motion and the capital was oc casionally filled with the soldiers who passed or re passed the Thracian Bosphorus Two cohorts of Gauls were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative and as they still revered the memory of Julian they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kins man At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia and Procopius clothed in a purple garment more suitable to a player than to a monarch appeared as if he rose from the dead in the midst of Constantinople The soldiers who were prepared for his reception saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity Their numbers were soon increased by a sturdy band of peasants collected from the adjacent country and Procopius shielded by the arms of his adherents was successively conducted to the tribunal the senate and the palace During the first moments of his tumultuous reign he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people who were either ignorant of the cause or apprehensive of the event But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion the poor were excited by the hopes and the rich were intimidated by the fear of a ge neral pillage and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution The magistrates were seized the prisons and arsenals broke open the gates and the entrance of the harbour were dili gently occupied and in a few hours Procopius be came the absolute though precarious master of the OF THE ROMAN EMP1UE 307 Imperial city The usurper improved this unexpected chap success with some degree of courage and dexterity xx He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the most favourable to his interest while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent but imaginary ambassadors of distant nations The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube were gra dually involved in the guilt of rebellion and the Gothic princes consented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of seve ral thousand auxiliaries His generals passed the Bosphorus and subdued without an effort the un armed but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia After an honourable defence the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his power the rerfowned legions of the Jovians and Herculians embraced the cause of the usurper whom they were ordered to crush and as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies he soon appeared at the head of an army whose valour as well as numbers were not unequal to the greatness of the contest The son of Hormisdas a youth of spirit and ability conde scended to draw his sword against the lawful em peror of the East and the Persian prince was im mediately invested with the ancient and extraor dinary powers of a Roman Proconsul The alliance of Faustina the widow of the emperor Constantius who intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of the usurper added dignity and reputation to his cause

de fence of the royal infant In the meanwhile Valentinian was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful intelligence of the revolt of the East The difficulties of a German war forced him to confine his immediate care to the safety of his own dominions and as every channel of communi cation was stopt or corrupted he listened with doubt ful anxiety to the rumours which were industriously spread that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius sole master of the eastern provinces Va lens was not dead but on the news of the rebellion which he received at Caesarea he basely despaired of his life and fortune proposed to negotiate with the usurper and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the Imperial purple The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers and their abilities soon decided in his favour the event of the civil war In a season of tranquillity Sallust had resigned without a murmur but as soon as the public safety was attacked he ambitiously solicited the pre eminence of toil and danger and the restoration of that virtuous mini ster to the praefecture of the East was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens and satis fied the minds of the people The reign of Proco pius was apparently supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces But many of the principal officers military as well as civil had been urged either by motives of duty or interest to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene or to watch the moment of betraying and deserting the cause of the usurper Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens Arintheus who in strength beauty and valour ex Or THE ROMAN EMPIRE 309 celled all the heroes of the age attacked with a chap small troop a superior

ascendant of his genius that this ex traordinary order was instantly obeyed Arbetio a respectable veteran of the great Constantine who had been distinguished by the honours of the consulship was persuaded to leave his retirement and once more to conduct an army into the field In the heat of action calmly taking off his helmet he showed his gray hairs and venerable countenance saluted the soldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of children and companions and exhorted them no longer to support the desperate cause of a contempti ble tyrant but to follow their old commander who had so often led them to honour and victory In the two engagements of Thyatira and Nacosia the un fortunate Procopius was deserted by his troops who were seduced by the instructions and example of their perfidious officers After wandering some time among the woods and mountains of Phrygia he was betrayed by his desponding followers conducted to the Imperial camp and immediately beheaded He suffered the ordinary fate of an unsuccessful usurper but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by the conqueror under the forms of legal justice excited the pity and indignation of mankind  Such indeed are

either of the displeasure of heaven or of the depravity of mankind Let us not hesitate to indulge a liberal pride that in the present age the enlightened part of Europe has abolished a cruel and odious prejudice which reigned in every climate of the globe and adhered to every system of religious opinions The nations and the sects of the Roman world admitted with equal credulity and similar ab horrence the reality of that infernal art which was able to control the eternal order of the planets and the voluntary operations of the human mind They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and incanta tions of potent herbs and execrable rites which could extinguish or recal life inflame the passions of the soul blast the works of creation and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity They believed with the wildest inconsistency that this preternatural dominion of the air of earth and of hell was exercised from the vilest motives of malice or gain by some wrinkled hags and itinerant sorcerers who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt The arts of magic were equally con demned by the public opinion and by the laws of Rome but as they tended to gratify the most im perious passions of the heart of man they were con tinually proscribed and continually practised An imaginary cause is capable of producing the most serious and mischievous effects The dark predictions of the death of an emperor or the success of a con spiracy were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of ambition and to dissolve the ties of fidelity and the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the actual crimes of treason and sacrilege Such vain terrors disturbed the peace of society and the hap piness of individuals and the harmless flame which insensibly melted a waxen

herbs which were supposed to possess a supernatural in fluence it was an easy step to the use of more sub stantial poison and the folly of mankind sometimes became the instrument and the mask of the

a d 364 merit of the sufferers excite in our breasts the most 375 lively sensations of terror of admiration and of pity The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and dis gusting accuracy But as our attention is no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude of recent greatness and of actual misery we should turn with horror from the frequent executions which disgraced both at Rome and Antioch the reign of the two brothers Valens was of a timid and Va lentinian of a choleric disposition An anxious re gard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens In the condition of a subject he had kissed with trembling awe the hand of the oppressor and when he ascended the throne he reasonably expected that the same fears which had subdued his own mind would secure the patient submission of his people The favourites of Valens obtained by the privilege of rapine and con fiscation the wealth which his economy would have refused They urged with persuasive eloquence that in all cases of treason suspicion is equivalent to proof that the power supposes the intention of mischief that the intention is not less criminal than the act and that a subject no longer deserves to live if his life may threaten the safety or disturb x 4 312 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap the repose of his sovereign The judgment of Va xx lentinian was sometimes deceived and his confidence abused but he would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile had they presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger They praised his inflexible love of justice and in the pursuit of justice the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness and passion as a virtue As long as he wrestled with his equals in the bold competition of an active and ambitious life Valentinian was seldom injured and never insulted with impunity if his prudence was arraigned his spirit was applauded and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier After he be came master of the world he unfortunately forgot that where no resistance can be made no courage can be exerted and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity he indulged the furious emotions of his temper at a time when they were disgraceful to himself and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure In the government of his household or of his empire slight or even ima ginary offences a hasty word a casual omission an involuntary delay were chastised by a sentence of immediate death The expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were Strike off his head â burn him alive â let him be beaten with clubs till he expires and his most favoured ministers soon understood that by a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution of his sanguinary commands they might involve themselves in the guilt and pu nishment of disobedience The repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind of Valen tinian against pity and remorse and the sallies of passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty He OF THE ROMAN EMPIRIC 818 could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive chap agonies of torture and death he reserved his friend xx ship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most congenial to his own The merit of Maximin who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome was rewarded with the royal approbation and the prefecture of Gaul Two fierce and enormous bears distinguished by the appellations of Innocence and Mica Aurea could alone deserve to share the favour of Maximin The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bed chamber of Valentinian  who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage Their diet and exercises were carefully in spected by the Roman emperor and when Inno cence had earned her discharge by a long course of meritorious service the faithful animal was again re stored to the freedom of her native woods But in the calmer moments of reflection when the Their laws mind of Valens was not agitated by fear or that ofyemment Valentinian by rage the tyrant resumed the senti ments or at least the conduct of the father of his country The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive and accurately pur sue his own and the public interest and the so vereign of the East who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust Both princes in  variably retained in the purple the chaste and tem perate simplicity which had adorned their private life and under their reign the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh They gradually reformed

which might xx inspire posterity with the most favourable opinion of their character and government It is not from the master of Innocence that we should expect the ten der regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted Valentinian to condemn the exposition of new born infants  and to establish fourteen skilful physicians with stipends and privileges in the four teen quarters of Rome The good sense of an illi terate soldier founded an useful and liberal institution for the education of youth and the support of de clining science It was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin languages in the metropolis of every province and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular pre eminence The frag ments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imper fectly represent the school of Constantinople which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations That school consisted of thirty one professors in dif ferent branches of learning One philosopher and two lawyers five sophists and ten grammarians for â the Greek and three orators and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue besides seven scribes or as they were then styled antiquarians whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the classic writers The rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university It

idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the pub lic service The institutions of Valentinian contri buted to secure the benefits of peace and plenty and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the Defensors freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people to support their rights and to expose their grievances before the tribunals of the civil magistrates or even at the foot of the Imperial throne The finances were diligently administered by two princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune but in the receipt and application of the revenue a dis cerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West Valens was persuaded that royal liberality can be sup plied only by public oppression and his ambition never aspired to secure by their actual distress the future strength and prosperity of his people Instead of increasing the weight of taxes which in the space of forty years had been gradually doubled he re duced in the first years of his reign one fourth of the tribute of the East Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burthens of his people He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration but he exacted without scruple a very large share of the private property as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advan 316

principal motives of their judicious choice The eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs and Valentinian himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of the di stant frontiers of an invaded monarchy As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of his name the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the a d 364 East of the North and of the South Their inroads 375 were often vexatious and sometimes formidable

affected reluctance yielded to their entreaties the Bata vians resumed their arms and with their arms the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni The principal command was declined by Degalaiphus and that experienced general who had represented perhaps with too much prudence the extreme difficulties of the undertaking had the mortification before the end of the cam paign of seeing his rival Jovinus convert those dif ficulties into a decisive advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians At the head of a well disciplined army of cavalry infantry and light troops Jovinus advanced with cautious and rapid steps to Scarponna in the territory of Metz where he sur prised a large division of the Alemanni before they had time to run to their arms and

wise monarch instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany confined his attention to the important and laborious defence of the Gallic frontier against an enemy whose strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes of the North The banks of the Rhine from its source to the straits of the ocean were closely planted with strong castles and convenient towers new works and new arms were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled in the mechanical arts and his numerous levies of Roman and Barbarian youth were severely trained in all the exercises of war The progress of the work which was sometimes opposed by modest re presentations and sometimes by hostile attempts secured the tranquillity of Gaul during the nine sub sequent years of the administration of Valentinian That prudent emperor who diligently practised The Bur the wise maxims of Diocletian was studious to fo p18 ment and excite the intestine divisions of the tribes of Germany About the middle of the fourth cen tury the countries perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia on either side of the Elbe were occupied by the vague dominion of the Burgundians a warlike and numerous people of the Vandal race whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom and has finally settled on a flourishing province The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the Burgundians appears to have been the dif ference of their civil and ecclesiastical constitution The appellation of Hendinos was given to the king or general and the title of Sinistus to

the events of war accused the courage or conduct of the king he was immediately deposed and the injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth and the regularity of the sea sons which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal department The disputed possession of some salt pits engaged the Alemanni and the Bur gundians in frequent contests the latter were easily tempted by the secret solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor and their fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers who had formerly been left to gar rison the fortresses of Drusus was admitted with mu tual credulity as it was conducive to mutual interest An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine and impatiently required the support and subsidies which Valentinian had promised but they were amused with excuses and delays till at length after a fruitless expecta tion they were compelled to retire The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment and their massacre of the captives served to embitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni The inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances and perhaps it was the original design of Valentinian to intimidate rather than to destroy as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of either of the German nations Among the princes of the Alemanni Macrianus â who with a Roman name had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman deserved his hatred

of pouring forth the in exhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the ocean who filled the British island with their lan guage their laws and their colonies and who so long defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of Germany which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous pro fessions of fishermen and pirates and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emu lation of their bravest countrymen who were impa tient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and moun tains Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets

their vessels on the great sea The various troops of pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a per manent society at first of rapine and afterwards of

which obtained from its luxuriant vegetation the epithet of Green and has preserved with a slight alteration the name of Erin or Ierne or Ire land It is probable that in some remote period of

who were often asso ciated in military enterprise were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes They long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin and

two nations who had assisted at the negotiations The invasion of the Goths and Huns which soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor

integrity of the public faith if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title of king But they soon repented of their own rashness They were confounded by the re proaches and threats of the Persian monarch They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of Para himself who  sacrificed to the slightest suspicions the lives of his most faithful ser vants and held a

the river which they were obliged to swim was attended with some delay and some loss The country was alarmed and the two roads which were only separated by an in terval of three miles had been occupied by a thou sand archers on horseback under the command of a count and a tribune Para must have yielded to superior force if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of escape A dark and almost impervious path se curely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune while they patiently expected his approach along the public highways They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or success and seriously alleged that the king of Ar menia who was a skilful

The Heruli who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake Maeotis were renowned for their strength and agility and the assistance of their light infantry was eagerly solicited and highly esteemed in all the wars of the Barbarians But the active spirit of the He ruli was subdued by the slow and steady perseverance of the Goths and after a bloody action in which the king was slain the remains of that warlike tribe became an useful accession to the camp of Hermanric He then marched against the Venedi unskilled in the use of arms and formidable only by their num bers which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern Poland The victorious Goths who were not inferior in numbers prevailed in the contest by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline After the submission of the Venedi the conqueror advanced without resistance as far as the confines of the Estii an ancient people whose name is still pre served in the province of Esthonia Those distant inhabitants of the Baltic coast were supported by the labours of agriculture enriched by the trade of am ber and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of the Gods But the scarcity of iron obliged the jEstian warriors to content themselves with wooden clubs and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence rather than to the arms of Hermanric His dominions which ex tended from the Danube to the Baltic included the native seats and the recent acquisitions of the Goths and he reigned over the greatest part of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror and some 3i8 THE DECLINE AND

peace and if a hostile band sometimes presumed to pass the Roman limit their irregular conduct was candidly ascribed to the ungovernable spirit of the Barbarian youth Their contempt for two new and obscure princes who had been raised to the throne by a popular election inspired the Goths with bolder hopes and while they agitated some design of marching their confe derate force under the national standard they were easily tempted to embrace the party of Procopius and to foment by their dangerous aid the civil dis cord of the Romans The public treaty might sti pulate no more than ten thousand

confidence that their invincible valour would decide the fate of the Roman empire and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of the Barbarians who displayed the in solence of masters and the licentiousness of enemies But the intemperance which gratified their appetites retarded their progress and before the Goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius

familiarized with their savage appearance ventured by degrees to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries whose name had so long been the object of their terror The king of Scythia and Hermanric alone could deserve so lofty a title was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity His ambassadors loudly complained at the court of Valens of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alliance which had so long subsisted between the Romans and the Goths They alleged that they had fulfilled the duty of allies by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives and they urged a very singular claim that the Gothic generals marching in arms and in hostile array were entitled to the sacred cha racter and privileges of ambassadors The decent but peremptory refusal of these extravagant demands was signified to the Barbarians by Victor master general of the cavalry who expressed with force and dignity the just complaints of the emperor of the East The negotiation was interrupted and the manly exhortations of Valentinian encouraged his timid bro ther to vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire

advice of Victor and Arintheus his masters general of the cavalry and infantry The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from their strong posts in the mountains  and the devastation of the plains obliged the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter The incessant rains which swelled the waters of the river produced a tacit sus pension of arms and confined the emperor Valens during the whole course of the ensuing summer to his camp of Marcianapolis The third year of the war was more favourable to the Romans and more pernicious to the Goths The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of the objects of luxury which they already confounded with the necessaries of life and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of fa mine Athanaric was provoked or compelled to risk a battle which he lost in the plains and the pur suit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precau tion of the victorious generals who had promised a large reward for the head of every Goth that was brought into the Imperial camp The submission of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens and his council the emperor listened with satisfac tion to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 351 the senate of Constantinople which assumed for the chap first time a share in the public deliberations and the same generals Victor and Arintheus who had successfully directed the conduct of the war were em powered to regulate the conditions of peace The freedom of trade which the Goths had hitherto en joyed was restricted to two cities on the Danube the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies and the exception which was stipulated in favour of Athanaric alone was more advantageous than honour able to the Judge of the Visigoths Athanaric who on this occasion appears to have consulted his private interest without expecting the orders of his sovereign supported his own dignity and that of his tribe in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens He persisted in his declaration that it was impossible for him without incurring the guilt of perjury ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire and it is more than probable that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent arid fatal examples of Roman treachery The Danube which separated the dominions of the two independent nations was chosen for the scene of the conference The emperor of the East and the Judge of the Visigoths accompanied by an equal number of armed followers advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the

The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power which in the time of Marcus Antoninus had spread terror to the gates of Rome But they still possessed arms and courage their courage was

whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions but they contained the veteran strength of the Maesian and Pannonian bands The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honours of rank and precedency was the cause of their destruction and while they acted with separate forces and divided councils they were surprised and

human species by their broad shoulders flat noses and small black eyes deeply buried in the head and as they were almost destitute of beards they never enjoyed either the manly graces of youth or the venerable aspect of age Against these enemies Hermanric prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes provoked by oppression were much more

conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus or Niester a considerable river which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia On the banks of the Niester the prudent Athanaric more attentive to his own than to the general safety had fixed the camp of the Visigoths with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians whom he thought it less advisable to provoke The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage and the encumbrance of captives but their military skill deceived and almost de stroyed the army of Athanaric While the judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detach ment of cavalry who by the light of the moon had passed the river in a fordable place and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage and con duct that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country The undaunted general had al ready formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war and the strong lines which he was preparing to construct between the mountains the Pruth and the Danube would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia from the destructive inroads of the Huns But the hopes and measures of the judge of the Visigoth were soon disappointed by the trembling impatience of his

confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and a d 375 authority of his elder brother whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision he was deprived of the fa vourite resource of feeble and timid minds who con sider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind the questions of war and peace of justice and policy which were debated in the councils of antiquity will frequently present them selves as the subject of modern deliberation But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of Barbarians who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilized nation When that important propo sition so essentially connected with the public safety was referred to the ministers of Valens they were per plexed and divided but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favour able to the pride the indolence and the avarice of their sovereign The slaves who were decorated OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE 367 with the titles of praefects and generals dissembled chap or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration XXI so extremely different from the partial and accidental  colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire But they applauded the libe rality of fortune which had conducted from the most distant countries of the globe a numerous and invin cible army of strangers to defend the throne of Va lens who might now add to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits The prayers of the Goths were granted and their service was accepted by the Imperial court and orders were immediately despatched to the civil and  military governors of the Thracian diocese to make the necessary preparations for the passage and sub sistence of a great people till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence The liberality of the emperor was accompanied how ever with two harsh and rigorous conditions which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans but which distress alone could extort from the indig nant Goths Before they passed the Danube they were required to deliver their arms and it was in sisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of Asia where they might be civilized by the arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents During this suspense of a doubtful and distant They are

the reign of Valens that the THE DECLINE AND FAIX chap brave officers who had served their country in the XXL execution of their duty were punished by the loss of their employments and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads The Imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation but the execution of this order was a task of labour and difficulty The stream of the Danube which in those parts is above a mile broad had been swelled by incessant rains and in this tumultuous passage many were swept away and drowned by the rapid violence of the current A large fleet of vessels of boats and of canoes was pro vided many days and nights they passed and re passed with indefatigable toil and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of Valens that not a single Barbarian of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome should be left on the opposite shore It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers but the persons who were employed soon desisted with amazement and dismay from the pro secution of the endless and impracticable task and the principal historian of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity were now jus tified in the eyes of mankind by the evidence of fact and experience A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women of children and of slaves the whole mass of people which composed this formi dable emigration must have amounted to near a mil lion of persons of both sexes and of all ages The children of the Goths those at least of a distinguished rank were separated from the multitude They were conducted without delay to the distant seats OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 369 assigned for their residence and education and as chap the numerous train of hostages or captives passed XXI through the cities their gay and splendid apparel their robust and martial figure excited the surprise and envy of the Provincials But the stipulation the most offensive to the Goths and the most important to the Romans was shamefully eluded The Bar barians who considered their arms as the ensigns of honour and the pledges of safety were disposed to offer a price which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to accept To preserve their arms the haughty warriors consented with some reluctance to prostitute their wives or their daughters The Goths with arms in their hands were permitted to enter the boats and when their strength was col lected on the other side of the river the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect The leaders of the Ostrogoths Ala theus and Saphrax the guardians of their infant king appeared soon afterwards on the northern banks of the Danube and immediately despatched their ambas sadors to the court of Antioch to solicit with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude the same favour which had been granted to the suppliant Visi goths The absolute refusal of Valens suspended their progress and discovered the repentance the suspicions and

the prudence as well as the in tegrity of the generals of Valens At this important crisis the military government of Thrace was exer cised by Lupicinus and Maximus in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument out weighed every consideration of public advantage and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and cri minal administration Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign and satisfying with decent libe rality the demands of the Goths they levied an un generous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hun gry Barbarians The vilest food was sold at an ex travagant price and in the room of wholesome and substantial provisions the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs and of unclean animals who had died of disease To obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread the Goths resigned the possession of an expensive though serviceable slave and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious but useless metal When their property was exhausted they continued this ne cessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters and notwithstanding the love of freedom which ani mated every Gothic breast they submitted to the humiliating maxim that it was better for their chil dren to be maintained in a servile  condition than to perish in a state of wretched and

possession and the use of arms The clamours of a multitude untaught to disguise their sentiments an nounced the first symptoms of resistance and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Maximus Those crafty ministers who substituted the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary coun cils of general policy attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire and to disperse them in separate quarters of cantonment through the interior provinces As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect or confidence of the Barbarians they diligently col lected from every side a military force that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people who had not yet renounced the title or the duties of Roman subjects But the generals of Valens while their attention was solely directed to the discontented Visigoths imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube The fatal oversight was observed and im proved by Alatheus and Saphrax who anxiously watched the favourable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the Huns By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported without opposition their king b b 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL and their army and boldly fixed a hostile and in dependent camp on the territories of the empire Under the name of judges Alavivus and Fritigern were the leaders of the Visigoths in peace and war and the authority which they derived from their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation In a season of tranquillity their power might have been equal as well as their rank but as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppres sion the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military command which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare He restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers under the same standard he secretly culti vated the friendship of the Ostrogoths and while he professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals he proceeded by slow marches to wards Marcianopolis the capital of the Lower Maesia about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube On that fatal spot the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace But the gates of the city were strictly guarded and the Barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies Their humble prayers were re jected with insolence and derision and as their pa  Ammianus xxxi 4 5 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE tience was now exhausted the townsmen the soldiers and the Goths were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches A blow was imprudently given a sword was hastily drawn and the first blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel became the signal of a long and destructive war In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance Lupicinus was informed by a secret messenger that many of his soldiers were slain and despoiled of their arms and as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus The clamor ous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme danger and as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him A trifling dis pute said the Gothic leader with a firm but gentle tone of voice appears to have arisen between the  two nations but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences unless the tumult is im mediately pacified by the assurance of our safety  and the authority of our presence At these words Fritigern and his companions drew their swords opened their passage through the unresist ing crowd which filled the palace the streets and the gates of Marcianopolis and mounting their horses hastily vanished from the eyes of the asto nished Romans The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp war was instantly resolved and the resolution was executed without delay the banners of the na tion were displayed

sudden emergency The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Mafcianopolis and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more pre vailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops The valour of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern that they broke by a close and vigorous attack the ranks of the Ro man legions Lupicinus left his arms and standards his tribunes and his bravest soldiers on the field of battle and their useless courage served only to pro tect the ignominious flight of their leader That successful day put an end to the distress of the Barbarians and the security of the Romans from that day the Goths renouncing the precarious con dition of strangers and exiles assumed the charac ter of citizens and masters claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of land and held in their own right the northern provinces of the em pire which are bounded by the Danube Such are the words of the Gothic historian who celebrates with rude eloquence the glory of his countrymen But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction As they had been deprived by the ministers of the em peror of the common benefits of nature and the fair intercourse of social life they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the empire and the crimes of Thcypcnc Lupicinus were

service of the empire They were en camped under the walls of Hadrianople but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont at a distance from the dan gerous temptation which might so easily be commu nicated by the neighbourhood and the success of their countrymen The respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march might be considered as a proof of their fidelity and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provi sions and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most dutiful terms But the first magistrate of Hadrianople incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his country house refused this indulgence and arming against them the inha bitants and manufacturers of a populous city he urged with hostile threats their instant departure The Barbarians stood silent and amazed till they were exasperated by the insulting clamours and mis sile weapons of the populace but when patience or contempt was fatigued they crushed the undisciplined multitude inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies and despoiled them of the splendid armour which they were unworthy to bear The resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation of the Visigoths the troops of Colias and uerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern ranged themselves under his standard and signalized their ardour in the siege of Hadrianople But the resistance of the garrison informed the Barbarians that in the attack of regular fortifications the

disappointment on the adjacent country He accepted with pleasure the useful reinforcement of hardy workmen who laboured in the gold mines of Thrace for the emolument and under the lash of an unfeeling master and these new associates con ducted the Barbarians through the secret paths to the most sequestered places which had been chosen to secure the inhabitants the cattle and the maga zines of corn With the assistance of such guides nothing could remain impervious or inaccessible resistance was fatal flight was impracticable and the patient submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the Barbarian conqueror In the course of these depredations a great number of the children of the Goths who had been sold into cap tivity were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents but these tender interviews which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sen timents of humanity tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge They listened with eager attention to the complaints of their captive children who had suffered the most cruel indignities from their masters and the same cruelties the same indignities were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Romans The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into the heart of the empire a nation of enemies but the Visigoths might even yet have been reconciled by the manly confession of past errors and the sincere performance of former engagements These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign  Sec Ammianus

Gratian who commanded all the forces of the West The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor and the immediate con duct of the Gothic war was intrusted during the absence of Valens to his lieutenants Trajan and Pro futurus two generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favourable opinion of their own abili ties On their arrival in Thrace they were joined by Richomer count of the domestics and the auxi liaries of the West that marched under his banner were composed of the Gallic legions reduced indeed by a spirit of desertion to the vain appearances of strength and numbers In a council of war which was influenced by pride rather than by reason it was resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarians who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile mea dows near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of waggons and the Barbarians secure within the vast circle of the inclosure enjoyed the fruits of their valour and the spoils of the province In the midst of riotous intemperance the watchful Fritigern observed the motions and penetrated the designs of the Romans He perceived that the num bers of the enemy were continually increasing and as he understood their intention of attacking his rear as soon as the scarcity of forage should oblige him to remove his camp he recalled to their standard his predatory detachments which covered the adjacent THE DECLINE AND FALL country As soon as they descried the flaming bea cons they obeyed with incredible speed the signal of their leader the camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians their impatient clamours de manded the battle and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs The evening was already far advanced and the two armies prepared themselves for the approaching com bat which was deferred only till the dawn of day While the trumpets sounded to arms the undaunted courage of the Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath and as they advanced to meet the enemy the rude songs which celebrated the glory of their forefathers were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries and opposed to the artificial harmony of the Roman shout Some mili tary skill was displayed by Fritigern to gain the ad vantage of a commanding eminence but the bloody conflict which began and ended with the light was maintained on either side by the personal and obsti nate efforts of strength valour and agility The legions of Armenia supported their fame in arms but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the Romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses This partial defeat was balanced however by partial success and when the two armies at a late hour of the evening retreated to their respective camps neither of them could claim the honours or the effects of a decisive victory The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans in proportion to the smallness of their numbers but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous and perhaps unexpected resistance that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications Such funeral rites as the cir cumstances of

and the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of Italy which were as signed for their settlement in the vacant territories of Modena and Parma The exploits of Sebastian who was recently engaged in the service of Valens and promoted to the rank of master general of the infantry were still more honourable to himself and useful to the republic He obtained the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline and the exercise of arms which were almost forgotten under the reign of Valens By the vigour and conduct of Sebastian a large body of the Goths was surprised in their camp and the immense spoil which was recovered from their hands filled the city of Hadrianople and the adjacent plain The splendid narratives which the general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war his valour was praised his advice was rejected and Valens who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and assured conquest His army was strengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so much military OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 885 skill that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians chap who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles and XXL to intercept either the troops themselves or their con voys of provisions The camp of Valens which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople was fortified according to the practice of the Romans with a ditch and rampart and a most important

fierceness of the Sarmatian character while Sebastian with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier re presented every precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible mon arch The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern and the prudent admoni tions of the emperor of the West The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly un derstood by the general of the Barbarians and a Christian ecclesiastic was despatched as the holy mi nister of peace to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy The misfortunes as well as the provocations of the Gothic nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador who pro tested in the name of Fritigern that he was still dis posed to lay down his arms or to employ them only in the defence of the empire if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace and a

his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople which he considered dur ing the vacancy of the throne as the representative council of the nation As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic he assembled the principal officers and privately con certed effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design An order was immediately promul gated that on a stated day the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective pro vinces and as a report was industriously circulated 894 THE DECLINE AND

with archers and slingers At the same hour in all the cities of the East the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter and the provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius from

victori ous Goths Whatever resentment the rash and jea lous vanity of his uncle might deserve the resent ment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic Gratian was too late to assist he was too weak to revenge his unfortunate colleague and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world A formidable tempest of the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 895 Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over chap the provinces of Gaul and the mind of Gratian was XXL oppressed and distracted by the administration of the Western empire In this important crisis the go vernment of the East and the conduct of the Gothic war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of confer ring an obligation rather than of yielding to an in sult It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the pur ple as the reward of virtue but at the age of nine teen it is not easy for a prince educated in the supreme rank to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals He attempted to weigh with an impartial hand their various merits and de fects and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic As each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate The choice of Gratian was soon declared in favour of an exile whose father only three years before had suffered under the sanction of his authority an unjust and ignominious death The great Theodosius a name  celebrated in history and dear to the Catholic church was summoned to the Imperial court which had gra dually retreated from the confines of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium Five months after the death of Valens the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled troops his colleague and their master who after a modest perhaps a sincere re sistance was compelled to accept amidst the general acclamations the diadem the purple and the equal title of Augustus The provinces of Thrace Asia THE DECLINE AND FALL and Egypt over which Valens had reigned were resigned to the administration of the new emperor but as he was specially intrusted with the conduct of the Gothic war the Illyrian prefecture was dis membered and the two great dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia were added to the dominions of the Eastern e mpire The same province and perhaps the same city which had given to the throne the virtues of Trajan and the talents of Hadrian was the original seat of another family of Spaniards who in a less fortunate age possessed near fourscore years the declining empire of Rome They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honours by the active spirit of the elder Theodosius a general whose exploits in Britain and Africa have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian The son of that general who likewise bore the name of Theodosius was educated by skilful preceptors in the liberal studies of youth but he was instructed in the art of war by the tender care and severe discipline of his father Under the standard of such a leader young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge in the most distant scenes of military action inured his constitution to the difference of seasons and climates distinguished his valour by sea and land and ob served the various warfare of the Scots the Saxons and the Moors His own merit and the recom mendation of the

portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps Yet I may boldly pro nounce that the battle of Hadrianople was never re venged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodo sius over the Barbarians and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the obser vation of the condition and circumstances of the times The fabric of a mighty state which has been reared by the labours of successive ages could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity The loss of forty thousand Romans who fell in the plains of Hadrian ople might have been soon recruited in the popu lous provinces of the East which contained so many millions of inhabitants The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions If the Bar barians were mounted on the horses and equipped with the armour of their vanquished enemies the numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry the thirty four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms and the wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the Romans THE DECLINE AND FALL extended the victory of the former and the defeat of the latter far beyond the limits of a single day A Gothic chief was heard to declare with insolent moderation that for his own part he was fatigued with slaughter but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the Gothic tribes were inspired by the formidable name of the Goths among the subjects and soldiers of the Ro man empire  If Theodosius hastily collecting his scattered forces had led them into the field to en counter a victorious enemy his army would have been vanquished by their own fears and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of success But the great Theodosius an epithet which he honourably deserved on this momentous occasion conducted him self as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic He fixed his head quarters at Thessalonica the capital of the Macedonian diocese t from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians and direct the operations of his lieutenants from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadri atic The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened and the troops among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived were in sensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety From these secure stations they were en couraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians who infested the adjacent country and as they were seldom allowed to engage without some decisive su periority either of ground or of numbers their en terprises were for the most part successful and they were soon convinced by their own experience  Eunapins in Excerpt Legation p 21 t See Godefroy s

reciprocally offered or sustained while the na tion was seated in the countries beyond the Danube The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to purchase with liberal gifts and promises the retreat or service of the discontented party The acquisition of Modar a prince of the royal blood of the Amali

of a skilful politician the most different means may be successively applied to the same ends and the peace of the empire which had been for warded by the divisions was accomplished by the re union of the Gothic nation Athanaric who had Death and been a patient spectator of these extraordinary events Athanaric was at length driven by the chance of arms from the A D 3 1 dark recesses of the woods of Caucaknd He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube and a very considerable part of the subjects of Fritigern who already felt the inconveniencies of anarchy were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic judge whose birth they respected and whose abilities they had frequently experienced But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric and in stead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honourable and advantageous treaty Theodosius who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople and enter tained him in the Imperial city with the confidence of a friend and the magnificence of a monarch The Barbarian prince observed with curious atten tion the variety of objects which attracted his notice and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder I now behold said he what I never could believe the

the emperor of the Romans is a god upon earth and the presumptuous man who dares to lift his hand against him is guilty of his own blood The Gothic king did not long enjoy this splendid and honourable reception and as temper ance was not the virtue of his nation it may justly be suspected that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the Imperial banquets But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death than he could have expected from the most faithful services of his ally The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the East a stately monument was erected to his memory and his whole army won by the liberal courtesy and decent grief of Theodosius inlisted under the standard of the Roman empire The submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the most salutary consequences and the mixed influence of force of reason and of corruption became every day more powerful and more extensive Each

adventures The Ostrogoths impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul concluded and soon violated a treaty with the emperor Gratian advanced into the unknown countries of the North and after an interval of more than four years returned with ac cumulated force to the banks of the Lower Danube Their troops were recruited with the fiercest warriors of Germany and Scythia and the soldiers or at least the historians of the empire no longer recognised the name and countenances of their former enemies The general who commanded the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier soon perceived that his superiority would be advantageous to the public service and that the Barbarians awed by the pre sence of his fleet and legions would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching winter The dexterity of the spies whom he sent into the Gothic camp allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare They were persuaded that by a bold attempt they might surprise in the silence and darkness of the night the sleeping army of the Romans and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes The bravest of the Ostro goths led the van the main body consisted of the remainder of their subjects and soldiers and the women and children securely followed in the rear One of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design and they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an unguarded camp But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unex pected obstacle a triple line of vessels strongly con nected with each other and which formed an impe d D 3 406 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap netrable chain of two miles and a half along the river XXI While they struggled to force their way in the un equal conflict their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys which were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke and sunk and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians their valour was ineffectual and Alatheus the king or general of the Ostrogoths perished with his bravest troops either by the sword of the Romans or in the waves of the Danube The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy On this occasion as well as on many others it is a diffi cult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius The partial and malignant historian who misrepresents every action of his reign affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valour and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus The flattering poet who cele brated in the court of Honorius the glory of the father and of the son ascribes the victory to the per sonal prowess of Theodosius and almost insinuates that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory assertions Settlement The original treaty which fixed the settlement of Goths in the Goths ascertained their privileges and stipulated â lT im tneir obligations would illustrate the history of Theo 383 395 0Sms an n s successors The series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this singular agreement The ravages of war and OF THE ROMAN UMPIRE 407 tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but chap uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians _ who might not disdain the practice of agriculture A numerous colony of the Visigoths was seated in Thrace the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle and their future industry was encouraged by an exemp tion from tribute during a certain term of years The Barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces They required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence they still cherished and propa gated their native manners and language asserted in the bosom of despotism the freedom of their domestic government and acknowledged the sove reignty of the emperor without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their fol lowers in peace and war but the royal dignity was abolished and the generals of the Goths were ap pointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the East and those haughty troops who assumed the title of Fcederati or allies were distinguished by their gold collars liberal pay and licentious privileges Their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline and while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the Romans Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace which had been extorted dd4 408 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap from him by prudence and necessity were the volun XXI tary expressions of his sincere friendship for the Gothic nation A different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions The calamities of the war were painted in the most lively colours and the first symptoms of the return of order of plenty and security were diligently exaggerated The advocates of Theodosius could affirm with some appearance of truth and rea son that it was impossible to extirpate so many war like tribes who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country and that the exhausted pro vinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen The Barbarians still wore an an gry and hostile aspect but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience that their manners would be polished by time education and the influence of Christianity and that their pos terity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people Their hos Notwithstanding these specious arguments and memsf1 these sanguine expectations it was apparent to every discerning eye that the Goths would long remain the enemies and might soon become the conquerors of the Roman empire Their rude and insolent be haviour expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials whom they insulted with impunity To the zeal and valour of the Barbarians Theodosius was indebted for the success of his arms but their assistance was precarious and they were sometimes seduced by a treacherous and inconstant disposition to abandon his standard at the moment when their service was the most essential During the civil war against Maximus a great number of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses of Macedonia wasted the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 409 adjacent provinces and obliged the intrepid monarch chap to expose his person and exert his power to suppress XXI the rising flame of rebellion The public apprehen sions were fortified by the strong suspicion that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion but the result of deep and premeditated design It was generally believed that the Goths had signed the treaty of peace with a hostile and insidious spirit and that their chiefs had previously bound themselves by a solemn and secret oath never to keep faith with the Romans to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and friendship and to watch the favourable moment of rapine of conquest and of revenge But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude several of the Gothic leaders sin cerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire or at least of the emperor the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their first and second engagements The Goths who considered themselves as the friends of peace of justice and of Rome were directed by the authority of Fravitta a valiant and honourable youth distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his man ners the liberality of his sentiments and the mild virtues of social life But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf who in flamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers On one of the solemn fes tivals when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table they were insensibly heated by wine till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect and betrayed in the presence of Theo dosius the fatal secret of their domestic disputes The emperor who had been the

Barbaric rage which disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor and as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius the public safety seemed

acknowledged the taste and eloquence of their sovereign his valour and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the soldiers and the clergy c6nsidered the humble piety of Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues The victory of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion and the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theodosius to the author of his greatness and of the public safety Gratian sur vived those memorable events only four or five years but he survived his reputation and before he fell a victim to rebellion he had lost in a great mea sure the respect and confidence of the Roman world The remarkable alteration of his character or con His defects duct may not be imputed to the arts of flattery which had besieged the son of Valentinian from his infancy nor to the headstrong passions which that gentle youth appears to have escaped A more atten tive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappointment of the public 412 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap hopes His apparent virtues instead of being the xx J hardy productions of experience and adversity were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal educa tion The anxious tenderness of his father was conti nually employed to bestow on him those advantages which he might perhaps esteem the more highly as he himself had been deprived of them and the most skilful masters of every science and of every art had laboured to form the mind and body of the young prince The knowledge which they painfully com municated was displayed with ostentation and cele brated with lavish praise His soft and tractable dis position received the fair impression of their judicious precepts and the absence of passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason His preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of mini sters of state and as they wisely dissembled their secret authority he seemed to act with firmness with propriety and with judgment on the most important occasions of his life and reign But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate beyond the surface and the skilful preceptors who so accu rately guided the steps of their royal pupil could not infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and independent principle of action which renders the laborious pursuit of glory essentially ne cessary to the happiness and almost to the existence of the hero As soon as time and accident had re moved those faithful counsellors from the throne the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his natural genius abandoned the reins of govern ment to the ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them  and amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications A public sale of favour and injustice was instituted both in the court and in the provinces by the worthless delegates of his power Among the various arts which had exer OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE â 413 cised the youth of Gratian he had applied himself chap with singular inclination and success to manage the xxiI horse to draw the bow and to dart the javelin and these qualifications which might be useful to a soldier were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting Large parks were enclosed for the Imperial pleasures and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts and Gratian neglected the duties and even the dignity of his rank to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and boldness in the chase The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to excel in an art in which he might be sur passed by the meanest of his slaves reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of Nero and Commodus but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a stranger to their monstrous vices and his hands were stained only with the blood of animals The behaviour of Gratian which degraded his cha Discontent racter in the eyes of mankind could not have dis Roman turbed the security of his r eign if the army had not 383 been provoked to resent their peculiar injuries As long as the young emperor was guided by the instruc tions of his masters he professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers many of his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp and the health the comforts the rewards the honours of his faithful troops appeared to be the object of his at tentive concern But after Gratian more freely in dulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting he naturally connected himself with the most dex terous ministers of his favourite amusement A body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic service of the palace and the admirable skill which they were accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia was exercised on a more narrow theatre in the parks and inclosures of Gaul Gratian admired the talents and customs of THE DECLIKE AND FALL these favourite guards to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his person and as if he meant to in sult the public opinion he frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people with the dress and arms the long bow the sounding quiver and the fur gar ments of a Scythian warrior The unworthy spec tacle of a Roman prince who had renounced the dress and manners of his country filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation Even the Germans so strong and formidable in the armies of the empire affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of the savages of the North who in the space of a few years had wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine A loud and licen tious murmur was echoed through the camps and garrisons of the West and as the mild indolence of Gratian neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent the want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of fear But the subversion of an established government is always a work of some real and of much apparent difficulty  and the throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom law religion and the nice balance of the civil and military powers which had been established by the policy of Constantine It is not very im portant to inquire from what causes the revolt of Britain was produced Accident is commonly the parent of disorder the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which was supposed to be more fruit ful than any other in tyrants and usurpers the le gions of that sequestered island had been long famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance and the name of Maximus was proclaimed by the tumultuary but unanimous voice both of the soldiers and of the provincials The emperor or the rebel for his title was not yet ascertained by fortune was a native of Spain the countryman the fellow soldier and the rival of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 415 Theodosius whose elevation he had not seen without chap some emotions of envy and resentment the events of XXI1 his life had long since fixed him in Britain and I should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire But this provincial rank might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity and if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office he was not in vested with the authority either of governor or ge neral His abilities and even his integrity are ac knowledged by the partial writers of the age and the merit must indeed have been conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favour of the van quished enemy of Theodosius The discontent of Maximus might incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign and to encourage perhaps without any views of ambition the murmurs of the troops But in the midst of the tumult he artfully or mo destly refused to ascend the throne and some cre dit appears to have been given to his own positive de claration that he was compelled to accept the dan gerous present of the Imperial purple But there was danger likewise in refusing the em night and pire and from the moment that Maximus had vio Q tLm lated his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he could not hope to reign or even to live if he confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of Bri tain He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of Gratian the youth of the island crowded to his standard and he invaded Gaul with a fleet and army which were long afterwards remembered as the emigration of a considerable part of the British nation The emperor in his peaceful residence of Paris was alarmed by their hostile approach and the darts which he idly wasted on lions and bears might have been employed more honourably against the 416 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap rebels But his feeble efforts announced his degenerate XXIL spirit and desperate situation and deprived him of the resources which he still might have found in the support of his subjects and allies The armies of Gaul instead of opposing the march of Maximus re ceived him with joyful and loyal acclamations and the shame of the desertion was transferred from the people to the prince The troops whose station more immediately attached them to the service of the palace abandoned the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in the neighbourhood of Paris The emperor of the West fled towards Lyons with a train of only three hundred horse and in the cities along the road where he hoped to find a refuge or at least a passage he was taught by cruel experience that every gate is shut against the unfortunate Yet he might still have reached in safety the dominions of his brother and soon have returned with the forces of Italy and the East if he had not suffered himself to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonese province Gratian was amused by pro testations of doubtful fidelity and the hopes of a sup port which could not be effectual till the arrival of Andragathius the general of the cavalry of Maximus put an end to his suspense That resolute officer executed without remorse the orders or the inten tions of the usurper Gratian as he rose from sup a d 383 per was delivered into the hands of the assassin  and Aug 25 his body was denied to the pious and pressing en treaties of his brother Valentinian The death of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful ge neral Mellobaudes the king of the Franks who maintained to the last moment of his life the ambi guous reputation which is the just recompense of obscure and subtle policy These executions might be necessary to the public safety  but the successful usurper whose power was acknowledged by all the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 417 provinces of the West had the merit and the satisfac j tion of boasting that except those who had perished by the chance of war his triumph was not stained by the blood of the Romans The events of this revolution had passed in such Treaty of rapid succession that it would have been impossible fween 6 for Theodosius to march to the relief of his benefac andX rheo tor before he received the intelligence of his defeat dosius o AD 383 and death The Eastern emperor was interrupted 387 by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of Maxi mus and the choice of a venerable old man for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs an nounced to the court of Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper The ambas sador condescended to justify or excuse the conduct of his master and to protest in specious language that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated with out his knowledge or consent by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers But he proceeded in a firm and equal tone to offer Theodosius the alternative of peace or war The speech of the ambassador con cluded with a spirited declaration that although Maximus as a Roman and as the father of his peo ple would choose rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic he was armed and prepared if his friendship should be rejected to dis pute in a field of battle the empire of the world An immediate and peremptory answer was required but it was extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy on this important occasion either the feelings of his own mind or the expectations of the public The imperious voice of honour and gratitude called aloud for revenge From the liberality of Gratian he had received the Imperial diadem his patience would encourage the odious suspicion that he was more deeply sensible of former injuries than of recent ob ligations and if he accepted the friendship he must VOL II E E 418 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap seem to share the guilt of the assassin Even the XXIL principles of justice and the interest of society would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of government and once more to re plunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age But as the senti ments of gratitude and honour should invariably re gulate the conduct of an individual they may be overbalanced in the mind of a sovereign by the sense of superior duties and the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious criminal if an innocent people would be involved in the consequences of his punishment The assassin of Gratian had usurped but he actually possessed the most warlike provinces of the empire the East was exhausted by the misfortunes and even by the success of the Gothic war and it was seriously to be apprehended that after the vital strength of the republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destruc tive contest the feeble conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the North These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to dis semble his resentment and to accept the alliance of the tyrant But he stipulated that Maximus should content himself with the possession of the countries be yond the Alps The brother of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy Africa and the Western Illyricum and some honourable conditions were inserted in the treaty to protect the memory and the laws of the deceased emperor According to the custom of the age the images of the three Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the veneration of the people  nor should it be lightly supposed that in the moment of a solemn reconciliation Theodosius secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 419 had exposed hhn to the fatal effects of their resent chap ment The orthodox bishops bewailed his death XXIL and their own irreparable loss but they were soon Baptism comforted by the discovery that Gratian had com dÂ SÂ ts mitted the sceptre of the East to the hands of a prince J 60 whose humble faith and fervent zeal were supported a d 38o by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character Among the benefactors of the church the fame of Constantine has been rivalled by the glory of Theodo sius If Constantine had the advantage of erecting the standard of the cross the emulation of his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy and of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world Theodosius was the first of the emperors baptised in the true faith of the Trinity Although he was born of a Christian family the maxims or at least the practice of the age encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation  till he was admonished of the danger of delay by the serious illness which threatened his life towards the end of the first year of his reign Before he again took the field against the Goths he received the sacrament of baptism from Acholius the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica and as the emperor ascended from the holy font still glowing with the warm feelings of regeneration he dictated a solemn edict which proclaimed his own faith and prescribed the religion of his subjects It is our pleasure such is the Imperial style that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should stedfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by St Peter to the Ro mans which faithful tradition has preserved and which is now professed by the pontiff Uamasus and by Peter bishop of Alexandria

they must expect to suffer the severe penal ties which our authority guided by heavenly wis dom shall think proper to inflict upon them  The faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of in struction rather than of inquiry but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the visible land marks of orthodoxy which he had so prudently constituted his religious opinions were never affected by the spe cious texts the subtle arguments and the ambiguous creeds of the Arian doctors rfConstan Constantinople was the principal seat and fortress tinopie of Arianism and in a long interval of forty years 38o 340â

with so much Christian blood was successively filled by Eudoxus and Damophilus Their diocese en joyed a free importation of vice and error from every province of the empire the eager pursuit of religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy idleness of the metropolis The heretics of various denominations subsisted in peace under the protec tion of the Arians of Constantinople who endea voured to secure the attachment of those obscure sectaries while they abused with unrelenting se verity the victory which they had obtained over the followers of the council of Nice During

religion and it has been chap observed in pathetic language that the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the mountains or to be devoured by rapacious wolves But as their zeal instead of being subdued derived strength and vigour from oppression they seized the first moments of imperfect freedom which they ac quired by the death of Valens to form themselves into a regular congregation under the conduct of an episcopal pastor Two natives of Cappadocia Basil and Gregory Nazianzen were distinguished above all Gregory i â 11 â r n Nazianzen their contemporaries by the rare

every spark of emula tion or envy appeared to be totally extinguished in the holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil But the exaltation of Basil from a private life to the archiepiscopal throne of Caesarea discovered to the world and perhaps to himself the pride of his character and the first favour which he condescended to bestow on his friend was received and perhaps was intended as a cruel insult Instead of employing the superior talents of Gregory in some useful and conspicuous station the haughty prelate selected among the fifty bishoprics of his extensive province the wretched village of Sasima without water with out verdure without society situate at the junction of three highways and frequented only by the in cessant passage of rude and clamorous waggoners Gregory submitted with reluctance to this humiliating exile he was ordained bishop of Sasima but he e E 3 422 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap solemnly protests that he never consummated his XXI1 spiritual

religious worship and the name of Anastasia was chosen to express the resur rection of the Nicene faith This private conventicle was afterwards converted into a magnificent church The pulpit of the Anastasia was the scene of the labours and triumphs of Gregory Nazianzen and in the space of two years he experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary The Arians who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise represented his doctrine as if he had preached three distinct and equal Deities and the devout populace was excited to suppress by violence and tumult the irregular assemblies of the Athanasian heretics From the cathedral of St Sophia there issued a motley crowd  of common beggars who had forfeited their claim to pity of monks who had the appearance of goats or satyrs and of women more terrible than so many Jezebels The doors of the Ana stasia were broke open much mischief was perpe trated or attempted with sticks

might complain with some appearance of justice that an inconsiderable congregation of e e 4 424 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap sectaries should usurp the hundred churches which XXI1 they were insufficient to fill whilst the far greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place of religious worship Theodosius was still inexorable and the church of St Sophia was occupied by a large body of the Imperial guards If the mind of Gre gory was susceptible of pride he must have felt a very lively satisfaction when the emperor conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph and with his own hand respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal throne of Constantinople But the saint who had not subdued the imperfections of human virtue was deeply affected by the mortifying consideration that the glittering arms which sur rounded his person were necessary for his safety and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party whom as men and citizens it was impossible for him to despise He beheld the in numerable multitude of either sex and of every age who crowded the streets the windows and the roofs of the houses he heard the tumultuous voice of rage grief astonishment and despair and Gregory fairly confesses that on the memorable day of his installa tion the capital of the East wore the appearance of a city taken by storm and in the hands of a Barba rian conqueror About six weeks afterwards Theo dosius declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately refuse to profess the In the East doctrine of the council of Nice His lieutenant Sapor janDjQ81 was armed with the ample powers of a general law a special commission and a military force and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with so much discretion and vigour that the religion of the em peror was established without tumult or bloodshed in all the provinces of the East Yet there is reason OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 425 to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was chap in some measure eluded by the want of resistance and that in their adversity the Arians displayed much less firmness than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and Valens The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and speculative mind but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed most powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion was much better adapted to become popular and successful in a believing age The hope that truth and wisdom would be found â e cmm in the assemblies of the orthodox clergy induced the stantinople emperor to convene at Constantinople a synod of May 381 one hundred and fifty bishops who proceeded with out much difficulty or delay to complete the theo logical system which had been established in the coun cil of Nice The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God and the various opinions which were embraced concerning the Second were extended and transferred by a natural analogy to the Third person of the Trinity Yet it was found or it was thought necessary by the victorious adversaries of Arianism to explain the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors to confirm the faith of the Ca tholics and to condemn an unpopular and incon sistent sect of Macedonians who freely admitted that the Son was consubstantial to the Father while they were fearful of seeming to acknowledge the ex istence of Three Gods A final and unanimous sen tence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of the Holy Ghost the mysterious doctrine has been received by all the nations and all the churches of the Christian world and their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of Theodosius the second rank among the general councils THE DECLINE AND FALL chap Among the ecclesiastics who illustrated the reign XXIL of Theodosius Gregory Nazianzen was distinguished Ambrose by the talents of an eloquent preacher the reputa pf Milan tion of miraculous gifts added weight and dignity to 397 374_ ne monastic virtues of Martin of Tours but the palm of episcopal vigour and ability was justly claimed by the intrepid Ambrose He was descended from a noble family of Romans his father had exercised the important office of Praetorian prefect of Gaul Gratian loved and revered him as a father and the elaborate treatise on the faith of the Trinity was de signed for the instruction of the young prince After his tragic death at a time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety and for that of her son Valentinian the archbishop of Milan was despatched on two different embassies to the court of Treves He exercised with equal firmness and dexterity the powers of his spiritual and political characters and perhaps contributed by his authority and eloquence to check the ambition of Maximus and to protect the peace of Italy Ambrose had devoted his life and his abilities to the service of the church Wealth was the object of his contempt he had renounced his private patrimony and he sold without hesitation the consecrated plate for the redemption of captives The clergy and people of Milan were attached to their archbishop and he deserved the esteem with out soliciting the favour or apprehending the dis pleasure of his feeble sovereigns His success The government of Italy and of the young em ful opposi Â 111 IT tion to the peror naturally devolved to his mother Justina a Jus ina woman of beauty and spirit but who in the midst of April 3 1 an ort hodox people had the misfortune of professing April 10 the Arian heresy which she endeavoured to instil into the mind of her son Justina was persuaded that a Roman emperor might claim in his own do OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 427 minions the public exercise of his religion and she chap proposed to the archbishop as a moderate and rea XX1L sonable concession that he should resign the use of a single church either in the city or suburbs of Milan But the conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Cajsar but the churches were the houses of God and within the limits of his diocese he himself as the lawful successor of the apostles was the only minister of God The privileges of Chris tianity temporal as well as spiritual were confined to the true believers and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied that his own theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy The archbishop declared with modest firmness his resolution to die a martyr rather than yield and Justina who re sented the refusal as an act of insolence and rebellion hastily determined to exert the Imperial prerogative of her son As she desired to perform her public de votions on the approaching festival of Easter Am brose was ordered to appear before the council He obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject but he was followed without his consent by an innumerable people they pressed with impe tuous zeal against the gates of the palace and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian instead of pro nouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan humbly requested that he would interpose his authority to protect the person of the emperor and to restore the tranquillity of the capital But the promises which Ambrose received and communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court and during six of the most solemn days which Christian piety has set apart for the exercise of religion the city was agitated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism The officers of the household were di 428 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap rected to prepare first the Portian and afterwards XXI the new Basilica for the immediate reception of the emperor and his mother The splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the cus tomary manner but it was found necessary to de fend them by a strong guard from the insults of the populace The Arian ecclesiastics who ventured to show themselves in the streets were exposed to the most imminent danger of their lives and Ambrose enjoyed the merit and reputation of rescuing his per sonal enemies from the hands of the enraged multi tude But while he laboured to restrain the effects of their zeal the pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry and seditious temper of the people of Milan The measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the evil A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the corporate body of merchants and manufacturers an order was signified in the name of the emperor to all the officers and inferior servants of the courts of justice that during the continuance of the public disorders they should strictly confine themselves to their houses and the ministers of Valentinian im prudently confessed that the most respectable part of the citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop He was again solicited to restore peace to his country by a timely compliance with the will of his sovereign The reply of Ambrose was couched in the most humble and respectful terms which might however be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war His life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor but he would never betray the church of Christ or degrade the dignity  of the episcopal character In such a cause he was prepared to suffer whatever malice could in OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 429 flict and he only wished to die in the presence of chap his faithful flock and at the foot of the altar he XXI1 had not contributed to excite but it was in the power of God alone to appease the rage of the people he deprecated the scenes of blood and con fusion which were likely to ensue and it was his fervent prayer that he might not survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city and perhaps the de solation of all Italy The obstinate bigotry of Justina would have endangered the empire of her son if in this contest with the church and people of Milan she could have depended on the active obe dience of the troops of the palace A large body of Goths had marched to occupy the Basilica which was the object of the dispute and it might be ex pected from the Arian principles and barbarous man ners of these foreign mercenaries that they would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most sanguinary orders They were encountered on the sacred threshold by the archbishop who thun dering against them a sentence of excommunication asked them in the tone of a father and a master Whether it was to invade the house of God that they had implored the hospitable protection of the repub lic The suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more effectual negotiation and the em press was persuaded by the advice of her wisest counsellors to leave the Catholics in possession of all the churches of Milan and to dissemble till a more convenient season her intentions of revenge The mother of Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose and the royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation that his own servants were ready to be tray him into the hands of an insolent priest The laws of the empire some of which were in a d 386 scribed with the name of Valentinian still condemned 430 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap the Arian heresy and seemed to excuse the resistance XX1L of the Catholics By the influence of Justin an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were subject to the court of Milan the free exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the faith of Rimini and the emperor de clared that all persons who should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution should be capitally punished as the enemies of the public peace The character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the suspicion that his conduct soon afforded a rea sonable ground or at least a specious pretence to the Arian ministers who watched the opportunity of sur prising him in some act of disobedience to a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and tyranny A sentence of easy and honourable banishment was pronounced which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without delay whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile and the number of his companions But he boldly refused to obey and his refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful people They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly secured and the Imperial troops who had formed the blockade were unwilling to risk the attack of that impregnable fortress The numerous poor who had been relieved by the liberality of Ambrose embraced the fair occa sion of signalizing their zeal and gratitude and as the patience of the multitude might have been ex hausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils he prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful institution of a loud and regular psalmody The feeble sovereign of Italy found him self unable to contend with the archbishop The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the defence OF THE 110MAN EMPIRE 431 of Ambrose the disinterested advice of Theodosius chap was the general result of piety and friendship and XXI1 the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace Maximus and prosperity could he have contented himself with itaiy the possession of three ample countries which now August 87 constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms of modern Europe But the aspiring usurper whose sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms considered his actual forces as the in struments only of his future greatness and his suc cess was the immediate cause of his destruction The wealth which he extorted from the oppressed provinces of Gaul Spain and Britain was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians collected for the most part from the fiercest nations of Germany The conquest of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations and he secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth whose government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects But as Maximus wished to oc cupy without resistance the passes of the Alps he received with perfidious smiles Domninus of Syria the ambassador of Valentinian and pressed him to accept the aid of a considerable body of troops for the service of a Pannonian war The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship but the Syrian Domninus was corrupted or deceived by the liberal favour of the court of Treves and the council of Milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger with a blind confidence which was the effect not of courage but of fear The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador and they were ad mitted without distrust into the fortresses of the Alps 432 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap But the crafty tyrant followed with hasty and silent XX1L footsteps in the rear and as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions the gleam of armour and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry first announced the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan In this extremity Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence and the per fidious arts of Maximus but they wanted time and force and resolution to stand against the Gauls and Germans either in the field or within the walls of a large and disaffected city Flight was their only hope Aquileia their only refuge and as Maximus now dis played his genuine character the brother of Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same assassin Maximus entered Milan in triumph and if the wise archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connexion with the usurper he might in directly contribute to the success of his arms by in culcating from the pulpit the duty of resignation rather than that of resistance The unfortunate jjustina reached Aquileia in safety but she distrusted the strength of the fortifications she dreaded the event of a siege and she resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius whose power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the West A vessel was secretly provided to transport the Im perial family they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure harbours ofVenetia or Istria traversed the whole extent of the Hadriatic and Ionian seas turned the extreme promontory of Pelo ponnesus and after a long but successful naviga tion reposed themselves in the port of Thessalonica Flight of All the subjects of Valentinian deserted the cause of Vaienunian a prince wh0  abdication had absolved them from the duty of allegiance and if the little city of Winona on the verge of Italy had not presumed to OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 433 stop the career of his inglorious victory Maximus chap would have obtained without a struggle the sole XXI1 possession of the Western empire Instead of inviting his royal guests to the palace Theodosius of Constantinople Theodosius had some unknown i Aeâ se reasons to fix their residence at Thessalonica but Sl 111611 these reasons did not proceed from contempt or in a d 387 difference as he speedily made a visit to that city accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate After the first tender expressions of friend ship and sympathy the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina that the guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world as well as in the next and that the public profession of the Nicene faith would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of her son by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth and in heaven The momentous question of peace or war was referred by Theodosius to the deliberation of his council and the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honour and justice had acquired since the death of Gratian a considerable degree of additional weight The persecution of the Imperial family to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his fortune was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition of Maximus and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures instead of prolonging the blessings of peace would expose the eastern em pire to the danger of a hostile invasion The Bar barians who had passed the Danube had lately as sumed the character of soldiers and subjects but their native fierceness was yet untamed and the opera tions of a war which would exercise their valour and diminish their numbers might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression Notwith standing these specious and solid reasons which were VOL II F F 434 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap approved by a majority of the council Theodosius  still hesitated whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation and his magnanimous character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt for the safety of his infant sons and the welfare of his exhausted people In this moment of anxious doubt while the fate of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the cause of her bro ther Valentinian The heart of Theodosius was softened by the tears of beauty his affections were insensibly engaged by the graces of youth and inno cence the art of Justina managed and directed the impulse of passion and the celebration of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil war The unfeeling critics who consider every amorous weakness as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox emperor are inclined on this occasion to dispute the suspicious evidence of the hi storian Zosimus For my own part I shall frankly con fess that I am willing to find or even to seek in the revolutions of the world some traces of the mild and fender sentiments of domestic life and amidst the crowd of fierce and ambitious conquerors I can di stinguish with peculiar complacency a gentle hero who may be supposed to receive his armour from the hands of love The alliance of the Persian king was secured by the faith of treaties the martial Barba rians were persuaded to follow the standard or to respect the frontiers of an active and liberal monarch and the dominions of Theodosius from the Euphrates to the Hadriatic resounded with the preparations of war both by land and sea The skilful disposition of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their num bers and distracted the attention of Maxim us He had reason to fear that a chosen body of troops OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE 435 under the command of the intrepid Arbogastes would chap direct their march along the banks of the Danube and boldly penetrate through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul A powerful fleet was equip ped in the harbours of Greece and Epirus with an apparent design that as soon as a passage had been opened by a naval victory Valentinian and his mo ther should land in Italy proceed without delay to Rome and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire In the meanwhile Theodosius himself ad vanced at the head of a brave and disciplined army to encounter his unworthy rival who after the siege of jEmona had fixed his camp in the neighbourhood of Siscia a city of Pannonia strongly fortified by the broad and rapid stream of the Save The veterans who still remembered the long re Defeat and sistance and successive resources of the tyrant Mag a g nentius might prepare themselves for the labours of a d 388 three bloody campaigns But the contest with his August successor who like him had usurped the throne of the west was easily decided in the term of two months and within the space of two hundred miles The superior genius of the emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus who in this im portant crisis showed himself destitute of military skill or personal courage but the abilities of Theo dosius were seconded by the advantage which he pos sessed of a numerous and active cavalry The Huns the Alani and after their example the Goths them selves were formed into squadrons of archers who fought on horseback and confounded the steady va lour of the Goths and Germans by the rapid motions of a Tartar war After the fatigue of a long march in the heat of summer

bravest soldiers of Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror Without suspending his march to receive the loyal acclama tions of the citizens of Emona Theodosius pressed forwards to terminate the war by the death or cap tivity of his rival who fled before him with the dili gence of fear From the summit of the Julian Alps he descended with such incredible speed into the plain of Italy that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the first day and Maximus who found himself en compassed on all sides had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city But the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy and the despair the disaffection the indifference of the soldiers and people hastened the downfal of the wretched Maximus He was dragged from his throne rudely stripped of the Imperial ornaments the robe the diadem and the purple slippers and conducted like a malefactor to the camp and presence of Theodosius at a place about three miles from Aquileia The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to insult and he showed some disposition to pity and forgive the tyrant of the West who had never been his personal enemy and was now become the object of his contempt Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are exposed and the spec tacle of a proud competitor now prostrate at his feet could not fail of producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor But OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 437 the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked chap by his regard for public justice and the memory of XX1L Gratian and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers who drew him out of the Imperial presence and instantly separated his head from his body The intelligence of his defeat and death was received with sincere or well dissembled joy his son Victor on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus died by the order perhaps by the hand of the bold Arbogastes and all the military plans of Theodosius were successfully executed When he had thus terminated the civil war with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally expect he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan to restore the state of the afflicted provinces and early in the spring he made after the example of Constantine and Constantius his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire The orator who may be silent without danger virtues of may praise without difficulty and without reluctance Theodoslus and posterity will confess that the character of Theo dosius might furnish the subject of a sincere and ample panegyric The wisdom of his laws and the success of his arms rendered his administration re spectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies He loved and practised the virtues of do mestic life Theodosius was chaste and temperate he enjoyed without excess the sensual and social pleasures of the table  and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from their lawful objects The proud titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of a faithful husband an indul gent father his uncle was raised by his affectionate

his eyes without a mask the consciousness of personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of the purple and he proved by his conduct that he had forgotten all the injuries while he most gratefully remembered all the favours and services which he had received before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire The serious or lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age the rank or the character of his sub jects whom he admitted into his society and the affa bility of his manners displayed the image of his mind Theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and virtuous every art every talent of an useful or even of an innocent nature was rewarded by his ju dicious liberality and except the heretics whom he persecuted with implacable hatred the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the limits of the human race The government of a mighty empire may assuredly suffice to occupy the time and the abilities of a mortal yet the diligent prince without aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amnsement of read ing History which enlarged his experience was his favourite study The annals of Rome in the long period of eleven hundred years presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life and it has been particularly observed that whenever he per used the cruel acts of Cinna of Marius or of Sylla he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity and freedom His disinterested opinion of past events was usefully applied as the rule of his own actions and Theodosius has deserved the singular commendation that his virtues always seemed OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 439 to expand with his fortune the season of his pros chap perity was that of his moderation and his clemency XX11 appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of the civil war The Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat of the victory and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals suffered the punishment of the law But the emperor showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than to chastise the guilty The oppressed subjects of the West who would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their lands were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to their losses and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged mother and educated the orphan daughters of Maximus  A character thus accom plished might almost excuse the extravagant sup position of the orator Pacatus that if the elder Bru tus could be permitted to revisit the earth the stern republican would abjure at the feet of Theodosius his hatred of kings and ingenuously confess that such a monarch was the most faithful guardian of the happiness and dignity of the Roman people t Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic Faults must have discerned two essential imperfections which dosl 0 might perhaps have abated his recent love of despot ism The virtuous mind of Theodosius was often re laxed by indolence and it was sometimes inflamed by passion In the pursuit of an important object his active courage was capable of the most vigorous exer tions but as soon as the design was accomplished or the danger was surmounted the hero sunk into inglorious

intem perate sallies of passion  and the success of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency But the pain ful virtue which claims the merit of victory is exposed to the danger of defeat and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian Within the space of three years the inconsistent hi storian of Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica TheÂ edi The lively impatience of the inhabitants of An Antioch tioch was never satisfied with their own situation or A D 387 with the character and conduct of their successive sovereigns The Arian subjects of Theodosius de plored the loss of their churches and as three rival bishops disputed the throne of Antioch the sentence which decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two unsuccessful congregations The exigencies of the Gothic war and the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the peace had con strained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public impositions and the provinces of Asia as they had not been involved in the distress were the less inclined to contribute to the relief of Europe The auspicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign a festival more grateful to the soldiers who received a liberal donative than to the subjects whose voluntary offerings had been long since converted into an extraordinary and oppressive â burthen The edicts of taxation interrupted the re pose and pleasures of Antioch and the tribunal of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 441 the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant crowd who in pathetic but at first in respectful language L solicited the redress of their grievances They were gradually incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers who treated their complaints as a criminal re sistance their satirical wit degenerated into sharp and angry invectives and from the subordinate powers of government the invectives of the people insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor himself Their fury provoked by a feeble Feb 26 opposition discharged itself on the images of the Imperial family which were erected as objects of public veneration in the most conspicuous places of the city The statues of Theodosius of his father of his wife Flacilla of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius were insolently thrown down from their pedestals broken in pieces or dragged with contempt through the streets and the indignities which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the populace The tumult was almost im mediately suppressed by the arrival of a body of archers and Antioch had leisure to reflect on the nature and consequences of her crime Accord ing to the duty of his office the governor of the pro vince despatched a faithful narrative of the whole transaction while the trembling citizens intrusted  the confession of their crime and the assurance of their repentance to the zeal of Flavian their bishop and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius the friend and most probably the disciple of Libanius whose genius on this melancholy occasion was not useless to his country But the two capitals An tioch and Constantinople were separated by a di stance of seven or eight hundred miles and notwith standing the diligence of the Imperial posts the guilty city was severely punished by a long and 442 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap dreadful interval of suspense Every rumour agitated XXI1 the hopes and fears of the Antiochians and they heard with terror that their sovereign exasperated by the insult which had been offered to his own statue and more especially to those of his beloved wife had resolved to level with the ground the offend ing city and to massacre without distinction of age or sex the criminal inhabitants many of whom were actually driven by their apprehensions to seek a refuge in the mountains of Syria and the adjacent March 22 desert At length twenty four days after the sedi tion the general Hellebicus and Caesarius master of the offices declared the will of the emperor and the sentence of Antioch That proud capital was de graded from the rank of a city and the metropolis of the East stripped of its lands its privileges and its revenues was subjected under the humiliating deno mination of a village to the jurisdiction of Laodicea The Baths the Circus and the Theatres were shut and that every source of plenty and pleasure might at the same time be intercepted the distribution of corn was abolished by the severe instructions of Theodosius His commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of individuals of those who had perpetrated and of those who had not prevented the destruction of the sacred statues The tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius encompassed with armed soldiers was erected in the midst of the Forum The noblest and most wealthy of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in chains the examination was assisted by the use of torture and their sentence was pronounced or suspended according to the judg ment of these extraordinary magistrates The houses of the criminals were exposed to sale their wives and children were suddenly reduced from affluence and luxury to the most abject distress and a bloody exe cution was expected to conclude the horrors But OF THE KOMAN EMPIRE 448 the ministers of Theodosius performed with reluct chap ance the cruel task which had been assigned to them XX1X they dropped a gentle tear over the calamities of the people and they listened with reverence to the pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits who descended in swarms from the mountains Helle bicus and Caesarius were persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence and it was agreed that the former should remain at Antioch while the latter returned with all possible speed to Constan tinople and presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign The resentment of Theodosius had J 7 already subsided the deputies of the people both dosius the bishop and the orator had obtained a favourable audience  and the reproaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendship rather than the stern menaces of pride and power A free and general pardon was granted to the city and citizens of An tioch the prison doors were thrown open senators who despaired of their lives recovered the possession of their houses and estates and the capital of the East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and splendour Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of Constantinople who had ge nerously interceded for their distressed brethren  he

the charioteers of the Circus The insolent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric and he sternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude who on the day of the public games lamented the absence of their favourite and consi dered the skill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue The resentment of the people was imbittered by some previous disputes and as the strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of the Italian war the feeble remnant whose numbers were reduced by desertion could not save the unhappy general from their licen tious fury Botheric and several of his principal officers were inhumanly murdered their mangled bodies were dragged about the streets and the em peror who then resided at Milan was surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of Thessalonica The sentence of a dispassionate judge would have inflicted a severe pu nishment on the authors of the crime and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indignation of his master The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry and he hastily resolved that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood of the guilty people Yet his mind still fluctuated between the counsels of clemency and of revenge the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general pardon  his passion was again inflamed by the flatter ing suggestions of his minister Rufinus

massacre The pro miscuous carnage continued three hours without dis crimination of strangers or natives of age or sex of innocence or guilt the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven thousand and it is affirmed by some writers that more than fifteen thou sand victims were sacrificed to the manes of Botheric A foreign merchant who had probably no concern in his murder offered

the great church at Milan He was stopped in the porch by the archbishop who in the tone and language of an ambassador of heaven declared to his sovereign that private contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault or to appease the justice of the offended Deity Theodosius humbly represented that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide David the man after God s own heart had been

the massacre of Thessalonica the murderer should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour of his death But the archbishop consulting the maxims of religious policy granted some

some new provocation the emperor without strength or counsel too hastily resolved to risk an immediate contest with his powerful general He received Ai bogastes on the throne and as the count approached with some appearance of respect delivered to him a paper which dismissed him from all his em ployments My authority replied Arbogastes with insulting coolness does not depend on the smilet

passed a disconsolate night without sleep without provisions and without hopes except that strong assurance which under the most desperate circumstances the independent mind may derive from the contempt of fortune and of life The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp whilst the active and vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains and to encompass the rear of the Eastern army The dawn of day discovered to the eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger but his apprehensions were soon dis pelled by a friendly message from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination to desert the standard of the tyrant The honourable and lu crative rewards which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy were granted without hesitation and as ink and paper could not easily be procured the emperor subscribed on his own tablets the ratifica tion of the

diverted or repelled their ineffectual javelins This accidental advantage was skilfully improved the violence of the storm was magnified by the super stitious terrors of the Gauls and they yielded with out shame to the invisible powers of heaven who seemed to militate on the side of the pious emperor His victory was decisive and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference of their characters The rhetorician Eugenius who had almost acquired the dominion of the world was reduced to implore the mercy of the conqueror and the unrelenting soldiers separated his

Corruption his imperfections have not been dissembled the act of cruelty and the habits of indolence which tar nished the glory of one of the greatest of the Roman princes An historian perpetually adverse to the fame of Theodosius has exaggerated his vices and their pernicious effects he boldly asserts that every rank of subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign that every species of corruption pol luted the course of public and private life and that the feeble restraints of order and decency were insuf ficient to resist the progress of that degenerate spirit which sacrifices without a blush the consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and appetite The complaints of contemporary writers  Zosimus 1 iv p 244 THE DECLINE AND FALL who deplore the increase of luxury and depravation of manners are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation There are few observers who possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revo lutions of society and who are capable of discover ing the nice and secret springs of action which im pel in the same uniform direction the blind and ca pricious passions of a multitude of individuals If it can be affirmed with any degree of truth that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless and dis solute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age of Constantine perhaps or of Augustus the alteration cannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements which had gradually increased the stock of national riches A long period of calamity or decay must have checked the industry and diminished the wealth of the people and their profuse luxury must have been the result of that indolent despair which enjoys the present hour and declines the thoughts of fu turity The uncertain condition of their property discouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious undertakings which re quire an immediate expense and promise a slow and distant advantage The frequent examples of ruin and desolation tempted them not to spare the remains of a patrimony which might every hour become the prey of the rapacious Goth And the mad prodi gality which prevails in the confusion of a shipwreck or a siege may serve to explain the progress of luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation The effeminate luxury which infected the manners of courts and cities had instilled a secret and destruc tive poison into the camps of the legions and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer who had accurately studied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman discipline It is the just and important observation of Vegetius that the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 459 infantry was invariably covered with defensive armour chap from the foundation of the city to the reign of the XXIL emperor Gratian The relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the soldiers less able and less willing to support the fatigues of the service they complained of the weight of the armour which they seldom wore and they successively obtained the permission of laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets The heavy weapons of their ancestors the short sword and the formidable pilum which had subdued the world insensibly dropped from their feeble hands As the use of the shield is incom patible with that of the bow they reluctantly marched into the field condemned to suffer either the pain of wounds or the ignominy of flight and always dis posed to prefer the more shameful alternative The cavalry of the Goths the Huns and the Alani had felt the benefits and adopted the use of defensive armour and as they excelled in the management of missile weapons they easily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions whose heads and breasts were exposed without defence to the arrows of the Bar barians The loss of armies the destruction of cities and the dishonour of the Roman name ineffectually solicited the successors of Gratian to restore the hel mets and cuirasses of the infantry The enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the public de fence and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered as the immediate cause of the downfal of the empire  Mr Gibbon has here interrupted his History by what may properly be styled a Dissertation rather than a Narrative respecting the fall of paganism and the alterations in the worship of the Christians As I have already observed that the History of the Church is not intended to form a part of the present publication I shall content myself with stating the most material circumstances of a very long chapter in the few sentences that are subjoined The fall of paganism which with one short interval had been progressive from the time of Constantine was rendered complete during the reign of Theo dosius The worship of Jupiter was condemned at Rome in the year 388 by the decree of a very large majority of the senate and the worship of idols with 460 THE DECLINE AND FALL  CHAP the sacrifice of guiltless warns was prohibited throughout the whole empire by XXII express edict in 390 Polytheism appears from this period to haye sunk so  rapidly in all the provinces that twenty eight years after the death of the great Xheodosius we find in the Theodosian code of the second emperor of that r the following words Pagan OS quos supersunt quanquam jum nuDos ess miu This expression was undoubtedly rather too general but we may c from it that the number of pagans was at that time become very r able Ed Among many anecdotes respecting the destruction of the objects of j ship there is one which is so well told by Mr Gibbon that tie editor thinks the reader will not be displeased at its insertion It relates to the celebrated statue of Serapis at Alexandria The colossal statue of Serapis was involved in the ruin of his temple and reli gion A great number of plates of different metals artificially joined together composed the majestic figure of the deity who touched on either side the walls of the sanctuary The aspect of Serapis his sitting posture and the sceptre which he bore in his left hand were extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter He was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket or bushel which was placed on his head and by the emblematic monster which he held in his right hand the had and body of a serpent branching into three tails which were again ter minated by the triple heads of a dog a lion and a wolf It was confidently affirmed that if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the god the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their original chaos An intrepid soldier animated by zeal and armed with a weighty battle axe ascended the ladder and even the Christian multitude expected with some anxiety the event of the combat  He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of Serapis the cheek fell to the ground the thunder was still silent and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve their accustomed order and tranquil lity The victorious soldier repeated his blows the huge idol was overthrown and broken in pieces and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged through the streets of Alexandra His mangled carcass was burnt in the am phitheatre amidst the shouts of the populace and many persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the impotence of their tutelar deity The popular modes of religion that propose any visible and material objects of worship have the advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the senses of mankind but this advantage is counterbalanced by the various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the idolater is exposed It is scarcely possible that in every disposition of mind he should preserve his implicit reverence for the idols or the relics which the naked eye and the profane hand are unable to distinguish from the most common productions of art or nature and if in the hour of danger their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own preservation he scorns the vain apologies of his priests and justly derides the objects and the folly of his superstitious attachments After the fall of Serapis some hopes were still entertained by the pagans that the Nile would refuse his annual supply to the impious masters of Egypt and the extraordinary delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the river god But this delay was soon compen sated by the rapid swell of the waters They suddenly rose to such an unusual height as to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation of a de luge till the peaceful river again subsided to the well known and fertilizing level of sixteen cubits or about thirty English feet OF THE KOMAN

appearance of an injury and his personal enemies had forfeited in his opinion the merit of all public services Promotus the master general of the infantry had saved the em pire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths but he indignantly supported the pre eminence of a rival whose character and profession he despised and in the midst of a public council the impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favourite This act of violence was re presented to the emperor as an insult which it was incumbent on his dignity to resent The disgrace and exile of Promotus were signified by a peremptory order to repair without delay to a military station on the banks of the Danube and the death of that general though he was slain in a skirmish with the Barbarians was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus The sacrifice of a hero gratified his re venge the honours of the consulship elated his vanity but his power was still imperfect and preca rious as long as

a consular senator the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his son the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck but in the moment when he expected and perhaps desired the relief of a speedy death he was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile The punishment of the two praefects might perhaps be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 465 conduct the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated chap by the jealous and unsociable nature of ambition xxiIL But he indulged a spirit of revenge equally repug nant to prudence and to justice when he degraded their native country pf Lycia from the rank of Ro man provinces stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of ignominy and declared that the country men of Tatian and Proculus should ever remain in capable of holding any employment of honour or ad vantage under the Imperial government The character of Theodosius imposed on his mi He oP nister the task of hypocrisy which disguised and gJJ thc sometimes restrained the abuse of power and Ru a d 395 finus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abi lities and the virtue which had raised him to the throne But the absence and soon afterwards the death of the emperor confirmed the absolute autho rity of Rufinus over the person and dominions of Arcadius a feeble youth whom the imperious pre fect considered as his pupil rather than his sovereign Regardless of the public opinion he indulged his pas sions without remorse and without resistance and his malignant and rapacious spirit rejected every pas sion that might have contributed to his own glory or the happiness of the people His avarice which seems to have prevailed in his corrupt mind over every other sentiment attracted the wealth of the East by the various arts of partial and general ex tortion oppressive taxes scandalous bribery im moderate fines unjust confiscations forced or ficti tious testaments by which the tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of strangers or enemies and the public sale of justice as well as of favour which he instituted in the palace of Constan tinople The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited at the expense of the fairest part of his patrimony VOL II H H THE DECLINE AND FALL the honours and emoluments of some provincial go vernment the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal whose punish ment was profitable only to the praefect of the East his accomplice and his judge If avarice were not the blindest of the human passions the motives of Rufinus might excite our curiosity and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without folly nor possess without danger Perhaps he vainly imagined that he laboured for the interest of an only daughter on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil and the august rank of Empress of the East Perhaps he deceived himself by the opi nion that his avarice was the instrument of his am bition He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis which should no longer de pend on the caprice of the young emperor yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people by the liberal distribution of those riches which he had acquired with so much toil and with so much guilt The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the reproach and envy of ill gotten wealth his dependents served him without attach ment the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear The fate of Lu cian proclaimed to the East that the praefect whose industry was much abated in the despatch of ordinary business was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge Lucian the son of the praefect Floren tius the oppressor of Gaul and the enemy of Julian had employed a considerable part of his inheritance the fruit of rapine and corruption to purchase the friendship of Rufinus and the high office of Count OF THK ROMAN EMPIRE 467 of the East But the new magistrate imprudently chap departed from the maxims of the court and of the XX i times disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration and presumed to refuse an act of injustice which might have tended to the profit of the emperor s uncle Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult and the prefect of the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power He performed with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles from Constantinople to Antioch en tered the capital of Syria at the dead of night and spread universal consternation among a people igno rant of his design but not ignorant of his character The count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged like the vilest malefactor before the ar bitrary tribunal of Rufinus Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity which was not im peached even by the voice of an accuser Lucian was condemned almost without a trial to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment The ministers of the tyrant by the order and in the presence of their master beat him on the neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead and when he fainted under the violence of the pain he was re moved in a close litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act the sole object of his expedition than he returned amidst the deep and silent curses of a trembling people from Antioch to Constantinople and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing without delay the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the Tji  He is dis JWlSt appointed But Rufinus soon experienced that a prudent mi h the â ar 1 nage ot nister should constantly secure his royal captive by the Arcadius   u u a A I 3 95 H H Z April 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL strong though invisible chain of habit and that the merit and much more easily the favour of the absent are obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign While the prefect satiated his revenge at Antioch a secret conspiracy of the fa vourite eunuchs directed by the great chamberlain Eutropius undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus who had been chosen without his consent for his bride and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia the daughter of Bauto a general of the Franks in the service of Rome and who was edu cated since the death of her father in the family of the sons of Promotus The young emperor whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor Arsenius eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia he gazed with impatient ardour on her picture and he understood the necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness Soon after the return of Rufinus the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was an nounced to the people of Constantinople who pre pared to celebrate with false and hollow acclamations the fortune of his daughter A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued in hymeneal pomp from the gates of the palace bearing aloft the diadem the robes and the inestimable ornaments of the future empress The solemn procession passed through the streets of the city which were adorned with garlands and filled with spectators but when it reached the house of the sons of Promotus the principal eunuch respectfully entered the mansion invested the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arcadius The OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE secresy and success with which this conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a mini ster who had suffered himself to be deceived in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation consti tute the most distinguished merit He considered with a mixture of indignation and fear the victory of an aspiring eunuch who had secretly captivated the favour of his sovereign and the disgrace of his daughter whose interest was inseparably connected with his own wounded the tenderness or at least the pride of Rufinus At the moment when he flat tered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings a foreign maid who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies was intro duced into the Imperial bed and Eudoxia soon dis played a superiority of sense and spirit to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband The em peror would soon be instructed to hate to fear and to destroy the powerful subject whom he had in jured â and the consciousness of guilt deprived Ru finus of every hope either of safety or comfort in the retirement of a private life But he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity and perhaps of oppressing his enemies The prefect still exercised an uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of the East â and his treasures if he could resolve to use them might be employed to procure proper instruments for the exe cution of the blackest designs that pride ambition and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman The character of Rufinus seemed to justify the accusa tions that he conspired against the person of his so vereign to seat himself on the vacant throne and that he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to in vade the provinces of the empire and to increase the public confusion The subtle prafect whose life had h h3 THE DECLINE AND FALL been spent in the intrigues of the palace opposed with equal arms the artful measures of the eunuch Eutropius but the timid soul of Rufinus was asto nished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival of the great Stilicho the general or rather the master of the empire of the West The celestial gift which Achilles obtained and Alexander envied of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has been enjoyed by Stilicho in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the declining state of genius and of art The muse of Claudian devoted to his service was always prepared to stigmatize his adversaries Rufinus or Eutropius with eternal infamy or to paint in the most splendid colours the victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor In the review of a period in differently supplied with authentic materials we can not refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius from the invectives or the panegyrics of a contemporary writer but as Claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier some criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or exaggeration into the truth and simpli city of historic prose His silence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof that his patron was neither able nor desirous to boast of a long series of illustrious progenitors and the slight mention of his father an officer of Barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens seems to countenance the assertion that the general who so long commanded the armies of Rome was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the Vandals If Stilicho had not possessed the external advantages of strength and stature the most flattering bard in the pre sence of so many thousand spectators would have hesitated to affirm that he surpassed the measure of the demigods of antiquity and that whenever he moved with lofty steps through the streets of OF THE SOMAN EMPIRE 471 the capital the astonished crowd made room for the Â xm stranger who displayed in a private condition the _ awful majesty of a hero From his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms his prudence and valour were soon distinguished in the field the horsemen and archers of the East admired his supe rior dexterity and in each degree of his military promotions the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the sovereign He was named by Theodosius to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia he supported during that important embassy the dignity of the Roman name and after his return to Constantinople his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honourable alliance with the Imperial family Theodosius had been prompted by a pious motive of fraternal affection to adopt for his own the daughter of his brother Honorius the beauty and accomplishments of Serena were univer sally admired by the obsequious court and Stilicho obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess and the favour of her adoptive father The assurance that the husband of Serena would be faithful to the throne which he was permitted to approach engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes and to employ the abilities of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho He His niili rose through the successive steps of master of the j00111 horse and count of the domestics to the supreme a ix 385 rank of master general of all the cavalry and infantry of the Roman or at least of the Western empire and his enemies confessed that he invariably dis dained to barter for gold the rewards of merit or to defraud the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or claimed from the liberality of the state The valour and conduct which he afterwards displayed in the defence of Italy against the arms of Alaric and Radagaisus may justify the h h 1 THE DECLINE AND FALL fame of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the laws of honour or of pride the Roman generals might yield the pre eminence of rank to the ascendant of superior genius He lamented and revenged the murder of Promotus his rival and his friend and the massacre of many thousands of the flying Bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice which the Roman Achilles offered to the manes of another Patroclus The virtues and victories of Stilicho deserved the hatred of Rufinus and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender and vigilant Serena had not protected her husband against his domestic foes whilst he van quished in the field the enemies of the empire Theo dosius continued to support an unworthy minister to whose diligence he delegated the government of the palace and of the East but when he marched against the tyrant Eugenius he associated his faithful general to the labours and glories of the civil war and in the last moments of his life the dying monarch re commended to Stilicho the care of his sons and of the republic The ambition and the abilities of Stilicho were not unequal to the important trust and he claimed the guardianship of the twoempires during the minority of Arcadius and Honorius The first measure of his administration or rather of his reign displayed to the nations the vigour and activity of a spirit worthy to command He passed the Alps in the depth of winter descended the stream of the Rhine from the fortress of Basil to the marches of Batavia re viewed the state of the garrisons  repressed the enter prises of the Germans and after establishing along the banks a firm and honourable peace returned with in credible speed to the palace of Milan Theperson and court of Honorius were subject to the master general of the West and the armies and provinces of Europe obeyed without hesitation a regular authority which OP THE ROMAN EMPIEK 473 was exercised in the name of their young sovereign chap Two rivals only remained to dispute the claims and to XX1IJ provoke the vengeance of Stilicho Within the limits of Africa Gildo the Moor maintained a proud and dangerous independence and the minister of Con stantinople asserted his equal reign over the emperor and the empire of the East The impartiality which Stilicho affected as the The fail common guardian of the royal brothers engaged him f Rufinus to regulate the equal division of the arms the jewels yj gfifc and the magnificent wardrobe and furniture of the deceased emperor But the most important object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions cohorts and squadrons of Romans or Barbarians whom the event of the civil war had united under the standard of Theodosius The various multitudes of Europe and Asia exasperated by recent animosi ties were overawed by the authority of a single man and the rigid discipline of Stilicho protected the lands of the citizen from the rapine of the licentious soldier  Anxious however and impatient to relieve Italy from the presence of this formidable host which could be useful only on the frontiers of the empire he list ened to the just requisition of the minister of Arca dius declared his intention of re conducting in per son the troops of the East and dexterously employed the rumour of a Gothic tumult to conceal his pri vate designs of ambition and revenge  The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the approach of a warrior and a rival whose enmity he deserved he computed with increasing terror the narrow space  Tantoque remoto Principe mutatas orbis non sensit

directed his march along the sea coast of the Hadriatic was not far distant from the city of Thessalonica when he received a peremptory message to recal the troops of the East and to declare that his nearer approach would be considered by the Byzantine court as an act of hostility The prompt and unexpected obe dience of the general of the West convinced the vul gar of his loyalty and moderation and as he had already engaged the affection of the Eastern troops he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design which might be accomplished in his absence with less danger perhaps and with less re proach Stilicho left the command of the troops of the East to Gainas the Goth on whose fidelity he firmly relied with an assurance at least that the hardy Barbarian would never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of Stilicho and of Rome and such was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited that the fatal secret communicated to thousands was faith fully preserved during the long march from Thessa lonica to the gates of Constantinople As soon as they had resolved his death they condescended to flatter his pride the ambitious praefect was seduced to believe that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head and the treasures which he distributed with a tardy and re luctant hand were accepted by the indignant multi tude as an insult rather than as a gift At the di stance of a mile from the capital in the field of Mars before the palace of Hebdomon the troops halted and the emperor as well as his minister advanced according to ancient custom respectfully to salute OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 475 the power which supported their throne As Rufinus chap passed along the ranks and disguised with studied XXIIL courtesy his innate haughtiness the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left and inclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms Be fore he could reflect on the danger of his situation Gainas gave the signal of death a daring and for ward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty praefect and Rufinus fell groaned and expired at the feet of the affrighted emperor If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse could be the object of pity our humanity might per haps be affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the popu lace of either sex who hastened in crowds from every quarter of the city to trample on the remains of the haughty minister at whose frown they had so lately trembled His right hand was cut off and carried through the streets of Constantinople in cruel mockery to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant whose head was publicly exposed borne aloft on the point of a long lance According to the sa vage maxims of the Greek republics his innocent family would haveshared the punishment of his crimes The wife and daughter of Rufinus were indebted for their safety to the influence of religion Her sanc tuary protected them from the raging madness of the people and they were permitted to spend the re mainder of their lives in the exercises of Christian devotion in the peaceful retirement of Jerusalem The servile poet of Stilicho applauds with ferocious Discord or ioy this horrid deed which in the execution per empires haps of justice violated every law of nature and society profaned the majesty of the prince and re newed the dangerous examples of military licence In THE DECLINE AND FALL less than three months the people were informed of the maxims of the new administration by a singular edict which established the exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of Rufinus and silenced under heavy penalties the presumptuous claims of the subjects of the Eastern empire who had been in jured by his rapacious tyranny Even Stilicho did not derive from the murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed and though he gratified his revenge his ambition was disappointed Under the name of a favourite the weakness of Arcadius required a master but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius who had obtained his domestic confidence and the emperor contemplated with terror and aversion the stern genius of a foreign warrior Till they were divided by the jealousy of power the sword of Gainas and the charms of Eu doxia supported the favour of the great chamberlain of the palace the perfidious Goth who was appointed master general of the East betrayed without scruple the interest of his benefactor and the same troops who had so lately massacred the enemy of Stilicho were engaged to support against him the inde pendence of the throne of Constantinople The fa vourites of Arcadius fomented a secret and irrecon cileable war against a formidable hero who aspired to govern and to defend the two empires of Rome and the two sons of Theodosius They incessantly laboured by dark and treacherous machinations to deprive him of the esteem of the prince the respect of the people and the friendship of the Barbarians The life of Stilicho was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired assassins and a decree was obtained from the senate of Constantinople to declare him an enemy of the republic and to con fiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of the East At a time when the only hope of delaying OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 477 the ruin of the Roman name depended on the chap firm union and reciprocal aid of all the nations to  XXI11 whom it had been gradually communicated the subjects of Arcadius and Honorius were instructed by their respective masters to view each other in a foreign and even hostile light to rejoice in their mutual calamities and to embrace as their faithful allies the Barbarians whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen  The natives of Italy affected to despise the servile and effeminate Greeks of Byzantium who presumed to imitate the dress and to usurp the dignity of Roman senators t and the Greeks had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and contempt which their polished ancestors had so long entertained for the rude inhabitants of the West The distinction of two governments which soon produced the separation of two nations will justify my design of suspending the series of the Byzantine history to prosecute without interruption the disgraceful but memorable reign of Honorius The prudent Stilicho instead of persisting to force Revolt of the inclinations of a prince and people who rejected Africa his government wisely abandoned Arcadius to his 3 8G unworthy favourites and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war displayed the modera tion of a minister who had so often signalized his military spirit and abilities But if Stilicho had any longer endured

the armies of Rome raised him to the dig nity of a military count the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted the mischievous ex pedient of supporting a legal government by the interest of a powerful family and the brother of Firmus was invested with the command of Africa His ambition soon usurped the administration of jus tice and of the finances without account and with out control and he maintained during a reign of twelve years the possession of an office from which it was impossible to remove him without the danger of a civil war During those twelve years the pro vince of Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic faction The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison and if the trembling guests who were invited to the table of Gildo presumed to ex press their fears the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury and he loudly summoned the mini sters of death In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius the count or rather the sovereign of Africa maintained a haughty and suspicious neu trality refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels expected the declara tion of fortune and reserved for the conqueror the vain professions of his allegiance Such profes sions would not have satisfied the master of the Ro man world but the death of Theodosius and the weakness and discord of his sons confirmed the power of the Moor who condescended as a proof of his moderation to abstain from the use of the diadem and to supply Rome with the customary tribute or rather subsidy of corn In every division of the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  4T9 empire the five provinces of Africa were invariably chap assigned to the West and Gildo had consented to XXIIL govern that extensive country in the name of Hono rius but his knowledge of the character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign The mi nisters of Arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel and the delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the empire of the East tempted them to assert a claim which they were incapable of supporting either by reason or by arms When Stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer He is con to the pretensions of the Byzantine court he solemnly tiâ R mum accused the tyrant of Africa before the tribunal which n e 3g had formerly judged the kings and nations of the earth and the image of the republic was revived after a long interval under the reign of Honorius The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample de tail of the complaints of the provincials and the crimes of Gildo to the Roman senate and the members of that venerable assembly were required to pro nounce the condemnation of the rebel Their unani mous suffrage declared him the enemy of the re public and the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction to the Roman arms A people who still remembered that their ancestors had been the masters of the world would have ap plauded with conscious pride the representation of ancient freedom if they had not long since been accustomed to prefer the solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty and greatness The subsistence of Rome depended on the harvests of Africa and it was evident that a declaration of war would be the signal of famine The praefect Sym machus who presided in the deliberations of the senate admonished the minister of his just apprehen sion that as soon as the revengeful Moor should 480 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap prohibit the exportation of corn the tranquillity and xxm perhaps the safety of the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent multitude The prudence of Stilicho conceived and executed with out delay the most effectual measure for the relief of the Roman people A large and seasonable supply of corn collected in the inland provinces of Gaul was embarked on the rapid stream of the Rhone and transported by an easy navigation from the Rhone to the Tyber During the whole term of the African war the granaries of Rome were continually filled her dignity was vindicated from the humiliating de pendence and the minds of an immense people were quieted by the calm confidence of peace and plenty The am The cause of Rome and the conduct of the African A iTm war were intrusted by Stilicho to a general active and ardent to avenge his private injuries on the head of the tyrant The spirit of discord which prevailed in the house of Nabal had excited a deadly quarrel between two of his sons Gildo and Mascezel The usurper pursued with implacable rage the life of his younger brother whose courage and abilities he feared and Mascezel oppressed by superior power took refuge in the court of Milan where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his two innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their in human uncle The affliction of the father was sus pended only by the desire of revenge The vigilant Stilicho already prepared to collect the naval and military forces of the Western empire and he had resolved if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and doubtful war to march against him in person  But as Italy required his presence and as it might be dangerous to weaken the defence of the frontier he judged it more advisable that Mascezel should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a chosen body of Gallic veterans who had lately sorved OF THE UOMAN EMPIRE 481 under the standard of Eugenius These troops who chap were exhorted to convince the world that they could XXIIL subvert as well as defend the throne of an usurper consisted of the Jovian the Herculean and the Au

Invincible Yet such was the smallness of their establishments or the difficulty of recruiting that these seven bands of high dignity and reputation in the service of Rome amounted to no more than five thousand effective men The fleet of galleys and transports sailed in tempestuous weather from the port of Pisa in Tus cany and steered their course to the little island of Capraria which had borrowed that name from the wild goats its original inhabitants The leader who appeared confident of victory avoided the dangerous rocks of Corsica coasted along the eastern side of Sardinia and secured his ships against the violence of the south wind by casting anchor in the safe and capacious harbour of Cagliari at the distance of one hundred and forty miles from the African shores  Gildo was prepared to resist the invasion with all Defeat and the forces of Africa By the liberality of his gifts oudo and promises he endeavoured to secure the doubtful A D 398 allegiance of the Roman soldiers whilst he attracted to his standard the distant tribes of Gaetulia and Ethiopia He proudly reviewed an army of seventy thousand men and boasted with the rash presump tion which is the forerunner of disgrace

or to obey the guidance of the bridle He fixed his Camp of five thousand veterans in the face of a superior enemy and after the delay of three days gave the signal of a general engagement As Mascezel advanced before the front with fair offers of peace and pardon he encountered one of the foremost standard bearers of the Africans and on his refusal to yield struck him on the arm with his sword The arm and the standard sunk under the weight of the blow and the imaginary act of submission was hastily repeated by all the standards of the line At this signal the disaffected cohorts proclaimed the

exercise of this obso lete and precarious jurisdiction were impatient to punish the African magistrates who had intercepted the subsistence of the Roman people The rich and guilty province was oppressed by the Imperial mi nisters who had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices of Gildo and if an edict of Honorius seems to check the malicious industry of informers a subsequent edict at the distance of ten years continues and renews the prosecution of the offences which had been committed in the time of the general rebellion The adherents of the tyrant who escaped

that his feeble and languid disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his rank or of enjoying the pleasures of his age In  his early youth he made some progress in the exer cises of riding and drawing the bow but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations and the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily care of the monarch of the West who resigned the reins of empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho The experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a prince who was born in the purple received a worse education than  Procopiuj de Bell Gothico I i c 2 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE the meanest peasant of his dominions and that the chap ambitious minister suffered him to attain the age of XXI1 manhood without attempting to

their laws attest the perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the Roman world But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his life a captive in his palace a stranger in his country and the pa tient almost the indifferent spectator of the ruin of the Western empire which was repeatedly attacked and finally subverted by the arms of the Barbarians In the eventful history of a reign of twenty eight years it will seldom be necessary to mention the name of the emperor Honorius As the history of the church is not the object of this publication I have reduced within narrow limits the account of the restoration of Paganism by Julian as I did the establishment of Christianity by Con stantine I have therefore in the extracts which I have made from the foregoing chapter of Mr Gib bon confined myself to those circumstances which illustrate the character and conduct of the prince or that relate to events which are of importance to the civil history of the empire but I have omitted the philosophical and theological discussions which  The lessons of Theodosius or rather Claudian iv Cons Honor 214â 418 might compose a fine institution for the future prince of a great and free nation It was far above Honorius and his degenerate subjects I I 3 THE DECLINE AND FALL are contained in it The twenty third chapter of the original like the twentieth is accordingly abridged but the points which are retained are given without any addition in the language of Mr Gibbon I have carefully avoided the omission or alteration of a single word in that point of the narrative which relates to the remarkable circumstances that attended the at tempt of Julian to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem I think it will be satisfactory to observe in respect to Ammianus Marcellinus as was noticed in the former case of Tacitus how little is the amount of all that can be urged by the ingenuity of our author to lessen the weight of the evidence which is derived to Chris tianity from the testimony of the two great pagan historians The words of Ammianus are indeed of such importance that I think it right to follow the example of Mr Gibbon who has given them in the original Latin in a note But that I may not be ac cused of a partial or imperfect quotation I shall in sert the whole of the first page of the twenty third Book of Ammianus Marcellinus Haec eo anno ut prretereamus

unexceptionable testimony of this pagan historian we find the same occurrence related by three contemporary writers Ambrose Chrysostom and Gregory Nazianzen The last of these asserts as his words are translated by Mr Gibbon This preternatural event was not dis puted by the infidels The original words of Gregory are as follows To Se sv its r rov van ba vft a kxi aSs roif aSetts ouiroi ontirsfj evov e u v ep ofiai c Perhaps disbelkved would have been a more literal translation than disputed Mr Gibbon does not mention any ancient writer who denies the truth of the fact The story is related by several succeeding authors with some variations and additional circumstances but for the most part copying the three foregoing fathers Of modern writers  Basnage in his Histoire des Juifs endeavours to controvert the truth of the story and the authority of the Christian authors but he confines his observations to Socrates Sozomen and Theodoret who wrote at a somewhat later period Basnage urges the following objection to the testi mony of Sozomen That writer concludes his account Lardner expresses himself as follows Julian in the fragment of some oration or epistle having taken notice how often the Jewish temple had been destroyed and was not yet restored adds I say not this by way of reproach for I also have designed or have had a design to raise that temple which has been so long in ruins to the honour of the God who is there worshipped In considering the passage in Ammianus he expresses himself thus Great weight was laid on the testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus who was a heathen and an impartial historian But then it has been said by some that he had this account from the Christians and took it up without examination To which I would add that he was credulous as appears from many things in his history He might therefore without scruple record a miraculous interposition which had been repeat ed to him Lardner s Heathen Testimonies vol iv p 227 and 22H I I 4 THE DECLINE AMD FALL chap of the fiery eruption or earthquake at Jerusalem with _ saying Should these things appear incredible to any one those who have had information from eye wit nesses and one yet alive will confirm it to him Basnage objects that Sozomen does not name any of these eye witnesses or the person who had derived information from them In reply to Basnage it has been said that witnesses are seldom named if reference is made to a multitude of persons who have viewed and related a public spectacle He takes no notice of the three contemporary writers Ambrose Chry sostom and Gregory Nazienzen the last of whom wrote before the close of the year in which the occur rences took place But what is still more extraordi nary Mr Basnage makes no mention of Ammianus Marcellinus He entirely overlooks this great pagan historian who relates with circumstantial minuteness the events of the reign of Julian to the greater part of which he was an eye witness and who certainly was not influenced by any partiality to the cause of Chris tianity Bishop Warburton in his Julian an elaborate work in reply to Basnage has stated if I mistake not every thing that can be adduced on this subject He also quotes some expressions from an epistle of Julian to prove that the emperor himself could not help ac knowledging the truth of the occurrence In the last place he transcribes a passage from R Gedaliah van Joseph Icehajah a learned Jewish writer who re lates the fact Even Basnage admits  que cet aveu des Rabbins est d autant plus considerable qu il est injurieuse a la nation et que ces messieurs ne sont pas accoutum s a copier les ouvrages des Chretiens Lib 6 c 18 19 The learned Abb6 de la Bleterie in his life of Julian an interesting publication not un favourable to the emperor relates the circumstances of the event with great candour and acknowledges the 1 OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE weight of the evidence by which it is supported Besides the testimony of Ammianus and the three Christian fathers he thinks as Warburton does that he finds an acknowledgment of the fact in the very words of Julian which have been already quoted La Bleterie adds Ces paroles dans la bouche d un souverain ressem blent bien a l aveu d une entreprise manquee He afterwards quotes the same Jewish writer as Bas nage and having established the truth of this re markable event by the concurrent testimony of pagan Jewish and Christian historians and having observed that it is not denied by any contemporary writer La Bleterie sums up the whole with saying  qu il n y a point dans toute l antiquite de fait que soit plus certain He concludes his account with the fol lowing words On ne peut contester le fait sans etablir le Pyrronism historique le plus insensÂ I have mentioned the principal authors both ancient and modern who have written on the subject of this remarkable event without presuming to offer any opi nion of my own But though I have generally avoided entering into any controversy yet I cannot help taking notice of one argument almost the only argument which is urged by Mr Gibbon against the authority of Ammianus He says that at the distance of twenty years a Roman historian care less of theological disputes might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle I might ask if it would be by a Christian miracle that the pagan author would choose to adorn his work  But it does not appear that Ammianus had any idea of a miracle when he described the fire which issued from the ground at Jerusalem In the course of his history he speaks of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in various places and the plain simplicity of his narrative might rather induce a belief that he con sidered the fiery eruptions as occurrences in nature of 400 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap a rare and extraordinary kind but there is nothing L_ in his history which should lead one to imagine that he supposed them to proceed from a miraculous origin It appears from Warburton that the same idea has been entertained by some other persons who thought that the evidence of the fact was irre sistible I am now desirous of considering the effect of the term of years which intervened between the occurrence of the event and the time of writing the history It is indeed with great diffidence that I venture to offer an opinion that this very circum stance instead of being as Mr Gibbon supposes an objection is in reality a strong confirmation of the truth of the narrative When the event hap pened Ammianus was at no greater distance from Jerusalem than Antioch where he held a distin guished office in the court of Julian The under taking and its failure must have been known to him at the time He must have known the account which was given by Alypius of his unsuccessful en deavours to execute the orders of the emperor Ju lian himself mentions his intention of rebuilding the temple It is universally known that it was not rebuilt and Ammianus at the expiration of twenty years relates in his history the circumstance which prevented it If he had written this account imme diately after the occurrence it might have been said it was a rumour invented by party zeal and propa gated by enthusiasm and credulity It might then have been urged that the imposition and falsehood would probably in a short time have been detected that pagan authors would have exposed the deceptions which had originated from the Christians and that if Ammianus had written a few years later he would probably have had a clearer view of the matter and would not have given credit to the romance of the day But the history is composed twenty years after OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 491 the event It is composed by a pagan desirous of chap placing the character of Julian in a favourable light xxiIL but not disposed to sacrifice truth for the sake of the emperor Of Ammianus and his history it may with great propriety be said Amicus Julianus magis arnica Veritas This historian after twenty years relates the unpleasant occurrence in the most plain but most decisive language He does not like the Christian fathers enlarge on miraculous appearances but tells the story as a true undisputed matter of fact If in twenty years any imposition had been detected if any false assertions of the Chris tians had been disproved if any pagans or Jews or any person whatever had controverted the truth of the statement which was made at the time of the oc currence Ammianus would certainly have noticed them This accurate and circumstantial historian would have mentioned the different ways of relating the event and accounting for the failure of the em peror s great undertaking and would not have in serted it in his history as a clear matter of fact in such terms as strongly confirm what Mr Gibbon calls the bold assertion of Gregory Nazienzen that the truth of the occurrence was not disputed by the infidels themselves ate rot aBeot au fui airirsfteyov As the history of this period of the empire is prin cipally derived from Ammianus Marcellinus I think it will not be improper to add a few words respecting this valuable historian with whose life and writings the generality of readers are not as well acquainted as with Livy and Sallust Ammianus Marcellinus was an officer of distinc tion in the Roman army and served under Julian in the Persian war His religion was the same as the emperor s and he appears to have been much at tached to his person After retiring from the military profession he resided at Rome where he employed 492 THE DECLINE AND FALL chap the latter part of his life in writing the history of the Y Y ITT â _ empire from the reign of Nerva to the death of Va lerius Of this work which consisted of thirty one books only the last eighteen are now extant but these books contain a very circumstantial history of twenty five years during which period Ammianus was an eye witness to the greater part of the trans actions which he relates Minute accuracy and strict  veracity appear to be characteristics of this writer whom Mr Gibbon repeatedly calls his faithful guide Though Ammianus is evidently desirous of placing the character of Julian in as favourable a light as possible yet he does not allow his partiality for the emperor to induce him to deviate from that strict adherence to truth which is required of an historian He mentions the hypocrisy of Julian in endeavouring to gain the favour of the Christians in Gaul by join ing with them in the celebration of the Epiphany though he had already in secret abandoned their faith And he relates the execution of Ursulus though he cannot deny that it was an act of ingratitude as well as injustice on the part of the emperor the recital of which will be displeasing to the favourers fauto ribus of Julian He describes very minutely the events of the Persian expedition yet he abstains from any censure on the imprudence of his hero in rejecting an offer of peace under the walls of Ctesi phon when he might have dictated the conditions of the treaty instead of which he led the Romans into such a situation that in a short time afterwards the army could not be extricated without the most hu miliating sacrifices I shall finish these observations respecting Ammianus Marcellinus with the expres sive words which conclude the valuable work of the modest historian Haec ut miles quondam et Graecus a principatu Caesaris Nervae exorsus adusque Valentis interitum OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE pro virium explicavi mensura Opus veritatem pro fessum nunquam ut arbitror sciens silentio ausus corrumpere vel mendacio Scribant reliqua potiores astate doctrinis florentes Quos id si libuerit aggres suros procudere linguas ad majores moneo stylos Mr Gibbon when he afterwards is taking leave of his accurate and faithful guide observes with re gret that the rising generation was not disposed to accept the advice or imitate the example of this ex cellent historian who had composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contem porary I will venture to add that the person who reads Ammianus will feel in many parts of his works that peculiar interest which seldom fails to be ex cited by the writings of an author who was an eye witness of the scenes which he was employed in describing
