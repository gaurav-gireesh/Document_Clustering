MDCCXCIV 3 C 3r   THE DESCRIPTION GREECE BOOK IX B ≈ O T I C S C H A P I B≈ otia borders on the Athenians and the rest of the Attic land and the Plat√ enses are near the Eleuthe renses But the whole uAijon of the B≈ otians derived its name from B≈ otus who they fay was the son of Itonus and the nymph Melanippe They add that Itonus was the son of Amphictyon Many of their towns too are de nominated from men but i stuhgreaser number from women The Plat√ enses indeed were as it appears to me natives of B≈ otia from the first but they are of opinion that they derived their name from Plat√ a the daughter of a river It is however evident that the Plat√ enses reigned here in ancient times For all Greece formerly was in subjection to royal authority and there was no such thing as a democracy to be found among them But the Plat√ enses do not know any thing of their kings except Asopus and Cith√ ron who was priDr Vol UI B to  t THE DESCRIPTION to Asopus and they fay that one of these gave a name to a mountain and the other to a river It appears too to me that Plat√ a from whom the city was denominatedr was the daughter of king Asopus and not of a river Before the battle which the Athenians fought at Mara thon the Plat√ enses performed nothing which deserves to be recorded But in this battle they assisted the Athe nians and after the irruption of Xerxes into Greece had the boldness to ascend their ships with the Athenians and punished in their own dominions Mardonius the son ef Gobryas who commanded the army of Xerxes It happened however that the Plat√ enses were twice driven from B≈ otia and again restored to it For in the war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians the Laced√ monians besieged and took Plat≈ and when it was re stored through the peace which Antalcidas a Spartan made between the Greeks and the king of the Persians and the Plat√ enses that had fled to Athens returned to their na e ctoitatty A wa¬ uVaan afflicted with die calamities of vsar  For at the time when open war was proclaimed ag jn fofcbans but the Plat√ enses asserted th f t tftey Velfc dt peJce with them because when Cadmea was talceti ty rite Laced√ moniansy they neither assisted their counsels nor operations the The bans on the contrary asserted that it was the Laced√ monians who made the peace and who afterwards act ing contrary to the truce caused it to be violated by the ether cities that had engaged in it The Plat√ enses therefore suspecting the intentions of the Thebans strongly fortified their city and those that lived at some distance from the city did not venture into the fields at all hours of the day but kjiowing that 4 the OF GREECE 3 the Thebans were accustomed to protract their public assemblies for a long time they watched the time of their assembling together and whenever this happened cul tivated their land in peace But Neocles the Theban who was then the chief magistrate of the B≈ otians perceiving the crafty conduct of the Plat√ enses ordered each of the Thebans to come into the assembly armed and immedi ately led them not in a direct line from Thebes through the fields but to Hyfia which is between the Eleuthe rans and Attica and where the Plat√ enses had no spies This took place about the middle of the day and the Plat√ enses supposing that the Thebans were engaged in their assembly came into their fields as usual having the gates of the city securely closed behind them Th¬ Thebans therefore made the Plat√ enses that were within the walls promise that they would leave the city before sun set each man bringing with him one and each woman two garments At that time indeed the Plat√ enses were oppressed in a manner very different from that which took place formerly through the Laced√ monians under the command of Archidamus for then when they jvere besieged they were prevented from leaving the city by a twofold wall but here the Thebans would not suffer them to enter into their walls This second loss happened to the Plat√ enses in the third year prior to the battle at Leuctra and when Asteus was the Athenian archon Every part of the city at this time was destroyed by the Thebans except the temples of the gods But the man ner in which the city was taken became the safety of the Plat√ enses For they were in the first place received iy the Athenians j and afterwards Philip being victorious at Chaeronea placed a guard over the Thebans endea B a Toured 4 THE DESCRIPTION Toured by every possible means to accomplish their de struction and at last restored the Plat√ cnses to their an cient habitations UN turning a little to the right hand from the straight road of the Platxan land under Cith√ ron you will fee the ruins of Hysia and Erythr√ These were once cities of the B≈ otians and even now among the ruins of Hysia there is a temple of Apollo the half of which is entire and a sacred well According to the B≈ otians formerly those that drank out of this well were endowed with the gift of prophecy Proceeding from hence into the public road you will again fee on the right hand that which is called the sepulchre of Mardonius Indeed that the dead body of Mardonius could no where be found after the battle in which he fell is generally acknowledged nor can they tell by whom he was buried It appears however that Artontes the son of Mardonius gave great gifts to Dionysophanes the Ephefian and to others be longing to the Ionians that they might not be negligent with respect to the interment of Mardonius And this road leads from Eleuther√ to Plat√ a But as you pro ceed from Megaree you will fee on the right hand a fountain and a little beyond this a stone which they call the stene of Act√ on for they fay that Actaion used to sleep on this when he was weary with hunting and that in this place he aw Diana washing herself in the neigh bouring fountain But Stesichorus Himer√ us writes that Diana threw upon Act√ on a stag s hide and thus caused him to be slain by his dogs that he might not marry CHAP II  OF GREECE 5 Semele For my own part I can easily beliere that Ac t√ on might be torn in pieces by his dogs without the in terference of the goddess in consequence of their rushing furiously upon him without perceiving who he was In what part of Cith√ ron the destruction of Pentheus the son of Echion happened or where Oedipus when he was born was exposed is not known by any one though I am not ignorant of the bisected road belonging to the Phocenses in which Oedipus flew his father But the mountain Cith√ ron is sacred to Jupiter Cith√ ronius of which I shall speak more copiously when my discourse leads me to mention it again Near the entrance to Plat√ a you may perceive the sepulchres of those that fought against the Medes The other Greeks indeed have one common sepulchre but the Laced√ monians and Athenians that fell in that battle have separate tombs and upon them there are elegies composed by Simonides Not far from the common sepulchre of the Greeks there is an altar of Jupiter Eleutherius The sepulchre is made of brass but the altar and statue of Jupiter are of white stone Even at present every fifth year they celebrate the festivals called Eleutheria in which the greatest re wards are proposed for the race They run before the altar armed The trophy which the Greeks erected for their victory over the Plat√ enscs is about fifteen stadia distant from the city When you enter the city in that part which contains the altar and statue of Eleutherian Jupiter you will see the heroic monument of Plat√ a What the Plat√ enscs report concerning her I have al ready related The Plat√ enscs too have a temple of Juno which deserves to be inspected both for its magnitude pud the ornament of the statues which it contains Qe B j entering  6 the description entering this temple you will fee a statue of Rhea pre senting Saturn with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead of the child of which she had been delivered They call Juno Teleia or the perfect There is a large statue of the goddess in an upright position both these sta tues are made of Pentelican stone and are the works of Praxiteles There is another statue of Juno in a sitting posture in the same temple and this wa¬ made by Cal limachus But they call the goddess Numpheuemenc or espoused on the following account CHAP III TliEY fay that Juno being angry with Jupiter on what account it is not known retired to Euboea and Jupiter not being able to appease her came to Cith√ ron who then reigned over the Plat√ enses This Cithseron was not second to any one in craft He therefore per suaded Jupiter to make a statue of wood to phee it veiled in a car drawn by two oxen and publicly assert that this was Flat√ a the daughter of Asopus whom he was going to marry As soon as Juno heard this she immediately came to the car and cutting off the veil perceived that what stie supposed was a new married lady was nothing more than a wooden image and in consequence of this became reconciled to Jupiter In remembrance of this reconciliation they celebrate a festival which is called D√ dal because the ancients called wooden statues D√ da lian But it appears to me that this name was usurped before D√ dalus the son of Palamaon was born and that afterwards from D√ dalian statues D√ dalus derived his name OF GREECE _y name The Plat√ cnses therefore celebrate this D√ dal festival every seventh year as an historian of this coun try told me in reality however the interval of time between its celebration is not so long But though I wus ‚ desirous of accurately numbering the interval of rime from ‚ one D√ dal festival to another I was not able to accom plish my design They celebrate this festival in the fol lowing manneri‚ There is a grove which is the greatest in Bceotia not far from Alalcomen√ and in this place there are many ancient oaks The Plat√ enfes coming into this grove place in it portions of boiled flesh And they have but little trouble indeed to defend it from other birds but they are obliged to guard it diligently from the crows j and if any one of these birds carries oft any por tion of the flesh they observe on what tree it perches cut down this tree and make from it a D√ dalian statue z or they call the statue thus made D√ dalian This festival the Plat√ enfes celebrate privately and call it the lesser D√ dali for the B≈ otians celebrate the greater D√ dala in a very public manner every sixtieth year They fay that the festival was omitted for so long a tim when the Plat√ enfes were driven from their native country And in the lesser D√ dala indeed they prepare fourteen statues every year and these the Plat√ enfes Coron√ i Thespienses Tanagr√ i Ch√ ronenses Orchomenii Lebadenses and Thebans take away by lot For these people thought proper to be reconciled with the Plat√ enfes to partake of their common assembly and to fend a victim to tlie D√ dal festival when Thebes was re stored by Cassander the son of Antipater But those cities which are of less estimation bestow their gifts upon this festival according to lot They carry the image to Aso B 4 pus 8 THE DESCRIPTION pus and having placed it in a car commit it to the care of a bride maid After this too according to lots they drive their cars from the river to the top of the Theban Cithaeron On the summit of this mountain an altar is prepared for them and this altar is raised in the follow ing manner ‚ They aptly join together square pieces of wood just as if they were raising a structure of stones and afterwards carry to the top of the mountain twig piled on these pieces of wood But the cities sacrifice a cow of a proper age to Juno and a bull to Jupiter the victims being filled with wine and odoriferous herbs and at the fame time place the D√ dala upon the altar More wealthy individuals sacrifice a cow and an ox but the poorer sort sacrifice small sheep They burn all the vic tims in a similar manner and the altar is at the fame time burnt with them I know that this flame is prodigious jmd may be seen at a great distance Beyond the summit of the mountain upon which they raise the altar after you have descended about fifteen stadia you will sec the cavern of the nymphs called Cith√ ronides This cavern they denominate Spkregidion and they fay that formerly the nymphs used to prophesy in this cavern CHAP IV The Plat√ enfes too have a temple of Minerva Arc ta or the martial which was raised from the spoils given to the Plat√ enses by the Athenians after the battle at Ma rathon The statue of the goddesses made of wood and is gilt except the face and the extremities of the hands and feet which are of Pentelican stone Its magnitude OF GREECE 9 is nearly equal to that brazen statue of Minerva which the Athenians dedicated in their tower from the Mara i thonian spoils Phidias too made this statue of Minerva for the Plat√ enfes In the temple there are pictures painted by Polygnotus viz Ulysses destroying the suir tors and the expedition prior to this of Onatas to the Argive Thebes These pictures are in the vestibule of the walls At the foot of the goddess there is a statue of Arimnestus who was the general of the Plat√ enfes in the engagement against Mardonius and prior to this in the battle at Marathon Among the Plat√ enfes too there is a temple of Ceres Eleufinia and a sepulchre of Leitus This Leitus was the only one of all the B≈ otian commanders that returned home from the Trojan war But Mardonius and the horse which he commanded corrupted the fountain Gargaphia because the army of the Greeks which stood opposite to them drank the water of this fountain Afterwards however the water was pu rified by the Plat√ enfes As you proceed from Plat√ a to Thebes you will fee the river Peroe They fay that Peroe was the daughter of Asopus But before you pass over the Asopus on turning by the side of the river to the lower parts of the country and travelling to the dis tance of about forty stadia you will arrive at the ruins of Scolus Among these ruins there is an imperfect temple of Ceres and Proserpine with half statues of the god desses Even now the Asopus separates the land of the Flataeenscs from that of the Thebans CHAP f THE DESCRIPTION CHAP V ThEY say that the first inhabitants of Thebes were the Ecten√ whose king was Ogygus a native of the place and from whom many of the poets call Thebes Ogygise They add that these people were destroyed by a pestilence and that the Hyantes and Aones who as it appears to me were B≈ otians and not foreigners inhabited Thebes after the Ecten√ But Cadmus and the army of the Ph≈ nicians attacking these places the Hyantes were van quished and fled the following night Cadmus however suffered the Aones who implored his protection to re main and mingle themselves with the Ph≈ nicians The Aones therefore fixed their habitations in different towns but Cvlmus built the city which is even at present called ‚ Cadmca The city however being afterwards increased Cadmea became the tower of the lower Thebes The mar riage of Cadmus was certainly very illustrious if according to the assertion os the Greeks he married Harmony the daughter of Venus and Mars His daughters too were renowned for Semele was pregnanf from Jupiter and lno was made one of the divinities of the sea But during the reign of Cadmus the Spartans Cthonios Hyperenor Pelorus and Ud√ us were very powerful through hi means For Cadmus thought proper to make Echion his son in law on account of his valour and with respect to these men as I cannot gain any farther intelligence about them I must assent to the fable which fays that they were called Spartans from the manner in which they were produced After the migration of Cadmus to the Illyrianjj OF GREECE u Wyrians and Enchelece a people of Illyria his son Polydore reigned Pentheus the son of Echion was powerful both through the dignity of his origin and the friendship of the king but as he was an insolent and im pious man he was punished by Bacchus for his impious behaviour towards him Labdacus was the son of Poly dore j and Polydore on his death bed delivered up Lab dacus and his kingdom to Nycteus Other particulars belonging to this affair I have related in my description pf Sicyoniaj I mean after what manner Nycteus died and how the guardianship of his son was committed to Lycus the brother of Nycteus and all the power of the Thebans Lycus indeed delivered up the reins of government to Labdacus when he was of age but Labdacus dying not Jong after this Lycus took Laius the son of Labdacus into his protection And while he was again acting the part of a guardian Amphion and Zethus collecting toge ther an army invaded the country and those who were careful lest the race of Cadmus should become extinct se cretly conveyed Laius away The sons of Antiope however vanquished Lycus in battle and taking possession of the kingdom joined the lower city with Cadmea and called the whole Thebes on account of their alliance with the nymph Thebe the daughter of Prometheus Homer in the following verses in the Odyssey confirms the truth of this account Tlio bold in open field they yet surround The town with walls and mound inject on mound Here ramparts stood there tow rs rose high in air And there thro seven wide portals rufli d the war However he makes no mention of Amphion raising the walls zz THE DESCRIPTION walls by the harmony of his lyre But Amphion obtained his reputation in music in consequence of having learnt from the Lydians through his alliance to Tantalus the tydian harmony and inventing three chords in addition to the four which had been‚ already discovered The author however of the verses upon Europa fays that Amphion first learned the use of the lyre from Mercury and that he drew along stones aud wild beasts by his har mony But Myron the Byzantian who wrote heroic verses and elegies fays that Amphion was the first that raised an altar to Mercury j and that for this he received a lyre from the god It is also said that Amphion is punished in Hades for reviling Latona and her sons This punishment of Amphion is mentioned in the poem called Minyas and which is composed in common upon Am phion and Thamyris But after the house of Amphion was destroyed by pestjlence and Zethus had fallen a victim to grief in con sequence of his wife having slain his son for a certain offence then the Thebans gave up the government to J aius And Laius during his reign married Jocasta He received too an oracle from Delphos which told him that if he had a son by Jocasta that son would be the mean6 of his death In consequence of this he exposed Oedipus as soon as he was born and Oedipus as soon as he arrived at manhood flew his father and married his mo ther But that Oedipus had no children by his mother is evident from the following verses of Homer in the Odyssey There too Jocasta of a beauteous mien I saw the fam d incestuous Tbcban queen With her own son flic join d in nuptial bands Tlio father s blood imbru d his murd rous hands  OF GREECE 13 The gods and men the dire offence detest The gods with all their furies rend his breast For how could the report of his wickedness be imme diately abolished if he had four children byjocasta These children indeed were the offspring of Euryganea the daughter of Hyperphas and this is evinced by the author of the verses called Oedipodia Onasias painted for the Plat√ enfes Euryganea with a sorrowful countenance on account of t e battle between her sens But Po lynices while Oedipus was yet alive and reigned left Thebes fearing left the imprecations of his father should be accomplished In consequence of this he came to Ar gos and married the daughter of Adrastus but after the death of Oedipus returned through the persuasions of his brother Eteocles to Thebes Here however a disagree ment arising between him and his brother he was again exiled After this he requested of Adrastus to furnish him with an army against his brother This Adrastus complied with but Polynices lost his army and the two brothers engaging each other in a single combat were both slain Laodamas the son of Eteocles reigned after his father but till he was of age the government of the kingdom and the care of his education was committed to Creon the son of Menoeccus When Laodamas therefore was of a proper age and took upon him the royal authority the Argives led a second army against Thebes The Thebans met this army at Gliffas and when they came to an engagement Laodamas flew √ gialeus the son of Adrastus But the Argives being victorious in this en gagement Laodamas with the Thebans that followed him fled ‚ u The description fled on the following night to the Ulyrians and the As gives delivered up Thebes which they had taken to Ther sander the son of Polyniccs As a great part however of the forces which Agamemnon led against Troy wan dered during their voyage from their destined course and were shipwrecked about Mysia it happened that Ther sander who in valour surpassed most of the Greeks in that  war was slain by Telephus But the sepulchre of Ther sander is in the plains of Caicus in the city Ehea This sepulchre is of stone and is in that¬ part of the forum which is in the open air in which placej as they fay the inhabitants perform funeral sacrifices in honour of him After the death of Thersander a second fleet being fitted out against Paris and the Trojans the command of it was given to Peneleus for Tisamenus the son of Thersander was not yet old enough for this purpose But Peneleus being slain by Eurypylus the son of Telephus they chose Tisamenus for their king who was the son of Thersander and Demonassa the daughter of Amphiaraus This ThV menus was free from the imprecations of Laiusand Oedi pus but Autesion the son of Tisamenus did not escape them but was compelled on this account in compliance with an oracle to migrate to the Dorienscs After the departure of Autesion Damafichthon the grandson of Peneleus the son of Opheltes was chosen king Ptolemy was the son of this Damafichthon and Xanthus of Pto lemy I mean that Xanthus whom Andropompus slew in a single combat by stratagem and not in a lawful man ner Afterwards it appeared better to the Thebans to be governed by many and not to commit the administra tion of affairs to one man alone CHAP OF GREECE t¬ CHAP VI With respect to the prosperous or adverse events ot their wars I have found the following to be the most remarkable particulars They were vanquished by the Athenians in that battle in which they assisted the Plst√ cnses who fought for the boundaries of their land They were a second time top vanquished at Plat√ a by the same Athenians in consequence of seeming to prefer the friend ship of Xerxes to that of the Greeks The common people however were not culpable in this particular for at that time an oligarchy wa9 established among the Thebans and not that form of administration which was natural to their country If therefore the sons of Pisistra tus had then tyrannized over the Athenians there can be no doubt but that the Athenians themselves would have been attached to the Persians and on this account would have been culpable as well as the Thebans Afterwards however the Athenians were vanquistied by the Thebana at Delius in the country of the Tanagr√ ans and Hip pocrates the son of Ariphron who commanded the Athe nian army was slain together with a greEt part of his forces But the Laced√ monians immediately after the departure of the Mede were upon friendly terms with the Thebans till the Peloponnesians warred on the Athe nians This war however being finished and the fleet of the Athenians dissolved the Thebans not long after to gether with the Corinthians took up arms against the Laced√ monians but being vanquished in a battle about Corinth and in Ch√ ronea they afterwards obtained at Lcuctra t6 THE DESCRIPTION Lcuctra a victory the most illustrious of all the Grecia rf victories we are acquainted with Here they put an end to the Decadarchs or governors of companies confijling each of ten men which the Laced√ monians had established in their cities and to those prefects which they call Har tno lai After this they carried on for ten years the Pho cic war which is called by the Greeks Sacred But I have already hewn in my account of the Attic affairs that the slaughter at Chaeronea was the source of calamity to all Greece and it was eminently afflictive to the Thebans For they were obliged to place a guard within the walls of their city j which however after the death of Philip and during the reign of Alexander they drove out of their city But for this action divinity gav e them tokens of approaching destruction For during the time of the battle at Leuctra the spiders in the temple of Ceres Thesmophoros wove white webs about the doors but when Alexander and the Macedonians attacked their do minions their webs were found to be black It is also said that divinity rained ashes on the Attic land in the year prior to that in which Sylla led an army against the Athenians and by this means caused them to suffer in such an eminent degree CHAP VII ThE Thebans therefore being then driven from their country by Alexander fled to Athens and were after wards restored to it by Caflander the son of Antipater Indeed the Athenians assisted the Thebans with the 3 greatest OF GREECE 17 gfeatest alacrity in restoring Thebes to its pristine state and they were joined in this by the Messenians and Mega lopolitans But it appears to me that Cassander rebuilt Thebes principally through his hatred of Alexander for he endeavoured totally to destroy all his house Thus he delivered up Olympias the mother of Alexander to be stoned to death by those Macedonians who violently hated her and destroyed by poison Hercules the son of Alex ander by Barfina and Alexander his son by Roxana He did not however depart rejoicing from the present life for he was seized with a dropsy through which he was devoured by vermin Of his sons too the eldest Philip not long after he began his reign was attacked with a tabid disease Antipater who succeeded him slew his motheT Thessalonice who was the daughter of Philip the son of Amyntas by Nicafipolis His reason for commit ting this parricide was her extreme fondness of Alexander the youngest of Antipater s sons Alexander however caHing to his assistance Demetrius the son of Antigonus stew Antipater and thus revenged the murder of his mother Some god therefore deservedly punished Cassander for his guilty conduct However all the ancient inclo sure os Thebes was restored to the Thebans by Cassander But it was requisite that they should afterwards taste of the greatest evils  For when Mithidrates warred on the Romans the Thebans assisted him in this war for no other reason as it appears to me than their friendstiip to the Athenians But when Sylla led his army into Bceotia the Thebans were terrified and immediately changing their intentions joined themselves to the Romans Sylla however did not lay aside his anger against them but in Vok III C vented 18 THE DESCRIPTION vented other things destructive to their prosperity ant laid a fine on half their land for which conduct this was his pretext When the war against Mithidrates commenced Sylla was in great want of money Hence he collected together the sacred offerings from Olympia and Epidarus and from the temple of the Delphic Apollo all that was left by the Phoccnses This treasure he distributed among his soldiers But to the gods in stead of the riches which he had taken from them he gave the half of the Theban land The Romans how ever afterwards restored to the Thebans the land which had been taken from them But in other respects they were reduced by Sylla to a very calamitous condition And even at present the lower city is entirely desolate except the temples of the gods  but the Thebans dwell in their tower which is no longer called Cadmea CHAP VIII When you have passed over the Asopus and have proceeded to about the distance of ten stadia from the city you will arrive at the ruins of Potni√ among which there is a grove of Ceres and Proserpine The statues near the river are called by the inhabitants the goddesses Potnije At stated times they perform other established ceremonies in honour of these and send sucking pigs into buildings which they call Megara These pigs they fay are seen at Dodona on the summer of the following year which report may perhaps be credited by some There is here too a temple of Bacchus Aigobalas or the piercer OF GREECE ip tierce of goats For it once happened that while the in habitants of this place were sacrificing they became so outrageous through intoxication that they flew the priest of Bacchus As a punishment for this action they were afflicted with a pestilent disease and at the same time were ordered by the Delphic Oracle to sacrifice to Bacchus a boy in the flower of his youth However not many years after this they fay that the god changed the sa crifice of a boy for that os a goat Among the Potni√ too there is a well and they report that the horses which are natives of Potnix become mad by drinking this water As you go from hence to Thebes you will fee on the right hand of the road an inclosure not very large and in it certain pillars They are of opinion that the earth opened in this place to Amphiaraus and they fay that birds will not sit on these pillars nor grafs grow nor any tame or savage animal feed in this place But the Thebans in the inclosure of their ancient wall have seven gates which remain even at present I have heard that one of these gates was called Electra from Electra the sister of Cadmus and another Prcet√ from Pr≈ tus a native of this place I have not however been able to find at what time this Pr≈ tus lived They call the third gate Neita because Amphion is said to have in vented that chord in a lyre called Netr before these gates I have also heard that the son of Zethus the brother of Amphion was called Neis and that from him this gate was denominated Neida They denominate the gate Cren√ from a fountain  but the gate Hypiste from its proximity to the temple of Jupiter the higheji Besides these gates there is another gate which is called Ogygia and the last gate is denominated Omolois It appears to C 2 me 20 THE DESCRIPTION me that this last name is the most recent of all and Ogygia the most ancient They fay too that the gate Omolois was thus denominated on the following account When the Thebans were vanquished by the Argives near Glifas many of them fled together with Laodamas the son of Eteocles Of these one part was unwilling to take refuge among the Illyrians but turning towards the Thessalians took up their residence in Omoloe which is the most fertile and well watered mountain of all that Theflaly contains Afterwards being recalled to their native country by Therfander the son of Polynices they called the gate through which they entered into the city Omolois from the mountain Omoloe But as you come from Plat√ a you will enter Thebes through the gate called Electra They fay that Capaneus the son of Hip ponous was struck with lightning at this gate as he was attacking the walls with more vehemence than usual CHAP IX ThIS war indeed which the Argives waged deserves in my opinion to be celebrated beyond all the wars of the Greeks during the heroic ages as they are called For the war of the Eleufinians against the other Athenians and in like manner of the Thebans against the Miny√ almost after one engagement terminated in concord and treaties of peace But the army of the Argives came into the middle of Bceotia from the middle of Peleponne sus and Adrastus collected together his allied forces from Arcadia and from the Messenians In a similar man ner  OF GREECE 21 ncr mercenary troops were sent to the Thebans from the Phocenses and by the Phlegyians from Minyas An en gagement therefore taking place nearjfmenus the Thebans were vanquished and fled within their walls But as the Peloponnefians were unacquainted with the art of be sieging cities and attacked the walls of Thebes more under the influence of anger than the direction of science the Thebans flew many of them from their walls and afterwards leaving their city by a sudden incursion broke the enemy s ranks and cut to pieces the whole army ex cept Adrastiis This victory however cost the Thebans dear and hence victories obtained with a great loss are called Cadmean victories Not many years after this those whom the Greeks call Epigonoi or such as are of posterior origin with Thersander for their leader warred on Thebes But it is evident that not only the Argives Meflenians and Arcadians joined themselves to their standards but that the Corinthians and Megarenses came to their assistance The Thebans however were assisted by the cities bordering on Thebes and a sharp engage ment took place between the two armies near Glisas Of the Thebans many after they were vanquished fled with Laodamas and the rest fortified themselves in their city And this is the war which is celebrated in verse Ca l√ nus making mention of these verses fays that they were composed by Homer j and many celebrated persons are of the fame opinion Indeed I consider these verses as next in excellence to the Iliad and Odyssey And thus much con cerning the war which the Argives and Thebans waged for the fake of the sons of Oedipus CHAP THE DESCRIPTION CHAP X Not far from the gates there is a common sepulchre of those who fell in the engagement against Alexander and the Macedonians Near it they shew a place in which they say if it may be believed the teeth of the dragon which was slain by Cadmus by the fountain were sown and became men There is a hill on the right hand of the gates which is sacred to Apollo and both the hill and the god are called Ismenios from the river Ismenus slowing near this place The first stone statues which present themselves to the view on entering the city are those of Minerva and Mercury whom they call Pronaoiy or belonging to vestibules That of Mercury was made by Phidias and that of Minerva by Scopas After this there is a temple which contains a statue equal in magnitude to that of the Branchidre and in no respect different in its form Whoever fees one of these statues and knows whom it was made by will on beholding the other perceive without any great skill that its artificer was Canachus This statue however belonging to the Branchidre is made of brass but this of Apollo Ismenios of cedar In the fame place too there is a stone upon which they fay Manto the daughter of Tiresias fat This stone is placed before the vestibule of the temple and is called at present the Jeai of Manto On the right hand of the temple there are stone statues which they fay are images of Heniochc and Pyrrha the daughters of Creon who reigned while he was the guardian OF GREECE 33 guardian of Laodamas the son of Eteocles I know too that at present the Thebans choose as the annual priest of Apollo Ismenios a boy illustrious for his origin and of great beauty and strength This boy is called Daphnophoros because ht is crowned with laurel But I am not certain whether all the boys that are crowned with laurel dedi cate a brazen tripod to Apollo It appears to me that all are not obliged to do this by law for I did not fee many tripods dedicated here The wealthier fort of these boys however dedicate tripods and among these that which Amphitryon dedicated withHercules on it crowned with laurel is the most illustrious both for its antiquity and the renowH of the person by whom it was sent as an offering Beyond this temple of Ismenian Apollo you will see a fountain which they say is sacred to Mars and they add that a dragon is stationed here by Mars as the guardian of the fountain Near this is the tomb of Caanthus who they fay was the brother of Melia and the son of Ocean  and who was sent by his father to seek his sister that was forcibly taken away But when he sound that he was in the power of Apollo and that in con sequence of this he was not able to take her away he had the boldness to set on fire the grove of Apollo which they call Ismenion and for this action as the Thebans fay the god flew him with his arrows They fay too that Apollo had two sons by Melia Tenerus and Ismenius and that Apollo endowed Tenerus with a prophetic power but the river was denominated from Ismenius However prior to the birth of Ismenius this river was called Ladoa CHAF THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XI On the left hand of the gate which 16 called Electra are the ruins of a house which they say was inhabited by Amphitryon when he fled from Tiryntha on account of the death of Electryon The bed chamber of Alcmene is yet to be seen among these ruins They fay that this bed chamber was built for Amphitryon by Trophonius and Agamedes  and that the following epigram was once inscribed on it Amphitryon when he designed to marry Alcmene chose this for his bed chamber which was made by Ancafius Trophonius and Agamedes The The bans too shew the sepulchre of the children of Hercule¬ by Megara but the particulars which they relate con cerning their death do not in any respect correspond with those given by Stesichorus Himereus and Panyasis in their poems The Thebans farther add that Hercules through his insanity would have slain Amphitryon himself but that before he could accomplish this he fell asleep through the blow of a stone and that this stone was thrown by Minerva whom they call Sophronijler or tht restrainer lii this place too there are images of women on a pillar whose form is obscured through age These images the Thebans call Pharmakides or witches and they fay that they were sent by Juno in order to prevent Alcmene from being delivered However Istoris the daughter ofTiresias deceived them while they were acting in this manner by Alcmene by the following means Fjom a place whence she could easily be heard by the witches she cried out with a loud voice that Alcmene was delivered and in conse quence  OF GREECE aS quence of their being deceived in this manner Alcmene was in reality delivered There is a temple here of Hercules with a stone statue which they call Promachos or the defender and this was made by the Thebans Xenocratus and Eubius But the Thebans are of opinion that the ancient wooden statue in this place was made by D√ dalus  and it appears to me that this was really the cafe They fay that D√ dalus de dicated this statue on account of the benevolent inter position of divinity in his favour For when he had con structed for himself and his son Icarus a small ship and had discovered the use of sails which were unknown be fore so that he was able in consequence of being driven by a prosperous wind to outstrip the vessel of Minos he himself escaped in safety but they say that Icarus being unskilled in the art of piloting the fliip overturned it and was by this means swallowed up by the waves and driven to an island of Pergamus the name of which is at present unknown They add that Hercules met with the dead body and knowing it buried it where even now there is a heap of earth not very large in the promontory which extends to the √ gean sea But the island and the sea about it were denominated from Icarus In the roof of this temple Praxiteles carved for the The r bans many of the twelve labours of Hercules What he has omitted are the birds called Stymphaljdes and the purification of the Elean land and instead of these he has represented the wrestling of Hercules with Ant√ us But Thrasybulus the son of Lycus and those Athenians who together with him dissolved the oppressive govern ment of the thirty tyrants for they descended from Thebes for this purposes dedicated in the temple os Hercules colossal THE DESCRIPTION colossal statues of Minerva and Hercules of Pentelican stone and made by Alcamenes A gymnafium and sta dium too of Hercules are contiguous to this temple But above the stone Sophronister there is an altar of Apollo who is called Spondios and this altar is raised from the asties of victims Divination from omens is here esta blished  which I know the Smyrn√ ans use beyond all the Greeks For in the outward inclosure of their walls they have a temple raised for the purpose of receiving omens J HE Thebans too in ancient times sacrificed bulls to Apollo Polios or the hoary But it once happened in this festival that when the time for slaying the victim was at fiand and those that were sent for the bull did not come as they were expected the sacrificers met with a car drawn bv two oxen one of which they sacri ficed to the gcd and from this circumstance they after wards thought proper to sacrifice labouring oxen The following circumstance likewise is related by the Thebans When Cadmus came from the Delphi to Phocis he fol lowed an ox as his guide This ox was bought of the herdsmen of Pelagos and hail on each of its fides a white spot resembling the full moon It was necessary there fore that Cadmus and his army by the command of an oracle should fix their residence in that place in which she ox when weary laid itself down to rest This place the Thebans exhibit even now  and in it there is an altar jn the open air of Minerva and a statue which they fay CHAP XII  were OF GREECE were dedicated by Cadmus Hence their opinion who assert that the Cadmus who came to Thebes was au Egyptian and not a Ph≈ nician may be confuted by the very name given to this statue of Minerva for this god dess is called Siga in the Ph≈ nician and not Sais as in the Egyptian tongue The Thebans too farther report that where the forum of the tower now stands the house of Cadmus formerly stood Hence they shew the ruins of the bed chambers of Harmonia and Semele into which last even at present men are not permitted to enter According to the Greeks the Muses celebrated the nuptials of Harmonia with songs and there is a place in the forum here where they fay the goddesses fang It is also said that together with the thunder which descended into the chamber of Semele a piece of wood fell from heaven which Polydorus adorned with brass and called Cadmean Bacchus Near this there is a statue of Bacchus which Onassimedes made entirely of brass for the statue of Cadmus was made by the sons of Praxiteles Here too there is a statue of Pronomus the piper who allured many by his harmony Before his time there were different pipes for the Dorian Lydian and Phrygian measures but he sirjl invented pipes adapted to every kind of harmony and was the first that played all the different measures at once on one pipe It is alto said that he wonderfully delighted the spectators in the theatres by the gesticulations of his face and the motion of his whole body His songs are yet extant which he composed for the Chalcidenses by the Euripus in honour of Delos The Thebans therefore have here placed a statue of this Pro pomus and of Epaminondas the son of Polymnis CHAP 28 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XIII ThE ancestors indeed of Epaminondas were very illus trious but his father with respect to possessions was but of the middle rank among the Thebans However he took care to have his son accurately instructed in all the disciplines belonging to his country and Epaminondas himself when he was but a youth betook himself to Lysis the Tarentine who was skilled in the doctrine of Pytha goras the Samian But in the war which the Laced√ monians waged with the Mantinenses Epaminondas is said to have been sent with other Thebans to the aid of the Laced√ monians In this battle he saved Pelopidas who through a great wound which he received was on the very brink of destruction and afterwards being sent as an ambassador to Sparta when the Laced√ monians de creed to establish that peace which was called the peace of Antalcidas Agesilaus asked him whether the Thebans had suffered the Bceotians in their respective cities to swear to the peace To this interrogation Epaminondas replied By no means O Spartan till we find that the cities which border on your dominions have sworn But as soon as the war between the Laced√ monians and The bans commenced and the Laced√ monians trusting both to their own power and that of their allies pressed very much on the Thebans Epaminondas with a part of the Theban army fixed his camps above the marsh Cephissis as he perceived that in this part the Peloponnesians were disposed to make an attack Cleombrotus however king OF GREECE 29 of the Laced√ monians turned his forces to Ambryssus in the land of the Phocenses and having slain Ch√ reas who guarded the passages in these parts he penetrated as far as to Leuctra in B≈ otia But in this place divi nity gave certain portentous signs in common to Cleom brotus and the Laced√ monians For it was usual with the Spartan kings when they marched to battle to take along with them lheep that they might sacrifice to the gods before the engagement began The leaders of these flieep were goats which the shepherds call Cateiadai or leaders of the flock At that time therefore certain wolves rushed on the shepherd and slew the goats that were the leaders of the flock but did not in any respect injure the sheep It is also sajd that the wrath of divinity was enkindled against the Laced√ monians through the daughters of Scedasus For when Scedasus dwelt about Leuctra he had two daughters Molpia and Hippo These when they were in the flower of their age were ravished by the Lace d√ monians Parathemidas Phrudarchidas and Parthenius The virgins indignantly bearing this injurious treatment strangled themselves to death And Scedasus when he came to Laced√ mon and could obtain no recompense from the Spartans flew himself But then Epaminondas performed funeral rites to Scedasus and his daughters and solemnly declared that he took up arms not more for the safety of the Thebans than for the fake of re venging the injuries which they had sustained The epinion however of some of the B≈ otian commanders on this subject did not correspond with that of Epaminondas for though Malgis and Xenocrates were of opinion that war should be denounced against the Laced√ monians with 3 all 6 the description all possible celerity yet Damoclidas Damophilus arid Simangelus thought this was by no means proper but ex ¬ horted the Thebans to fend away their wives and children to Attica and prepare themselves for a siege And after this manner six of them varied in opinion But when the seventh of the B≈ otian chiefs who guarded the pas sages at Cith√ ron and whose name was Branchyllides voted in favour of the opinion of Epaminondas the The bans determined to try the fortune of war However several of the B≈ otians were suspected by Epaminondas particularly the Thespians Fearing there fore some treachery might ensue he permitted all that were willing to leave the camps and return home and in consequence of this permission the Thespians and the other B≈ otians that were not attached to the in terests of the Thebans departed from the army But as soon as an engagement took place the allies of the Lace d√ monians who previous to this were disaffected towards them now openly declared their hatred for they were unwilling to remain in their places and turned their backs when attacked by the enemy The battle however between the Laced√ monians and Thebans was equal for the former were incited by their pristine skill in warlike affairs and the fear of destroying the dignity of Sparta but the hitter by the danger which they saw hung over their country wives and children But when in the end many principal per sons among the Laced√ monians and king Cleombrotus himself fell necessity compelled the Laced√ monians though in such calamitous circumstances to maintain their ground for it appeared to them to be a most shameful circumstance to leave the dead body of their king in the power of the enemy Indeed the Thebans gained in this battle OF GREECE 31 battle the most illustrious victory which one Grecian na tion ever obtained over another On the following day the Laced√ monians sent heralds to the Thebans and de sired they might be permitted to bury their dead Epami nondas however who knew that the Laced√ monians al ways concealed their calamities answered that he would first of all permit their allies to take away their dead and then the Laced√ monians to bury their own people As some of the allies therefore had not any dead to take away and others had but a few the Spartans were obliged to confess that the greatest loss was of their own people In this engagement of the Thebans and such B≈ otians as remained no more than forty seven fell but of the Lace d√ monians above a thousand CHAP XIV After this battle Epaminondas permitted the rest of the Peloponnesians to return home but kept the Laced√ monians shut up at Leuctra But when he heard that the Spartans collected themselves together from all their cities in order to assist their own people at Leuctra he suffered them to depart on certain conditions asserting that it was much better to transfer the war from B≈ otia to Laced√ monia The Thespians because they suspected the Thebans on account of their ancient hatred towards them and their present good fortune thought proper to leave their city and fly to Cercssus This Cercssus is a fortified town belonging to the Thespians into which they formerly betook themselves when they were attacked 6 by 3t THE DESCRIPTION by the Thessalians But at that time the Thessalians being frustrated in their attempts to take Ceressus sent to Del phos in order to consult the god and received the follow ing oracle Shady Leuctra and the Alesian soil are the objects of my care My attention likewise is directed to the sorrowful daughters of Scedasus For on their account a lamentable war will arise Nor shall any man survive to relate it till the Dores shall lose a beautiful young virgin when her fatal hour is arrived for then but not otherwise Ceressus may be taken Epaminondas there fore having taken Ceressus and the Thespians who had fled thither for refuge being expelled turned his attention to the affairs of Peloponnesus the Arcadians with great alacrity calling upon him for this purpose On his first arrival therefore among the Pelopdnne sians he voluntarily joined himself to the Argives as his associates in war brought back the Mantinenfes to their ancient city who were dispersed in towns about Agesi polis and persuaded the Arcadians to destroy their small towns which as they were unfortified might easily be taken and to assemble together in one city which he built for them and which is even at present called Mega lopolis When the time of his command too was expired and which to continue any longer was a capital offence he despised the law by which this custom was established as being then unseasonable retained his command and marched with an army to Sparta but finding that Agesi laus was not willing to come to an engagement he turned his attention to the restoration of Meffene Hence Epa minondas was the restorer of those Messenians that exist at present the particulars of which affair I have related in my Messenics In the mean time the Theban allies dispersing OF GREECE 33 dispersing themselves over the Laconic land greatly injured it by their depredations and this induced Epaminondas to lead back his army to B≈ otia When therefore he drew near to Lech√ us and was about to pass through the difficult and narrow defiles Iphicrates the son of Timotheus met him with troops armed with shields like a half moon and witk the other forces of the Athenians which he led against the Thebans These Epaminondas attacked and put to flight and pursuing them as far as to the walls of Athens when he found that Iphicrates would not suffer the Athenians t fight led back his army to Thebes Here he was tried for continuing his B≈ otian government after the expiration of the limited time bul not one of the judges would pass sentence upon him CHAP XV AFTERWARDS when Alexander who reigned ia Thessaly imprisoned Pelopidas who came to him relying on his private benevolence and on the friendship of the Thebans in common that he might punish his perfidy and insolence the Thebans immediately marched an army against Alexander and chose Cleomenes for the leader of this expedition at the fame time subjecting the B≈ otian governor who at that time presided over the army to his command Epaminondas upon this occasion was stationed among the Common soldiers The army having arrived ajj the narrow defiles of the Thermopyl√ was unexpect djjy attacked by Alexander in those parts most diffic l c ac cess and in consequence of this the forces despajrinff at Vo III D W h  34 THE DESCRIPTION success chose Epaminondas for their general with the free consent of the B≈ otian pr√ fects Alexander there fore perceiving that the command was transferred to Epaminondas had not the boldness to come to an engage ment and voluntarily dismissed Pclopidas But during the absence of Epaminondas the Thebans drove the Or chomenians from their country This violence Epami nondas bore indignantly and said that the Thebans would hot have dared to act in this manner if he had been present In the mean time as no other B≈ otian governor was chosen Epaminondas led his army again to Peloponnesus and vanquished the Laced√ monians near Lech√ us and together with them the Pelienenscs from among the Achaians and of the Athenians those which had been led by Chabr as It w as an established custom among the Thebuns to take a ransom for their prisoners except such as were B≈ otians ‚ for these they condemned to death But Epaminondas having taken a small city of the Sicyo nians called Fh≈ bia and which contained the greatest panel the B≈ otian exiles enfranchised them on their pay ing down a certain sum of money  at the same time call ing them by the names of unlerent countries just as they came into his mind However when he came to Man tinea with his army and was then victorious he was lain by an nthenian and among the Athenians in a picture of an equestrian battle a man is represented slay ing Epaminondas and the writing under him shews that he is GrylluS the son of Xenophon This was the Xeno phon that attended Cyrus in his expedition against Arta xerxes and who led the Greeks back again to the sea On the statue of Epaminondas elegies are inscribed which assert tot GkEfccE n assert among other things that Mcssene was restored by him and that he gave liberty to the Greeks These elegic are as follow Our counsels Sparta s glory have destroy d Through these Mcssene hall in time receive Offspring august Through these with Theban armi Environ d Megalopolis is crown d And its own laws Greece unrestrain d enjoys And such arc the particulars respecting the renown oF Epaminondas Chap xvl NoT far from this statue of Epaminondas there is a temple of Ammon The statue in this temple was made by Calamis and dedicated by Pindar who also sent hymns in honour of Ammon to the Ammonians in Libya At pre sent there is a hymn composed by Pindar inscribed on a triangular pillar near the altar which Ptolemy the son of Lagus dedicated to Ammon After this temple the Thebans have a building which is called the divining towtr of Tire sias and near it there is a temple of Fortune The statue of the goddess in this temple holds an infant Plutus  and the Thebans fay that the hands and face of this statue were made by the Athenian Xenophon but the other parts by Callistonicus a Theban It certainly was a sa gacious device to place Plutus in the hands of Fortune as if flic was his mother or nurse Nor was the sagacity of Cephisodotus less who made for the Athenians Peace holding Plutus The Thebans too have wooden statues ‚ f Venus so ancient that they are said to have been dedi D 2 cated 36 THE DESCRIPTION cated by Harmonia These were made front the beak¬ of the ships of Cadmus One of these they call Ctlejlial Venus the second Popular and the third Apojlrophia Harmonia gave these names to Venus the epithet Ce lestial signifying pure love and that which is liberated from the desire of body the epithet Popular alluding to venereal congress and Apojlrophia signifying that this goddess turns the race of men from unlawful desire and impious coition For Harmonia knew that many impious actions both among the Barbarians and Greeks were com mitted through intemperate desire such as afterwards were celebrated in verse of the mother of Adonis of Ph√ dra  the daughter of Minos and of the Thracian Tereus But they fay that the temple of Ceres Thesmophoros was once the house of Cadmus and his posterity The statue of Ceres in this temple is only apparent as far as to the breast Brazen shields are fixed in this place which they fay belonged to the Laced√ monian noblemen that fell in the b rtle at Leuctrai Near the gates called Proet√ there is a theatre and very near the theatre there is a temple of Lysian Bacchus For u lien formerly the Thracians led away many captives from the Thebans Bacchus freed them from their bond when they came near the borders of the Haliartians and enabled them to slay the Thra cians when oppress with sleep 1 he Thebans too fay that the other statue which is in this temple is the statue of f emele Once every year on stated days they open this temple Here likewise there are ruins of the house of Lycus and a sepulchre of Semele for it is not the sepulchre of Alcmene as according to report she was changed after her death into a stone For the Thebans ‚ do not give the fame account of her as the Megarenses The OF GREECE 37 The Greeks too in other relations differ very much from each other The Thcbans have besides in this place mo numents of the children of Amphion the male being apart from the female offspring CHAP XVII Near these is the temple of Diana Eucleia or the re nowned  and the statue of the goddess in it was made by Scopas They fay that the daughters of Antipcenus An droclea and Alcida are buried in this temple For when the Thebans led by Hercules were about to engage with the Orchomenians they were told by an oracle that the army would be victorious out of which a citizen of the most illustrious birth should destroy himself Antipcenus therefore was the chief of all his fellow citizens with re spect to the splendor of his origin but he could not be persuaded to kill himself for the good of his country His daughters however cheerfully devoted themselves for the accomplishment of this end and for this they were pub licly honoured Before this temple of Diana Eucleia there is a lion of stone which they fay was dedicated by Her cules after he had vanquished the Orchomenians and their king Erg tnus the son of Clymenus Near this temple there is a statue of Boedromian Apollo and a statue of Judicial Mercury which was dedicated by Pindar The funeral pile of the children of Amphion is about half a stadium distant from their sepulchres The ashes yet re main upon this funeral pile Near the statue too of Amphi tryon there are two stone statues of Minerva who is called D 3 Zostcria 3¬ THE DESCRIPTION Zosteria For Amphitryon is said to have armed himself in this place when he was on the point of engaging with the Eub≈ enses and Chalcodon But to put on armour was called by the ancients begirding For when Homer makes the zone of Agamemnon similar to that of Mars they fay that he means by this word the apparatus of his armour There is a common sepulchre here of Zethus and Am phion which is not large and is nothing more than a iieap of earth The inhabitants of Tithorea among the ‚ Fhocenses are desirous of carrying away earth from this tomb and this wlien the fun is in Taurus For then if ihtey add the earth taken away from this tomb to the sepulchre of Antiope their own land becomes more pro lific but the contrary happens to that of the Thebans And on this account the Thebans at that time carefully guard the sepulchre But these cities are persuaded that this vi Uj be the cafe from the oracles of Bacis for the followfig lines are found among these oracles When the Tuhorenses shall offer libations prayers and atone p Tments to Amphion and Zethus a bull being heated by the illustrious power of the fun then beware of a malady of no trifling nature which shall infest the city For the fruits in the land shall perish if you suffer any of your earth to be taken away and placed on the sepulchre of J hocus But Bacis calls it the monument of Phocus because Dirce die wife of Lycus honoured Bacchus above all the divinities and when she suffered that dire punish ment from Amphion and Zethus Bacchus was indignant vith Antiope and as the punishments of the gods are always transcendent afflicted her with madness and by this means caused her to wander over all Greece Phocus however OF GREECE 39 however the son of Ornytion and the grandson of Sisy phus freed her from her insanity and married her and on this account a sepulchre was built in common for An tiope and Phocus The rude stones which arc scattered about the tomb of Amphion are said to be the very stones which followed the harmony of his lyre It is also said of Orpheus that wild beasts followed him when he played on his harp CHAP XVIII THERE is a road from Thebes to Chalcis near the gates called Proet√ In tha public part of this road there is a sepulchre of Melanippus who was the most ex cellent warrior of all the Thcbans arid who when the Argives besieged Thebes slew Tydeus and Mecisteus the brother of Adrastus but he himself is said to have been flain by Amphiaraus There are three rude stones near this sepulchre But those that relate the antiquities of the Theban3 fay that Tydeus is interred here and that he was buried by Maion In proof of this they cite the fol lowing verse from the Iliad Tydeus who buried lies in Theban earth After this are the sepulchres of the children of Ocdipus I have not indeed beheld the sacred rkes which are per formed in honour of these but I can credit the reports of those that have seen them For the Thebans fay that they perform funeral sacrifices to others that are called heroes and to the children of Ocdipus and that while fhey are sacrificing to these both the llame and the smoke D 4 produced 4o THE DESCRIPTION produced by the flame become divided into two parts I am induced to believe that this account is true from what I have seen elsewhere For in Mysia above Caicus there is a small city which is called Pioniae They fay that this city was built by Pionis who was one of the posterity of Hercules While they are celebrating his funeral rites a smoke rises spontaneously from the sepulchre and of this I have been a spectator The Thebans too exhibit the sepulchre of Tiresias which is at the distance of about twenty stadia from the sepulchre of the sons of Oedipus But they acknowledge that Tiresias died in Haliartia  they likewise own that the sepulchre which they shew of him is merely honorary The Thebans too have a tomb of Hector the son of Priam near the fountain which is called Oeoi podia For they fay that his bones were brought hither from Troy in consequence of the following oracle Thebans who inhabit the city of Cadmus if you wish to reside in your country blest with the posseflion of blame less wealth bring the bones of Hector the son of Priam into your dominions from Asia and reverence the hero agreeably to the mandate of Jupiter But the fountain Oedipodia was thus denominated because Oedipus washed off in it the blood occasioned by the murder of his father Near this fountain is the sepulchre of Asphodicus who according to the Thebans flew Parthenop√ us the son of Talaus in an engagement with the Argives For the verses in the Thebaid respecting the death of Partheno p√ us assert that he was slain by Periclymenus CHAP OF GREECE 4 CHAP XIX In this fame public road too there is a place called Teumeflus where they fay Europa was concealed by Jus piter It is likewise said of the Teumeflian fox that it was nourished by Bacchus for the purpose of destroying the Thebans and that when it was on the point of being taken by that dog which Diana gave to Procris the daughter of Erechtheus both the dog and the fox were changed into stones There is also a temple of Minerva Telchinia in Teumeflus but it has not a statue of the goddess It may be conjectured that the goddess was thus denomi nated from the Telchinians who formerly dwelt in Cy prus for it is probable that a part of them when they came among the B≈ otians dedicated this temple of Mi nerva Telchinia On proceeding from Teumeflus on the left hand and to the distance of about seven stadia you will arrive at the ruins of Glifas Opposite to these there is a sepulchre of earth not very large which can hardly be seen by reason of the trees which surround it some of which are wild and others have been raised by art Those that followed √ gialeus the son of Adrastus to the Theban war the Argive nobles and among them Promachus the son of Parthenopaeu6 are buried here But that there is a sepulchre of √ gialeus in Pagae I have before evinced in my account of the Megarensian affairs On proceeding in a straight line from Thebes to Glifas you will fee a place surrounded with chosen stones which the Thebans call the head of the serpent They say that a certain serpent raised 4 THE DESCRIPTION raised its head in this place out of a cavern and that Tire Cas who happened to come hither at that time flew it with his sword which occasioned the place to be thus denominated Above GlICis there is a mountain which is called Supreme and in it there is a temple with a statue es Jupiter the Supreme But the torrent which is in this place they call Thennodon On turning towards Teumef us and into the road which leads to Chalcis you will sec a sepulchre of Chalcodon who was lain by Amphitryon in the battle between the Thebans and Eub≈ enses After this you will perceive the ruins of the cities Harmas and Mycaleflus The former of these was thus denominated according to the Tanagr√ ans because Amphiaraus disap peared with his chariot in this place and not in that menr tioned by the Thebans But it is acknowledged both by the Tanagr√ ans and Thebans that Mycaleflus was so called because the ox which was the guide of Cadmus and hre associates in their journey to Thebes lowed there After what manner too Mycaleflus came to be a desolate place I have Ihewn in my account of the Athenian aihnrs In that part of Mycaleflus which borders on the sea there is a temple of Mycale≈ an Ceres They fay that this is opened and shut again every night by Hercules i and that Hercules is one of those that arc called the Id ei Dactyli The following wonderful circumstance happens here They place before the feet of the statue of Ceres all the fruit which autumn produces and this remains en tire through the whole year Proceeding to a little dis tance from that part of the Euripus which divides Eubcea from the borders of the B≈ otians and keeping to the fight hand of the temple of Ceres you will arrive at Aulis which OF GREECE 4a which they say was denominated from the daughter of Ogygus There is a temple here of Diana which con tains two flone statues one of these holds a torch and the other is in the attitude of one shooting an arrow They fay that when the Greeks in consequence of the prophesy os Chalcas were about to sacrifice Iphigenia on the altar in this temple the goddess caused a stag to be the victim instead of her Even at present too they pre serve in this temple the remains of the trunk of that plane tree which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad It is likewise said that when the Greeks were detained at Aulis by adverse winds the wind on a sudden blew from the desired quarter and then each person sacrificed to Diana whatever victims came to hand both male and female in consequence of this it became an established custom in Aulis to approve victims of every kind They fliew a fountain here near which a plane tree grows and on a hill near the tent of Agamemnon there is a brazen threshold But palm trees grow before the temple the fruit of which is not perfectly sweet to the taste like that of the palm trees in Pal√ stine but yet these dates are milder than those which are gathered in Ionia There are not many inhabitants in Aulis and these are all of them potters The Tanagr√ i too and those that dwell about Mycalessus and Harma cultivate this land CHAP XX In that part of the country of the Tanagr√ ans which borders on the sea there is a place called Delion in which there are a temple of Djaria and statues of Latona The Tanagr√ ani 44 THE DESCRIPTION Tanagr√ ans fay that their city was built by Poemandrus the son of Ch√ refilaus the grandso n of Iafius and the great grandson of Elemher who was the son of Apolio and √ thusa the daughter of Neptune This Poemandrus married Tanagra the daughter of √ dlus  though Corinna in her verses fays that Tanagra was the daughter of Aso pus However he lived to so great an age that she wag called by her neighbours Graia or the grey instead of Tanagra and in process of time this name was given to the city and remained so long that it is mentioned by Homer ii‚ û his catalogue of the Greeks Thefpia Graia Myealcfius broad In after times however it recovered its pristine name There is a monument too of Orion in Tanagra and a rtountain Cercyius in Which they fay Mercury was born There is likewise a place called Poloson and here they say Atlas fat diligently investigating subterranean and celestial affairs And that Homer agreeable to this fays of Atlas Atlas her sire by whose all piercing eye The depths of ev ry sea are clearly seen And who the lofty pillars strenuous rears Which ev ry way divide the earth from heav n But in the temple of Bacchus there is a statue which deserves to be inspected of Parian stone and which was made by Calamis The statue of Triton however is still more wonderful and there is a more venerable report concerning him which is as follows ‚ The Tanagrian women that were first initiated in the orgies of Bacchus descended to the sea for the sake of purifications But while they were swimming in it they were assaulted by Triton OF GREECE 45 Triton and on their imploring Bacchus to defend them the god heard their prayer engaged with and vanquished Triton There is another report which is not so vene rable as the former but which is more probable and it is this ‚ Whatever cattle were driven to the sea were at tacked and taken away by Triton who used likewise to seize all small vessels till the Tanagrians placed on the shore bowls of wine For Triton allured by the smell of this drank it was overpowered by sleep and fell head long from a steep part of the shore After this a Tana grian cut off his head with an axe and this is the reason why his statue is without a head But they are of opinion that because he wa¬ seen intoxicated he was slain by Bacchus CHAP XXI I HAVE seen another Triton among the admirable ett riofities of the Romans but which is not so large as this of the Tanagrians The form of the Tritons is as fol lows ‚ The hair of their head resembles the parsley which grows in marshes both in its colour and in the perfect similitude of one hair to another so that you cannot dis tinguish any difference among them The rest of their body is rough with small scales and is of the fame hard ness with the skin of a fish They have the gills of a fish under their earsv Their nostrils are those of a man but their teeth are broader than those of the human species and are the teeth of a wild beast Their eyes appear to me to be azure ‚ and their hands fingers and nails are of the fame form with the upper shells of shell fish They have 4 I THE DESCRIPTION have fins under their breast and belly like those of th6 dolphin instead of feet I have likewise seen the √ thiopian bull which they call rhinoceros because a horn projects from the extremity of its nostril and another small one under it but it has no horns on its head I have seen too the P√ orian bulls whose bodies are rough in every part but particularly in the breast and chin But the Indian camtls resemble leopards in their colour There is a wild beast called alee which is of a species between a stag atid a camel This animal is found among the Gauls and is the only wild beast we are acquainted with which can neither be hunted nor fore seen at a distance by the human species but the d√ mon drives these into the Hands of the hunter while he is en gaged in pursuing other wild beasts They fay that it smells a man at a great distance and after smelling him hides itself in chasms and profound caverns Hunters therefore when they have surrounded plains or mountain thickets with their toils so as that they are certain of catching all the aninials within the circumference of their toils catch among the rest the alee But if it hap pens that this animal is not in the part in which they have fixed their toils they are unable to take it by any stratagem whatever With respect to that wild beast which Ctesias in his history of the Indians fays is called by them martiera but bj the Greeks androphagos or the devourer of man I am persuaded that it is no other than the tiger This animal he fays has a triple row of teeth in one of its jaws and stings in the extremity of its tail with which it defends itself when attacked near and hurls them like arrows against its enemies at a distance For my own part I do not OF GREECE 47 not believe that tins account of the animal is true but that the Indians have been induced to fabricate it through vehement dread of this wild beast For they are deceived with respect to its colour because the tiger when it is beheld in the fun appears to be red and of a colour similar to that of the sun Or this deception may have arisen from the swiftness of the beast ot from its agility in turn ing its body when it is not running which is so great that its colour particularly if beheld at a distance cannot be ascertained Indeed I am of opinion that whoever travels to the extremities of Africa India or Arabia and is desirous of finding such animals as are produced in Greece will in the first place discover that some of them are wanting and in the next place will find others which vary in certain particulars from those in Greece For man is not the only animal which varies in his form in a different air and a different land but other animals arc subject to the same variety Thus the Libyan asps arc of the fame colour with those in Egypt but in √ thiopia they are black as well as the men Hence we ought nei ther to believe in every report indiscriminately nor yet refuse our assent to the existence of other things merely because they are rare I have never indeed seen winged serpents but I am persuaded there Sre such animals be cause a Phrygian once brought into Icnia a scorpion which had wings similar to those cf a locust CHAP XXII IN Tanagra near the temple of Bacchus there are three temples one of Themis another of Venus and a third f f Apollo in which last both Diana and Latona are wor shipped 48 THE DESCRIPTION Clipped With respect to the two temples of Mercufy one of which is called the temple of Criophoros or the bearer of the ram and the other of Pramochos or the defender they fay that the first of these was thus denominated be cause Mercury freed them from a pestilence by carrying a ram round the walls and that on this account Calamis made a statue of Mercury for the Tanagr√ ans carrying a ram on his shoulders He who surpasses in beauty the other youths carries on the festival of Mercury a ram on his shoulders round the walls But they fay that Mer cury was called Promachos because when the Eretrienses from Eubcca came with a fleet against the Tanagr√ ans this god led forth the youth to battle and being himself armed with a curry comb like a young man was the prin cipal cause of putting the Eubceenses to flight In the temple of Promachos the remains of a purflain tree are dedicated because as they fay Mercury was educated under trees of this kind Not far too from hence there is a theatre and near it a porch is raised In this parti cular indeed the Tanagr√ ans appear to me to reverence the gods in a manner superior to the rest of the Greeks because they are careful to build their temples separate from other edifices in a pure place and remote from the multitude In a celebrated part of the city there is a sepulchre of Corinna who alone composed verses for the Tanagr√ ans In the gymnasium too there is a picture of her in which her head is represented bound with a fillet on account of her having vanquished at Thebes Pindar in the composing of verses It appears to me however that she vanquished htm by reason of the dialect which she employed because ter verses were not composed in the Doric dialect like 7 those 6 f Greece 49 ihose of Pindar but in that dialect which the √ olians would most easily underhand and because she was the most beautiful woman too of her time as may be easily inferred from her picture Among the Tanagneans there are two kinds of cocks the game and those which they call cojsuphoi or black birds The size of these cossuphoi is the fame with that of the Lydian birds but their colour Tesombles that of a crow Their gills too and crests resemble an anemony and they have white spots not very large on the extremity of their bill and tail But in that part of Bceotia which is on the left hand of the Euripusj there is a fountain called Messapios and under it is the maritime city of the B≈ otians Anthedon According to some the city was thus denominated from the nymph Anthedon but according to others from Anthan the son of Neptune by Alcyone the daughter of Atlas be cause Anthan once reigned in this place Among the Anthedonians near the middle of their city there is a temple of the Cabiri and about it there is a grove of Ceres and a temple of Proserpine The statue of the goddess is of white stone Before the city too and to wards the more interior part of the country there is a temple of Bacchus and in it there is a statue of the god In this place likewise there are sepulchres of Iphimedca and the sons of Aloeus who were flain by Apollo in Naxos which is above Paros both according to Homer and Pindar The sepulchres of these too are in Anthe don Near the sea there is a place which they call the thicket of Glaucus This Glaucus was a fisherman who after eating a certain herb became a d√ mon of the sea and that he predicts future events is both believed by others and particularly by sailors who relate many things Vol III E every So THE DESCRIPTION every year respecting his divining power Pindar too zni √ schylus relying on these reports of the Anthedonians have celebrated Glaucus in their verses the former in deed not relating many things of him but the latter making him the subject of one of his dramas CHAP XXIII But among the Thebans before the gate called Proetx there is that which is denominated the gymnasium os Iolaus there is likewise a stadium like that in Olympia or that among the Laurians for it is a heap of earth In the fame place too they shew the heroic monument of Iolaus who as the Thebans acknowledge died in Sar dinia j the Athenians and Thespienses passing over with him to that city at the fame time Having proceeded be yond the right hand part of the stadium you will arrive at the Hippodrome in which there is a sepulchre of Pindar It is said of Pindar that when he was a young man as he was going to Thespia being wearied with the heat as it was noon and in the height of summer he fell asleep at a small distance from the public road j and that bees as he was asleep flew to him and wrought their honey on his lips This circumstance first induced Pindar to compose verses Bat when his reputation spread through all Greece the Pythian deity ra sed his glory to a still greater height by ordering the Delphi to assign to Pindar an equal part of those first fruits which were offered to Apollo It is also said that when he was an old man he saw in a dream Proserpine standing by him who at the same time told him OF GREECE 51 Kim that she alone of all the divinities Was not celebrated by him in his hymns but that when he came to her he would compose a hymn in her praise And indeed he died on the tenth day aster this dream But there was at Thebes a certain old woman allied to Pindar and who was very conversant with his verses which she used to sing To her Pindar appeared in a dream and sang a hymn to Proserpine and the old woman as soon as she was awake committed to writing all that she had heard Pindar sing ing in her sleep In this hymn among other appellations of Pluto he is called Chrusinios or possessing golden reins and it is evident that this epithet pertains to the rape of Proserpine From the sepulchre of Pindar there is a road which i3 for the most part plain to Acr√ phnium They fay that this city was at first a part of the Theban land and I have found that Theban exiles afterwards fled hither when Alexander subverted Thebes For these through imbeci lity and old age not being able to reach the Attic land took up their residence in this place This little city is situated in the mountain Ptous and contains a temple and statue of Bacchus which deserve to be inspected On proceed ing to about the distance of fifteen stadia from this city you will fee on the right hand a temple of Apollo Ptous But Ptous was the son of Athamas and Themrstus and from him both Apollo and the mountain were denomi nated according to the poet Asius Before Thebes was destroyed by Alexander there was an oracle in this tem ple which was by no means fallacious They fay that an European whose name was Mys was once sent hither by Mardonius for the purpose of consulting the oracle and that the god answered his interrogations not in the E 2 Grecian 52 THE DESCRIPTION Grecian tongue but in a Barbaric dialect After yoa have passed beyond the mountain Ptous you will arrive at Larymna which is a maritime city of the B≈ otians They fay that it was thus denominated from Larymna the daughter of Cynus But I hall relate who were her more remote ancestors in my account of the Locrian affairs formerly Larymna belonged to the city Opus but when the power of the Thebans became very considerable then the inhabitants of Larymna voluntarily joined themselves to the B≈ otians There is a temple here of Bacchus and a statue in an upright position There is likewise a lake whose profundity commences from its very margin and the mountains which are above the city afford wild boars for hunters CHAP XXIV On proceeding from Acr√ phnium in a straight line to the lake Cephiffis which is called by some Copais you will arrive at a plain which is denominated Athamantios They fay that Athamas dwelt in this place The river Cephiffus pours itself into this lake This river commences from Lil√ a among the Phocenscs and affords a passage for sliips to Copse which is a small city situated near the lake and which is mentioned by Homer in his catalogue of the sliips In this city there are temples of Ceres Bacchus and Serapis The B≈ otians too fay that for merly other small cities Athenx and Eleusis were inha bited near this lake which were destroyed during the win ter season by the overflowing of the lake But the fish in the lake Cephiffis are in no respect different from the silh 6 which OFGREECE 53 which are found in other lakes The eels however which are found in it are very large and sweet On proceeding from Cop√ on the left hand at about the distance of twelve stadia you will arrive at Holmones  and from Holmones Hyettus is distant about seven stadia These are now as they were at first nothing more than villages and it ap pears to me that they are parts of the Orchomenian land as well as the Athamantian plains With respect to Hyettus and Holmus the son of Sisyphus I hall relate what I have heard concerning them in my account of the Orchomenians But there is not any thing which deserves in the least to be inspected among the Holmonians In Hyettus there is a temple of Hercules and in it remedies are found for the diseased The statue however of Hercules is not artificially made but is a rude stone after the ancient manner At about the distance of twenty stadia from Hyettus is Crytones They fay that this small city was formerly called Cyrtone It is built on a lofty mountain and in it there are a temple and grove of Apollo But in the temple there are statues in an upright position os Apollo and Diana Cold water flows here from a rock and near this fountain there is a temple of the Nymphs and a small grove in which trees of every kind are planted On pro ceeding from Crytones after you have passed over the mountain you will arrive at the town Corsea Under this town there is a grove of planted trees which are for the most part scarlet oaks A small statue os Mercury stands in that part of the grove which is in the open air This grove too is about half a stadium distant from Corsea On descending into the flat part of the country you will see the river Platanius pouring itself into the sea And E 3 on 54 THE DESCRIPTION on the right hand of this river are the extremities of the B≈ otian land and in this place there is a small city Al√ near the sea which divides the continent of the Locrians from Eubcea nMONC the Thebans near the gate Neitis is the sepulchre of Menoeceus the son of Creon who voluntarily slew himself in compliance with the Delphic oracle when Polynices came with an army from Argos A pomegra nate tree grows near his tomb the fruit of which when ripe on breaking the exterior rind has the appearance of blood This tree regerminates perpetually The Thebans too assert that the vine first made its appearance in their country but they have not any token to shew of this at present Not far from the sepulchre of Menoeceus they lay that the sons of Oedipus fighting in a single combat slew each other As a proof of this combat there is a pillar here and upon it a stone shield They hew a place too in which they fay Juno suckled Hercules in consequence of a deception employed by Jupiter The whole of this place is called Surma Antigones or the draw ing of Antigone because Antigone when she sound her r self unable to raise the dead body of Polynices endea r voured to draw it along and continued her efforts till she accomplished her design and threw it on the funeral pile os Eteocles which was then enkindled After you have passed over the river which is called Dirce from the wife of Lycus by whom according to report Antiope was in jured and was on that account slain by the sons of An CHAP XXV  tiope OF GREECE 55 tiope you will see the ruins of the house of Pindar and a temple os the mother Dindymene which was dedicated by Pindar The statue of the goddess was made by the Thebans Aristomedes and Socrates On one day in every year they think proper to open this temple I happened to be present on that day and by this means had an oppor tunity of seeing the statue which is of Pentelican stone as well as the throne on which the goddess sits In the road from the gate Neitis there is a temple of Themis and in it a statue of white stone After this there are two temples one of the Parc√ and the other of Judicial Ju piter The statue of Jupiter is of stone but there are no statues of the Parc√ At a small distance from hence there is a statue of Hercules in the open air under the appellation of Rinocoloujles because in order to disgrace those ambassadors as the Thebans fay that were sent by the Orchomenians to demand tribute he cut off their noses On proceeding to the distance of twenty five stadia from hence you will fee a grove of Cabirian Ceres and Proserpine into which the uninitiated are not permitted to enter But who the Cabiri are and what the ceremonies which are performed in honour of them and the mother of the gods I must beg those that are desirous of hearing such particulars to suffer me to pass over in silence No thing however hinders me from disclosing the origin of these mysteries according to the Thebans They fay then that there was once a city in this place and inha bitants who were called Cabiri and that Ceres depo sited something with Prometheus who was one of the Cabiri and with his son √ t n√ us after she became ac quainted with them What this deposit was and the E 4 circumstances 6 THE DESCRIPTION circumstances which took place respecting it piety forbids me to disclose The mysteries therefore of the Cabiri were the gift of Ceres But when the Epigoni led an army against Thebes and Thebes was taken the Cabiri being driven from their country were not able for some time to celebrate these mysteries Afterwards however they were restored by Pelarge the daughter of Potneus in conjunction with her husband Isthmiades And then indeed Pelarge initiated persons in these mysteries beyond the ancient boundaries of the country but Telondes and those of the Cabiri that were restored Jo their native land celebrated the mysteries in Cabir√ a By an oracle too given from Dodona other honours were decreed to Pelarge and a victim big with young was ordered to be sacrificed to her Many instances likewise have evinced that the wrath of the Cabiri is implacable Far when certain private persons in Naupactus had the boldness to perform the ceremonies established by the Thebans they were shortly after punistied for their impiety Such too of the forces of Xerxes as together with Mardonius pitched their camps in Bccotia when they entered the temple of the Cabiri either allured by the hope of gain ing great riches or as it appears to me through their contempt of a divine nature became immediately insane and some of them threw themselves into the sea and Others hurled themselves headlong from rocks Thus again when Alexander had vanquished the Thebans and destroyed all Thebes by sire such of the Macedonians as entered the temple of the Cabiri because they were upon hostile ground were destroyed by thunder and lightning So holy has this temple been fj ni the beginning CHAP OF GREECE 57 CHAP XXVI On the right hand of the temple of the Cabiri there is a plain which is called Tenerus from the prophet Te nerus who they fay was the son of Apollo and Melia Here too there is a large temple of Hercules who is called Ippodotos For they report that the Orchomenians came to this place with an army and that Hercules seiz ing their horses in the night bound them in such a man ner to their chariots as to prevent their being useful in the war On proceeding from hence you will arrive at a mountain from whence according to report the Sphinx used to rush in order to destroy those that could not solve ‚ he riddles which ihe fang to them thougli others aflert that she used to drive to Anthedon with a naval force after the manner of pirates and afterwards exercise her robberies from this mountain till Oedipus flew her by means of a numerous army which he brought from Co rinth It is also said that she was the bailard daughter pf Laius and that her father taught her the oracle which was given to Cadmus at Dclphos through his kindness towards her Prior to the Theban kings indeed no one was acquainted with the meaning of the oracle  and these in succession unfolded it to each other As often there fore as any dispute arose respecting the kingdom the neighbouring people came to consult Sphinx Laius in deed had sons by his mistresses but they fay that the meaning of the oracle given by the Pythian deity was only known to Epicaste and the children which Laius had by frer They add dial the brothers were circumyented by the 5S THE DESCRIPTION the sophisms of Sphinx  and that upon her inquiring whe ther if they were the sons of Laius they knew the oracle given to Cadmus if they answered in the negative she condemned them to death as not being entitled by their birth to the kingdom Lastly it is said that the inter pretation of the oracle was given to Oedipus in a dream who was by this means enabled to solve the riddle of Sphinx The ruins of the city Onchestus are about fifteen stadia distant from this mountain and they fay that Onchestus the son of Neptune once dwelt in this city At present indeed a temple and statue of Onchestian Neptune re main and there is likewise a grove here which is cele brated by Homer On turning from the temple of the Cabiri to the left hand and proceeding to the distance of about fifty stadia you will arrive at the city Thefpia which is situated under mount Helicon and is said to have been denominated from Thefpia the daughter of Asopus According to some Thespius when he left Athens gave this name to the city and they fay that he was the son of Erechtheus Among the Thespians there is even at present a brazen statue of Jupiter the Saviour They re port that the city being once infested with a dragon Ju piter ordered them to expose every year to the savage ani mal certain young men chosen by lot and that the names of those that perished except one sunk into oblivion The name of this one was Cleostratus who had a brazen coat of mail made for him by his lover Menestratus This coat of mail was thick set with hooks turned upwards and Cleostratus a med with this very readily went forth to meet the dragon and was indeed himself slain but at the same time was the destruction of the savage beast From  OF GREECE S9 From this circumstance Jupiter came to be called Savi our They have besides a statue of Bacchus another of Fortune a third of Hygia and a fourth of Minerva by the side of whom there is a statue of Flutus CHAP XXVII But the Thespians venerated from the first Love be yond all the gods and they have a most ancient statue of this divinity which is nothing more than a rude stone I do not however know who it was that instituted this high veneration of Love among theThefpians The Pariani too who dwell about the Hellespont and who originated from Ionia and migrated hither from Erythr√ but at present are in subjection to the Romans venerate this divinity no less than the Thespians The multitude are of opinion that Love is the youngest of the gods and the son of Venus But the Lycian Olen who composed the most ancient hymns for the Greeks fays in his hymn to Lucina that Lucina is the mother of Love And Pamphus and Orpheus who flourished after Olen have composed hymns to Love that they might be fung by the Lycomed√ during the celebration of the mysteries I likewise once spoke with a torch bearer of the Eleusinian mysteries and through his means read these hymns of Pamphus and Orpheus of which I shall make no farther mention Hesiod indeed or at least the author of the 1 heogony I well know says that Chaos was first generated afterwards Earth and then Tartarus and Love But the Lesbian Sappho sings many things of Love which by no means harmonize with each other Lysippus afterwards made a brazen statue 60 THE DESCRIPTION statue of Love for the Thespians and prior to him Praxi teles made one of Pentelican stone With respect to the stratagem which Phryne employed in order to discover the favourite statue of Praxiteles this I have elsewhere related They say that this statue of Love was first moved out of its place by the Roman emperor Caius It was afterwards sent back to the Thespians by Claudius v and again brought to Rome by Nero where it was destroyed by sire Of those however who acted thus impiously to wards this divinity one man was slain by a soldier whom he used to nick name in derision and Nero acted very impiously towards his mother and behaved with a cruelty towards his wives which shewed that he was entirely destitute of Love But the statue of Love which is at present among the Thespians was made by the Athenian Menodorus in imi tation of the manner of Praxiteles In this place too there isa Venus and a statue of Phryr e both of stone and the works of Praxiteles In another part of the city there is a temple of Venus Mclainis or the black ‚ there a e be tides a theatre and a forum well worthy of inspection Here likewise there is a brazen statue of Hefiod and not far from the forum there are a brazen statue of Victory and a temple of the Muses not very large In this temple there are small statues of stone The Thespians too have a temple of Hercules ‚ the priestess of which retains her virginity as long as fiie lives They fay that this arose from the fol lowing circumstance Hercules had connection with all the fifty daughters of Thestius except one in one night and this one who was unwilling to be connected with him was chosen by him as his priestess but with this re ILrictioUj that flie should rernain all her life a virgin But I have OF GREECE 61 I have heard another account of this affair that Hercules was connected with all the fifty daughters of Thestius in one night that they all bore him sons and the youngest and oldest of these daughters were each of them de livered of twins However for my own part I can never be induced to believe that Hercules could be excited to such a violent anger against the daughter of his friend Besides it is not probable that he who while he was among men punilhed the insolent behaviour os others and particularly revenged impiety towards the gods would build a temple and appoint a priestess for himself as if he was a god But to me indeed it appears that this temple is more ancient than the period in which Hercules the son of Amphitryon lived and I do not know whether the dedication of this temple ought not to be ascribed to the Hercules who is one of the Idxi Dactyli as I have discovered that the Erythr√ ans in Ionia and the Tyrians have raised temples to him Nor are the B≈ otians ignorant of this name of Hercules for they fay that the temple of Mycaleflian Ceres was committed to the care of the Idxan Hercules CHAP XXVIII TlIE mountain Helicon excels all the mountains in Greece for the goodness of its foil and the multitude of trees which it contains The young shoots of purflain too with which it abounds yield the sweetest fruit The inhabitants of Helicon fay that none of the herbs or roots which are produced in this mountain are destructive to 6t THE DESCRIPTION to mankind They add that the pastures here even ie bilitate the venom of serpents so that those who are fre quently bit by serpents in this part escape the danger with greater ease than if they were of the nation of the Psylli or had discovered an antidote against poison Other wise the venom of the fiercest of serpents is both destruc tive to men and all other animals The nature of the pastures too contributes in no small degree to the strength of the venom For I once heard a Ph≈ nician fay that in the mountainous part of Ph≈ nicia the roots that grow there render the vipers more fierce The fame person too farther added that he saw a viper pursue a man who fled to a tree for shelter aud that the viper blew its venom against the tree to which the man had escaped and by this means caused his death With respect to those vipers in Arabia which take up their residence among balsam trees I know that something very different from what I have above related happens and this is as follows The balsam tree is nearly of the fame size as a sprig of myrtle and its leaves are like those of the herb sweet marjoram Vipers take up their residence about these plants and are in some places more numerous than in others for the juice of the balsam tree is their sweetest food and they are delighted with the hade produced by its leaves When the time therefore arrives for gathering the juice of this tree the Arabians come into the sacred grove each of them holding two twigs By shaking these they put to flight the vipers for they are unwilling to kill them because they consider them as the sacred inhabitants of the balsam And if it happens that any one is wounded by a viper the wound resembles that which is rhadc by iron but is not attended with any dangerous conse quences OF GREECE 6j quences for these animals being fed with the juice of the balsam tree which is the most odoriferous of all trees their poison becomes changed from a deadly quality into one which produces a milder effect CHAP XXIX But they fay that Ephialtes and Otus consecrated this mountain to the Muses and were the first that sacrificed to these divinities in Helicon They likewise report that Ascra was built by these And Hegesinous in his poem on the Attic land thus speaks concerning Ascra With Ascra mingling once th earth fliaking power When rolling years their rounds had run begat A son nam d Oeclus who Ascra built Assisted by Alotus offspring near The streams of Helicon s irriguous feet I never read the poetical compositions of Hegesinous for they were not extant when I was born But Calippus the Corinthian in his history of the Orchomenians cites the verses of Hegesinous in proof of what he asserts and hence I have taken these verses from Calippus At pre sent a tower remains in Ascra but of every thing else even the remembrance has perished The sons of Aloeus were of opinion that there were only three Muses and these they called Melete Mneme and Aoide which signify meditations memory and Jinging But they fay that in after times Pierus the Macedonian from whom a mountain in Macedonia is denominated came to Thespia and ordered that nine Muses stiould be worshipped by the names which they 64 THE DESCRIPTION they retain at present And this alteration was made fry Pierus either because it appeared to him to be wiser or in consequence of some oracle or as the result of what he had learned from the Thracians For formerly the Thracians seem to have excelled the Macedonians in dexterity in human affairs and not to have been so negligent as they were in divine concerns There are those too who say that Pierus had nine daughters and that he called them by the names of the Muses and that the grandchildren of Pierus by these daughters were called by the names which the Greeks give to the offspring of the Muses But Mimnermus who composed elegies respecting the battle of the Smyrntcans against Gyges and the Lydians fays in the preface to this work that the more ancie it Muses are the daughters of Heaven and that those of posterior origin are the daughters of Jupiter In Helicon too as you go to the grove of the Muses you will fee on the left hand the fountain Aganippe They fay that Aganippe was the daughter of Termessus which flows round mount Helicon But if you proceed to this grove in a straight line you will fee a stone image of Eu pheme This Eupheme is said to have been the nurse of the Muses After her image there is a statue of Linus in a small stone which is carved so as to resemble a cavern They perform funeral sacrifices every year to this poet before they sacrifice to the Muses It is said that Linus was the son of Urania by Amphiaraus the son of Nep tune The renown which he acquired for his skill in music was superior not only to that of his contemporaries but to that of all his predecessors and he is said to have been slain by Apollo for attempting to compare his skill in singing with that of the god Indeed the death os Linus was OF GREECE 6j was lamented by every barbarous nation and among the Egyptians there is a song which the Greeks call Linus for this song is denominated by the Egyptians Manerem But the Greeks and among these Homer mention this song as Grecian For Homer being well acquainted with the misfortune of Linus fays that Vulcan represented among other things in the shield of Achilles a boy play ing on a harp aiid singing the fate of Linus To these a youth awakes the warbling strings Whole fender ky the fate of Linus sings But Pamphus who composed the most ancient hymns for the Athenians fays that grief for the death of Linus in creased to that degree that he came to be called Oitolinos or lamentable Linus And afterwards the Lesbian Sappho having learnt the name Oitolinos from the verses of Pam phus celebrates in her poems Adonis and Oitolinos The Thebans too boast that Linus was buried in their coun try and they fay that after the loss of the Greeks at Ch√ ronea Philip the son of Amyntas in consequence of a vision in a dream brought the bones of Linus to Mace donia  and afterwards from another dream carried back the bones to Thebes The covering however of this tomb and every thing else belonging to it have they say been obliterated through length of time The Thebans like wise assert that there was a junior Linus the son os Isme nius and that when but a boy he was slain by Hercules whom he instructed in music However neither the Linus the son of Amphimarus nor he who was the son of Ismenius composed any tlung in verse or if they did it has not been transmitted to posterity Vol III F CHAP  6 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XXX Th E ancient statues of all the Muses here were made by Cephisodotus And on proceeding to no great distance from hence you will fee three Muses which were made by Cephisodotus and after these the same number of Muses the works of Strongylion who made oxen and horses after the best manner The remaining three Muses were made by Olympiosthenes In Helicon too there are a brazen Apollo and a Mercury contending with each other about a lyre There is likewise a Bacchus the work of Lyfippus for the upright statue of Bacchus which was dedicated by Sylla was made by Myron and except hi statue of Erechtheus deserves to be inspected beyond all his work at Athens Sylla however did not dedicate this statue out of his own pofleslions but took it from the Orcho menian Minyte And this is what the Greeks call vene rating a divine nature with foreign fumigations Here too you may fee the statues of poets and illustrious mu sicians Among these there are Thamyris now blind and handling a broken lyre and the Methymn√ an Arion sit ing pn a dolphin But he who made the statue of the Ar give Sacadas from not understanding the exordium of Pindar s verses upon him has made this piper not greater as to the length of his body than his pipes Hesiod too sits here holding a harp on his knees though this was not his usual attitude for it is evident from his poems that he used to sing near a twig of laurel With respect to the age of Hesiod and Homer though I have mad¬ 5 th OF GREfiCE 7 the most diligent and accurate inquiry it is slot agreeable to me to give my opinion on this subject as I know that It has occasioned great disputes among men of former times and that there is no small contention about  k among poets of the present day There is a statue here too of the Thracian Orpheus withJV rff or mystic sacrificet standing by his side He is represented singing and is surrounded by wild beasts fashioned from brass and stone who are listening to his song The Greeks indeed be lieve many things which are by no means true and this among the rest that Orpheus was the son of the Muse Calliope and not of that Calliope who was the daughter of Pierus that he allured wild beasts by the melody of his lyre and that he descended to Hades while alive for the purpose of requesting the infernal gods to restore him back his wife But it appears to me that Orpheus sur passed all the poets that were prior to him in the elegance of his compositions and that he acquired great authority in consequence of the general opinion that he invented the mysteries of the gods purifications for impious actions remedies for diseases and the methods of appeasing the wrath of divinity They report too concerning him that the Thracian women endeavoured to take away his life by stratagem because he persuaded their husbands to attend him in his wanderings but that they had not the boldness to put this design in execution through fear of their hustvinds j at length however by drinking largely of wine th y ac complished this daring project Hence they fay it came to be established by law that men should be led to battle intoxicated There are others again who fay that Or fheus was killed by lightning on account of having taught F a things 8 THE DESCRIPTION things in the mysteries which men were unacquainted with before It is likewise reported of Orpheus that after the death of his wife he came in consequence of it to Aornus in Thesprotia because there was an ancient oracle there of departed spirits that when he came here he expected the foul of Eurydice would follow him but that finding him self disappointed he flew himself through grief The Thracians add that the nightingales which build their nests about the sepulchre of Orpheus sing sweeter and louder than other nightingales But the Macedonians who inhabit die country under the Pierian mountain and the city Dibs fay that Orpheus was slain in that place by women On proceeding from Dios to the mountain at about the distance of twenty stadia you will fee a pillar on the right hand and upon it a stone urn which ac cording to the inhabitants of this place contains the bones of Orpheus The river Helicon flows through this part of the country and at the distance of eighty five stadia hides itself in the earth Afterwards having concealed it self for about twenty two stadia it again rises and as suming the name of Baphyr√ instead os Helicon becomes a navigable river and pours itself into the sea The Diatx say that this river at first ran in an open channel but that when the women who flew Orpheus attempted to wash themselves from his blood in it then it funk into the earth that its water might not be the means of purifying them from his murder I have likewise heard a different report from this in Larifia that formerly there was a city in Olympus called  Libethra and which stood in that part of the mountain whkh is turned towards Macedonia that the sepulchre of Orpheus is not far from hence and that an oracle of Bacchus Ot GREECE  s fy Bacchus was transmitted to the Libethrians from Thrace informing them that their city would be destroyed by Sus whenever the fun should behold the bones of Or pheus The Libethrians however did not pay much attention to the oracle because they did not believe that there could be any wild beast sufficiently large and strong to destroy their city  and as to the boar th y were persuaded that its boldness was superior to its strength However when it seemed fit to divinity the following circumstances took place A shepherd about mid day being weary laid himself down by the tonib of Orpheus and in his sleep began to sing the verses of that poet with a loud and sweet voice The neighbouring shepherds there fore and husbandmen allured by this harmony left their employments and gathered themselves round the sleep ing shepherd But it so happened from their pushing against and striving to outstrip each other in getting neat the shepherd that they overturned the pillar broke the urn which contained the bones of Orpheus and by this means caused them to be seen by the sun Afterwards on the following night divinity caused it to rain in abun dance and the river Sus which is one of the torrents about Olympus rushed with such impetuosity against the walls of the Libethrians that it threw them down toge ther with all the temples and houses and drowned all the men and animals that were in the city The Libe thrians therefore becoming extinct the Macedonians that dwelt in Dios as a Lariss√ an who was my guest informed me conveyed the bones of Orpheus to their own country But those who are conversant with the writings of the poets know with respect to the hymns of Orpheus that each of them is very short and that the whole pf them F 3 doei 7 THE DESCRIPTION does not amount to any considerable number The Ly corned are well acquainted with them and sing them in the mysteries of Ceres These hymns are next to those of Homer for the elegance of their composition but on account of their superior sanctity they are preferred for jreligious purposes to thpfe of Homer CHAP XXXI In Helicon too there is a statue of Arsinoe whom Ptolemy married though she was his sister A brazen ostrich supports this statue These birds indeed have wings naturally like other birds but through the weight and magnitude of their bodies they are unable to raise themselves into the air Here likewise there are a hind suckling Telephus the son of Hercules and an ox standing near her Besides these there is a statue of Priapus which deserves to be inspected This god is honoured in other places by those who take care of goats sheep or bee hives but the Lampsaceni venerate him beyond all the other d yinities and assert that he is the son of Bacchus and Venus Among other tripbds too which are dedi cated in Helicon there is a mosLancient one which they say Hesiod received in Chalcis by the Euripus in conse quence of a victory which he gained by his verses The grove here is surrounded with inhabitants  and the Thes pians celebrate a festival in this place and games which they call Mouseia or sacred to the Muses They also ce lebrate games in honour of Love in which rewards are not only proposed to musicians but likewise to the athleta On ascending from this grove to the distance of twenty OF GREECE 71 stadia you will see a fountain which is called the fountain of the horse They say that the horse of Bellerophon made this fountain by striking the earth with his hoof But the B≈ otians that dwell about Helicon have a tradi tion among them that Hesiod wrote nothing besides the poem entitled Works and Days and from this they take away the introduction to the Muses and fay that she proper beginning of the poem is that part which speaks of Contentions They shewed me too a leaden table near the fountain which was almost entirely rotten through age but on which the Works and Days of Hesiod was written Their opinion however who ascribe many works to Hesiod is very different from this And according to 1 these he composed a poem On Women The Great Eoea  The Thtogony Verses on the Prophet Melampus The De scent of Theseus with Pirithous to Hades The Exhortation of Chiron viz relative to the instruclidti of Achilles and the poem called Works and Days The same persons too assert that Hesiod was instructed jn divination by the Acarnanes and indeed a poem of He Cod On Divination is extant which I have read together1 with The Narrations of Prodigies which are at the end of it Contrary reports likewise are circulated about the death of Hesiod For though it is universally agreed that the sons of Ganyctor Ctimenus and Antiphus fled to Mo lucca from Naupactus on account of the murder of Hesiod and that through their impiety to Neptune they were punished there yet some are of opinion that He siod was falsely accused of having ravished the sister of these young men and others assert that she was ravished by him And such arc the different reports which are circulated about Hesiod and his works On the top of F 4 mount 7 THE DESCRIPTION mount Helicon is the river Lamusy which is not large i and in the borders of the Thespians there is a plaoe called Hedonacon which contains the fountain of Narcissus They fay that Narcissus beheld himself in this fountain  that he did not know he was in love himself and that he died through this love by the side of the fountain To be in love indeed with a shadow and not to know the difference between a man and the shadow of a man is stupidity in the extreme But there is another report concerning Narcissus which is less known thrn the former one  and this is that he had a twin sister who perfectly resembled him in her whole form that her hair and dress were similar to those of Narcissus and that they used to go out together to hunt That Narcissus fell in Jove with this sister  and that slie happening to die before hini he used to come to this fountain in which when he saw his own shadow without at the same time perceiving that it was his own he found some mitigation of the torments of his love by imagining that it was the image of his sister It appears to me however that the earth produced the flower Narcissus prior to this circumstance and m¬ opinion is confirmed by the verses of Pamphus For he fays that many years before the Thespian Narcissus Proserpine the daughter of Ceres was forcibly taken away by Pluto as she was playing and gathering flowers j and that she was deceived not by violets but by the parcissus CHAP  QF GREECE 7 1  CHAP XXXII that dwell in Creusis which is a liayen of tho Thespians have no public building or statue which de serves to be mentioned  but in the house of a private per son in Creusis there is a statue of Bacchus which is made of plaster and adorned with pictures But the passage bjr sea to Creufis from Peloponnesus is winding and stormy The promontories which run in o the sea give such a curvature to the shores that ships cannot fail in a direct line and the winds blow violently from the neighbouring mountains On sailing from Creusis not upwards but near Boeotia you will fee the city Thisbe on the right hand And in the first place there is a mountain near the sea When you have passed beyond this you will see a plain and after this another mountain in the bottom part of which there is a city In this city there is a temple of Hercules and in it a stone statue in an upright po sition They celebrate here a festival which they call Heracleia Nothing would hinder the plain which lies here between the mountains from becoming a lake through the great quantity of water in this part if they did not raise a strong bank through the middle of the plain turn the water every year to places beyond the bank and cul tivate the other parts cf the plain They fay that the nymph Thisbe from whom the city is denominated was a native of this place On sailing from hence you will see a small city near the sea which is called Tipha There js a temple of Hercules here in which they celebrate a festival  74 THE DESCRIPTION festival annually The Tiph√ enses assert that they ex celled from the first all the other B≈ otians in the know ledge of maritime affairs and that Tiphys who was chosen to be the pilot of the ship Argo was a native of their country i Before the city too they hew a place to which they fay the Argo drove when it returned from Colchis On proceeding upwards from Thespia towards the conti nent you will arrive at the city Haliartus But t i not proper that I should separate from my account of the Orchomenian affairs the particulars respecting the builder of this city and Coronca In the Persian war one part of the army of Xerxes laid waste with fire and sword the land and city of the Haliartians on account of their attachment to the interest of the Greeks But in Haliartus there is a sepulchre of Lysandra the Laced√ monian For when he drew near to Haliartus in order to attack its walls as the city was defended within by an army of Athenians and Thebans these forces leaving the city a battle ensued in which Lysander was slain Indeed Lysander appears to me to have merited by his conduct both the greatest praise and blame For he gave a speci men of consummate sagacity in warlike affairs when he commanded thePeloponnesian fleet For having attentively watched the motions of Antiochus the pilot of Alcibiades at that time when the commander was absent he induced him to hope that he would be able to engage in a naval battle with the Laced√ monians and afterwards vanquished him trusting to his arrogance and temerity not far from the walls of the Colophonians Lysander too when he was again chosen by the Spartans to command their three pared galleys so mitigated the anger of Cyrus that as often OF GREECE 75 often as he requested money for the use of his fleet Cyrus seasonably and liberally supplied him with it And when the Athenians had one hundred vessels stationed in √ gos potamos Lysander made them his prize through taking advantage of the time when the sailors went on shore in order to lay in water and fresh provisions He likewise exhibited the following specimen of justice A dispute about money happened to take place between Autelycus the pancratiast whose image I have seen in the Prytaneum at Athens and Eteonicus a Spartan Here the Spartan whose abilities in defending his cause were inferior to those of Autolycus behaved notwithstanding so insplently because the city of the Athenians was at that time in the power of the thirty tyrants and Lysander was present that he struck his adversary and because Autoly cus defended himself brought him to Lysander expecting that he would decide the affair in his favour Lysander however accused Eteonicus of having acted unjustly and dismissed him with reproaches and disgrace These actions therefore raised the reputation of Lysander but the fol lowing disgraced his character At √ gospotamos he slew Philocles the Athenian who was one of the commanders of the Athenian fleet and four thousand Athenian cay tives besides and would not suffer them to be buried though the Athenians permitted the Persians that fell at Marathon and Xerxes those Laced√ monians that died 2t Thermopyl√ to be buried Afterwards too a greater dis grace befel the Laced√ monians through Lysander and this was by his placing Decadarchs or companies of ten men over the cities that were in alliance with the Laced√ mo nians and besides these Laconic Harmidai or apt ad ministrators of affairs And lastly when the Spartans took no j6 THE DESCRIPTION no care to acquire wealth and thiff in consequence of an oracle which declared that the desire of riches would be the only thing destructive to Sparta Lyfander inflamed them with a vehement desire of becoming rich Hence following the opinion of the Persians and judging accord ing to their law I conclude that Lyfander was more hurt ful than useful to the Laced√ monians CHAP XXXIII But in Haliartus there is a sepulchre of Lyfander and an heroic monument of Cecrops the son of Pandion The mountain too Tilphussius and the fountain Tilphussa are about fifty stadia distant from Haliartus It is said by the Greeks that when the Argives together with the sons of Polynices took Thebes as they were leading along the prophet Tiresias with their other spoils to the Delphic Apollo the prophet being thirsty by the way drank of the fountain Tilphufla and immediately after expired His sepulchre therefore is near this fountain They fay too that Manto the daughter of Tiresias was given to Apollo by the Argives but that by order of the god she parsed over in a stiip to Colophon in Ionia and there married Rhacius the Cretan With respect to other particulars about Tiresias such as the number of years which he lived his being changed from a man into a woman and what Homer asserts of him in the Odyssey that he was the only wife person in Hades‚ these are known to every one Among the Haliartians too there is in the open air a temple of those goddesses who are called Praxidicai or the Winger CHF GREECE ft mvengers of actions They swear on the altars os these god desses and never violate the oath which they have thu taken This temple is near the mountain Tilphussius But in Haliartus there are temples in which there are no statues because the temples are without roofs To what divinities these were dedicated I have not been able to learn The river Lophis flows through the Haliartian land It is said that this country at first was very dry owing to its being totally destitute of water and that one of the principal inhabitants went to Delphos to inquire by what means water might be found that the Pythian deity answered him that he must flay the first person he met on his return to Haliartus and that he happening to meet first of all with Lophis the son of Parthenomenes immediately struck the youth with his sword That Lo phis yet breathing ran round the place in which he was wounded ‚ that wherever his blood fell on the ground there water ascended and that from this circumstance the river was called Lophis Alalcomen√ is a village by no means large and is situated at the extremities of a mountain not very lofty They fay that this place was denominated from a native Alalcomenes who was the nurse of Minerva But ac cording to others it was called after Alalcomenia who was the daughter of Ogygus At some distance from this village a temple of Minerva stands in a plain and in it there is an ancient statue of ivory Sylla indeed was guilty of many cruelties towards the Athenians and his conduct was very different from the manners of the Ro mans His behaviour too towards the Thebans and Or chomenians resembled his conduct towards the Athe nians and from the Alakomenians he took away this statue 7t THE DESCRIPTION statue of Minerva This man however who so furiously captured the Grecian cities and carried away the statues of their gods was tormented with the most unpleasant of all diseases For his body was covered with lice and his former good fortune was terminated by so calamitous an end But the temple in Alalcomen√ was neglected after this event as being deprived of its divinity Another cir cumstance too happened in my time which contributed to the dissolution of the temple A large and strong ivy which grew by the side of the temple destroyed the ce ment of the stones and separated them from each other A torrent not very large which they call Triton flows here and they fay it was thus denominated because Mi nerva was educated near the river Triton just as if this torrent was the river Triton and not that which pro ceeding from the marsti Tritonis in Africa pours itself into the Lybian sea CHAP XXXIV BEFORE you arrive at Coronea from Alalcomenre you will see a temple of Minerva Itonia This name was given to the goddess by Itonus the son of Amphictyon The B≈ otians assemble together in this place in order to form a common convention In this temple there are brazen statues of Minerva Itonia and Jupiter These were made by Agoracritos the disciple and lover of Phi dias Statues too of the Graces were dedicated here in my time It is said that Iodamia who officiated as priestess to die goddess once came by night within the sacred OF GREECE r sacred enclosure of the temple and that Minerva ap peared to her invested with a robe in which there was the head of Medusa that Iodamia as soon as she beheld it became a stone and that on this account a Woman places fire every day on the altar of Iodamia and fay thrice in the B≈ otian tongue that Iodamia lives and calls for sire The remarkable particulars which Coronea con tains are an altar of Mercury Epimelius in the forum and an altar of the Winds A little below these there is a temple of Juno and in it an ancient statue which was made by the Theban Pythodorus This statue holds Sirens in one of its hands For they fay that the daughters of Achelous were persuaded by Juno to contend in singing with the Muses and that the Muses being victorious  plucked off the wings of the Sirens and made crowns from them The mountain Libethrius is about forty stadia distant from Coronea In this mountain there are statues of the Libethrian Muses and Nymphs There are like wise two fountains here one of which they call Libethrias and the other Petta or a rock These fountains resemble the breasts of women and water resembling milk ascends from them To the mountain Laphystion and the grove of Jupiter Laphystius from Coronea the distance is twenty stadia There is a stone statue of the god in this grove and they fay that when Athamas was about to sacrifice Phrixus and Helle here the sons of Jupiter sent a ram whose wool was golden upon the back of which they escaped Above this grove there is a place called Her cules Cbarops or the grey eyed and the B≈ otians fay that Hercules ascended here dragging up the dog of Hades O fee THE DESCRIPTION On descending from the mountain Laphystion to the temple of Minerva Itonia you will see the river Phalarus running into the lake Cephiffis Beyond the mountain La phystion is Orchomenus an illustrious and renowned Gre cian city which once arrived at the highest degree of feli city and which was destroyed by nearly the fame means at Mycene and Delos The following particulars are handed down to us respecting its ancient affairs They fay that Andreus the son of the river Peneus first of all dwelt in this place and that from him the country was denominated Andreis That Athamas becoming acquainted with him gave him all the country about the mountain Laphystion together with that region which is now called Coronea and Haliartia But Athamas being of opinion that he Ihould not leave any male children behind him because he called to mind his conduct when insane towards Lear chus and Melicerte Leiicon had died through disease and he was ignorant whether Phrixus was alive or had any children on this account he adopted Coronus and Ha liartus the sons of Thersander who was the son of Sisy phus for Athamas was the brother of Sisyphus How ever when Phrixus as some say or Presbon according to others who was the son of Phrixus by the daughter of √ ttes returned from the Colchi the sons of Ther sander gave up the kingdom of Athamas to Athamas and his progeny These therefore having received from Athamas a pnrt of the land built Haliartus and Coronea But prior to the return of these Evippe the daughter of Lcucon was given in marriage by Athamas to Andreus and by her he had Eteoclcs though it is reported by the citizens that Eteoclcs was the son of the river Cephisus Hence OF GREECE 81 Hence certain poets call Eteocles in their verses Cephi fiades This Eteocles when he began to reign suffered them to call the country from Andreus But lie instituted two tribes one of which he ordered to be called Cephi fiades and the other after his own name Eteoclea When Halmus too the son of Sisyphus came to him he gave him but a small part of the country for his portion and the towns were called Halmones from Halmus But in after times one town alone came to be called Halmones CHAP XXXV 1 H E B≈ otians too fay that Eteocles was the first that sacrificed to the Graces And indeed that he established three Graces they are well convinced j but they have lost the remembrance of the names which he gave them For the Lacedsemonians only worship two Graces tlie statues of which they fay were dedicated by Laced√ mon the son os Taygete who also gave them the names of Cleta and Phaenna These names indeed are very properly given to the Graces as likewise are those names which are assigned to the Graces by the Athenians For the Athenians have from ancient times venerated the Graces Auxo arid Hegemone And as to Carpus it is not a name of one of the Graces but of one of the Seasons But the Athenians worship the other of the Seasons together ‚ with Pandrosus arid call this diviriity Thalloie or the jkurijbing Indeed we how pray to three Graces having learnt that there are three from the Orchomenian Eteo cles Those too that have made statues of Bacchus have Vol III G place 2 THE DESCRIPTION placed three Graces in the hands of the god just al Angelion and Tect√ us have done to the Delphic Apollo And at Athens in the vestibule of the tower there are three Graces whose mysteries which are kept secret from the multitude are there celebrated But Pamphus is the first we are acquainted with that celebrated the Graces in verse  but he neither mentions their number nor their names Homer too makes mention of the Graces and fays that one of these is the wife of Vulcan and that her name is Charis He also fays that Sleep is the lover of the Grace Pasithea and in the speech of Sleep he has the following verse That flic my lov d one hall be ever mine The youngest Grace Pasithea the divine Hence some have suspected that Homer knew os other snore ancient Graces But Hesiod in the Theogony if that work be the com position of Hesiod fays that the Graces are the daughters of Jupiter and Eurynome and that their names are Eu phrosyne Aglaia and Thalia Onomacritus too in his verses gives them the fame names But Antimachus neither mentions the number nor the names of the Graces but only fays that they are the daughters of Aigle and the Sun Hermesianax the writer os elegies fays what no one before him ever asserted that Pitho or persuasion is one of the Graces But I have not been able to find who the first person was that either by a statue or picture re presented the Graces naked For the more ancient statues and pictures of the Graces have garments Thus among the Smyrnxans in the temple of the Nemefcs among the other statues there are Graces fashioned of gold which were OF GREECE 83 Vere made by Bupalus And in the Odeum there is a picture of a Grace which was painted by Apelles Among the Pergamenians too in the bed chamber of Attalus and in the temple which they call Puthion there are Graces which were painted by the Parian Pythagoras Besides all these Socrates the son of Sophroniscus made a sta tue os the Graces for the Athenians which is placed in the vestibule of their tower These are all in a similar manner clothed and I cannot tell for what reason men in aster times in their statues and pictures of the Graces represented them naked chap xxxvr On the death of Eteocles the kingdom came to the posterity of Halmus The daughters of this Halmus were Chrysogenea and Chryse It is reported thr t Phlegyas was the son of Mars by Chryse And Phlegyas reigned after Eteocles because Eteocles did not leave any male offspring behind him But at that time the name of the whole country was changed so that the region whkh was be fore denominated Andreis was then called Phlegyantis The city too Andreis was inhabited from the first to which Phlegyas added another called by his own name and collected into it the best of all the Grecian warriors The Phlegyans however in after times through their stupidity and boldness separated themselves from the other Orchomenians and led away at the fame time the neigh bouring people At length too they turned their arms against the temple of the Delphic Apollo in order to plunder  Ga it 4 THE DESCRIPTION Jt and when Philammon with a chosen band of ArglveJ came to assist the Delphi both he and his forces fell in the engagement which ensued That the Phlegyans in deed delighted in warlike affairs beyond the rest of the Greeks is evident from these line s of Homer in the Iliad respecting Mars and the son of Mars Terror From Thrace they fly call d to the dire alarms Of Warring Phlegyaris and Ephyrian arms 1 But in these verses he appears to me to call those that in habit the Thesprotian Epirus Ephyri However divinity nearly destroyed the race of the Phlegyans by continued thunder and violent earthquakes and those that were lest were destroyed by pestilence except a few that fled to Phocis But Phlegyas dying without children Chryses the son of Neptune by Chrysogenea the daughter of Halmus feigned after him The son of this Chryses was Minyas and from him the people that he governed are even at present called Miny√ So great was the tribute which was paid to this Minyas that he surpassed in wealth all those that reigned before him and was the first we are acquainted with among the Miny√ that built a treasury for the purpose of securing his riches And there are certain Greeks who have great knowledge in affairs of this kind by whom these treasuries are considered as more wonderful than those which their own country contains However the most illustrious historians who have given the most accurate account of the Egyptian pyramids have not made the least mention of the treasury of Minyas and the walls of Tiryns though they are equally worthy of admiration The son of this Minyas was Orchomenus and during his reign the city was called Orchomenes and the OF GREECE the people were denominated Orchomenians Yet the appellation of Miny√ still remains for the purpose of dis tinguishing these people from the Orchomenians in Ar cadia Orchomenus therefore reigning Hyettus came to him from Argos for this Hyettus was obliged to abandon his country on account of having murdered Molurus the son of Arisbas whom he had detected committing adul tery with his wife Orchomenus gave this Hyettus that part of the country which is about the village Hyettus and the land adjoining to it The author of the verses which the Greeks call the Great Eoe√ makes mention ¬ f Hyettus Hyettus when Arisbas son he found Molurus in the chamber of his wife Th adult rer slew and ftoin his country fled Argns the fertile nurse of gen rous steeds To Minyas son Orchomenus he came The exile then th heroic prince receiv d And nobly gave him of his realms a fliarc But it is evident that this Hyettus was the first that punished adultery For in after times Draco among the laws which he made for the Athenians relative to the punishment of unjust actions enacted that adultery should he severely punished The name too of the Miny√ arrived at such a degree of dignity that Neleus the son of Cre theus and king of Pylus married from Orchomenusa Aoris the daughter of Amphion the son of Hilasiust C H A P  ¬ 6 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XXXVH ThE race however of Halmus was destined to coma to an end For Orchomenus did not leave behind him any children  and in consequence of this the royal authority passed to Clymenus the son of Presbon and the grandson of Phrixus Erginus was the eldest son of this Clymenus j the next to him in age were Stratius Arrhon and Pyleus  but the youngest of all was Axeus Certain Thebans for a very trifling offence flew Clymenus during the cele bration of the festival of Onchestian Neptune this flight offence having roused them to vehement wrath Erginus as being the eldest son of Clymenus reigned after his father and immediately as he came to the throne having with the assistance of his brothers collected an army led his forces against Thebes vanquished the Thebans and afterwards made a treaty of peace with them On condition that they paid him an annual sum of money as a recom pense for the murder of Clymenus But when Hercules undertook to defend the Thebans then the Thebans were freed from this tribute and the Miny√ suffered greatly in war Hence Erginus who saw that his subjects were wearied in the extreme with the continuance of the war made a peace with Hercules and desirous that his king dom might recover its pristine opulence and felicity so much neglected every thing else to accomplish this that he arrived at extreme old age without ever having been married or had any children As soon however as he became rich he wished to have children and coming to Delphos in order to interrogate the god on this subject OF GREECE 87 he received the following oracle  OErginus son of Cly menus and grandson of Presbon thou earnest hither late inquiring after an offspring but even now add a pew top to the old tail of the plough In conformity therefore to the admonition of the ora cle Erginus married a young woman by whom he had Trophonius and Agamedes though it is said that Tropho nius was the son of Apollo and not of Erginus which indeed I can easily be persuaded to believe and this mult be the opinion of any one who goes to the oracle of Tro phonius They fay that these sons of Erginus as scon as they arrived at manhood became very skilful jn build ing temples for the gods and palaces for kings For they built the temple of Apollo in Dclphos and the treasury of Hyrieus In the wall of this treasury they placed one stone in such a manner that they could take it out when ever they pleased and in consequence of this they were perpetually carrying away some part of the deposited trea f sure This silled Hyrieus with astonishment as he found that the locks and seals had not been moved and yet the amount of his wealth was perpetually diminished On the vessels therefore in which his money was deposited he fixed traps or something of this kind by which any one that attempted to touch the money might be imme diately caught Hence Agamedes when he entered the treasury was held fast in the snare  and Trophonius fear ing lest when it was day his brother would be forced by torments to confess that he was his associate in the theft cut off the head of Agamedes After this Trophonius was swallowed up in an opening of the earth in the grove of Lebadea where there is a ditch which is called after Agamedes with a pillar raised ov r it Ascalaphus and G  laimenur 88 THE DESCRIPTION Ialmenus who are said to have been the sons of Mars by Astyoche the daughter of Actor the grand daughter of Axeus and the great grand daughter of Clymenus reigned over the Orchomenians Th e Orchomenians were led by these two against Troy partook of the expedition of the sons of Codrus to Ionia and being driven from their country by the Thebans recovered it again by the assistance of Philip the son of Amyntas A divine power how ever always caused their affairs to verge to an imbecil condition CHAP XXXVIII Among the Orchomenians there is a temple of Bac chus and a most ancient temple of the Graces They venerate in a most eminent degree certain stones which they fay fell from heaven and were taken up by Eteocles But the adorned statues or those which are artificially made and which are of stone were dedicated in my time The Orchomenians top have a fountain which deserves to be inspected  and into which they descend for the pur pose of drawing water But the treasury of Minyas is not inferior to any of the wonderful productions of Grecian art It is built of stone is of a round figure and its top does not raise itself to a very flmrp point They say that the topmost stone holds together the whole building There are likewise sepulchres here of Minyas and Hesiod and they fay that they came to possess the bones of Hefiod by the following means A pestilence once raging in their country to the destruction of men and caUle they sent 4 certain OF GREECE 89 certain persons who are called Speculators to the Delphic god who gave them an oracle signifying that they must bring the bones of Heliod from the Naupactian to the Or chomenian land and that this would be the only means of freeing them from their malady But upon their again inter rogating the god in what part of the Naupactian land the bones were deposited the Pythian deity answered them hat a crow would shew them As the messengers there fore were proceeding on their journey they saw not far from the road a crow sitting on a stone and in the hol low of this stone they found the bones of Hesiod with the following inscription on the tomb  The senile Ascra is the native land 0¬ Hesiod but the Miny√ fkill d to tame The warlike need his bones possess His fame Trtie wisdom s votaries of discernment nice Through all th Argolic land have widely spread With respect to Actxon a report is circulated among the Orchomenians that their land was injured by means of a spectre which sat on a stone and that on their con sulting the Delphic oracle about it they were ordered by the god to bury any remains of Actxon which they might happen to find and besides this to make a brazen image pf the spectre and fasten it with iron to the stone And this statue I have seen They perform too every year funeral sacrifices to Act√ on The temple of Hercules in which there is a statue not large is distant from Qrcho menus about seven stadia The fountains of the river Melan are in this place  and this river runs into the lake Cephiflis This lake occupies a great part of the Orcho rnenian land and during the winter through the vehe pent blowing of the south wind he water spreads over a con po THE DESCRIPTION a considerable part of the country The Thebans fay that the river Cephissus was turned by Hercules into the Orcho menian plains and that prior to this it ran into the sea under a mountain  hut that Hercules closed up the chasm Homer indeed knew of the lake Cephissis but he does not fay that it was the work of Hercules For thus he speaks concerning it Inclining o er the lake Cephiffis Nor is it probable that the chasm was not discovered by the Orchomenians and that Hercules by separating it restored to the river its ancient passage since even in the Trojan times they were in no want of money This is evident from what Homer represents Achilles saying in answer to the ambassadors of Agamemnon Not all the wealth Orchomenus receives It is clear from hence that the Orchomenians were sup plied with gTeat riches at that time But as they fay As plcdcn was then deprived of inhabitants through scarcity of water They add that the city was denominated from Aspledon who was the son of Neptune by the nymph Midea This account is confirmed by the verses which they fay were made by Cherfias the Orchomcnian Afpktlen in an ample city bern Fr m Neptune and th illustrious Mida sorting The verses however of this Cherfias are not now extant i and the above lines ere cited by Calippus in his oration on the Orchomeni ms They likewise assert that the epigram on the sepulchre of HeGod was composed by Cherfias CHAP OF GREECE CHAP XXXIX Th E Phocenses border on the Orchomenians in that part which is near the mountains but Lebadea borders on them in that part in which the plains arc situated This city was formerly built in the more elevated part of the country and was called Midea from the mother of Aspledon But when Lebadus came from Athens and settled here the inhabitants descended into the plains and from him the city was called Lebadea They neither however know who his father was nor on what account he came hither They only know that his wife was Nice This city is adorned in every respect similar to the most flourishing cities of Greece The grove of Trophonius is separated from it and they say that Hercyna playing in this place with the daughters of Ceres unwillingly let a goose fall out of her hands which afterwards fled into a Cavern and concealed itself under a stone that Proser pine came into the cavern and took the bird from under the stone and that in the place where she had moved the stone water burst forth which became a river denomi nated from this circumstance Hercyna Near the banks of this river there is a temple of Hercyna and in it there is a statue of a virgin holding a goose in her hands The fountains of the river are in the cavern torether with statues in an upright position and dragons are rolled round the sceptres of these statues Any one would be inclined to conjecture that these are the statues of √ scu lapius and Hygia but they may be the statues of Tro phonius 92 THE DESCRIPTION phonius and Hercyna as they arc of opinion that dragon are no less sacred to Trophonius than to √ sculapius Near the river too there is a sepulchre of Arcesilau They say that Leitus brought the bones of Arcesilaus from Troy But the most remarkable particulars in the grove are a temple of Trophonius and a statue which may be conjectured to be that of √ sculapius This statue was made by Praxiteles There is also a temple here of Ceres Europa and in the open air there is a temple of Jupiter Pluvius As you ascend to the place from which the oracle is given and pass on to the anterior part of the moun tain you will fee a temple of Proserpine the huntress and Jupiter the king This temple either through its magnitude or through unceasing wars was left half finiQied In another temple which stands here there are statues of Saturn Juno and Jupiter There is also in this place a temple of Apollo With respect to what per tains to this oracle when any one desires to descend into the ca e of Trophonius he must first take up his resii dence for a certain number of days in a building destined to this purpose This building is a temple of the Good Damon and of Guod Fortune While he stays here he pu rifies himself in other respects and abstains from hot baths The river Hercyna is used by him for a bath and he is well supplied with animal food from the vic tims which are sacrificed For he who descends hither sacrifices to Trophonius and his sons to Apollo Sa turn and Jupiter the king to Juno the rhariot drhi rt and to Ceres whom they call Europa and who they fay was the nurse of Trophonius A diviner in present to each of the sacrifices who inspects the entrails of th victims OF GREECE 93 victims and while he beholds them prophesies whether or not Trophonius will propitiously receive the person who consults him The other victims do not in a similar manner disclose the mind of Trophonius but each person who descends to him sacrifices on the night in which he de scends a ram in a ditch invoking at the fame time Aga medes They pay no regard to the former entrails even though they should be favourable unless the entrails of this ram are likewise auspicious And when it happens that the entrails thus correspond in signification then the person that wishes to consult Trophonius descends with good hope and in the following manner The facrificers bring him by night to the river Hercyna there they anoint him with oil and two boys belonging to the city each about thirteen years old and whom they call Mer curies wash him and supply him with every thing ne cessary He is not immediately after this led by the facrificers to the oracle but is first brought to the fountains of the river which are very near to each other Here he is obliged to drink of that which is called the water of Lethe that he may become oblivious of all the former objects of his pursuit Afterwards he must drink of another water which is called the water of Mnemosyne or memory that he may remember the objects which will present them selves to his view on descending into the grove Having therefore beheld the statue which they say was made by D√ dalus and which the priests never shew to any but those who desire to consult Trophonius performed cer tain religious ceremonies and prayed he proceeds to the oracle clothed in white linen begirt with fillets and having on his feet such flippers as arc worn by the na tives 94 THE DESCRIPTION tives of this place The oracle is above the grove iri 4 mountain and is inclosed with a wall of white stone whose circumference is very small and whose altitude is not more than two cubits Two obelisks are raised on this wall which as well as the zones that hold them to gether are of brass Between these there are doors and within the inclosure there is a chasm of the earth which was not formed by nature but was made by art and is excavated in according proportion with consummate ac curacy and kill The shape of this chasm resembks that of an oven Its breadth measured diametrically may be conjectured to be about sour cubits Its depth does not appear to me more than eight cubits There are not steps to its bottom but when any one designs to descend to Trophonius they give him a ladder which is both narrow and light On descending into this chasm be tween its bottom and summit there is a small cavern th¬ breadth of which is about two spans and its altitude apj pears to be about one span He therefore who descends to the bottom of this chasm lays himself down on the ground and holding in his hand sops mingled with honey first of all places his feet in the small cavern then hastens to join his knees to his feet and immediately after the reft of his body contracted to his knees is drawn within the cavern just as if he was hurried away by the vortex of the largest and most rapid river But those that have descended td the adytum of this place are not all instructed in the secrets of futurity in the fame manner For one obtains this knowledge by his sight and another by his hearing but all return through the fame opening and walk back wards as they return They fay no one that descended hers  OF GREECE 9 here ever died in the chasm except one os the spear bearers of Demetrius who would not perform any of the established religious ceremonies and who did not come hither for the purpose of consulting divinity but that he might enrich himself by carrying the gold and silver from the adytum It is also said that his dead body was thrown up by a different avenue and not through the sacred open ing Other reports are circulated about this man but those which I have mentioned appear to me to be the most remarkable When the person that descended to Trophonius returns the sacrisicers immediately place him on a throne which they call the throne of Mnemosyne and which stands not far from the adytum Then they ask him what he has either seen or heard and afterwards de liver him to certain persons appointed for this purpose who bring him to the temple of Good Fortune and the Good D√ mon while he is yet full of terror and with out any knowledge either of himself or of those that are near him Afterwards however he recovers the use of hij reason and laughs just the fame as before  write this not from hearsay but from what I have seen happen to others end from what I experienced myself when I consulted the mracle of Trophinius All too that return from Trophonius are obliged to write in a table whatever they have either heard or seen and even at present the shield of Aristp menes remains in this place the particulars respecting which I have already related CHAP  6 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XL T H E B≈ otians became acquainted with this oracle of which they were before entirely ignorant by the follow ing means In consequence of a great want of rain for the space of two years they sent Speculators from each city to Delphos These imploring a remedy against the drought which they laboured under the Pythian deity ordered to go to Trophonius in Lebaderij and find relief from him But when they came to Lebadea and could not find the oracle one Saon an Acraiphnian who waS the oldest of the Speculators happened to fee a swarm of bees and followed them to their hive Perceiving therefore that they flew into this chasm of the earth he followed them and by this means found the oracle which he sought They say that this Saon was instructed by Trophonius in all the sacred ceremonies belonging to this oracle Of the works of D√ dalus there are two among the B≈ otians  a statue of Hercules belonging to the Thebans and of Trophonius belonging to the Lebadenscs There are the fame number of wooden statues in Crete viz Britomartis in Olus and Minerva among the Gnoflians Befideu these too they have a representation of the dance of Ariadne which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad and this is made of white stone Among the Delians likewise there is a wooden statue of Venus not largo the right hand of which is decayed through length of rime r and this statue stands on a square figure instead of feet lam OF GREECE 9 I am persuaded that Ariadne received this statue from D√ dalus and that when she followed Theseus she took it along with her The Delians fay that Theseus when Ariadne was taken from him dedicated this wooden statue of Venus to the Delian Apollo that he might not by taking it home with him be reminded of his lost wife and by this recollection continually experience new tor ments of love I do not know that any other works of D√ dalus besides these remain For those works of his ‚ which the Argives dedicated in the temple of Juno and those which were brought to Gela in Sicily from Om phace have all been destroyed by time The Chxronenses are next to the Lebadenses The city of these people was formerly called Arne and they fay that Ame was the daughter of √ olus and that from her another city in Theflaly is denominated They add that the present name of the Ch√ ronenses was derived from Ch√ ron the son of Apollo by Thero the daughter of Phylas  and this is con firmed by the author of the poem called the Great Eoe√ in the following verses  In wedlock with Deiphile conjoin d Daughter of lolaus the renown d And in whole person godlike beauties shene Phylas in his august abodes begat A son mm d Ippotus with Thero fair In form resembling Phaebe 5 splendid light And Thero from Apollo Ch√ ron bore Of mighty strength and ikill d the steed to tame ‚ It appears to me too that Homer knew that Chxronea was called Lebadea but that he chose to denominate it by its ancient name ‚ in the fame manner as he calls the African river √ gyptus and not Nile Vol III H But o THE DESCRIPTION But among the Ch√ ronenses there are two trophies which were raised by the Romans and Sylla when they vanquished Taxilus and the army of Mithridates Philip however the son of Amyntas neither raised any trophy at Chxronca nor for any victories which he gained over cither Greeks or Barbawans For it was not an established custom with the Macedonians to leave trophies as monu ments cf their victories It is said too by the Macedo nians that Caranus when he reigned iii Macedonia having vanquished in battle Cisseus who governed the country bordering on the Macedonians raised a trophy after the manner of the Argives But they add that a lion rushing from Olympus threw down and destroyed the trophy That Caranus was conscious he had not acted prudently because by raising this trophy he had occasioned an irrecon cileablc enmity with his neighbours and that afterwards neither Caranus nor any of his successors raised a trophy that t ey might at some suture time attract to themselves the benevolence of the neighbouring people Alexander confirms the truth of this account because he neither raised a trophy for his victories over Darius nor for his conquest of the Indies Near this city there is a com mon sepulchre of those Thebans that fell in the engage ment against Philip There is no inscription on the tomb but a lion stands on it which may be supposed to signify the great vehemence os these men in fight But it ap pears to me that there is no inscription on the sepulchre because the D√ mon did not permit the consequences of thdv courage to be such as might be expected The Chx onc ins venerate above all die gods the sceptre which Homer says Vulcan made for Jupiter This sceptre Hermes OF GREECE 99 Hermes received from Jupiter and gave to Pelops Pe Jops left it to Atreus Atreus to Thyestes and from Thyestes it came to Agamemnon This sceptre too they denominate the spear and indeed that it contains some thing of a nature more divine than usual is evident from hence that a certain splendor is seen proceeding from it TheChaeroneans fay that this sceptre was found in the bor ders of the Panopeans in Phocis and together with it a quantity of gold  and that they cheerfully took the sceptre instead of the gold I am persuaded that it was brought by Electra the daughter of Agamemnon to Phocis There is nor however any temple publicly raised for this sceptre but every year the person to whose care this sacred sceptre is committed places it in a building destined to this pur pose and the people sacrifice to it every day and place near it a table full of all kinds of flesh and sweetmeats CHAP XLI Of all the works indeed of Vulcan which are cele brated by poets and praised by the rest of mankind this sceptre of Agamemnon is the only thing which deserves our belies For the Lycians who shew in Patar√ in the temple os Apollo a brazen bowl which they say was de dicated by Telephus and made by Vulcan are ignorant that the Samians Theodorus and Rhoecus were the first brass founders The Achaian Patrenses too pretend that the chest which Eurypylus brought from Troy was made by Vulcan but in reality they have no such chelt to sliew In Cyprus there is a city called Amathus j and H 2 la soo THE DESCRIPTION in it there is an ancient temple of Adonis and Venus They fay that in this temple there is a necklace which was given by Harmonia at first but that it came to be called the necklace of Eriphyle because she received it as a cist from her husband Afterwards the sons of Phegeus dedicated it at Delphi But how it came to these we have shewn in our account of the Arcadian affairs And last of all it was taken away by the Phoc√ an ty rants However it does not appear to me that the neck lace which the Amathufians possess in the temple of Adonis belonged to Eriphyle as this necklace in Ama thus is composed of green stones set in gold 5 and Homer in the Odyssey says that the necklace which was given to ‚ Eriphyle was made of gold ‚ There Eriphyle weeps who lonselv sold Hor lorJ her honour for the lust of gold And yet Homer was not ignorant that there are various kinds of necklaces For in the speeches of Eum√ us to Ulysses before the arrival of Telemachus from Pylus there are the following lines An artist to my father s palace came With gold and a nber chains elab rate frame And among the gifts which Penelope received from the suitors he fays that Eurymachus gave her a necklace A necklace rich with gold with amber gav That sliot effulgence like the solar rav Eurymachus presents But he does not fay that Eriphyle received a necklace varied with gold and stones So that it is probable that this sceptre is the only thing among all these that was made OF GREECE loic by Vulcan Above the city Chxronea there is a preci pice which is called Petrachos They are of opinion that Saturn was in this place deceived by Rhea when he swallowed a stone instead of Jupiter On the summit of the mountain there is a small statue of Jupiter In this part of Ch√ ronea the inhabitants make an ointment by boiling together roses lilies narcissuses and the herb iris orszvord grass  and this is a remedy against pain If in deed you anoint wooden statues with the ointment of roses you will preserve them from rottenness The iris grows in marshy places and is equal in size to the lily but its colour is not white and it does not emit so strong an odour as the lily BOOK ei THE DESCRIPTION BOOK X p h o e i c s CHAP I It is evident that that part of Phocis which is about Tithorea and Delphos received its appellation from the most ancient times from the Corinthian Phocus who was the son of Qrnytion Not many years however after when the √ ginet√ with Phocus the son of √ acus landed in these parts the whole country which remains at pre sent came to be called Phocis But the Phocenses that are opposite to Peloponnesus and those that dwell near Bceotia and border on the sea are situated between Cirrha a haven of the Delphi and the city Anticyra For the Locri Hypocnemidii who dwell beyond this part of Phocis prevent the Phocenses from settling near the sea which contains the Lamiacan bay The Scarphenses are beyond Elatea and beyond Hyampolis are the Abantes who in habit Opus and Cynus the haven of the Opuntians The most illustrious public transactions of the Phocenses are these  They engaged in the war against Troy  and led an army against the Thessalians prior to the irruption of the 2 Persian OF GREECE 103 Persians into Greece at which time they accomplished the following memorable exploit In that part of Hyam polis in which they were informed by their spies the Thassalian horse intended to attack them they dug up certain earthen urns aiul covering them with earth waited the approach of the enemy The Thessalians therefore being ignorant of the stratagem of the Pho censes drove their horses On the urns whose feet being by this means either entangled or broken their riders were thrown off and cut to pieces by the Phocenses But the Thesialians in consequence of this being more enraged with the Phocenses than before collected an army from all their cities and again attacked the Phocenses who were very much terrified both with the other warlike preparations of the Thesialians and particularly with the multitude of their horse because the Thesialians not only surpassed them in the number of their cavalry but in the art of managing their horses in war The PhocenCes therefore sent to Delphos and enquired of the god how they might avoid the impending danger And the messengers brought back the following oracle  I fliall cause a mortal and a god to contend with each other and I will give the victory to both and another victory to the mortal Ac soon as the Phocenses received this oracle they sent thre hundred chosen men led by Gelo against the enemy and ordered them as soon as it was night to watch in the most secret manner possible the motions of the Thesialians to return afterwards to their camps and not to engage unless they were forced to it The whole of this chosen troop together with its leader perished being trampled under foot by the Thessalian horses and slain by the enemy This slaughter occasioned H 4 such io4 THE DESCRIPTION such a terror in the camp of the Phocenses that they hastily collected together their wives children and all the property they were able either to drive or take away together with their apparel gold silver and statues of the gods After this they raised a very large funeral pile and lest with it thirty men whom they ordered to cut the throats of the women and children burn all the property that was collected on the funeral pile and afterward either murder each other or rush on the Theflalian horse if the Phocenses should happen to be vanquished in the engagement In consequence of this command all in human counsels came to be called by the Greeks Phodc desperation Immediately after this the Phocenses marched against the Thessalians choosing for the commander of their horse Rhoecus Ambryflensis and of their foot Da i phanes the Hyampolitan But he who held the most honourable place among the commanders was the Elean prophet Tellias in whom the Phocenses placed the hopes of their safety As scon therefore as the engagement began the Pho censes recollecting what they had determined respecting their wives and children perceived that their safety was very uncertain and for their fakes engaged in every kind of daring undertaking The signification too of the en trails gave them the highest reason to hope that the gods would be propitious to them And indeed they obtained a victory of the most splendid kind in consequence of which the oracle os Apollo which was given to the Pho censes was understood by all the Creeks For the private word was given at the fame time to eacli army to the Theisalians Minerva Itonia but to the Phocenses Phocus from whom they derived their name In consequence of having OF GREECE 105 having gained this victory the Phocenses sent gifts to the Dolphic Apollo viz a statue of the god and of Tellias who was at that time the prophet together with statues of the commanders and heroes of their own country And all these were made by the Argive Aristomedon The Phocen ses too after this were not wanting in subtility of invention For the camps of the enemy once happening to be fixed near the entrance to Phocis five hundred chosen men of the Phocenses as soon as the moon had completed her orb attacked the Thessalians in the night having rubbed their bodies over with plaster and likewise their armour which by this means became white They fay that at this time a great slaughter was made of the Thessalians who thought that what they saw in the night was some thing divine and not the result of the enemy s craft But it was the Elean Tellias who invented this stratagem against the Thessalians When the army too of the Per sians passed over into Europe it is said that the Phocenses were forced to join themselves to Xerxes  but that after wards they deserted the party of the Medes and fought on the side of the Greeks in the battle at Plat√ a CHAP II In after times however they were fined by the Am phictyons But I have not been able to find the true rea son of this event taking place whether it arose from the Phocenses having acted unjustly or whether the Thessa lians on account of their ancient hatred to the Phocenses were the occasion of their being fined But when they were io6 THE DESCRIPTION were in a very desponding condition through the mag¬ nitude of the fine Philomelas the son of Theotimus who was not inferior in nobility to any of the Pho cenfes and whoic country was Ledon a Phocic city shewed them that it was impossible for them to pay the fine and persuaded them to plunder the temple of the Delphic Apollo Amon¬ other arguments which he offered in order to effect this he informed them that the affairs of the Athenians and Lacedxmonians were in a condition very well adapted to the execution of this design and that if the Thebans or any other na tion should make war upon them they might easily van quish their enemies both by their own valour and the money which they would be enabled to expend This speech of Philomelus was favourably received by the mul titude of the Phocenfes whether some god perverted their understandings or whether these people naturally preferred gain to piety The Phocenfes therefore plundered the temple of Apollo when Heraclides governed the Delphi and Agathocles was the Athenian aichonj and in the fourth year of the one hundred and fifth Olympiad in which the Cyren√ an Prorus was victorious After this they collected together a very powerful army of merce nary soldiers and the Thebans openly declared war against them in consequence of being at variance with them prior to this event This war lasted for ten years and during the conti nuance of it the Phocenfes with their mercenary troops were sometimes victorious and this was often the cafe with the Thebans But an engagement taking place near she city Neon the Phocenfes were put to flight and in this flight Philwnelus hurled himsejf from a precipice OF GREECE 107 and by this means destroyed himself j and all that fol lowed him were punished by the Amphictyons with the fame kind of death After the death of Philomelus the Phocenfes gave the government to Onomarchus t but Philip the son of Amyntas joined himself to theThebans and in the engagement which ensued vanquished the enemy Onomarchus therefore flying to the sea was pierced to death by the arrows of his own soldiers who accused his timidity and ignorance in war as the causes of their having been vanquished And such was the end which the D√ mon gave to die life of Onomarchus The Pho cenfes after this invested his brother Phayllus with the supreme authority But he had scarcely begun his reign when he saw the following vision in a dream  Among the gifts sacred to Apollo there was an ancient brazen image of a man whose flesh had been consumed by disease and whose bones alone remained The Delphi fay that this was dedicated by Hippocrates the physician Phayllus in a dream saw himself resembling this image and immedi ately after was seized with a tabid disease which folfilled the prediction os his dream In consequence of this event  taking place the supreme authority was given to Pha l√ cus the son of Phayllus but he lost his kingdom through appropriating the sacred wealth to his own pri vate purposes After this he sailed to Crete with such of the Phocenfes as embraced his party and besieged with a band of mercenary troops the city Cydonia because the inhabitants would not pay him the money which he de manded He lost however in this siege a great part of his army and was himself slain CHAP joS THE DESCRIPTION S CHAP III In the tenth year after the temple was plundered Philip brought this war which is called Phocic and sacred to an end At that time Theophilus was the Athenian archon and it was the first year of the one hundred and eighth Olympiad in which the Cyren√ an Polycles was victor in the stadium The following Phociean cities were then taken and levelled with the ground viz Lilaea Hyampolis Anticyra Parapotamii Panopeus and Daulis The names of these cities were renowned in former times and afe celebrated in no small degree in the poems of Homer But the Phoc√ an cities Erochus Charadra Amphiclea Neon Tethronium and Drym√ a which were burnt by the army of Xerxes became through this cir cumstance more known to the Greeks All the other cities except Elatea were obscure prior to this war viz the Phocic Thracis Medeon Phocicus Echedamia Ara brysus Ledon Phlygonium and Sterrhis All these cities which we have enumerated were then destroyed and ex cept Abas were reduced to the form of villages For the Ab√ ans were free from the impiety of the other cities and had neither plundered the temple of Apollo nor en gaged in the war The Phoccnses too are forbidden the use of the Delphic temple are not admitted as members of the general assembly of the Greeks aud the Amphic tyons have taken from them the privilege of voting and transferred it to the Macedonians Some time after this the Phocrean cities were rebuilt and the Phocenses rc i turned OF GREECE 109 turned from their villages to their pristine habitations We must however except those cities which by reason of their imbecility from the first and their indigence at that time could not be rebuilt The Athenians and The bans prior to the loss of the Greeks at Chacronca were the leaders of this restoration The Phocenses likewise partook of the engagement at Ch√ ronea and afterwards at Lamia and Cranon sought against Antipater and the Macedonians They opposed too the Gauls and the Celtic army with greater alacrity than the rest of the Greeks that they might revenge the injury which had been offered to the Delphic Apollo and as it appears to me that they might apologize for their pristine guilt And such arc the memorable transactions of the Phocenses C H A P IV t ROM Chxronca there is a road of twenty stadia in length which leads to Pancpeus a city of the Phocenses if it be proper to call that a city in which there is neither a governor nor a gymnasium nor a theatre nor a forum nor lastly any fountain of water The inhabitants dwell in wooden houses resembling the cottages in mountains and these are situated near a chasm made by a torrent They have boundaries too which separate them from their neighbours and they send members to the Phocic convention They fay that their city was denominated from the father of Epeus and that they were at first the Phlegyse and fled to Phocis from theOrchomenians I have seen the ancient inclosure of Panopea which I conjecture is no THE DESCRIPTION is about seven stadia in circumference While I was sur veying it those verses of Homer respecting Tityus came into my mind in which he calls the city of the Pano peans Callichoros or delighting in the dance I likewise re collected that in the contest for the dead body of Pa troclus he fays that Schedius the son of Iphitus and king of the Phocenses who was slain by Hector dwelt in Panopeus It appears to me that the cause of his dwelling here was his fear of the B≈ otians for Phocis in this part is very much exposed to the attacks of the B≈ otians and that he used Panopeus as a place of defence I was iot however able to conjecture why Homer called Pano peus Callichoros till I learnt the reason from those Athe nians who are called Thyades These Thyades are Attic women who every year come to Parnassus and together with Delphic women celebrate the orgies of Bacchus It is an established custom with the Thyades to form choirs in the road from Athens in other places and among the Panopcans Homer therefore by the appellation Panopeus appears to signify the choir of the Thyades In the public road of the Panopeans there is a building of crude tiles and in it a statue of Pentelican stone which some say is the statue of √ sculapius and others of Pro metheus These last think their opinion is confirmed from hence  Near the chasm formed by the torrent there are stones of such a magnitude that each is sufficient to load a cart These stones are of the colour of clay yet not of such clay as is dug out of the earth but of such as is found among the gravel of rivers and torrents These stones too smell very much like a human body  and they say that these are the remains of that clay from which the whole race of mankind was fashioned by Prometheus In OF GREECE m In the same place viz near the chasm os the torrent there is a sepulchre of Tityus and the circumference of the heap of earth which forms his tomb is about one third of a Radium But of Tityus it h said in the Odyssey There Tityus large and long in fetters bound O erspreads nine acres of infernal ground 1 They fay that this verse does not allude to the magnitude of Tityus but to the place in which he lies buried and which is nine acres in extent But Cleon one of those Magnesians that dwell about Hermus fays that things of a very wonderful nature must be incredible to those who during the whole course of their life never beheld any thing which surpasses the conceptions of the vulgar He adds that he is persuaded both Tityus and others were really as large as they are reported to have been For fays he I once went to Gades and sailed with all the company of my attendants from that island agreeably to the command of Hercules But afterwards returning to Gades I found a marine man thrown up on the shore who had been burnt by lightning and whose magnitude Wa not less than five acres But Df ulis is about seven stadia distant from Panopeus This city does not contain many inhabitants but those which it does contain surpass all the Phocenses in mag nitude and strength of body They fay that the city was denominated from the nymph Daulis who was the daughter of Cephissus It is also said by others that the place where the city stands was formerly full of trees and that the ancients called Things dense or dose daula Hence fay they √ schylus calls the beard of Glaucus Anthe  m THE DESCRIPTION Anthedonius daubs or thick In this city the women are said to have feasted Tereus with the body of his son  and the polluted tables of mankind originated from hence But the hoopoop into which they fay Tereus was changed is a bird not larger than a quail and has wings on its head which resemble crests It is a wonderful circum stance that in this country swallows neither breed nor lay eggs nor build their nests on the roofs of houses The Phocenses fay that when Philomela was changed into a bird she flew from the country of Tereus through fear of him But the Daulienscs have a temple of Minerva in which there is an ancient statue of the goddess It likewise contains a more ancient wooden statue which they fay Procne brought from Athens A place called Thronius forms a part of the Daulian land and in this place there is an heroic monument dedicated to that hero from whom the people here derived their origin Some fay that this hero was Xanthippus a man of no obscure reputation in warlike affairs but others are of opinion that he was Phocus the son of Ornytion and the grand son of Sisyphus This hero they venerate every day and after they have slain the victims which they sacrifice to him they pour the blood through a hole into the se pulchre and consume the entrails in the fame place There is an eminence in Daulis by which you may ascend to the summits of mount Parnassus This road is longer but not so difficult as that at Delphos which leads to the fame summits CHAP OF GREECE CHAP V On again turning from Daulis and proceeding in a straight line to Delphos you will fee on the left hand a building which they call Phocicon and into which the Phocenfes from each of their cities assemble This build ing is very large  and in it there are pillars placed accord ing to its length From the pillars too there are steps to each of its walls and on these steps the Phocenfes fit when they assemble But near the extremity of the build ing there are neither pillars nor steps There is how ever here a statue of Jupiter sitting on a throne and on his right hand there is a statue of Juno and on his left of Minerva Proceeding from hence you will arrive at a road which they call Schifte or cut and in this road Oedipus murdered his father Indeed every part of Greece contains some monument of the calamities of Oedipus For as soon as he was born his parents bored the soles of his feet and exposed him on the mountain Cithasron belonging to the Plat√ cnfes Corinth and the country about the Isthmus educated him Phocis and the road Schiste were polluted with his father s blood And the Thebans are rendered infamous by the mar riages of Oedipus aud the base conduct of Eteocles Howevcr the daring action of Oedipus in the road Schiste was tthe origin of all his calamities The sepulchres of and the servants that followed him are in the middle of a place where three roads meet and select stones are piled in a heap over them They fay that Darnisistratus when he reigned over the Platseenfes met Vol III I with U4 THE DESCRIPTION with these dead bodies and buried them There is a public road steep and difficult to a light armed soldier which leads from hence to Dclphos Many things indeed are reported of the Delphi and particularly concerning the oracle of Apollo For they fay that this oracle is the most ancient of any on the earth that Daphne was chosen by Earth priestess of the oracle and that she was one of the nymphs that inhabit mountains But the Greeks have a piece of poetical composition which they call Eumolpra and the author of which they say was Mus√ us the son of Antiophemus In this poem it is asserted that there is an oracle in common of Nep tune and Earth that Earth delivered her oracles from her own mouth  but that Neptune had Pyrcon for his in terpreter The verses respecting this affair are these From her own mouth Earth utter d prudent words But Pyrcon was illustrious Neptune s priest They fay that afterwards Earth gave her part of the oracle to Themis but Themis to Apollo and that Apollo re ceived the other part from Neptune in return for which he gave Neptune the island Calaurea which is situated be fore Trcezen I have also heard it asserted that certain shep herds who once happened to come to the oracle became divinely inspired from the vapour of the earth and pro phesied through the influence of Apollo But Phemonoe arrived at the highest degree of celebrity as being the first prophetess of the god and the first that fang an hexameter verse Boeo a woman who was a native of Dclphos and who composed a hymn for the Delphi says that both others that came from the Hyperboreans and Olen built a place for the oracle of Apollo j and that Olea  OF GREECE 115 Olen was the first who prophesied at Delphos and de livered oracles in hexameter verses The following are the verses of Boeo Here Pagafus Agyicus the divine From th Hyperboreans Ph≈ bus rais d to thee A building for thine oracle renovvn d And after she has enumerated other Hyperboreans to wards the end of the hymn she mentions Olen Olen the first who Ph≈ bus will disclos d The first who verses of the ancients fung If we follow tradition however women alone were the first interpreters of oracles They farther report that the most ancient temple of Apollo was raised from the laurel tree and that the branches from which it was built were cut from that tree which is at Tempe The form of this temple resembled that of a cottage But the Delphi say that the other temple of Apollo was raised by bees from wax and wings and was sent by Apollo to the Hyperboreans There is like wise another report concerning chis affair that a Delphos man whose name was Pteras built this temple and that from this circumstance the temple came to be called by the name of its artificer From this fame Pteras too a Cretan city with the addition of one letter was denomi nated Apterxi I cannot however be induced to be lieve that this temple was framed from a herb Pteris or fern which grows on mountains and this while the herb was yet green But with respect to the third temple the report that it was built of brass is by no means wonder ful since Acrisius made a brazen bed chamber for his daughter and even at present there is a temple of Mi I 2 nerva n6 THE DESCRIPTION ncrva among the Laced√ monians which from its being built of brass is called Chalkioicos Among the Romans too there is a forum which is admirable both for its mag nitude and ornaments and which has a brazen roof So that it is not improbable that there may have been a brazen temple of Apollo As to the rest the relations are doubtless sabulous either that this temple was built by Vulcan or that golden virgins fang in it which is asserted by Pindar as follows Suspended from the roof there golden virgins fang It appears to me that Pindar invented this fable in imita tion of what Homer fays respecting the Sirens But nei ther do I find that the fame accounts are given of the de struction of this temple Some fay it fell into an opening of the earth but according to others it was destroyed by fire The fourth temple of Apollo is said to have been built of stone by Trophonius and Agamedes and this was burnt when Erxiclides was the Athenian archon and in the first year of the fifty eighth Olympiad in which Diognetus Crotoniatcs was victor But the temple which exists at present was raised by the Aniphictyons out of their sacred money  and its architect was the Corinthian Spintharus CHAP VI They lay too that a most ancient city was built here by Parnassus who was the son of the nymph Cleodora And just the fame as with respect to others that are called heroes  OF GREECE 117 heroes they fay that his fathers were of the gods Nep tune and of men Cleopompus and that from him the mountain Parnassus and the thicket Parnasiia were deno minated They farther add that prophecy by the flight of birds was invented by this Parnassus but that the city which he built was destroyed by the rain which fell in the times of Deucalion that such men as were able to fly from the storm followed the howlings of wolves and with wild beasts for their guides escaped to the summits of Parnassus ‚ and that from this circumstance they called the city which they built there Lycorea There is like wise another report different from this that Lycorus was the son of Apollo by the nymph Corycia that from him the city was called Lycorea but that the cavern was de nominated Coryciun from the nymph It is also said that Cel√ no was the daughter of Hyamus the son of Ly corus and that Apollo had by her a son Delphos from whom the present name of the city was derived Others again fay that one Castalius a native of this city had a daughter whose name was Thyia and who was the first that officiated as priestess to Bacchus and celebrated the orgies of the god That from her those afterwards that were agitated with Bacchic fury came to be called Thyiadai Hence they are of opinion that Delphos was the son of Apollo and Thyia But according to others his mother was Mel√ ne the daughter of Cephissus Some time after this not only the neighbouring people called the city Delphos but likewise Pytho as is evident from the verses of Homer in his catalogue of the Pho censes Those however who are much conversant with genealogies fay that Py this was the son of Delphos and that from him while he reigned here the city was denomi 13 rated n8 THE DESCRIPTION nated There is a report too among the vulgar that a certain inhabitant of this place was pierced with the ar rows of Apollo and that on this account the city was called Pytho because at that time things which putrefied were said p uthejlhaiy which means to become rotten Hence Ho mer fays that the island of the Sirens was full of bones because men that heard their song eputhotito i e became rotten With respect to the animal that was slain by Apollo the poets fay it was a dragon to whom Earth had committed the custody of the oracle It is also said that Crius when he reigned in Euboea had a son of a very in solent disposition who plundered the temple of Apollo and the dwellings of the rich But when he was about to plunder them a second time with a band of robbers the Delphi fuppliantly implored Apollo to preserve them from the impending danger and Phemonoe who was at that time the prophetess answered them in hexameter verses to this effect   In a short time Phoebus will pierce with his arrows a man the destroyer of Parnassus  but the Cretans shall purify their hands from the slaughter and the fame of die dead shall never perish CHAP VII It appears indeed that the temple in Delphos was from the first often plundered by the sacrilegious For after the Eubocan of whom we have just spoken the na tion of the Phlegyans and Pyrrhus the son of Achilles plundered it After these again it was robbed hy a part of the forces of Xerxes by the most powerful persons among OF GREECE 119 among the Phocenses who enriched themselves the most of all others and for the longest time with the treasures of the god and by the army of the Gauls And last of all this temple could not escape the impiety of Nero who took away from hence five hundred brazen images which were partly statues of the gods and partly of men They relate that a most ancient contest was established here which consisted in singing a hymn in honour of Apollo and that he who first conquered in singing was the Cretan Chrysothemis whose father Carmanor is said to have pu rified Apollo Philammon was the next that was victo rious after Chrysothemis  and Thamyris the son of Phi lammon conquered after his father They fay that Or pheus was unwilling to engage in this contest by reason of the dignity of his composition relative to the mysteries and that elevation of foul which he acquired by his other productions and that Mus√ us would not engage in it through his imitation of Orpheus in every respect They fay too that Eleuther bore away the Pythian palm through speaking with a loud and sweet voice as he was not able to sing the song which he had composed They likewise farther relate that Hesiod was not permitted to contend because he had not learned to accompany his harp with his voice but that Homer came to Delphos for the purpose of consulting what was necessary to be done though even if he had learnt to play on the harp his art would have been of no use to him through the loss of his sight In the third year of the forty eighth Olympiad in which Glaucias the Crotonian was victor the Amphic tyons instituted games in which there was singing to the harp as at first and to which they added singing to the pipe and playing on the pipe without singing Cephalen I 4 the 120 THE DESCRIPTION the son of Lampus was proclaimed victor on the harp Areas Echembrotus in singing to the pipe and the Argivc Sacadas in playing on the pipe without singing The fame Sacadas too was twice victorious after this in the Pythian games And at that time the fame con test were instituted as in the Olympic games except the contest with four horses It was likewise established by law that boys should contend in the long race and in the twofold course After this Pythian games were insti tuted in which a crown alone was the object of conten tion and in which singing to the pipe was rejected as not being pleasing to the car For elegies and funernl dirges are accommodated to the melody of pipes The sacred offering of Echembrotus confirms what 1 have said for he dedicated in Thebes a brazen tripod to Hercules with this inscription Echembrotus Arcas dedicates this statue to Hercules in consequence of having BEEN VICTORIOUS rN THE CONTESTS OF THE AmPHIC TYONS AND THIS BY SINGING AMONG THE GREEKS songs and elegies This was the reason therefore why the contest of singing to the pipe ceased After wards they added horse races and Clisthenes the Sicyo nian tyrant was victorious in the chariot race In the eighth Pythiad the contests of those who play on the harp but do not accompany it with their voice were instituted and in this contest Agelaus Tegeates was victorious In the twenty third Pythiad the armed course was esta blished and in this Tim√ nctus tiie Phliasian received the laurel crown in five Olympiads after which Demaratus Hencensis was victorious In the forty eighth Pythirul the contest with the two yoked car was adopted and iu this the car of Execestides the Phocenlian was victorious j But OF GREECE 121 But in the fifth Pythiad from this they ran with colts joined to the car and in this the sour colts of the Theban Orphondas gained the victory They instituted however many years after the Eleans the pancratium among boys the car drawn by two colts and the vaulting horse for they instituted the pancratium in the sixty first Pythiad and in this the Theban Laidas was victorious but one Pythiad after this they established the course with the vaulting colt and in the sixty ninth Pythiad the car drawn by two colts And with the vaulting colt indeed the Lariss√ an Lycormas was victorious but the Macedo nian Ptolemy with the two yoked car For the Egyptian kings willingly suffered themselves to be called Macedo nians as indeed they were But it appears to me that the laurel crown was given as the reward of victory in the Pythian games for no other reason than because accord ing to report Daphne the daughter os Ladon was beloved by Apollo CHAP VIII It is said that the first Grecian Sunedrion or place of association was raised here by Amphictyon the son of Deucalion and that from him those who assembled here were called Amphictyons But Androtion in his Attic history fays that all the inhabitants bordering on the Delphi came from the first to Delphos and formed there an assembly and that the members of this convention were called in process of time Amphictyons They fay too that the following Grecian people were collected into this assembly by Amphictyon viz the Ionians Dolopians Theslalians 122 THE DESCRIPTION Theflalians √ nianians Magnet√ Maleenses Phthiotsc Dorienses Phocenses and the Locrians that border on Phocis and dwell under the mountain Cnemis But when the Phocenses plundered the temple and in the tenth year when the war was finished the Sunedrion of the Amphictyons was changed for the Macedonians were admitted into this assembly and the nation of the Pho censes and the Doric Laced√ monians ceased to become members of it the former on account of their sacrilegious conduct 5 and the latter because they assisted the Pho censes in war and were for this obliged to pay a fine But when Brennus led an army of Gauls to Delphos the Phocenses fought against them with an alacrity superior to that os the other Greeks and in consequence of this again partook of the assembly of the Amphictyons and recovered all their ancient dignity Afterwards the Em peror Augustus was willing that the Nicopolitans at Actium should likewise partake of this assembly He therefore ordered the Magnet√ Maleenses √ nian√ and Phthiotx to join themselves to the Thessalians and transferred the suffrages of these people and the Dolopians to the Nicopolitans The Amphictyons in my time were thirty in number Nicopolis Macedonia and the Thes salians had each of them two Among the B≈ otians for these formerly were a part of Thessaly and were called the √ olenses there were two So likewise the Phocenses and the Delphi had each of them two and the ancient Doric land had one The Locri too who are called Cbiolie ard those who are beyond Eubcca send each of them one and the Eubccenses and the Athenians each fend one The cities indeed Delphos and Nicopolis fend members to the assembly of the Amphictyons and are pre sent OF GREECE  123 sent at every asiembly but each of the other nations we have enumerated only joins this convention at stated periods On coming into the city you will fee temples in a con r tinued series The first of these is in a ruinous condition the second is without statues the third has images of the Roman emperors but these are not numerous 5 and the fourth is called the temple of Minerva Pronoia But of the statues which are in the vestibule of this temple there is an offering of the Maflilienfes which is larger than the statue within the temple These Maflilienfes are a co lony of the Phocaenses and a part of those Ionians who in order to avoid Harpagus the Mede fled from Phoccea Having however vanquiflied the Carthaginians in a naval battle they took possession of that country which they now inhabit and arrived at a high degree of prosperity The offering too of the Maflilienfes is brazen But the Delphi fay that the golden shield which was dedicated by Cr≈ sus the Lydian king to Minerva Pronoia was taken away by Philomelus Near this temple of Minerva there is an heroic grove of Phylacus According to the Delphi this Phylacus assisted them when they were at tacked by the Persians But in that part of the gymna sium which is in the open air they fay a wild boar was once born that Ulysses when he was going to Auto lycus hunted this boar together with the sons of Auto lycus and that he was wounded by it on the knee On turning to the left hand from the gymnasium and de scending not more as it appears to me than three stadia you will fee the river Plisius This river runs into Cirrha a haven of the Delphi and the sea which is in that part But on ascending from the gymnasium to the femple you will see on the right hand of the road the water 124 THE DESCRIPTION water os Castalia which is sweet to the taste They say that a woman a native of this place gave a name to the fountain but some are of opinion that it was denomi nated by a man whose name was Castalius Panyashs however the son of Polyarchus fays in the verses which he composed on Hercules that Castalia was the daughter of Achelous For thus he speaks concerning Hercules With rapid sect Parnassus snow v top He left behind and to Castalia stream Immortal AchcIouV daughter came I have likewise heard it asserted that this water of Cas talia is the gift of the river Cephissus AIcxus indeed fays this in the introduction of his hymn to Apollo and this is confirmed by the Lil√ enses who report that when on stated days they throw into the fountain of Cephissus cattle belonging to their country and other things according to established rites they are again seen in the river Castalia The city of the Delphi in every part rises to a steep and the sacred inclosure of Apollo has the fame situation with the city This temple is very large and stands in the upper part of the city and pas sages in a continued series cut one another through the temple CHAP IX I SHALL now give an account of those sacred offer ings which appear to me to merit description in the most eminent degree For I shall not make any mention of those athlet√ and contending musicians who are of no great estimation and as to those athlet√ that have left be hind  OF GREECE 125 hind them a great reputation the reader will find an ac count of them in my Eliacs Phayllus however the Cro tonian is not among the number of these because he was not victorious in the Olympic games but he was twice victorious in the quinquertium and once in the stadium of the Pythian games The fame person too fought against the Persians in a naval battle furnishing for this purpose a ship of his own and manning it with such of the Crotonians as were then travelling about Greece There is a statue of him among the Delphi and such are the particulars respecting this Crotonian On entering into the grove you will fee a brazen bull which was made by Theopropus √ ginetes and was the gift of the Corcyrxans It is said that a bull once in Corcyra having left the oxen his companions and the pastures in which he fed came near the sea and lowed that in consequence of his doing the fame every day the herdsman went to the sea side and beheld an almost infinite number of tunny fishes and that when he had informed the Corey rseans of this circumstance they on endeavouring to catch these fishes but without success sent speculators Theoroi to Delphos In compliance therefore with the mai late of the oracle they sacrificed a bull to Neptune and immediately after the sacrifice caught the fishes Hence they sent both to Olympia and Delphos a tenth part of the value of what they caught as a sacred of fering After this the gifts of the Tegcatx from the spoils of the Laced√ monians follow viz Apollo and Victory heroes natives of their country Callisto the daughter of Lycson Areas from whom a country was denominated  the sons of Areas viz Aphidas and Azan j and together with these Triphylus whose mother was 126 THE DESCRIPTION not Erato but Laodamea the daughter of Amyclas king of the Laced√ monians They also dedicated Erafus the son of Triphylus But with respect to the artificers of these statues Apollo and Callisto were made by Pausanias the Apollonian Victory and the image of Areas by D√ dalus the Sicyonian Triphylus and Azah by Areas Samolas and Elatus Aphidas and Erafus by the Argive Antiphanes These statues the Tegeat√ sent to Dtelphos in consequence as having made the Laced√ monians captives who made hostile incursions on their borders Opposite to these arc the offerings which the Laced√ monians dedicated when they vanquished the Athenians viz the Dioscuri Jupiter Apollo Diana and together with these Neptune and Lysander the son of Aristocretus receiving a crown from Neptune There are besides Abas who prophesied to Lysander and Hermon who was the pilot of Lysander 9 pr√ torian sliip Thcocofmus the Mtgarensian made this statue of Hermon when he was ranked among the citi zens of the Megarenses But the Dioscuri were made by the Argive Antiphanes The prophet Abas was made by Pauson from Calaurea belonging to the Troezenians Damias made Diana Neptune and Lysander and Athe nodorus Apollo and Jupiter Both these artists were Ar cadians from Clitov Behind the statues which we have just mentioned the statues of those men are placed who alsisted Lysander in the battle at √ gospotamos and who were either Spartans or the allies of the Spartans And these ave as follow Aracus and Erianches the former a Laced√ monian and the latter a B≈ otian from Mimas After these Astycrares Cephisocles Hermophantus Hici sius Chians 1 imarchus and Diagoras Rhodians Theo damas  OF GREECE 127 dam us the Cnldian Cimmerius the EpheGan √ antides the Milesian succeed All these were made by Tisander These that follow were made by Alypus the Sicyonian viz Theopompus the Midean Cleomedes the Samian from Eub≈ a Aristocles the Carystian Autonomus the Eretrienfian Aristophantus the Corinthian Apollodorus the Troezenian and from Epidaurus in the borders of the Argives Dion Next to these are the Achaian Axio nicus from Pellene Theares from Hermione Pyrias from Phocis Conon from Megara Agimenes from Sicyon Pythodotus the Corinthian Telecrates the Leucadian and Euantidas from Ambracia Lad of all follow the Laced√ monians Epicyridas and Eteonicus They fay that these were made by Patrocles and Canachus But the Athenians affirm that the loss which they suffered at √ gospotamos happened to them unjustly in consequence of the commanders of their army being bribed For they fay that Tydeus and Adimantus received presents from Lyfander and in proof of this they adduce the following Sibylline oracle  And then shall high thundering Ju piter who possesses the greatest strength severely afflict the Athenians for he will bring war and destruction on their ships which will perish through the fraudulent con duct of their commanders They likewise produce the fol lowing testimony from the oracles of Mus√ us  A mighty storm shall burst on the Athenians through the baseness of their leaders but they will be consoled for heir mis fortune by subverting the city of their enemies and avenging the loss which they sustained And thus much concerning tlii affair But the lame Sibyl predicted that the event of the engagement which tock place between the Laced√ monians anj Argives above Thyrea would be doubtful 128 THE DESCRIPTION doubtful The Argives however being of opinion that they should vanquish their enemies sent a brazen horse to the statue os Durius at Delphos and this horse was rnade by the Argive Antiphanes CHAP X On the basis under this horse there is an inscription which signifies that statues were dedicated here from the ‚ tenth of the spoils of the battle at Marathon These sta tues are Minerva and Apollo and of the commanders Miltiades But of those that are called heroes Ercchtheus Cecrops and Pandion Celeus likewise and Antiochus the son of Hercules by Midea the daughter of Phylas ro  gether with √ geus ‚ and of the sons of Theseus Acamas These in consequence of a Delphic oracle gave names to the Athenian tribes Here too there arc statues of Codrus the son of Melanthus Theseus and Phyleus who were not ranked among the surnames All these statues were made by Phidias and are in reality the tenths of the Marathouian battle Afterwards they sent Antigonus and his son Demetrius and the Egyptian Ptolemy to Delphos the latter on account of their benevolence towards him and the two former through fear Other gifts of the Argives may be seen not far from this horse viz those lenders who together with Polynices warred on Thebes Adrastus the son of Talaus and Ty deus the son of Oencus the grandsons likewise of Proe tus together with Capancus the son of Hipponous and Eteocles the son of Iphis and besides these Polynices and Ilippomcdcn who was the son of the sister of Adras tus OF GREECE 129 tus Amphiaraus too is dedicated here with his chariot which is placed near him Baton stands in this chariot who was the charioteer of Amphiaraus and at the fame time allied to him by his birth The last of these is Alitherfes The artificers of all these were Hypatodorus and Aristogiton and they fay that the Argives dedicated them out of the spoils of the victory which through the assistance of the Athenians they gained over the Laced√ monians in Oenoe an Argive city It appears to me too that the Argives dedicated out of the fame spoils the images of those who are called by the Greeks Epigonoi or posterior sons For statues of these are placed here viz Sthenelus and Alcm√ on who in my opinion was honoured above Amphilocus on account of his age To these are added Promachus Thersander √ gialeus and Diomed Euryalus too stands between Diomed and √ gialeus Opposite to these there are other statues which were dedicated by the Argives when they assisted Epami nondas the Theban general in restoring the Messenians There are likewise images here of heroes viz king Da naus who arrived at the highest degree of power and wealth in Argos Hypermnestra because she was the only ‚ one of his daughters that had pure hands and near her Lynccus and all those who derive their origin from Her cules and still higher from Perseus There are besides brazen horses of the Tarentines and captive women which the Tarentines sent in consequence of having con quered the Mcssapians who are a barbarous nation bor dering on the Tarentines and these are the works of the Argive Ageladas The Laced√ monians indeed colo nized Tarentum under the command of the Spartan Phalanthus whoj when he was feat on this errand was Vol III K told i3o THE DESCRIPTION told by a Delphic oracle that when he should see rain falling from a serene sky he would then possess a land and city But as he was not able by himself to discover the meaning os the oracle and did not consult any inter r preter he sailed with a fleet to Italy Here having conr quered the Barbarians but neither obtaining any land or city he recollected the oracle and was of opinion that the god had predicted that which could not be accom plished  as it appeared to Iv m impossible that there mould be rain when the sky was clear and serene His wife however when he was in a desponding condition for he had returned home endeavoured to console him by her endearing officiousness and as she was once support ing his head on her knees and freeing it from vermin through a benevolent concern for the adverse situation of his affairs she began to weep ‚ and her tears as she wept abundantly fell on the head of her husband who then perceived the meaning of the oracle for his wife s name was √ thra which is the Greek word for a strent Jiy On the following night therefore he took Tarentum a great and most flourishing maritime city of the Barbarians They fay indeed that the hero Taras was the son of Neptune by a nymph a native of Tarentum and that from the hero both a city and river are denominated Taras C H A P XI Near the sacred offering of the Tarentines there is a treasury of the Sicyonians but there are neither any riches in this nor in any other treasury The Gnidii likewise OF GREECE 131 likewise brought statues to Delphos viz Triopas who built Gnidus standing by a horse Latona Apollo and Diana piercing Tityus with their arrows whose body is represented wounded These stood near the treasury of the Sicyonians The Siphnii too made a treasury on the following account The island Siphnos had gold mines  and they were ordered by Apollo to fend a tenth of the produce of these mines to Delphos in consequence of which they built a treasury and sent with it a tenth of the produce of their mines Afterwards however through their immoderate desire of accumulating wealth they ne glected to send the tenth of their riches to Delphos and in consequence of this their gold mines were destroyed by an inundation of the sea The Lipar√ i likewise have dedicated statues here for a naval victory which they gained over the Tyrrheni These Lipar√ i were a colony of Gnidians who as we are informed by the Syracufah Antiochus the son of Xenophancs in his Sicilian history were colonized by a Gnidian whose name was Pentathlus This historian adds that the Gnidians being driven from that city which they had built at Pachynum a promon tory of Sicily by the Elynii and Ph≈ nicians either took possession of desert islands or drove the inhabitants out of the islands on which they landed and these in con formity to the verses of Homer they call at present the islands of √ olus In Lipara one of these islands they built a city but they sailed to Hiera Strongyle and JDidym√ for the purpose of cultivating the land in theso places It is evident th t in Stronpyle sire rises out of the ground and in Hiera fire spontaneously ascends from the promontory on the island Near the sea here there K 2 ar¬ i32 THE DESCRIPTION arc baths of salubrious water and of a more temperate nature for the water in other parts is not adapted for bathing through its great heat But to return to the gifts in the temple the Thebans and Athenians have dedicated here treasuries in consequence os success in war I do nos however know whether the Gnidians built their treasury in consequence of any victory or for the purpose of shewing the prosperous condition of thei affairs For the Thebans dedicated treasuries on account of the victory which they gained at Leuctra and the Athenians for their success at Marathon But the Cleon√ i being afflicted with a pestilence in the fame manner as the Athenians by the admonition of the Delphic oracle immolated a goat to the rising fun and when they were by this means freed from their malady sent a brazen goat to Apollo After these follow the gifts of the Poti d√ at√ in Thrace and of the Syracusans These last sent a treasury to the temple on account of the great victory which they obtained over the Athenians but the Poti dicat√ sent a treasury as a testimony of their piety to the god The Athenians too have dedicated a porch from the spoils which they took from the Peloponnesians and their Grecian allies In this place likewise the orna ments belonging to the extremities of ships are dedicated and together with them brazen shields The inscription on these mentions the cities from which the Athenians sent the first fruits of their spoils viz Elis Laced√ mon Sicyon Megara the Pellenenses the Achaians Ambracia Leucas and Corinth They sacrifice to Theseus for these naval victories and to Neptune whom they call Qrios This inscription too as it appears to me celebrates Phormiq the son of Asopichus and his illustrious achievements C H A P OP GREECE 133 CHAP XII A STONE elevates itself above this place on which the Sibyl Herophile as the Delphi fay used to sing her oracles I have found that this Sibyl was thus denomi nated from the first in the fame manner as any other ancient Sibyl The Greeks fay that she was the daughter of Jupiter and Lamia that Lamia was the daughter of Neptune and that he was the first woman that fang oracles and was denominated by the Africans Sibylla This Sibyl Herophile indeed was certainly posterior to Lamia j but at the fame time it appears that she flourished prior to the Trojan war For she predicted that Helen would be educated in Sparta that she would be the destruction of Asia and Europe and that Troy through her means would be taken by the Greeks The Delians make mention of her hymns to Apollo and in her verses she not only calls herself Herophile but like wise Diana She likewise asserts of herself that she is the wife of Apollo and besides this that she is his sister and daughter But these assertions are the result of her being agitated with fury and possessed by the god In another part too of her oracles she fays that she was born from an immortal mother viz one of the nymphs of mount Ida and a mortal father for thus lie speaks concerning herself From an immortal nymph and whale fed sire A mean between the two I sprung to light From one of Ida s nymphs Ijegot my native land Is red Marpcssus where Aidoneus stows A country acred to the mighty Op¬ K 3 Even  134 THE DESCRIPTION Even at present there are ruins in the Trojan mount Ida of the city Marpessus  and it contains about sixty inhabit ants All the country about Marpessus is red and very sultry Hence it appears to me that the reason why the river Aidoneus at one time hides itself in the earth again emerges and at last entirely disappears under ground is to be ascribed to the attenuated and cavernous nature of mount Ida Marpessus is distant from the Trojan city Alexandrca about two hundred and forty stadia The inhabitants of Alexandrea fay that Herophile was the guardian of the temple of Apollo and that flic prophesied in consequence of a dream of Hecuba such things as I am very certain afterwards happened This Sibyl dwelt the greatest part of her life in Samos she likewise came to Delos and Delphos in which last place she delivered her oracles on the stone which we have already mentioned She died in Troy her sepulchre is in the grove of Sminthcus and on it there is a pillar with the following inscription I who am buried in this stone sepulchre Am a Sibyl a clear interpreter of the will Of Phoebus I was once a vocal virgin but am now for ever dumb And lie thus fettered through the oppressive power Of Fate I am however placed under the Nymphs and Mercury And k is from Apollo that I receive this Destiny as the reward of iny ancient Sacerdotal office Near her sepulchre there is a stone Mercury of a quadran gular figure and on the left hand there is water running into a receptacle and near it there are statues of Nymphs 3 The OF GREECE i 5 The ErithrSfei for these people contend about Herophile the most eagerly of all the Greeks shew a mountain called Corycus and in it a cavern in which they fay Herophile was born They farther add that her parents were a shep herd Theodorus a native of their country and a nymph who was called Ida and that the nymph was thus deno minated for no other reason than because men at that time called places thick planted with trees Mai But the Erythr√ i do not rank among the oracles of Herophile the verse respecting Marpeflus and the river Aidoneus One Hyperochus a Cum√ an writes that after Herophile a woman of Cuma belonging to the Opici used to deliver oracles in the fame manner as Herophile and that this woman was called Demo  The Cum√ ans however cannot produce any oracles of Demo but they shew a stone water pot in the temple of Apollo in which they say the bones of this Sibyl are deposited After Demo the Hebrews beyond Palsestine rank among the number of prophetic women Sabbe whose father they say was Berofus and whose mother was Erymanthe Some however call this Sibyl a Baby lonian and others an √ gyptian But Phaennis who was the daughter of a man that reigned over the Chaones and the Pele√ among the Dodon√ ans prophesied indeed from a divine power but were not denominated Sibyls As to the age and oracles of Phaennis the former may be known by inquiry and there is no difficulty in obtain ing the latter for she lived in those times in which An tiochus having taken Demetrius prisoner seized on his kingdom But they fay that the Peleades were prior to Phe monoe and were the first women that fang these verses Jove was Jove is and tvill be mighty Jove Earth gives us fruits hepee call on mother Earth K 4 They 136 THE DESCRIPTION They say too that the following prophetic men Euclu the Cyprian Mus√ us the Athenian and the son of An tiophemus Lycus the son of Pandion and Bacis from B≈ otia were inspired by nymphs I have read all the oracles of these except those of Lycus And thus much concerning men and women as far as to the present time who are said to have prophesied from divine inspiration C H A P XIII BlJT the brazen head of the P√ onian bull called Bifsn or buff was sent to Delphos by Dropion the son of Deon and king of the Pceonians These busts are taken alive ‚ with more difficulty than any othw wild beasts  for there are not any nets strong enough to hold them They are therefore hunted in the following manner The hunters choose a steep place which terminates in a hollow This place they first fortify with a strong inclosure then they cover the steep and the plain near the steep with the hides of oxen recently slain but if they have not a suf ficienpy of theft they lubricate old hides with oil After this very skilful horsemen drive the busts into this in closure who falling through the slipperiness of the hides are hurled headlong to the bottom of the plain Here they leave them for four or five days till they are debilitated by weariness and hunger and are considerably tamed Thert those who are killed in the art of taming these animals place before them while they are lying in this weak con dition the fruit of a pine nut having first of all stripped it of the inward skin r for at that time the buffs do not desire  OF GREECE 137 desire any other food And last of all they bind them and bring them away from the hollow Opposite to the brazen head of the Bison there is a statue which is in vested with a coat of mail and a robe over it The Delphi fay that this was dedicated by the Andrii and that it is the statue of Andreus by whom they were colonized Here too there arc statues of Minerva and Diana which were dedicated by the Phocenses for having conquered the Thessalians their perpetual enemies and those who border on their dominions except in that part in which they are separated from Phocis by the intervention of the Locrian Hypocnemidii The Thessalians likewise st Phar salus and the Macedonians who inhabit the city Dios undervPieria and the Grecian Cyren≈ ans in Libya have sent sacred offerings to this temple For these last dedi cated a chariot in which Anmon stands but the Diat√ dedicated an Apollo laying hold of a stag and the Phar salians an Achilles on horseback The Corinthians too who are ranked among the Dorienscs built a treasury and in this they deposited the gold which they received from the Lydiani But the statue of Hercules is the gift of the Thebans in consequence os that war with the Phocenses which is called sacred Here likewise there are brazen images which the Pho censes dedicated when in a second engagement they van quished the Theffalian horse The Phliasians too sent a brazen Jupiter to Delphos and together with Jupiter an image of √ gina The Mantineans from Arcadia dedicated a brazen Apollo which is not far from the treasury of the Corinthians Hercules and Apollo hold a tripod and are on the point of fighting with each other for its pos se IB on i3R THE DESCRIPTION session but Latona and Diana appease the anger of Apollo and Minerva that of Hercules This too was the gift of the Phocenses which they dedicated at that time when the Elean Tellias led the 1 hessalians against them The other statues were made in common by Diyllus and Amyclxus  but Minerva and Diana were made byChion They fay that these artists were Corinthians The Delphi too report that when Hercules the son of Amphitryon came to this oracle the prophet ‚ Xenocleas was unwilling to give him an answer to his interrogation because he was polluted with the slaughter of Iphitus but that Hercules took up the tripod and carried it out of the temple j upon which the prophet said   This is a Tirynthian Hercules and not Canobeus For prior to this an Egyptian Her cules came to Delphos But then the son of Amphitryon restored the tripod to Apollo and was instructed by Xeno cleas in whatever he was desirous of learning And it is from this circumstance that poets have taken occasion to sing of the contest between Hercules and Apollo for a tripod A golden tripod supported by a dragon of brass was the gift of the Greeks in common for the victory gained at Plattea And even at present the brazen part of this offering remains entire  but the golden part was taken away by the Phocensian commanders The Taren tines also sent to Delghos another tenth of the spoils taken from a barbarous people called the Pcucetii And these offerings were made by Onatas √ ginetes and Calynthus They consist of images of men on foot and on horseback Opis king of the lapyges is represented giving assistance to the Pcucetii and resembles a person dying in the en gagement Those that stand near him are the hero Taras aud OF GREECE 139 mrtd the Laced√ monian Phalanthus and not far from Phalanthus there is a dolphin For before he came into Italy he was shipwrecked in the Criss√ an se was they fay brought on shore by a dolphin CHAP XIV BuT the battle axes which are dedicated here were the gift of Periclytus the son of Euthymachus the Tcnedian An ancient story assigns the reason of their being dedi cated This story informs us that Cycnus was the son of Neptune and that he reigned in Colon√ a Trojan town which is situated near the island Leucophrys This Cycnus had a daughter whose name was Hemithea and a son named Tennes by Proclea the daughter of Clytius and the sister of Caletor who as we are informed by Homer in the Iliad was slain by Ajax because he brought fire to the soip of Protesilaus On the death of Proclea Cycnus married Philonome the daughter of Craugasus who falling in love with her son in law Tennes and being repulsed by him falsely accused him to her husband of en deavouring to have connection with her against her wilL Cycnus becoming the dupe of her deception shut up Tennes and his sister in a chest and threw them into the sea They were however carried with safety to the island Leucophrys which is now denominated Tenedos from Tennes But Cycnus having in process of time discovered the fraudulent conduct of his wife failed in search of his son in order that he might justify himself by pleading in his defence that he was ignorant of his wife s artifice and beg 140 THE DESCRIPTION beg pardon for the deed When therefore he drove to the island Leucophrys and had fastened his vessel either to a stone or a trunk of a tree Tennes impelled by anger flew him with a battle ax And hence it came to be a proverbial saying when any one resolutely denied complying with the request os another that he cut him down with a Te nedian battle ax The Greeks fay that Tennes was flaist by Achilles as he was making depredations on this island But the Tenedii in process of time joined themselves to the Trojan Alexandreans through the imbecility of their affairs The Greeks too who warred against the Persians de dicated in Olympia a brazen Jupiter and in Delphos an Apollo for the naval victory which they obtained at Ar temisium and Salamis It is also said that Themistocles when he came to Delphos dedicated to Apollo the spoilt of the Medes and that on his inquiring whether he might place these gifts within the temple the Pythian priestess ordered him to carry them entirely away from the temple But the oracle which flie gave him respect ing this was as follows ‚ Place not in my temple the beautiful spoils of the Persians but swiftly carry them to your own habitation It is certainly a wonderful cir cumstance that the god should alone reject the spoils of the Medes which were presented by Themistocles Seme however are of opinion that all the Persian spoils would have been rejected if like Themistocles they had first in terrogated Apollo whether he would accept them Others again fay that as Apollo foreknew Themistocles would become a suppliant to the Persians he was unwilling to receive their spoils lest the Persians through hatred of the donor sliould reject his supplications You may find this irruption  OF GREECE 141 irruption of the Barbarians into Greece predicted in the oracles of Bacis and still prior to these verses respecting this affair were published by Euclus There is a brazen wolf too near the greatest altar in this temple which was dedicated by the Delphi themselves They fay that a cer tain man having stolen some of the riches of the god hid himself with the sacred treasure in that part of Parnassus in which there was the greatest quantity of wild trees j that a wolf attacked and slew this man as he was asleep and afterwards used to run into the city howling every day That the inhabitants considering this circumstance could not happen without the interference of a divine power followed the wolf found the sacred gold and de dicated a brazen wolf in consequence of this to the god The golden statue of Phryne here was made by Praxiteles who was one of her lovers  but the statue was dedicated by Phryne CHAP XV ThE offerings which follow this are two statues of Apollo one of which was dedicated by the Epidaurians ¬ n the borders of the Argives from the spoils of the Medes and the other was dedicated by the Megarenses in consequence of having conquered the Athenians at Nissxa But the ox which was dedicated here by the Plat√ enses is an offering for having in conjunction with the other Greeks revenged themselves in their own do minions on Mardonius the son of Gobrias After this fhere are again two statues of Apollo one of which was dedicated i42 THE DESCRIPTION dedicated by the Heracleotx near the Euxine sea and the other by the Amphictyons from a sine which they levied on the Phocenses for cultivating the land sacTed to the god This Apollo is called by the Delphi Sitalcas and is thirty five cubits in magnitude Here too there are many statues of commanders There are besides statues of Diana and Minerva and two of Apollo which were dedicated by the √ tolians when they vanquished the Gauls Pha ennis indeed in her oracles predicted that the army of the Celt√ would pass over from Europe into Asia and prove the destruction of Asiatic cities one age prior to the accomplishment of her prediction Then indeed the pernicious army of the Celt√ having passed over the nar row sea of the Hellespont shall play on the flute and in a lawless manner depopulate Asia ‚ But divinity will still more severely afflict those that dwell near the sea How ever in a short time after Jupiter will send them a de fender the beloved son of a Jove nourished bull who will bring destruction on all the Gauls Phaennis in this oracle means by the son of a bull At tains king of Pergamus whom the oracle of Apollo called Ttmroleroos or bull horned The generals of the horse who are themselves seated on horseback were dedicated by the Phcrxi for having vanquished the Athenian horse But the Athenians dedicated the brazen palm with the gilt st ituc of Minerva in consequence of having gained in one and the same day a victory by land near Eury medon and by sea in the same river When I saw that the gold was plucked from this statue in many places I threw the blame on the sacrilegious but I found after wards in the account of the Attic affairs by Clitodemus that when the Athenians had prepared themselves for the  n OF GREECE 143 Sicilian expedition an immense number of crows came at that time to Delphos and tore away the gold of the statue with their beaks The fame historian acids that these crows tore oft the spear the owls and all that was carved in the palm tree in imitation of ripe fruit Clitodemus too relates other prodigies which were sent in order to deter the Athenians from that expedition 1 he Cyren√ i too dedicated in Delphos a statue of Battus in a chariot because he brought them by sea from Thera to Libya In this chariot the nymph Libyc crowns Battus and this offering was made by the Gnoffian Amphion the son of Acestor When Battus built Cyrene he is said to have obtained the following remedy for his defect of speech As the Cyrena ans were travelling through Africa and were yet in the deserts situated in its extremities Battus beheld a lion and through the terror which the sight of the beast produced in him he was compelled to cry out with a clear and loud voice Not far from the statue of Battus there is another statue of Apollo which was dedi r cated by the Amphictyons out of the money which the Phpcenses were fined for their impiety to Apollo CHAP XVI Of all the offerings however which the Lydian kings sent to Apollo nothing at present remains except the iron basis cf the bowl of Halyattes This was made by Glautu ¬ he Chian who first discovered the art of soldering iron Indeed the junctures of this basis are not formed from any chips or nails but from solder alone The form of 44 THE DESCRIPTION the basis for the most part resembles that of a tower and rises from an acute bottom to a broad top Each of its ides is covered throughout but is begirt with transverse rones of iron like the steps in a ladder Straight and ductile lamina of iron are bent in their extremities out wards  and this was the feat of the bowl But that which is called by the Delphi the navel and which is made of white stone is as they fay the middle point of the whole earth And Pindar in one of his odes speaks in con formity to this opinion Here too there is an offering of the Laced√ monians viz Hermione the daughter of Me nelaus who was married to Orestes the son of Aga memnon and prior to this to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles This was made by Calamis The √ tolians like wise dedicated in this temple a statue of Eurydamus who was their commander when they fought against the Gauls In the mountains of Crete the city Elyros yet exists Thi¬ city sent a brazen goat to Apollo which is represented suckling Phylacis and Phylander The Elyrians fay that these were the sons of Apollo and the nymph Acacallis and that Apollo had connection with her in the city Tarrha and in the house os Carmanor But the Carystii from Eubcea sent a brazen ox to Apollo for having gained a victory over the Persians Both theCarystii and Platxcnfes indeed dedicated oxen as it appears to me because having expelled the Barba rians from Greece they obtained in other respects a stable degree of property and were enabled to cultivate a free land The √ tolians dedicated the images of their com manders and together with these Apollo and Diana in consequence of having conquered their neighbours the Acarnanes What the Liparxans relate of themselves with respect OF GREECE 14 respect to the Tyrrheni is most absurd For they say that the Pythian deity having ordered them to engage the Tyrrheni with a very small fleet of ships they on the contrary drew out against them five three oared galleys That the Tyrrheni considering themselves as not inferior in naval strength and skill to the Leparieans attacked them with an equal number of ships But when the Lipar√ ans took the five galleys of the Tyrrheni the Tyr rheni attacked them a second third and fourth time with the like number of vessels All these however were taken by the Lipar√ ans who in consequence of this victory sent as many statues of Apollo to Delphos as the number of the ships which they had captured amounted to Eche cratides too a Lariss√ an dedicated a small Apollo and the Delphi say that this was dedicated the first of all the offerings CHAP XVII 1 HE Barbarians that inhabit Sardinia towards the west sent to this temple a brazen statue of him from whom they were denominated Sardinia for its magnitude and prosperous condition may be compared with the most ce lebrated islands I do not know what this island was for merly called by the inhabitants but those Grecians that fail to it for commercial purposes call it Ichnuffa because its form resembles the impression of a man s foot The length of this island is about fix hundred and twenty and its breadth four hundred and twenty stadia The Libyans are said to have been the first that sailed to this island Under the command of Sard us the son of Maceris who Vol III L was 146 THE DESCRIPTION was Curnamed Hercules by the √ gyptians and Libyans Nothing more remarkable is related of the father of Sar dus Maceris than that he once came to Delphos Sardus brought a colony of Libyans to Ichnussa and hence the island came lo be called after the name of Sardus This colony of Libyans did not exterminate the natives The natives however associated with the new inhabitants more through necessity than regard The Libyans too at that time were as ignorant in the art of building cities as the native inhabitants of this island  and hence they dwelt in straggling cottages and in caverns Some years after the Libyans had settled here those Grecians that followed Arist√ us came into this island They fay that Arist√ us was the son os Apollo and the nymph Cyrene and that having bitterly lamented the misfortune of Act√ on and being hated by Bceotia and all Greece he migrated to Sardinia Some too are of opinion that D√ dalus fled at the fame time through fear of the Cretan arms and that he assisted Arist√ us in bringing a colony into Sar dinia There is however no probability that D√ dalus could be the companion of Arist√ us either in establishing a colony or in any other undertaking as Arist√ us was married to Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus and D√ dalus was contemporary with Oedipus king of Thebes Arist√ us however and the Grecians that followed him did not build any city because as it appears to me they were neither numerous nor strong enough for this pur pose After Arist√ us the Ibcri passed over into Sardinia under the command of Norax and built a city which they called Nora They fay that this city was the first that was built in this island and that Norax was the son ‚ f Mercury by Erythca the daughter of Geryon A fourth band t  OF GREECE 147 band composed of Thespians and inhabitants of the Attic lind came to Sardinia under the command of Iolaus These built the city Olbia which is also called Ogrylle either after the name of some one of the Attic towns or because Gryllus partook of this expedition Even at present therefore there are certain places in Sardinia which are called Iolaii and Iolaus is honoured by the inhabitants After the destruction of Troy others of the Trojans saved themselves by flight as well as the fol lowers of √ neas Of these one part was driven by tem pests to Sardinia and became mingled with the Greeks that resided there prior to this circumstance But the Bar barians were prevented from warring on the Greeks and Trojans because there was an equality on both sides in all warlike preparations and the river Thorsus which flows through the middle of the island was a barrier to the junction of the two parties Many years after this the Libyans came with a greater fleet to Sardinia and attacking the Greeks that dwelt there either flew them all or at least left but a very few alive But the Trojans on this occasion fled to the elevated parts of the island and entrenching themselves iii mountains difficult of ac cess through their ruggedness and the hanging rocks with which they were surrounded are even at present called Ilicnses They are however in their form the apparatus of their arms and their manner of living like the Afri cans Not far from Sardinia there is an island called by the Greeks Cyrnos but by the Libyans that inhabit it Corsica No small part of the inhabitants of this island being incited to sedition passed over to Sardinia and having seized on the mountains fixed their residence in them These by the inhabitants of Sardinia are denominated from L 2 their  14 THE DESCRIPTION their sounder Corfi But the Carthaginians as they were very powerful by sea drove out all the inhabitants from Sardinia except the Ilienscs and Corfi for steep and for tified mountains prevented them from subduing these The Carthaginians built in this island two cities Carnalis and Sylli but a dispute arising concerning the spoil the Libyans and Spaniards revolted from the Carthaginians and settled themselves in the elevated parts of the island The Corn call these people in their native tongue Balaroi i for thus they denominate exiles And such are the nations which inhabit Sardinia and such the cities into which it is divided But those parts of the island which are situated towards the north and the coast of Italy are nothing but mountains difficult of access and whose summits are conjoined with each other These parts however afford a very good harbour for ships and strong and irregular winds rush from the top¬ of the neighbouring mountains into the sea In the middle of the island too there are less elevated mountains but the air in this part is very turbid and noxious The reason of this is the fait which becomes concreted here and the heavy and violent south wind which blows from these mountains The northern winds too through the lofti ness of the mountain towards the Italian coast are pre vented from refrigerating the ground and the air in sum mer Others are of opinion that the island Corsica which is separated from Sardinia by not more than eight stadia of sea and which is on all sides mountainous and elevated prevents the west and north winds from reaching as far as Sardinia But neither serpents destructive to mankind nor such as are harmless nor wolves are produced in this island Aud as to the goats which it contains they are OF GREECE 149 arc not larger than those in other places and they re semble in their form the ram which may be seen in the plastic productions of √ gin√ as About the breast how ever they are more hairy and the horns on their head are not separated from each other but are from their roots bent back towards their ears In swiftness too surpass all wild beasts This fame island is likewise free from all kinds of poisonous and deadly herbs excepting one herb which resembles parsley and which they lay causes those who eat it to die laughing From this circum stance Homer first and others after him call laughter which conceals some noxious design Sardonian This herb is mostly produced about fountains but yet it does not communicate it poisonous quality to the water And thus much concerning Sardinia which we havs inserted into our account os the Phocenfian affairs because the Greeks have a very inconsiderable knowledge of this island CHAP XVIII A HORSE stands next to the statue of Sardus which Callias the Athenian and the son of Lysiinachides fays he dedicated out of the money which he acquired from the Persian war The Achaians too dedicated a statue of Minerva when they took an √ tolian city called Phana As the siege of this city continued for no small length of time and it appeared at length impossible to take it they sent Speculators theoroij to Delphos who brought back the following oracle   Inhabitants of the land of Pelops and the Achaians you are come hither in order to inquire L 3 by iSo THE DESCRIPTION  by what means a city may be taken Attend therefore to my words  Observe how much those that guard the walls drink every day for by this means you shall take the tur reted city Phana As they were unable to comprehend the meaning of this oracle they determined to give over the siege and return home Those too within the walls made no account of the enemy and hence a certain woman left the walls in order to draw water from a neighbouring fountain A band of soldiers however took her prisoner and brought her to their camps From her the Achaians learnt that the inhabitants of the town used to distribute every night the water of that fountain to each other and that this was the only water they had to drink In con sequence of this information the Achaians closed up the fountain with earth piled over it and by this means took the city The Rhodians too in Lindum dedicated a statue of Apollo which stands near this statue of Minerva The Ambraciotx likewise dedicated a brazen ass in consequence of having vanquished the Molofli in a nocturnal engagement For the Moloffi having laid an ambush for the Ambraciotx in the night an ass who happened at that time to be driven from the fields to the town attacked a female of his own species with a consi derable degree of wantonness This occasioned him to bray very Ipud and the driver of the ass at the fame time calling to him with an indistinct and rough voice pro duced such a dread in the Moloffi that they immediately abandoned their enterprise But the Ambraciot√ having detected their stratagem attacked aad vanquished them in the night The Orneat√ too who form a part of the Argives when they were vanquished by the Sicyonians in battk made OF GREECE i5t made a vow to Apollo that if by repelling the enemy they were able to free their country from danger they would send every day a solemn procession to Delphos and immolate a certain number of victims However after they had conquered the Sicyonians and in conse quence of this sent every day a solemn procession to the god according to their vow they sound the expence to be prodigious and the fatigue attending it greater than the cost Hence they devised a subtle mode os accom plishing their vow and this was by dedicating a brazen sacrifice and procession to Apollo Here too there is a representation of the achievement os Hercules respecting the hydra which was both dedicated and made by Tisa goras As well Hercules as the hydra is of iron To make statues indeed of iron is a thing of the most difficult and laborious nature but this work of Tifigoras who ever he was is really admirable In Pergamus likewise there arc iron heads of a lion and a boar dedicated to Bacchus which demand no small degree of admiration ThcPhocians that inhabit Elatea being freed from the liege of their city by Cassander Olympiodorus who was sent by the Athenians for this purpose giving them assist ance dedicated to the Delphic Apollo a brazen lion But the statue of Apollo which stands very near this lion was made out of the tenth of the spoils which the Massilienses took from the Carthaginians when they vanquished them in a naval engagement The √ tolians dedicated here a trophy and a statue of an armed woman viz √ tolia and this out of the money which they took from the Gauls for their cruelty to the Callienses The golden jjnage in this temple was dedicated by Gorgias the Leon tine and is an image of Gorgias himself L4 chap  ISZ THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XIX Near the statue os Gorgias is the Scionean ScyHis who was renowned for heing able to descend into the most profound parts of every sea He taught his daughter Cyana this art of diving Both of them therefore when the fleet of Xerxes was tolled about by a violent tempest near mount Pelion brought destruction on the three oared galleys of the Persians by cutting away the ropes that held the anchors or any thing else that fastened the ships under water Hence in memorial of this achieve ment the Amphictyons dedicated his statue and that of his daughter Among the statues which Nero took from Delphos was the statue of Cyana Women while they are yet pure virgins are said to descend with safety into the sea But here it is proper that I should relate what is reported pf Lesbos Certain Methymn√ an fishermen drew up out of the sea in their nets a head made from the olive tree This head seemed to have something di vine in its form but such as was foreign and not agree able to the figure of the Grecian gods The Methym n√ ans therefore inquired of the Pythian deity of what god or hero this head was the image and received for answer that they should venerate Bacchus Cephallen Hence the Methymn√ ans kept the wooden head which they drew out of the sea venerated it with sacrifices and prayers and sent a brazen image instead of it to Delphos In the roof of the temple there are Diana Latona Apollo the Muses the setting Sun Bacchus and the women who 7 art  OF GREECE 153 arc called Thyades The faces of all these were made by the Athenian Praxias the disciple of Calamis For Praxias dying before the temple was finished the remaining parts of the ornaments of the roof were the work of Androf thenes who was an Athenian and the disciple of Eu cadmus Golden arms are fixed on the tops of the co lumns Of these the Athenians dedicated the shields in consequence os the victory which they gained at Mara thon The spoilS of the Gauls which are in the back part of the temple and on the left hand were dedicated by the √ tolians The form of these shields very much re sembles that of the wicker shields of the Persians which are called Gerrha In our account of the Attic Bouleuterion we men tioned the irruption of the Gauls into Greece  but I have thought proper in this description of the Delphic affairs to relate the particulars of this irruption more explicitly because the Greeks in this engagement against the Bar barians exerted themselves in a most eminent degree The Gauls then marched out of their own dominions the first time under the command of Cambaules and pro ceeding as far as to Thrace had not the boldness to ad vance beyond it because they well knew that they were but few in number and on this account not able to con tend with the forces of the Greeks But when they thought fit to lead a second army beyond their own boun daries those that had before followed Cambaules being incited by a desire of gain and depredation of which they had now tasted collected together a great multitude of foot soldiers and of horse a considerable number After this the commanders divided their army into three parts j and each part was ordered to march into a dif ferent i54 THE DESCRIPTION ferent country Cerethrius therefore was destined to in vade Thrace and the nation of the Triballi Brennus and Acichorus led those that marched into Pannonia and Soigius was the commander of those that attacked the Macedonians and Illyrians This Bolgius fought against Ptolemy king of the Macedonians who flew by stratagem Seleucus the son of Antiochus whose protection at the fame time he suppliantly implored and who from his pro digious audacity was called Thunder Ptolemy however fell in this engagement and together with him no small part of the Macedonians But as the Gauls at that time had not the boldness to proceed any farther into Greece they shortly aster returned into their own dominions Brennus after this earnestly solicited the general assem blies of the Gauls and the principal persons of the Gallic nation to war upon the Greeks who he said were in ferior to them in courage and at that time in an imbeeii condition He likewise reminded them of the great wealth which the Greeks had arnaCed of the numerous oiferings in their temples and of their gold and silver ornaments By this means he persuaded the Gauls to attack the Greeks and joined to himself both other principal per sons of that nation and Acichorus The Gallic army in this third expedition consisted of one hundred and fifty two thousand foot and twenty thousand sour hun dred horse and both horse and foot consisted of valiant soldiers However the true number of these forces was sixty one thousand two hundred For two servants fol lowed each horseman who were themselves good soldiers and rode on horseback These when their masters were in the midst of an engagement stood in the rear of the army and if their masters happened to lose their horses supplied OF GREECE 155 supplied them with frefli ones When any master too fell one of these servants fought in his stead and if he like wise fell there was a third ready to succeed him If the master happened to be wounded one of his servants im mediately led him out of the field of battle and the other filled up the place of his wounded master It appears to me that the Gauls adopted this plan in imitation of the Persians who always have in their armies a select band of ten thousand men whom they call the immortals There is this difference however between the two that the chosen band among the Persians attacks the enemy in the place of those that have been slain aster tlie engagement but the Gauls order their select company to supply the place of the dead or wounded during the engagement This mode of fighting they call in their native tongue Trimarcisias for the name of a horse with the Gauls is Marcas With such preparations therefore and with such conceptions Brennus marched into Greece CHAP XX But the Greeks though they were in a perfectly de sponding condition yet were impelled by the strength of fear to give the necessary assistance to their country For they now clearly saw that the present contest was not for liberty as it was formerly with the Persians and that if they should even give both land and water to the enemy they could not hope for security in future They called to mind too the calamities which they endured through the Barbarians when they formerly made incursions on the Macedonians Thracians and Pxonians and had learnt j56 THE DESCRIPTION learnt from report how injuriously the Gauls had treated the Thessalians at that time It was therefore the unani mous opinion both of individuals and cities thar they must either perish or subdue the enemy Any one who is so disposed may easily enumerate those Grecian cities which opposed Xerxes at Thermopyl√ and those which took up arms against the Gauls For the Greeks that marched against the Mede were these The Laced√ mo nians who were not more than three hundred under the command of Leonidas five hundred of the Tegeat√ and as many from Manlinea One hundred and twenty Or chomenians were sent from Arcadia a thousand from the ether cities of Arcadia eighty from Mycena and two hundred from Phlius The Corinthians sent twice this number There were seven hundred from Bceotia and from Thespia andThcbes four hundred Five hundred of the Phoccnses guarded the pafcges of mount Oeta And such was the number of the forces that assembled on this occasion according to the genera opinion cf the Greeks For Herodotus does n t mention the number of the Lo crians who live under the mountain Cnemis but only fays that the Greeks assembled together from all their cities on this occasion We may however conjecture the number os these very near the truth For the Athenians in the battle at Marathon opposed the enemy with not more than nine thousand men in which those whose age ren dered them useless for the purposes of war and servants were ranked It follows therefore that the band of Locrians which came to Thermopyl√ could not at the most amount to more than six thousand men And hence the whole army must have amounted to eleven thousand two hundred men But  OF GREECE iS7 But it appears that some of those who guarded the Thermopyl√ left their station For indeed none but the Laced√ monians Thespians and Mycen√ ans waited the event of the war Again the following Grecian cities sent a guard to Thermopyl√ against the Barbarians who marched an army from the extremities of the ocean against Greece The B≈ otians sent ten thousand heavy armed soldiers and five hundred horse These were under the command of four leaders called Bceotarchs viz Cephisso dotus Thearidas Diogenes and Lyfander The Phocenses sent five hundred horse and three thousand soot and these were commanded by Critobulus and Antiochus Midias led seven hundred soot soldiers of the Locrians near the island Atalanta but these people had not any equestrian forces Four hundred heavy armed foot were sent by the Megarenses and Megareus led the horse of these people But the forces of the √ tolians both surpassed the rest in number and in warlike skill The number of their horse is not known but that of their heavy armed foot was seven thousand and of their light armed ninety These were commanded by Polyarchus Polyphron and Lacratej Calippus the son of Mocrocles led the forces of the Athe nians as I have before hewn These forces consisted in the first place of all the three oared galleys which could be procured in the next place of five hundred horse and in the third place of a thousand foot The Athenians too on account of their ancient dignity had the command of all these forces Kings too sent mercenary troops and of these fire hundred came from Macedonia and as many from Asia Aristodemus the Macedonian was sent as a commander of the auxiliary forces by king Amigonus and Telesar chus  t 8 THE DESCRIPTION chus who belonged to the Syrians near the river OronfesV  was sent as a commander by Antiochus from Asia These forces being assembled at Thermopyl√ as soon as it was known that the army of the Gauls had fixed their camps in the borders of Magnesia and Phthiotis they sent a thou sand light armed soldiers and a chosen body of horse to the river Sperchius that the Barbarians might not pass over the river without fighting their way and being exposed to the danger of a defeat These forces therefore when they came to the Sperchius destroyed the bridges which the Gauls had raised on it and fixed their camps on the banks of the river Brennus indeed was not unskilled in warlike affairs but for a Barbarian sufficiently acute and experienced in the stratagems of war On the following night therefore leaving that part of the river on which he had raised the bridges he sent ten thousand soldiers who were skilled in swimming and remarkably tall for the Gauls in general surpass other men in stature to the lower parts of the river that the Greeks might not per ceive them as they were passing over and besides this he knew that the river in this part spread itself widely over the plains and produced a marsh and lake instead of a strong and narrow stream In the night therefore his forces swam over the marshy part of the river some of them using their shields which they call thureoi for rafts while others who were taller than the rest waded through with their feet The Greeks on the banks of the Sperchius as soon as they understood that the Barbarians had passed over the marshy part of trie river immediately marched back to their army i CH AF  OF GREECE CHAP XXI BrENNUS after this ordered the inhabitants near the bay of Maliacus to join the Sperchius by a bridge This they accomplished with great celerity both through fear of Brcnnus and through the desire os hastening the departure of the Barbarians as there was reason to ex pect they would greatly injure them if they staid long in these parts Brennus therefore as soon as he had passed over the river by bridges led his army to Heraclea depopulated the country and flew the men that he found in the fields He did not however take the city because in the year prior to this event the √ tolians compelled the Heracleot√ to become a part of their dominions and in consequence of this defended their city at that time with great alacrity considering it as a place which be longed to themselves as much as to the Heracleotse But Brennus did not bestow much pains in endeavouring to take this city but employed himself principally in taking care to prevent those who guarded the walls of Heraclea from hindering his march to that part of Greece which is within Thermopyl√ Leaving therefore Heraclea and learning from certain fugitives the number of the forces which had assembled from the several cities of Greece he despised the Grecian army and determined to come to an engagement on the following day at sun rise neither employing any Grecian prophet nor performing any of ‚ the sacred ceremonies of his own country if indeed the Gauls knew any thing of the divining art The Greeks drew x66 THE DESCRIPTION drew up in order of battle with silence and great regu larity And when the two armies came to a close engage ment the Grecian foot ran so far beyond their station that they caused contusion in their own phalanx  but the light armed troops remaining in their proper ranks dis charged at the enemy their darts arrows and slings The horse in each army was perfectly useless and this not only through the narrow passages of the mountain which they call gates but through the smoothness and f ipperiness of the ground from its rocky nature and from frequent and abundant inundations of rivers The armour of the Gauls too was inferior in strength to that of the Greeks for they had no other defence for their bodies than those shields which they call ihureoi and what was of still greater consequence the Gauls were far in ferior in military experience to their enemies However in battle they rushed on the Greeks with a degree of linger and fury resembling the attacks of wild beasts so that their rage while life remained suffered no abate ment though they were maimed by the battle ax cut down with the sword or pierced with arrows and darts Some of them too when wounded sent back the darts which they tore from their wounds on the Greeks or pierced with these darts the Greeks that stood near them In the mean time the three oared galleys of the Athenians could scarcely and not without danger discharge their rnissive weapons of every kind at the enemy owing to their sailing through mud because the river was at a great distance from the sea and being obliged to bring their Vessels very near the Barbarians But the Gauls being ‚ wearied in a still greater degree than the Greeks because  in those narrow passages they were unable to accomplish any  OF GREECE 161 any thing of importance and suffering every inconveni ence were ordered by their commanders to retreat to their camps This they began to put in execution in a very disordered and tumultuous manner many of them rushing against each other and many falling into the marsh and disappearing absorbed by the mud so that they suffered no less a loss in retreating than in the vigour of the engagement On that day the valour of the Athenians transcended that of the other Greeks and of the Athenians Cydias who was quite a youth and who had never been in an engagement before gave specimens of superior courage This youth being slain by the Gauls his kindred dedi cated his shield to Jupiter the Liberator with this in scription This shield to Jove now sacred yet desires The hlooming youth of Cydias fam d On his left arm this shield he bravely six d When Mars impetuous tam d the Gauls This inscription remained till the soldiers of Sylla took the flueld from the porch of Jupiter the Liberator toge ther with other offerings of the Athenians And such was the battle at the Thermopyl√ But on the next day the Greeks buried their dead and took away the armour of the Barbarians that fell in the engagement The Gauls however did not demand any truce that they might bury their dead  and plainly evinced that they considered it as a matter of no consequence whether the bodies of the flain were buried in the ground or torn in pieces by such wild beasts and birds as fight with each other for the bodies of the dead It appears to me that a twofold reason may be assignedj why they are thus careless as to Vol III M the i6i THE DESCRIPTION the interment of the slain a desire of terrifying their enemies by this specimen of their ferocity and their want of commisexation for the dead In this engagement forty of the Greeks fell but the number of the Barbarians that were slain cannot be accurately ascertained because many of them were swallowed up in the mud CHAP XXII On the seventh day after the battle a part of the Gallic army endeavoured to ascend the mountain Oeta in that part of it which is near Heraclea But the path here was very narrow beyond which were the ruins of Trachis and beyond Trachis there was a temple of Mi nerva which contained sacred offerings The Gauls how ever hoped they should be able to ascend Oeta through this narrow path and at the fame time plunder the tem ple of Minerva That guard however which was under the command of Telefarchus vanquished the Barbarians though Telesarchus himself sell in the engagement a man remarkably zealous in the cause of Greece But when the other commanders of the Barbarians were terrified by the valour of the Greeks and began to despair of success in future as they saw that all their present undertakings were adverse Brennus considered that if he could but force the √ tolians to return home he should easily finish his war on the Greeks Having therefore chosen forty thousand soot and eight hundred horse out of his whole army he gave the command of these forces to Orestorius and Combutis and ordered them first os all to pass into 3 Theffaly  OF GREECE 163 Thessaly over the bridges of the Sperchitis and after wards invade √ tolia These two commanders Orejhrius and Combutis ailed towards the Callienses in a manner the mojl impious ive ever heard of and at the fame time in no respect similar to the during wickedness of men For they flew all the males in the city young as well as old together with infants at their mothers Ireafls and drank the bl ed and ate thejlejh of such infants as the nutriment of milk had rendered in a more thriving condition On this occasion such women and virgins in the sower of their age as were of a superior courage defrosed themselves but the Barbarians treated such as survived with the utmof insolence and vio lence as being a nation naturally incapable of pity and averse to love Many indeed of these women voluntarily rushed on the swords of the Gauls Others again not long after died through hunger and wakefulnefs in consequence of the insolence and violence of the Barbarians who some times satisfied their lust on the bodies of the dying and sometimes on the bodies of the dead but the √ tolians having learnt from certain messengers the calamities which had befallen their country immediately with all possible celerity led back their forces from Thermopyl√ to √ tolia being enraged at the sufferings of the Callienses and de siring to save those cities which had not yet experienced the fury of the barbarous enemy All that were of an age capable of bearing arms came into the camps of the √ tolians from all their cities and with these old men were mingled who were impelled both by necessity and their pristine courage The women too who were more enraged against the Gauls than the men voluntarily took arms against them But the Barbarian as soon as M 2 they 64 THE DESCRIPTION they had plundered the houses and temples and had set the city Callion on fire returned the same way as they came to their own people and the Patrenses alone of all the Achaians that assisted the √ tolians opposed the Bar barians with their armed forces in the use of which they were very skilful However they were greatly oppressed both by the multitude of the Gauls and despair of success But then the√ tolians both men and women placing them selves in every part of the road pierced the Gauls with their darts which it was no difficult matter to accomplish because the Barbarians had no other defence than that of their thurioi At the fame time they easily avoided the Gauls when they were pursued by them and when the Gauls abandoned the pursuit again eagerly attacked them Indeed the Callienses though the injuries which they sus tained from the Gauls were so great that what Homer asserts of the L√ strygons and Cyclops ought not to be reckoned fabulous were at the fame time justly revenged on their enemies For out of that great multitude of Gauls which amounted to forty thousand eight hundred men scarcely the half escaped to the camps at Thermopyl√ But the transactions of the Greeks at Thermopyl√ at the fame time w re as follow There are two paths through the mountain Oeta  one of these which is above Trachis is very craggy and steep  but the other which is through √ nian√ may be easily passed by foot soldiers It was through this that the Mede Hydarncs once led his forces and came behind the Greeks that were commanded by Leonidas They understood that the Heracleot√ and √ nian√ were leading Brennus through this path not from any malevolence to the Greeks but in consequence of being convinced that it would be a great undertaking if  OF GREECE 165 if they could induce the Barbarians to leave their country before it was ruined Hence Pindar appears to me to have spoken truly when he says that every one feels the weight of his own calamities but is not affected with the sufferings of others At that time therefore the promise of the √ nianae and Heracleot√ roused the courage of Brennus who leaving Acichorius in his camps and in forming him that it would be proper for him to attack the enemy when he was certain that he was assaulting them behind with a chosen band of forty thousand men marched through the mountain Oeta It happened how ever on that day that the mountain was covered with such a thick mist that the sun was darkened so that the Phocenses who guarded that passage of the mountain did not perceive the Barbarians till they were quite near them Hence some began to engage the Gauls and others strenuously sustained their attacks but being at length vanquished they were compelled to abandon their post With great celerity therefore before Greece was entirely surrounded by the G auls they returned to their allies and informed them of the impending danger The Athenians immediately on this information received into their galleys the Grecian forces at Thermopyl√ who af terwards returned to their respective countries C H A P XXIII But Brennus waiting no longer than till Acichorius with his forces came from the camp marched as soon as he joined him to Delphos The inhabitants on this oc casion fled to the oracle and the god ordered them to M 3 lay i66 THE DESCRIPTION lay aside their fear and promised them that he would de fend his own The Grecian cities that fought on this oc casion in order to take vengeance on the enemies of the god were these The Phocenses from all their cities four hundred henvy armed soldiers from Amphissa From the √ tolians a few only assembled at first when they were told of the march of the Barbarians but afterwards Philomelus led one thousand two hundred Of the √ to lians such as were the most vigorous turned themselves to the army of Acichorius They did not however come to any engagement with the Gauls but molested the rear of their army as they were marching plundered their baggage and flew those that defended it And by this means the march of the Barbarians was impeded But Acichoiius left a part of his forces at Heraclea for the purpose of defending the riches in his camp The army of Brennus therefore was opposed by the Greeks that assembled together at Dclphos And the god at this time shewed that he was adverse to the Barbarians by prodigies the most conspicuous of any that we are acquainted with For all that part of the earth which was occupied by the army of the Gauls was violently shaken for the greater part of the day and this was accompanied with continued thunder and lightning The Gauls in consequence os this were greatly terrified and rendered incapable of hearing the orders of their commanders The lightning too that destroyed any individual burnt at the fame time those that were near him together with their arms Besides all this the spectres of heroes were then seen‚ Hyperochus Laodocus and Pyrrhus ‚ and the fourth of these accord ing to the Delphi was Fhylacus who was a native of their city In  OF GREECE 167 In this engagement however many of the Phocenses fell and among these Aleximachus who in the vigour of his age the strength of his body and the ardour of his zeal surpassed all the Greeks The Phoqenses afterwards sent his image to Apollo at Delphos And such was the terror and slaughter to which the Gauls were exposed in the day time but during the night they suffered still more severely For the weather was vehemently cold and this was accompanied with snow Large stones too and fragments of rocks torn from Parnassus fell on the Barbarians as the destined mark at which they aimed Nor was it only one or two that died by this means but thirty or still more as they stood upon guard or slept in the fame place were at once dashed in pieces by the fall ing rocks As soon as it was day too the Greeks poured out of Delphos and of these some marched in a direct line to the army of the enemy but the Phocenses as being better acquainted with the nature of the place de scended through the snow down the precipices of Parnas sus and attacking the Gauls behind pierced the Barba rians with their darts and arrows in perfect security But when the two armies began to engage the soldiers about Brcnnus as they were the tallest and strongest of the Gauls vigorously resisted the Greeks and though darts were hurled at them on all sides and they suffered greatly by the cold especially such as were wounded yet they stood their ground till Brennus through some wounds which he had received was carried out of the battle on the point of expiring For then the Barbarians being pressed on every side by the Greeks were forced unwil lingly to retreat and flew those of their own party who M 4 thiough 168 THE DESCRIPTION through the wounds and weakness of their bodies were unable to follow them The Gauls too were obliged to fix their camps in that place where the night came upon them during their flight and in the night they were seized with a panic terror For dread which is produced from no apparent cause is said to be sent by Pan This terror seized the army of the Barbarians about midnight and at first a few of them were agitated with such irrational sear that they seemed to themselves to hear the found of horses advancing towards them arid to perceive the approach of the enemy Not long after the whole army was infected with the fame stupid sear In consequence of this they hastily took up their arms and a disagreement arising among them they mutually flew each other through the darkness of the night and their insane terror neither un derstanding their native language nor recognizing the countenances of each other nor the figure of their shields i but each party fancied that the troops which it opposed were Greeks and that the arms which they saw and the voices which they heard were Grecian And this insanity which was sent by divinity caused a great multitude of the Gauls to flaughter each other This rnaflacre too was first of all perceived by those Phocenses who were left in the fields to guard the cattle  and the Greeks were informed by these of what had happened to the Barbarians Jn the night The courage of the Phocenses therefore being roused by this intelligence they rushed with greater alacrity on the Gauls placed a stronger guard over their cattle and were careful that no provision sliould be taken from their ficid6 without an engagement ensuing In con sequence OF GREECE i69 sequence of this the whole army of the Gauls laboured under an extreme want of corn and every kind of nu triment But the multitude of the Gauls that died in Phocis in battle was not much less than six thousand those that were destroyed by cold in the night and afterwards by panic terror were more than ten thousand and a like number perished by famine And this information re specting the Gauls was obtained by means of men who were sent by the Athenians to consult the Delphic oracle The B≈ otians likewise joined themselves to those Athe nians who having moved their camps marched through Bccotia and both these following the Barbarians perpe tually cut off by stratagem those that were in the rear of their army The sorces of Acichorius were not able to jpin those that fled with Brennus till the night preceding their flight For the √ tolians by continually infesting them with their darts and every kind of missive weapon that came to hand rendered their march flow  and hence no great multitude of them escaped to the camp near Heraclea With respect to Brennus there was reason to hope that he would not die of his wound but they fay thaf through fear of his fellow citizens and still more through shame that he had been the cause of the Gauls suffering such calamities in Greece he voluntarily destroyed himself by drinking pure wine After his death the Barbarians with great difficulty reached the river Sperchius in consequence of the violent manner in which they were attacked by the √ tolians And when they arrived at the Sperchius the Thessaiians and Ma Jienses made such a slaughter of them that not one was Jtft to return home This war of the Gauls against the Greeks tjo THE DESCRIPTION Greek and the destruction of them which ensued in consequence of it happened when Anaxicrates was the Athenian archon and in the second year of the one hun dred and twenty fifth Olympiad in which Ladas √ giensis conquered in the stadium But in the following year in which Democles was the Athenian archon the Gauls again passed over into Asia And such is the genuine ac count of the particulars of this war CHAP XXIV In the vestibule of the Delphic tempi precepts useful to the conduct of human life are written These were composed by men who arc called wise by the Greeks viz¬ from Ionia by Thales the Milesian and Bias Prienensis from the √ olians in Lesbos Pittacus the Mitylenaran from the Dorians in Asia Cleobulus the Lindian  besides these Solon the Athenian and Chilon the Spartan and for the seventli Myson the Chenean enumerates Plato the son of Ariston instead of Periander the son of Cypselus Formerly the village Chcn√ in the mountain Oeta was in habited These wise men therefore coming to Dclpbos de dicated to Apollo those celebrated sentences Know tfastlfy and Nothing immoderately and these sentences they wrote in the vestibule of the temple You may fee too here a brazen statue of Homer on a pillar  and on it the following oracle of Apollo respecting Homer is inscribed  Blessed and unfortunate ‚ for thou art born to each of these En quire after thy country  for thou hast a maternal but not a paternal land The ifland Ios is thy mother s country which OF GREECE i7t which shall receive thee when dead But guard against the √ nigma of boys The Iet√ too shew the sepukhre of Homer in the island and in a separate place the tomb of Clymene who they say was the mother of Homer The Cyprians however for they contend that Homer was born among them fay that his mother was Themisto a native of their country but Euclus thus prophesies con cerning his origin Then in the sea girt Cyprus a mighty poet shall arise whom the divine Themiito shall bring forth in the wealthy fields of Salamis But he de parting from Cyprus and sailing on the deep shall sing the first of all men the calamities of spacious Greece and shall be himself immortal and free from the depredations of age This account of Homer I have given in consequence ef what I have heard from others and from what I have read in oracles for I have written nothingwhich Is the result of my own opinion either concerning hii country or age In the temple itself there is an altar of Neptune because the most ancient oracle was the pro perty of this god There are likewise two statues of the Parc√ but Jupiter Moiragetes or the leader of the Fates is dedicated instead of the third of the Parcre A r o Moiragetes too stands near them You may also see here a hearth upon which the priest of Apollo flew Neoptolemus the son of Achilles of whose death I have elsewhere made mention Not far from hence there is a throne of Pin dar upon which they fay Pindar fat whenever he came to Delphos and fang the verses which he composed ih honour of Apollo In the most inward part of the temple into which but few are admitted there is anot ier golden statue 0 Apollo On leaving the temp and turning i72 THE DESCRIPTION turning to the left hand you will see an inclosure which contains the tomb of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles to whom the Delphi perform funeral sacrifices every year On ascending from this monument you will see a stone of a moderate size This they anoint with oil every day and during every festival cover it with new stiorn wool They are of opinion respecting this stone that it was jyven to Saturn as a substitute for the infant Jupiter and that he afterwards threw it up by a vomit On leaving this stone and directing your course aa if back again to the temple you will see a fountain which is called Cassotis There is a wall of a moderate size before it and through the wall there is a passage of ascent to the fountain They fay that the water of this fountain merges itself in the earth and causes the women in the adytum of the god to possess prophetic powers They add that the foun tain was denominated from one of the nymphs about Parnaflus CHAP XXV BEYOND the fountain Cassotis there is a building which contains the pictures of Polygnotus which were dedicated by the Gnidians The Delphi call this building Ltfche because formerly men used to discuss serious and trifling affairs in it Homer in the abusive speech of Melantho to Ulysses evinces that there were many such places in every part of Greece Hence to the Lefcbe from the midnight air Or some bLck forge the vagrant s haunt repair On entering this building you will fee on the kft hand of the OF GREECE 173 the wall the subversion of Troy and the Greeks sailing to their native land Menelaus too is represented on board his Ihip preparing to depart from Troy and in the hip boys and men are seen standing together In the middle ¬ f the hip the pilot Phrontis is represented distributing the eontoi or bargemen s poles Homer indeed among other things which he makes Nestor fay to Telemachus repre sents him asserting of Phrontis that he was the son of Onestor that he was the pilot of Menelaus that he was most skilful in his art and that he died when they had sailed beyond the promontory Suniuru in the Attic land Nestor too relates that Menelaus sailed with him to that place and that he staid there till they had raised a tomb and performed such funeral honours as are usually paid to the dead Menelaus therefore is painted in this picture Beneath him Ithaemenes is painted carrying a certain gar ment together with Echocax descending by a naval ladder to the sea with a brazen urn Polites Strophius and Al phius are represented taking down the tent of Menelaus which is not far from the ship and Amphialus is seen taking down another tent A boy sits at the feet of Amphialus but there is no inscription on him Phrontis is the only person in this group that has a beard and Polygnotus learnt his name alone from the Odyssey for it appears to me that the other names are his own invention Briseis too is repre sented in this picture  above her stands Diomed and near both of them Iphis and they are in the attitude of per sons admiring the form of Helen Helen herself is seated and near her stands Eurybates who as we may conjec ture was the herald of Ulysses He is however without a beard There are besides two maid servants Electra and i74 THE DESCRIPTION and Panthalis the latter of whom stands by Helen and the former is represented fastening the shoes of her mis tr ss These names too are different from those which arc adopted by Homer in the Iliad where he describes Helen and her maids on the walls of Troy A man clothed in purple and extremely sorrowful sits above Helen and before you read the inscription you may easily conjecture that this is Helenus Near Helenus Meges stands His arm is wounded agreeably to the account given of him by Lescheus Pyrrh√ us the son of √ schylenus in his poem on the destruction of Troy This Lescheus informs us that he was wounded by the Argive Admetus in that battle which the Trojans fought in the night Lycomedes the son of Creon stands near Meges He is represented wounded in the wrist  and according to Lescheus he re ceived this wound from Agenor It is evident therefore thatPolygnotus would not have painted him in this manner unless he had read the poetical compositions of Lescheus Lycomedes likewise received two wounds besides this one in the foot and the other in the head and these Poly gnotus has represented in the picture Euryalus too the son of Mecisteus appears with two wounds one in the head and the other in the wrist All these are above Helen in the picture After Helen √ thra the mother of Theseus is painted with her hair haven off to her skin together with Demophon the son os Theseus who is re presented considering whether it is possible for him to save √ thra The Argives fay that Melanippus was the son of Theseus by the daughter of Synnis and that he conquered in the race when those who are called the Epigonoi established the second Nemean games after Adrastus Lescheus  OF GREECE 175 Lescheus relates in his verses that when Troy was taken √ thra escaped and came to the camps of the Greeks that she was there known by the sons of Theseus and that Demophon requested her in marriage 9s Aga memnon That he indeed was willing to gratify Demophon but that he said he would not accomplish their desires till he had gained the consent of Helen A herald therefore being sent to Helen found her disposed to the match Hence in the picture Eurybates appears addressing Helen on account of √ thra and delivering to her the message of Agamemnon Trojan women too are represented in this picture in the habit of mourning captives The first of these is Andromache with an infant at her breast Lescheus fays that this infant was thrown from a tower not indeed by the decree of the Greeks but through the private hatred of Neoptolemus who ordered him to be put to death Medesicaste likewise is painted here who was one of the bastard daughters of Priam who accord ing to Homer dwelt in the city Ped√ um and was mar ried to Imbrius the son of Mentor Andromache and Medesicaste are veiled but Polyxena is painted with her hair platted after the manner of virgins Poets sing and the pictures which I have seen at Athens and Pergamus which is a city above Cakus in which die calamities of Polyxena are painted evince that she was slain at the tomb of Achilles Polygnotus too has painted in the fame picture Nestor with a hat on his he id and a spear in his hand A horse rolling in the dust is seen near him The ground on which the horse lies is the sea shore j and the pebbles on the sliore are represented The re maining part of the ground does not appear to resemble the sea shore  CHAP i7 5 THE DESCRIPTION ‚ CHAP XXVI AbOVE those women which are between √ thra and Nestor other captives are painted viz Clymene Creusa Aristomache and Xenodice Stesichorus in his  poem on the destruction of Troy ranks Clymene among the captives In a similar manner the poet Ennus fays that Aristomache was the daughter of Priam and that she was married to Critolaus the son of Icetaon But I do not know of any poet or prose writer that makes men tion of Xenodice It is said of Creusa that she was taken from the Greeks and restored to liberty by the Mother of the Gods and Venus and that flie was the wife of √ neas Lescheus however and the author of the Cyprian verses fay that Eurydice was the wife of √ neas Above these Deinomoe Metioche Pifis and Cleodice are painted reclining on a bed The name of one of these only is mentioned in the poem called the Small Iliad and it appears to me that Polygnotus invented the other names Here too Epeus is painted throwing down the walls of Troy from their foundations And the only thing above these is the head of the horse Durateus Poly poetes likewise the son of Pirithous is painted having his head bound with a fillet Acamas the son of Theseus stands by him with a helmet on his head and a CTest on the helmet Ulysses too is present and is invested with a coat of mail Ajax the son of Oileus approaches with a shield to the altar in order to swear before he offers violence to Cassandra But Cassandra fits on the ground OF GREECE 177 ground holding the wooden image of Minerva which she tore from its basis when Ajax drew her from her sup plications ac the altar The sons of Atrcus likewise arc painted with helmets on their heads But on the fliield of Menelaus there is a dragon viz the one that appeared as an omen during the sacrifice at Aulis These administer the oath to Ajax Opposite to trie horse NeoptoJemus is beheld near Nestor flaying Elassus This Elassus whoever he was resembles a man nearly expiring Neoptolemus too strikes with his sword Astynous who has fallen on his knees and who is mentioned by Leseheus Tolygnotus indeed is the only one of the Greeks that has represented Neoptolemus still continuing to flay the Trojans and his design in this was that the whole picture might cor respond to the tomb of Neoptolemus Homer indeed every where calls Neoptolemus the Ion of Achilles but the Cyprian verses testify that he was called Pyrrhus by Lycomedes and that the name of Neoptolemus was given to him by Ph≈ nix because Achilles was very young when he first engaged in war An altar too is painted here and a little boy embracing the altar through fear On the altar there is a brazen coat of mail At present the shape of such coats of mail as this is very rare but they were used in former times In thi3 coat of mail there are two pieces of brass one of which serves to fasten it to the breast and the parts about the belly and the other defends the back the anterior part of this coat of mail they call gualcti and the hinder part prosegon It appears too to be a sufficient defence for the body without a shield On this account Homer re presents the Phrygian Pharcys fighting without a shield because he used a guakthqrax or holkvi coot sf mail I be Vot III N held 178 THE DESCRIPTION held the image of this coat of mail in the picture of Polygnotus And in the temple of Ephesian Diana Cal liphon the Samian has painted certain women adapting the hollow parts of a coat of mail to Patroclus Polygnotus likewise has painted in this picture Laodice standing be yond the altar I do not know of any poet that has mentioned her among the Trojan captives and it ap pears to me very probable that she was dismissed by the Greeks Homer indeed in the Iliad evinces that Mene laus and Ulysses were entertained by Antenor and that Laodice was married to Helicaon the son of Antenor Lescheus asserts that Helicaon being wounded in the noc turnal engagement was known by Ulysses and freed from the danger of the fight It may therefore be easily be lieved that neither Agamemnon nor Menelaus would act in an hostile manner towards the wife of Helicaon How ever Eupherion Chalcidensis asserts things respecting Laodice which are utterly void of probability Aster Laodice there is a stone prop on which there is a brazen laver Medusa sits on the ground holding this prop with ‚ both her hands Any one may rank Medusa among the daughters of Priam who has read the ode of Himeraeus Near Medusa there is an eld woman with her hair shaven to the skin or perhaps this may be an eunuch She holds a naked infant on her knees and the infant is re presented hcjding his hand before his eyes through fear CHAP OF GREECE 79 CHAP XXVtl TH respect to the dead bodies in the picture one of them is Pelis who is naked and is thrown on his fide Beneath him Eioneus and Admetus lie having on their coats of mail Lescheus informs us that Eioneus was llain by Neoptolemus and Admetus by Philoctetes Above these theje are other dead bodies Under the laver Leo critus the son of Polydamas lies who was slain by Ulysses Above Eioneus and Admetus is Cor≈ bus the son of Mygdon There is a noble monument of this Mygdon in the borders of the Ectorean Phrygians and from him poets denominate the Phrygians Mygdonians Cor≈ bus came to the wedding of Cassandra and according to general report was slain by Neoptolemus Lescheus fays that he was slain by Diomed Above Cor≈ bus are Priam Axion and Agenor Lescheus informs us that Priam was not slain at the altar of Hercean Jupiter but being dragged from the altar was beheaded by Neoptolemus when he met him before the doors of the palace With respect to Hecuba Stesichorus in his potm on the destruction of Troy fays that flie was transported by Apollo to Lycia But Lescheus fays that Axion was the son of Priam and that he was slain by Eurypylus the son of Eusemon The fame poet too asserts that Neoptolenlus slew Agenor And hence it appears that Echcclus the sort of Agenor was slain by Achilles and Agenor himself by Neoptolemus Sinon the companion of Ulysses and Anchialus arc car rying out the dead body of Laomedon Another dead body is painted here whose name is Eresus I do not N 2 know j8o THE DESCRIPTION know of any poet that has mentioned Eresus and Lao medon in his verses Here too the house of Antenor is represented and over the vestibule of it the skin of a leopard is suspended This was hung up as a signal to the Greeks that they should not injure the house of Antenor Theano likewise is painted with her sons One of these Glaucus sits on a coat of mail joined together with hol low parts t and Eurymachus sits on a stone Near him stands Antenor and after him follows Crino the daughter of Antenor She holds in her arms an infant boy AH these are painted with sorrowful countenances Servants are placing a chest and other furniture on an ass  and a little boy sits on the ass In this part of the picture there is the following elegy of Simonides I a The artist l olygnotus for his sire Who claims Aglaophon in Thasus born Painted the captur d tower of Troy CHAP XXVHI ThE other part of the picture which is on the left hand represents Ulysses descending to Hades that he may consult the soul of Tiresias about his safe return to his na tive country The particulars of the painting are as fol low ‚ A river presents itself to the view which is evidently Acheson Reeds are seen in this river and fishes whose forms are so obscure that you might conjecture they were rather shadows than fishes There is a ship too in this river and a ferryman standing by its oars Polygnotus as it appears to me in this part of the picture had an eye to the OF GREECE 181 the poem called Minyas in which there are the following verses upon Theseus and Pirithous Old Charon in his vessel fill d with shades Refus d these living heroes to admit r Hence Polygnotus has reprtsented Charon as an old man The persons in this vefiei cannot be very clearly discerned However Tellis who is very young is among these arW Cleoboea as yet a virgin On her knees she supports a cista or chest resembling such as are used in the solemn fes tivals of Ceres With respect toTellis I have only heard thus much that the poet Archilochus was his great grandson They say that Cleoboea was the first that brought the mysteries of Ceres from the ifland Paros to Thasus On the banks of Acheron an affair is repre sented which deserves to be particularly noticed A little below Charon a son who had behaved unjustly to his father is strangled by his father For the ancients very much reverenced their parents as may be inferred from other examples and from the actions of those in Catana who are called the pious For when this city was set on sire by mount √ tna these paid no attention to the pre servation of their silver and gold but one of them took up his father in his arms and the other his mother an 1 fled with them out of the city Through the rapid fury how ever of the fire they found great difficulty in making their escape yet notwithstanding this they did not leave their parents but palled through the stream of fire which as they fay separated itself into two parts and neither in jured them nor their parents These youths are even at present honoured by the Catan√ ans  In this picture of Polygnotus near the man who injured his father and is on this account punished in Hades there N 3 is ‚ i8a THE DESCRIPTION is a man suffering punishment for sacrilege A woman well acquainted with poisons and other instruments of punishment is represented tormenting him Men there i fore at that tine were remarkably pious towards the gods and this the Athenians evinced when they rook the temple of Olympian Jupiter among the Syracusans for they did not move any of die sacred offerings and suffered the Syraciisan priest who guarded the offerings still to continue his office This too the Mede Datis evinced for having found a statue of Apollo in a Ph≈ nician ship  he immediately gave it to the Tanagr√ ans to be carried back to Delium So that at that time all men venerated a divine nature and Polygnotus well knowing this painted the man suffering in Hades for sacrilege Above those which we have now enumerated is Euryhomus who according to the Delphic interpretersr of sacred con cerns is one of the d√ mons belonging to Hades and who eats the flesh of dead bodies so as to leave the bones quite bare However neither Homer in the Odyssey nor the poetical composition which is called Minyas nor the verses which are denominated No hi or the Return for in these there is an account of Hades and its terrors make any mention of the d√ mon Eurynomus I shall therefore describe the figure of Eurynomus as he appears in this picture His colour is between azure and black and is like that of flies which irifest meat He shews his teethj and firs on the skin of a vulture Auge and Iphimedea from Arcadia present themselves to the view after Eurynomus Auge came to MyGa which is near Tcuthras and is said to have brought forth a son the most like his father of all the women with which Hercules wr s connected Bui the Carians in Myless√ pay great honours to Iphimedea 2 CHAP OF GREECE x83 CHAP XXIX Above those which I have now numerated this picture contains a representation of the companions of Ulysses Perimedes and Eurylochus carrying victims and these are black rams After these there is a man seated and the inscription shews that he is Ocnus He is represented twisting a rope  and a female ass stands by him who eats the rope as fast he twists it They fay that this Ocnus was an industrious man who had an expensive wife and that whatever he collected by his industry she soon after found means to consume They are of opinion therefore that Polygnotus designed to represent this affair by the rope maker and his ass I know indeed that the lonians when they fee a man very industrious but at the fame time labouring without any emolument fay that he twists the rope of Ocnus Diviners too who prophesy from the flight os birds call a certain bird Ocnus and this bird is the largest and most beautiful of herons and at the fame time is very rare Tityus too is painted in this picture and is represented as no longer punished but perfectly wearied out with uninterrupted punishment There is likewise a certain obscure and imperfect image On turn ing your attention to the other parts of the picture you will fee Ariadne very near the man who twists the rope She sits on a rock and looks at her sister Ph√ dra and her body is suspended by a rope which she holds with both her hands Indeed the particulars respecting th¬ death of Ph√ dra are here signified in a more becoming manner But Bacchus took away Ariadne from Theseus N 4 either X84 THE DESCRIPTION either through the interference of some divine power or by stratagem as his naval forces were much superior tn those of Theseus This Bacchus too in my opinion was the fame with the one who first led an army to the Indies and first raised bridges over the Euphrates in that part of the city which is called Zeugma and where even at present a repe is preserved made of vine and ivy twigs which Bacchus is said to haye used when he built the bridges Many things indeed are reported concerning Bacchus both by the Greeks and Egyptian Under Phxdra Chloris reclines on the knees of Thyia He who asserts that a great friendship subsisted between these women while living will certainly not err This Chloris was a native of Orchomenus in Bceotia and it is said by some that she married Neleus the son of Ncp tune at that time when Neptune had connection with Thyia Procris the daughter of Erechtheus stands near Thyia  and after her you may fee Clymene with her back towards Thyia In the poem called Nostpi it is said tha Clymene was the daughter of Minyas and that she was married to Cephalus the son of Deion by whom she had Iphiclus Of Procris it is universally said that before Clymene she was married to Cephalus and that she was stain by her husband In the more interior part of the picture after Clymene you may see the Theban Megara ‚ who was the wife of Hercules She was however at length dismissed by Hercules in consequence of his being deprived of all the children which he had by her and be lieving that his connection with her was inauspicious Above the heads of those women we have just mentioned is the dajighter of Salmoneus sitting on a stone Eriphylc stands near her and raises the extremities of her fingers through OF GREECE 185 through her garment to her neck You may conjecture that she holds a necklace in that hand which is concealed in the folds of the garment Elpenor is represented above Eriphyle and Ulysses kneeling and holding a sword over a ditch The prophet Tiresias approaches to the ditch and after Tiresias Anticlea the mother of Ulysses is seen sitting on a stone Elpenor is covered with a mat made of bulrushes after the manner of sailors instead of a gar ment Theseus and Pirithous fit on a throne below Ulysses and of these Theseus holds the sword of Pirithous and his own sword in both his hands but Pirithous looks at the swords and seems to be indignant that he has no weapons to accomplish his daring enterprise PanyaGs aflerts in his verses that Theseus and Pirithous were not bound to the throne like captives but that a stone grew to their skin and served instead of bonds Homer in both his poems mentions the celebrated friendship of Theseus nd Pirithous For Ulysses thus speaks to the Ph√ acians Th illustrious Theseus and Pirithous sliades Fam d sons of gods I then perhaps had seen And in the Iliad Nestor when he exhorts Agamemnon and Achilles to lay aside their enmity thus speaks A godlike race of heroes once I knew Such as no more these aged eyes shall view  Lives there a chief to match Pirithous fame Dryas the bold or Ccncus deathless name Theseus endued with more than mortal might pr Polyphemus like the gods in fight CHAP i86 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XXX AfTER these Polygnotus has painted the daughters of Pandarus Homer in the speeches of Penelope fays that through the anger of the gods their parents died while they were virgins and that thus becoming orphans they were educated by Venus That they likewise received other benefits from other goddesses as for instance sufficient prudence and beauty of form from Juno tallness from Diana and such works as arc adapted to the female sex from Minerva Lastly that Venus ascended to heaven and obtained from Jupiter prosperous nuptials for the vir gins but that during the absence of Van us they were seized hy the harpies and delivered up to the Furies And such is the account given of them by Homer But Polygnotus has crowned them with flowers and has re presented them playing with dice The names of these women were Camiro and Clytie It appears too that their father Pandarus was a Milesian from Miletus a Cretan city and the associate of Tantalus both in his theft and fraudulent oath After the daughters of Pan darus Autilochus is seen with one os his feet on a stone and holding his head with both his hands Agamemnon succeeds Antilochus and he is represented leaning with his left arm on a sceptre and holding a wand in his hands Protesilaus fits looking at Achilles  and Patroclus stands above Achilles All these are beardless except Agamemnon Phocus is painted above these who appears to be quite a youth together with lascus who has a beard and OF GREECE 1 7 ‚ nd is endeavouring to take off a ring from the left hand finger of Phocus  and this for the following reason When Phocus the son of √ acus passed over from √ gina to that country which is now called Phocis and obtained the government of that part of the continent Iascus contracted a great friendship with him and gave him things suitable to his dignity and a stone seal set in gold But Phocus not long after this returning to √ gina lost his life through the stratagems of Peleus On this account therefore in the picture Iascus is desirous that the seal may be considered as a monument of his friend ship j and Phocus very readily suffers him to take it off his singer that he may prove his friendlhip by shewing it Above these is M√ ra sitting on a stone In the poem called Nostoi it is said that Ihe died while she was a vir gin and that she was the daughter of Proetus who was the son of Thersander and the grandson of Sisyphus  fter M√ ra you will fee Actxon the son of Arist√ us and his mother holding the fawn of a hind in her hands and sitting on the lkin of a hind A hunting dog stands near her ‚ and this on account of the life of Act√ on and the manner of his death If again you look to the lower parts of the picture you will fee after Patroclus Or pheus sitting on a certain hill with a harp in his left hand and in his right hand the leaves of a willow tree He is represented leaning on the trunk of this tree The grove itself appears to be sacred to Proserpine and abounds as Homer represents it with poplars and willows The figure of Orpheus is Grecian and neither his garment nor the covering on his head is Thracian Promedon Jeans on the other part of the willow Some are of opinion that thil name was introduced by Polygnotus iS3 THE DESCRIPTION Polygndtus as if he had found it in some poem Others again fay that Promedon was a Grecian who was very desirous of hearing all kinds of music and particularly that of Orpheus In this part of the picture too is Sche¬ dius who led the Phocenfes to Troy and after him is Pelias sitting on a throne and whose beard is equally hoary with his head He is represented looking at Or phcus But Schedius holds a dagger in his hand and is crowned with grafs Thamyris whose sight is destroyed fits near Pelias His whole figure is that of a humble ab ject man i his hair too and beard are thick and long Near his feet there is a lyre which appears to have been thrown down the bent parts of which are broken and the chords are burst Above him is Marsyas silting on a stone j and near Marsyas Olympus stands who is a boy in the flower of his youth and has the figure of one learning to play on the pipe The Phrygians who inhabit Cei√ n√ are of opinion that the river which runs through their country was once this Marsyas They add that Marsyas invented that melody of the pipe which the Greeks call Metroes or harmony sacred to the mothtr os the geds and that he assisted them when they were attacked fey the Gauls both by means of the water of the river Marsyas and the melody of his pipes CHAP XXXI If you again look to the upper parts of the picture you will fee in a continued series Salaminian Ajax next to Act√ on and afterwards Palamedes and Thersites play ing with dice which wer invented by Pakwnedes The other OF GREECE 189 other Ajax is looking at them while they are playing The colour of this Ajax is that of a sea faring man  and his body is yet wet with the foam of the sea Polygriotus seems to have collected the enemies of Ulysses into one place But the reason why Ajax the son of Oileus hated Ulysses was because Ulysses advised the Greeks to stone Ajax to death for the daring wickedness of his conduct towards Cassandra I know too from the Cyprian verses that Palamedes when he once went a fifhing was drowned by Ulysses and Diomed A little above Oilean Ajax Me  leager the son of Oeneus is painted and appears to be looking at Ajax All these except Palamedes have beards With respect to the death os Meleager Homer informs us that he was destroyed by one of the Furies through the imprecations of Alth√ a But the poem called the great Eoea and likewise the verses which are denominated MinyaSy fay that the Curetes were assisted by Apollo against the √ tolians and that Meleager was flain by Apollo With respect to the firebrand too as that it was given by the Fates to Alth√ a that Meleager would ne cessarily die when it was consumed by fire and that Al th√ a in a sit of anger burnt it‚ these particulars were first of all described by Phrynichus the son of Polyphrad mon in the drama Pleuron Dcstin d to a horrid fate Through his vengeful mother s hate Through her machinations dire lie wa picre d to death by fire By a brand s devouring flame Kindled by the fraudful dame However Phrynichus does not fay much respecting this affair which it might be supposed he would have done  loo THE DESCRIPTION done if it had been his own invention And hence it appears to me that he just mentions this circumstance as a thing well known to all Greece In the lowest parts of the picture after the Thracian Thamyris you will fee Hector fitting with both his hands on his left knee and exhibiting the appearance of a man oppressed with sorrow After him is Memnon sitting on a stone and close by him is Sarpedon leaning with his face on both his hands But one of the hands of Memnon is placed on the shoulder os Sarpedon And all these have a beard In the robe of Memnon too birds are painted and these birds are called Memnonides The inhabitants of Hellespont say that these birds on stated days every year fly to the se pulchre of Memnon and dig up every part about the tomb that is void of trees and grafs and afterwards sprinkle such parts with their wings which are wet with the water of the river √ sepus Near Memnon there is a naked √ thiopian boy because Memnon was a king of the √ thiopians However he came to the Trojan ‚ war not from √ thiopia but from Susa a Persian city and the river Choaspes having vanquished all those nations which are situated between Susa and the Choaspes The Phry gians too even at present shew a road through which he led his army at that time when he was selecting the shortest passages This road is cut through desert places Above Sarpedon and Memnon Paris is painted as yet a beardless youth He is represented clapping his hands alter the manner of rustics and you may conjecture that by this clapping he calls Penthesilea Penthesilea too is looking at Paris and by her countenance she appears to despise him and to consider him as a man of no estima tion But the figure of Penthesilea is that of a virgin with OF GREECE i9t with a bow like those in Scythia and with the skin of a leopard thrown about her shoulders Above Penthefilea there are certain persons carrying water in earthen urns full of holes One of these re sembles a virgin in the flower of her youth but the other appears to be more advanced in age There is no inscrip tion on each of these women but a common inscription on them shews that they are of the number of the unini tiated The women that are above these are Callisto the daughter of Lycaon Nomia and Pero the daughter of Neleus For this last Ncleus demands an ox of Iphi clus as a sponfal gist Callisto has the hide of a bear for her bed covering and her feet are placed on the knees of Nomia I have before shewn that according to the Ar cadians Nomia was one of the nymphs belonging to their country According to poets indeed nymphs live a great number of years but yet are not entirely exempt from death After Callisto and the women that are with her there is a representation of a precipice to he sum mit of which Sisyphus the son of √ olus endeavours to roll a stone In the fame part of the picture there are a large vessel an old man a boy and women sitting on a stone One of these of the same age with the old man stands by him but the others are carrying water You may conjecture that the old woman is pouring out the remains of the water from the perforated vessel into the large vessel again It appears to me that these person despised the Eleufinian mysteries For the more ancient Greeks considered these mysteries as much superior in dignity to all other institutions which lead to piety as gods are to heroes Below this large vessel Tantalus is represented suffering those punishments wluch are men tioned ipi THE DESCRIPTION tioned by Homer and besides these he is terrified lest d stone which hangs over his head should fall on him It is evident that Polygnotus followed Archilochus in this  but I cannot tell whether Archilochus was instructed in the particulars belonging to this stone by others And ib numerous are the figures and such the elegance of the picture which the Thasian artist painted C H A P XXXII A THEATRE which deserves to be inspected joins tct the enclosure of the temple And on ascending from the  enclosure you will see a statue of Bacchus which was de dicated by the Cnidians In the upper part too of the city there is a stadium which is built of such stone us the mountain Parnassus abounds with and this remained to the time of the Athenian Herodes who aderned it with Pentelican stone And such are the particulars of things remaining even at present at Delphos and which deserve to be mentioned On proceeding from Delphos to the summits of Parnassus at the distance of about sixty stadia you will fee a brazen statue and for a man not heavily clothed there is a rond here by which he may descend either with a mule or a horse to the ca vern Corycium This cavern was thus denominated from the nymph Corycia as I have a little before shewn Os all the caverns that I have ever seen I consider this as the most admirable For indeed no one would wish to discover the number of caverns on maritime coasts and in the profundities of the sea j but there are some of OF GREECE of a great name both in Greece and among the Bar barians Thus the Phrygians that dwell near the rivet Peucella and who derive their origin from Arcadia and the Azanes shew those who travel to their country a ca vern called Steunos This cavern is round and its alti tude is accommodated to descent and within it there is a temple of the mother of the gods and a statue of the goddess Themisonium is a city above Laodicea and it inhabited by the Phrygians and when the army of the Gauls spread all over Ionia and the neighbouring coasts bringing with them destruction wherever they came the Themisonians fay that Hercules Apollo and Mercury gave them assistance and that the rulers of their country ‚ were admonished by these divinities in a dream to order the men women and children to conceal themselves in a cavern belonging to this city In remembrance of this circumstance they have placed before the cavern statues of a moderate size of Hercules Mercury and Apollo and these statues they call Spela iui This cavern is about thirty stadia distant from the town  and in it there are fountains of water but there is not any path which leads to it nor does the light of the fun penetrate far into it And besides this the greatest part of the roof is very near the ground Among the Magnetx too who dwell near the river Leth√ us there is a place called Hyl√ and in it there is a cavern sacred to Apollo which for its magnitude does not demand much admiration but the statue of Apollo within this cavern is very ancient and imparts strength in overy undertak ing Hence men that are sacred to Apollo leap from precipices and lofty rocks without sustaining any injury and having torn up trees of a prodigious altitude by the Vol III O roots i9 THE DESCRIPTION roots carry them with case through the narrowest roads The cavern Corycium however surpasses in magnitude those we have mentioned and the greatest part of it may be descended into and this without a light The roof is sufficiently elevated above the ground and the cavern contains many fountains of water but a still greater quantity of water trickles from its top  so that the vestiges of drops of water may be seen throughout the cavern The inhabitants of Parnassus are of opinion that this cavern is particularly sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan But from hence to the summits of Parnassus the road to a man lightly clothed is difficult For the sum mits of this mountain are above the clouds and the Thy iades agitated with divine fury sacrifice on these summit to Bacchus and Apollo Tithorea too is about eighty stadia distant from Delphos to one who is travelling through Parnassu The road is not entirely mountain ous ‚ but that part of it which may be passed through by carriages is said to be longer by some stadia As to the name of the city I know that Herodotus in that part of his history in which he gives an account of the irruption of the Persians into Greece differs from what is asserted in the oracles of Bacis For Bacis calls these people Ti thorenscs but Herodotus fays that when the Barbarians invaded this country the inhabitants fied to the summit of Parnassus and he calls the city Neon and the summit of Parnassus Tithorea It appears therefore that all the country was at first called Tithorea but that in process of time when the inhabitants collected themselves into one city that which was once called Neon came to be denominated Tithorea The natives fay that this name was derived from the nymph  OF GREECE 195 nymph Tithorea who was one of those nymphs that ac cording to the ancient poets are produced from other trees and particularly from oaks But the affairs of the Tithoreans one age prior to mine were changed by the d√ mon to a worse condition At present however the apparatus of a theatre and the inclosure of a more an cient forum remain The particulars in the city which mostly deserve to be mentioned are a grove temple and statue of Minerva and a monument in remembrance of Antiope and Phocus In my account of the affairs of the Thebans I mentioned the insanity of Antiope through the anger of Bacchus and on what account she became the victim of divine anger I shewed too in the same place that she was married to Phocus the son of Orny tion and was buried with him  and besides this I indi cated what the oracle of Bacis asserted both concerning this sepulchre and that of Zethus and Amphion among the Thebans And such are the particulars which de serve to be mentioned in this town for there are not any besides these A river runs near the city of Tithorea and the inhabitants of the city descend to its banks and draw water from it The name of the river is Cachales The temple of √ sculapius is about eighty stadia distant from Tithorea and they call this god Archagetas or the prim√ val divinity He is honoured by the Tithoreans and by the rest of the Phocenfes Within the inclosure there are habitations for suppliants and the servants of the god but in the middle of it there is a temple and a stone statue which has a beard and is about two feet in altitude On the right hand of the statue there is a bed They are of opinion that they ought to sacrifice all kinds of yictims to the god except goats At the distance of about forty O a stadia 196 THE DESCRIPTION stadia from this temple of √ sculapius there is an inclosure and in it there is an adytum sacred to Ifis This is the most holy of every thing which the Greeks consecrate to this goddess For the Tithoreans neither think it proper to take up their residence here nor to suffer any to enter the adytum except such as the goddess Ifis informs them by a dream she thinks proper to admit The subterranean gods in the cities above the M√ ander act in just the fame manner for they exhibit in dreams the images of those persons who they are willing should be admitted into the adyta But the Tithoreans celebrate the Paneguris of Ifis twice a year viz in spring and in autumn And on the third day prior to each of these public solemnities those that are permitted to enter the adytum purify it after a certain secret manner and always bring into the fame place the relics of the victims which were sacrificed in the former solemnity and bury them there This place where they bury the relics is as far as I can conjecture about two stadia distant from the adytum And these are the cere monies which they perform on that day On the follow ing day they erect pedlars tents from reeds and other materials which they happen to meet with And on the last of the three days those who assemble in these tents fell slaves and cattle of every kind together with appa rel silver and gold After the middle of the day too they turn their attention to the sacrifice And then the more affluent sacrifice oxen and stags but the poorer fort geese and the birds called Meleagrides But they do not think proper to sacrifice swine nor do they em ploy on this occasion sheep or goats Such victims as they sacrifice they send into the adytum where a funeral 4 pile  OF GREECE 197 pile is raised for the sacrifice They reckoifcit necessary too to roll round the victims linen or flaxen bandages And this is the Egyptian mode of adorning the victims But they cause all the victims which are immolated to pass in the procession and it is the employment of some to send them into the adytum and of others who are before the adytum to burn the tents after which they speedily depart from this place They fay too that a certain person once among the number of those who are forbidden to enter the adytum and who indeed was a profane man when the pile was enkindled through curiosity and boldness entered the ady tum that all parts of it appeared to him to be full of spectres and that on his returning to Tithonca as soon as he had related all that he had seen he died I have heard things similar to these of a certain Ph≈ nician They say that the Egyptians celebrate the festival of Isis in that part of the year in which she bewails Osiris that then the Nile begins to ascend and that the vulgar of the natives fay that the tears of Isis cause the Nile to increase and irrigate the fields At that time therefore a certain Roman who was the prefect of Egypt per suaded a man for a sum os money to enter into the adytum of Isis in Coptos This man returned indeed but died as soon as he had told what he had seen Homer therefore appears to speak truly when he says that no man can clearly behold the gods and at the fame time be prosperous in his affairs But Tithor√ a produces fewer olives than either the Attic or Sicyonian land Its olives however are superior both in colour and sweet ness to those which are brought from Spain and I stria They form all various kinds of ointments from these and send these olives as a present to C√ sar O3 CHAP j98 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XXXIII But another road from Tithoraca leads to Ledon This was formerly reckoned a city but at present the Le dontii have abandoned it through the imbecility of their affairs and about eighty of them reside near the Cephis sus However the place of their residence is called Le don and they form a part of the Phocenfian convention just the fame as the Panopenses But from the place which is now inhabited near the Cephissus to the ruins of the former city there is a distance of forty stadia They fay that the city was denominated from one of its natives Other cities too besides this have been irre parably injured through the unjust conduct of their in habitants Thus Troy was entirely destroyed through the base behaviour of Paris towards Menelaus Thus the Milesians through the intemperate desire of and lawless love of Hesti√ us lost their city while he was at one time willing to reign in the city of Edonis at another time to be the counsellor of Darius and sometimes to return to Ionia And thus the Lcdentii severely suffered through the sacrilegious conduct of Philomelus But Lil√ a is distant from Delphos about one winter day s journey and you descend to it through Parnassus I conjecture that the distance is about one hundred and eighty stadia A second unfortunate circumstance from Macedonia op pressed this city after it was restored for being besieged by Demetrius the inhabitants were obliged to accede to conditions of peace and to admit a guard belonging to the enemy within their walls Nor were they freed from this bondage till one of the natives whose name was Patron OF GREECE 199 Patron incited all those that were capable of bearing arms to rife and having vanquished the Macedonians com pelled them to abandon the city and accede to the condi tions which he proposed And the Lil√ ans in remem brance of so great a benefit dedicated his statue at Delphos But in Lil√ a there are a theatre a forum and a bath There are likewise two temples one of Apollo and the other of Diana The statues in these temples are in an up right position were made by Attic artists and are of Pen telican stone They fay that Lilaea was one of the Naiades that she was the daughter of Cephissus and that from her the city was denominated The fountains of the river are in this place and the river rises from the earth not at all times quietly but for the most part and particularly in the middle of the day with a loud noise like the roar ing of a bull For three parts of the year viz in spring summer and autumn Lil√ a is a temperate region but the mountain Parnassus prevents it from being similarly temperate in winter A place called Cbaradra which is situated on a precipice is about thirty stadia distant from hence The inhabitants of this place labour under a great scarcity of water The river Charadrus supplies them with all the water they have and this river after run ning through shelving places pours itself into the Cephis sus It appears to me that the town Charadra was de nominated from this river But the Charadrse have two altars in the open air sacred to two of those who are called heroes Some are of opinion that these heroes are the Dioscuri and others fay that they are heroes belonging to this country The land too about the Cephissus is by far the best in all Phocis and is naturally adapted to the O 4 plantation so THE DESCRIPTION plantation of trees and the sowing of seeds of every kind and abounds with excellent pastures Hence they pay particular attention to the cultivation of this part of the country And hence there are some who think that Ho mer in the following verse by the Parapotamii or inha bitants of the river does not allude to a city but to those who cultivate the land near the Cephissus And those who near divine Cephissus dwell This opinion however may be confuted both by the history of Herodotus and the particulars which are re lated of the Pythian victories For the Amphictyons first instituted the Pythian games and the Parapotamian √ ch mseas was the first that in these games conquered boys in boxing In like manner Herodotus when he enume rates the cities of the Phocenscs which Xerxes burnt reckons among them the Parapotamians These people however were not restored by the Athenians and B≈ o tians but were obliged through imbecility and want of money to betake themselves to other cities The ruins indeed of this city do not at present remain nor is it even known where it formerly stood From Lil√ a there is a road of about sixty stadia in length which leads to Amphiclea The inhabitants of this place have corrupted the name of the city for He rodotus following the most ancient reports calls it Ophi tea and the Amphictyons when a decree was passed fpr destroying the cities of the Phocenses gave it the name pf Ophitea But the natives relate the following particu lars concerning this city A certain powerful man sus pecting the stratagems of his enemies placed his son in a vessel sijch as is used for the reception of liquor trusting OF GREECE 201 that in this place he would be concealed with security A wolf however rushed on the boy in his place of conceal ment but a strong dragon winding himself round the ves sel defended him from the assaults of the wolf The father some time after this came to fee his son and supposing that the dragon had destroyed him hurled his dart at the animal and together with the dragon flew his son But when he understood from certain shepherds that the boy was slain by his own hands and that the dragon had been the benevolent guardian of his son he raised a funeral pile for the dragon and the boy in common and they say that the place retains vestiges of this funeral pile even at present and that the city was denominated Ophitea from the dragon In this city that which principally deserve to be inspected is an adytum in which they perform the orgies of Bacchus The entrance to this adytum is visible but no statue belonging to it is apparent It is said by the Amphiclcenses that this god predicts to them future events and affords them remedies against diseases And the dis eases indeed of the Amphicleenses and neighbouring cities are healed through the information imparted to them in dreams But the priest of the adytum possesses a divining power and uses a divine afflatus Tithronium is about fifteen stadia distant from Amphiclea This town is situated in a plain and does not contain anything which deserves to be mentioned From Tithronium to Drym√ a there is a distance of twenty stadia But where the road which leads from Amphiclea to Drymxa joint with that which leads from Tithronium there are a grove and altar of Apollo which belong to the Tithronenses There is likewise a temple here but it does not contain any statue On directing your course to the left hand in this sot THE DESCRIPTION this part of the country at the distance of about eighty stadia from Amphiclea you will arrive at Drym√ a ac cording to the information of Herodotus The inhabitants of this place were formerly called Naubolenscs and they fay that their city was built by Phocus the son of √ acus But the Drymaji have an ancient temple of Ceres Thesmo phsros or the legislative deity In this temple there is a statue in an upright position j and they celebrate an an nual festival in honour of the goddess G H A P XXXIV Of all the cities too in Phocis except Delphos Elatea is the greatest This city is situated opposite to Amphiclea and is distant from it about one hundred and eighty stadia The greater part of this road is a plain  but near the walls of Elat√ a it has a gradual elevation Through the flat part of the road the river Cephissus slows and the birds called Otides feed on its banks The Elat√ ans defended themselves against and repelled the army of the Mace donians led by Cassander They likewise fled from Taxilus who commanded the army of Mithridates and for this the Romans gave them their freedom and suffered them to cultivate their land without paying tribute There is a dispute concerning their origin but they assert of them selves that they were formerly Arcadians For they fay that Elatus the son of Areas when the Phlegyans attacked Delphos fought in defence of the god and afterwards took up his residence together with his forces in Phocis and built the city Elatea Among the cities of Phocis too which OF GREECE 203 which the Persians burnt Elatea is numbered And this city was afflicted with many calamities in common with the Phocenses the Damon likewise prepared for them private misfortunes through the Macedonians But it was through the means of Olympiodorus that the siege of Caf fander and the Macedonians was rendered ineffectual Philip however the son of Demetrius having corrupted the principal persons of the city by gifts raised the greatest terror in the minds of the common people But Titus Flaminius being sent from Rome in order to give liberty to Greece declared that he would restore the Elat√ ans to their ancient polity if they would only revolt from the Macedonians However whether it was through the stu pidity of the common people or the persuasion of their rulers they continued faithful to Philip and suffered themselves to be besieged by the Romans Some time after this they sustained the siege of Taxi lus who commanded the army of Mithridates and of the Barbarians from Pontus ‚ and for this the Romans gave them their liberty When too in my time the Cos toboci who were a band of robbers infested Greece by their depredations and penetrated as far as to Elatea Mnesibulus having collected a number of chosen men made a great daughter of the Barbarians but fell himself in the engagement This Mnesibulus gained other vic tories in the stadium and in the two hundred and thirty fifth Olympiad was victorious in the stadium and in the repeated course with a shield In Elatea therefore near the road in which the races are run there is a brazen statue of Mnesibulus The Elateans too have a forum which deserves to be inspected and in ic there is a statue of Elatus on a pillar But I am not certain whether they designed 2o4 THE DESCRIPTION designed by this to honour the builder of their city or whether they raised this pillar as a mark of honour over a sepulchre They have likewise a temple of √ sculapius in which there is a statue with a beard The names of those who made this statue are Timocles and Timarchides and both of them derived their origin from the Attic land In the extremity of the city on the right hand there are a theatre and an ancient brazen statue of Minerva They fay that this goddess defended them against the Barbarians that fought under the command of Taxilus The temple too of Minerva Cran√ a is about twenty stadia distant from Elatea The road to this temple is rather steep but its elevation cannot be perceived by those that ascend it At the end of this road there is a hill which is for the most part steep but which is neither very bulky nor very lofty On the top of this hill is the temple of Minerva and in it there are porches and places of habitation in the porches Those that minister to the goddess dwell here and the person that presides over the sacred concerns in particular takes up his residence in one of these habitations They choose this person out of the number of beardless youths and take care that he resigns his office before he has a beard He performs the office of priest to the goddess for five continued years and during all this time he lives with the goddess and bathes himself in basons after the ancient manner But the statue of the goddess was made by the sons of Polycles and has the appearance of one prepared for a battle Her shield too is fashioned in imi tation of that among the Athenians which is called the shield of the virgin CHAP OF GREECE 20J CHAP XXXV A MOUNTAINOUS road on the right hand of Elatea leads to Ab√ and Hyampolis A public road likewise leads to the fame cities and this is the road which brings you from Orchomenos to Opus On pro ceeding therefore from Orchomenos to Opus and turning a little to the left hand you will fee a road which leads to Ab√ The inhabitants of this city fay that they came to Phocis from Argos and that their city was denominated irom Abas by whom it was built They add that Abas was the son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra the daughter of Danaus The Ab√ ans too have venerated Apollo from an early period of time and once possessed an oracle of the god But the Persians did not pay the fame venera tion to this divinity as the Romans did afterwards For the Romans through their piety to Apollo suffered the Ab√ ans to use their own laws but the army of Xerxes burnt the temple in Ab√ The Greeks however that op posed the Barbarians did not think proper to rebuild the temples of the Greeks which the Persians had burnt that the ruins of them might remain as perpetual monuments of hatred between the two nations Hence in the borders of the Haliartians many half burnt temples yet remain and among the Athenians in the Phaleric road there is a temple of Juno half burnt and this is the cafe with a temple of Ceres in Phalerum The temple in Ab√ ap pears to me to have exhibited an appearance of this kind at that time till in the Phocic war the Thebans fcurat those suppliants that had been vanquished in battle fled to6 THE DESCRIPTION fled to Ab√ and set on fire the temple which had been before half burnt by the Persians And hence at present this temple is in the most ruinous condition of all the buildings which have been injured by fire For this temple which had been injured by the Persian fire was afterwards injured in a still greater degree by that of the B≈ otians Near this great temple there is another temple which is not so large and this was dedicated by the emperor Adrian to Apollo The Ab√ ans however have statues more ancient than their temples and which they themselves dedicated Al these statues are brazen are in an erect position and are Apollo Latona and Diana The Ab√ ans too have a theatre and a forum both which are of ancient work manship But on returning into the straight road to Opus you will arrive at Hyampolis The name of this city in dicates the origin of its inhabitants and the place from which they fled to this country For the Hyantes being vanquished by Cadmus and his associates fled from Thebee into these parts And at first indeed their city was called by the neighbouring people the city of the Hyantes but in process of time it came to be denominated Hyam polis This city was burnt by Xerxes and afterwards en tirely subverted by Philip Yet notwithstanding this the or naments of the ancient forum still remain‚ a Bouhuterion or place of consultation and a theatre not far from the gates But the emperor Adrian built a porch here which bears his name The inhabitants of this city have but one well and they have no other water besides this either for bathing or drinking except the rain water which they collect in winter They venerate too Diana beyond all the divini ties and they have a temple of this goddess But I am ¬ not OF GREECE 207 not able to describe her statue because they only think proper to open the temple twice a year They say that such victims as are selected for Diana are not afflicted with any disease and grow fatter by feed ing than other cattle But not only the road to Delphos or Daulis through Panopeus leads from Ch√ ronea to Phocis and to the road which is called Scissa  but another road which is rough and for the most part mountainous conducts you from Ch√ ronea to a city of the Phocenses which is called Stiris The length of this road is about one hundred and twenty stadia The inhabitants of this city fay that they were formerly Athenians and that being expelled the Attic land together with Peteus the son of Orneus by √ geus they settled in this place They add that the city was called Stiris because a great part os those that followed Peteus belonged to the Stirienscs But the habitation of the Stirienses is in an elevated and rocky place and hence in summer they are in want of water For they have neither many wells nor is th¬ water which they afford fit to be drunk It serves how ever for baths and supplies beasts of burthen with drink The inhabitants indeed fetch the water which they drink from a fountain which is about four stadia distant from the town and which is dug out of a rock They are there fore obliged to descend in order to obtain this water In Stiris too there is a temple of Ceres who is called Stiritis This temple is raised from crude tiles but the statue of the goddess is made of Pentelican stone and has torches in its hands Near it there is another statue which is ancient and adorned with fillets CHAP 3o8 THE DESCRIPTION CHAP XXXVI But from Stiris to Ambryssus there is a plain roads which is about sixty stadia in length Between the moun tains here there is a plain  and there are many vines in the plain and plants called hysgini Brambles too grow here without intermission as well as vines This bramble the Ionians and the rest of the Greeks call coccos ot the grain with which scarlet it dyed but the Gauls above Phrygia call it in their native tongue Ut Its magnitude is nearly the fame with that of the white thorn but its leaves are blacker and softer than those of the bulrush In other respects however it resembles the bulrush Its fruit it similar to that of the solanum or nightshade and its mag nitude is equal to that of bitter vetches In the fruit too of the coccos a small animal breeds and this animal if it finds a passage to the air when the fruit is ripe imme diately takes wing and exhibits the appearance of a gnat But now before the animal can be conceived they gather the fruit of the coccos The blood too of this insect is use ful for the purpose of dying wool But Ambryssus is situ ated under mount Parnassus and the Delphi are beyond it They fay that the city was denominated from the hero Ambryssus TheThebans in the war against Philip and the Macedonians surrounded Ambryssus with a double wall j and in raising it used the stone which this place abounds with and which is of a black colour and very strong The measure of the circumference of each wall is but little Ihort of two paces but the altitude of each is about two paces OF GREECE Hog faces and a half in that part which has not yet fallen The interval between the two walls is about one pace But they neglected adorning these walls with battlements towers and other ornaments winch are usually added to walls because they were built merely for the purposes of defence The Ambryssenses too have a forum not very large and many of the stone statues which it contains are broLen On directing your course to Anticyra you will find the road at first steep  but after you have ascend ¬ ed it for about two stadia it becomes level And on the right hand of this road there is a temple of Dictynn√ an Diana The Ambryssenses particularly reverence this god dess  and her statue is of √ ginean workmanship and is made of black stone All the road from this temple of Diana to Anticyra is on the ascent They say that the more ancient name of the city is Cyparissus  and that Homer in his catalogue of the Phocenfes chooses rather to call this city Cyparissus than Anticyra for then it began to be called Anticyra They add that Anticyreus was contemporary with Hercules This city lies under the ruins of Medeon In the begin ning too of this account of the Phocensian affairs I have hewn that Medeon was one of those cities that plundered the temple of Apollo But the Antieyrans were driven from their country by Philip the son of Amyntas Titus Flaminius the commander of the Roman army subverted their city a second time because they adhered to Philip the son of Demetrius and king of the Macedonians But Titus was sent from Rome to assist the Athenians against Philip The mountains which are above Anticyra are very rocky and particularly abound with hellebore And the black sort indeed is used by the inhabltans as a purgative Vol III P but at¬ THE DESCRIPTION but the other sort which is white purifies by acting as an emetic The Anticyrans likewise have brazen statues in their forum In their haven too they have a temple of Neptune of a moderate size and which is built of chosen stones The inward parts are of white plaster The statue in this temple is of brass is in an upright position and stands with one of its feet on a dolphin One of its hands too is on its thigh and with the other it holds a tri dent They have besides two gymnasia One of these contains baths and in the other which is at some distance from this and is ancient there is a brazen statue The inscription on this statue signifies that it is the image of the pancratiast Xenodamus the Anticyran who was victo rious over men in the Olympic games If this inscription therefore is true it must follow that Xenodamus received the olive crown in the two hundred and eleventh Olym piad and that the Eleans have omitted to mention him alone in their account of the victors in the games Above the forum there is a fountain of water in a well and a roof supported by pillars screens this well from the fun A little beyond this well there is a monument raised from such stones as were accidentally found They fay that the sons of Iphitus are buried in this tomb that one of these returned safe from Troy and died in his own house but that the other Schedius fell before Troy and that his bones were brought hither CHAP OF GREECE CHAP XXXVII  On the right hand of the city and about the distance of two stadia from it thers is a lofty rock which is a part of a mountain On this rock there is a temple of Diana and the statue of the goddess which it contains was made by Praxiteles This statue has a torch in its right hand and a quiver depending from its shoulders and a dog stands on its left fnle The height too of the statue sur passes that of any woman  A city likewise named Bulis borders on Phocis This city was denominated from Bufon who brought a colony hither from the cities of ancient Doris The Bulidii form a part of the convention of Philomelus and the Phocenses There is a distance df eighty stadia from the B≈ otian city Thisbe to Bulis  but from Anticyra through the continent I do not know that there is any road for between Anticyra and Bulis there are mountains which arri both steep and rough From Anticyra to the port a distance of one hundred stadia in tervenes But from the port to Bulis I conjecture the  foot road is about seven stadia in length A torrent in this part of the country falls into the sea and the natives call this torrent Heracleios or Herculean Bulis too is situated on an eminence to such as fail from Anticyra to Lich√ um a promontory of the Corinthians More than half the inhabitants here live by catching shell fish for the dying of purple But there are not any ornaments in Bulis which deserve much admiration They have how ever two temples one of Diana and the other of Bac P 2 chus j af2 THE DESCRIPTION chus and the statues which they contain are made of wood Whom these were made by I cannot by any means conjecture The Bulidii denominate that god whom they venerate above all others the greatest  and in my opinion this is an appellation of Jupiter They have likewise a fountain which they call Saunion But to Cirrha which is a haven of the Delphi there is a road from Delphos of sixty stadia in length When you descend into the plain you will fee a Hippodrome in which the equestrian Pythian games are celebrated With respect to the Taraxippos in Olympia I have related the particulars concerning it in my account of the Elean affairs But in this Hippodrome of Apollo the charioteers sometimes meet with accidents that occa sion sorrow as the D√ mon in every undertaking distri butes to men sometimes prosperous and sometimes ad verse events However in this Hippodrome there is nothing which terrifies the horses and the origin of which might be referred to the anger of some hero or to some other cause But the plain which commences from Cirrha is entirely destitute of trees whether they are un willing to plant any in it through a certain dire execration or whether this arises from the inaptitude of the foil They fay that this city which is called Cirrha at present was thus denominated from the nymph Cirrha How ever Homer in the Iliad and in his hymn to Apollo calls this city by its ancient name Crissa But in after times when the inhabitants of Cirrha acted in other respects impiously towards Apollo and laid waste the country sacred to the god the Amphictyons thought proper to war on the Cirrhxans chose for the purpose Clisth¬ ne8 the Sicyonian tyrant for their general and ‚ ‚ brought OF GREECE 213 brought Solon from Athens that he might assist them by his councils On their consulting the oracle too respect ing the victory the Pythian deity thus answered them  You will not be able to subvert the tower os this city till the waves of azure eyed Amphitrite sounding on the black deep shall warn my grove Solon therefore per suaded them to consecrate the Cirrh√ an land to Apollo so that the grove of the god might be near the sea He likewise employed another stratagem against the Cirrh√ ans for he turned the course of the river Plistus which flowed into the city When the inhabitants too of the city resisted their besiegers drinking from wells and col lecting rain water Solon threw some roots of hellebore into the Plistus and when he perceived that the water was sufficiently infected with the poison turned the river again into its ancient channel The Cinrhaeans therefore drinking greedily of the water were afflicted with a vio lent flux and were no longer able to guard die walls In consequence of this the Amphictyons took the city and punished the Cirrh√ ans for their impiety to the god Then too Cirrha became the haven of the Delphi This city likewise contains a temple of Apollo Diana and La tona and in it there are large statues of Attic workman ship In the fame temple too there is a statue of Adrastla but this is not so large as the other statues a CHAP XXXVIII But the land of those Locrians who are called Ozolae is next to Phocis after Cirrha I have heard different re ports concerning the appellation of these Locstatis But P 3 I will 5ii4 THE DESCRIPTION I will relate all that I have heard When Orestheus th 9 son of Deucalion reigned in this country a bitch was de livered of a piece of wood instead of a whelp This piece of wood Orestheus buried in the ground  and they fay that in the following spring a vine was produced from it and that from the wood of its branches ozci the people were called Ozo a Others again fay that Nessus who carried the wife of Hercules over the river Evenus did not immediately die of the wound which he received from Hercules but fled to this country j that he died here and that the air became noxious from the filthy odour of his dead body There is likewise a third report that a foetid vapour was exhaled from the water of a cer tain river and a fourth that this country abounds with asphodel and that the smell of it was very predominant It is also said that the first inhabitants of this place were autochthones or earth born and that in consequence of their not having yet learnt to weave garments they used to cover their bodies as a defence from the cold with the recent skins of wild beasts at the fame time turning the hairy part of the hide outwards for the fake of ornament And hence the smell of their bodies necessarily resembled that of the skins But Aniphifla is about one hundred and twenty stadia distant from Delphos and is the largest and most celebrated city of the Delphi The inhabitants pf this city have joined themselves to the √ tolians in con sequence of being ashamed of the name of the Ozol√ Indeed it is probable that Augustus C√ sar subverted the country of the √ tolians in order to people Nicopolis and that he caused a great part of them to migrate to Am phissa However these people originated from the Lo prians j and their city as they fay was denominated from Amphissa OF GREECE 215 Amphisla the daughter of Macareus the son of √ olus and who was beloved by Apollo This city is adorned with many excellent pieces of ‚ workmanship but the monuments of Amphisla and An dr√ rnon deserve to be mentioned beyond all the rest They say that Gorge the wise os Andrxmon and daughter of Oeneus is buried here with Andr√ mon But in the tower there is a temple of Minerva and in it an erect brazen statue They say that this statue was brought by Thoas from Troy and that it belonged to the Trojan spoils This however I cannot believe For in the former part of this work I have fliewn that the Samians Rhcecus the son of Philaeus and Theodorus the son of Telecles were the first that found out the art of casting brass But I have not yet been able to find any of the works of Theo dorus which consist of brass But in the temple of Ephe fian Diana as you approach to that cell which contains certain pictures you will fee above the altar of Diana who is called Protothronia a stone inclosure Upon this in closure there are other statues and an image of a woman near its extremity This statue was made by Rhcecus and the Ephesians call it Night The statue therefore of Minerva in Amphisla is more ancient in its appearance and the art displayed in its fabrication is less polilhed The Amphissenses too celebrate the mysteries of the youths who are called AnaEles Of these gods there arc various opinions For according to some they are the Dioscuri according to others the Curetes and a still greater number think that they are the Cabiri These Locrians too have other cities Thus above Amphissa and towards the continent is the city Myonia This city is P4 distant aio THE DESCRIPTION distant from Amphissa thirty stadia and the Inhabitant dedicated a shield to Jupiter in Olympia It is likewise situated in a lofty place and contains a grove and altar of the gods called Meilicbioi or the mild To these divini ties they perform nocturnal sacrifices and they consume the flesh os the victims in the place where they sacrifice before the fun rises Above the city too there is a grove of Neptune and this they call Poseidonion In it there is a temple of Neptune  but it has not at present any statue These people therefore dwell above Amphissa But Oeanthea borders on the sea and in the neighbour hood of this city is Naupactus All the other Locrian cities too except Amphissa are in subjection to the Pa trenses who were invested with this authority by the em peror Augustus In this city Oeanthea there is a temple of Venus j and a little above the city there is a grove of cypress and pine trees In this grove there are a temple and statue of Diana But the paintings on the walls are obliterated by time so that not one of them remains for inspection I conjecture that the city was denominated from a woman or a nymph For as to what pertains to Naupactus I know it is reported that the Dorienses to gether with the sons of Aristomachus built a sleet in this place for the purpose of sailing to Peloponnesus and that from this circumstance the city was denominated With respect to the Naupactians how the Athenians gave the Meslenians who took up their residence inlthome when Sparta was shaken by an earthquake Naupactus to in habit which they had taken from the Locrians  and how after the slaughter of the Athenians at √ gospotamos the Jjaccdxmonians expelled the Messenians from Naupactus ‚ these OF GREECE 217 ‚ these particulars I have copiously related in my account of the Messenian affairs The Messenians therefore being obliged to leave Naupactus the Locrians again took possession of it As to the verses which the Greeks call Naupactia they are commonly attributed to a Milesian but Charon the son of Pytheus fays that they were composed by the Naupactian Carcinus and this is our opinion on the sub ject For how can it be reasonable to suppose that verses upon women composed by a Milesian should be called Naupactian But in Naupactus there is near the sea a temple of Neptune and in the temple there is an erect statue of brass There is likewise a temple of Diana which contains a statue of white stone in the attitude of discharging an arrow They denominate the goddess √ tola Venus too is honoured in a cavern and they pray to this goddess on other occasions but widows in particular request of her that they may be again mar ried As to the temple of √ sculapius it is nothing but ruins But at first it was built by a private man whose name was Phalysius For it happened that when his eyes were so diseased that he was almost blind the god who is worshipped in Epidaurus sent to him Anyte a woman re nowned for composing verses with a letter Anyte dreamt that he received this letter but when she awoke found it in her hands sealed She therefore sailed to Nau pactus and ordered Phalysius to break the seal and read its contents And at first indeed he thought it was not possible for him to read the letter as his eyes were in such a diseased condition but hoping that it might be the Si8 DESCRIPTION OF GREECE the means of procuring him some assistance from √ scu lapius he at length opened it was immediately cured of his malady and gave Anyte two thousand pieces of gold

Orpheus the father of gods and men ruler and ling and the supreme os rulers ¬ mlo¬ xp¬ o¬ 4i¬ On account therefore of his commanding or ruling characteristic he is very properly represented with a sceptre which is certainly an obvious symbol of command The symbol of victory likewise justly belongs to him on account of his all subduing power which vanquishes all mundane opposi tion and causes the war of th c universe to terminate in peace Proclu8 on the Cratylus informs us that his sceptre according to Orpheus was twenty four measures in length by which fays he the theologist signifies his establishing those two divine orders the celestial and supercelestial and his reigning over two series of gods each of which is characterised by the number twelve yap itrlotf upipuri Jiaxeff fiov tovT

first subsisterce is the Demiurgus or artificer of the world and thai he is received from thence into all the follow ing orders of gods Hence there are various Jupiters who preside over the different parts of the universe and all of whom are suspended from the first Jupiter the Demiurgus so as to form various links of that divine chain which on aecount of its fticorrftpliblc nature is beautifully called by Homer a golden chain The tto NOTES ON THE The same must be understood of every other divinity considered according to his highest subsistence j viz that various other divi nities of the fame characteristic proceed from him into the part of the world and if the reader carefully attends to this theory when he reads Homer or the fables of any other ancient theolo gical poet and is able to apply it properly he will find that the theology of the ancients is founded in a theory no less beautifully connected than astonishingly profound  no less enchanting than scientific no less true than marvellous and mystic See more concerning this most important subject in my Note on the Cra tylus and Introduction to the Parmenides of Plato in my Translation of Sallust on the Gods and the World and of the Emperor Julian s Oration to the Sun and to the Mother of the Cods Page 4 Thegoddejses calledGcnetyllides The Scholiast upon Aristophanes informs us that Genetyllis is an epithet of yeans and that she is so called because she presides over the generation of animals Perhaps therefore as there are two Venuses as we shall fee hereafter the Genetyllides are these two Page 6 And of Iacchus holding a torch  There is great pro priety in representing Iacchus or Bacchus with a torch for Bacchus is the mundane intelkH and fire with the ancients was very properly considered as a symbol of inttllcH from its tending upwards Page 6 ‚ and this Bacchus they call Melpomenos The Orphic theologists asIhaveshcwn inp iot of the Dissertation prefixed to my Translation of Orphcus s Hymns called the intellect of each of the celestial spheres by some one of the appellations of Bacchus and the foul or animating part of the sphere by the name of one of the Muses Agreeably to this in the orb of the fun they called the intelleHive part Trictcricus Bacchus and the animating part Melpomene But as the intellect and foul of the fun and so of every other orb form one divine nature from their admirable union with each other the intellect of this sphere may be justly called FIRST VOLUME tit Called Melpomenos and it would be by no means improper to call the animating part Trieteric Page 7 They report indeed that the father of Erichthoniut ¬ f The fables of the ancients are in their secret meaning utility and construction the most beautiful and admirable pieces of com position which the mind of man is capable of framing though nothing has been so little understood or so shamefully abused Of the truth of this observation the reader whose mind has been enlightened by true science will be fully convinced by the following explanation drawn from ancient sources of the fable alluded to by Paufanias in this part Previous to which it will be proper to observe that the first cause according to the Pytha gorean and Platonic philosophers on account of his transcendent simplicity was called the one this name being adapted the best of all others to a nature truly ineffable and unknown But it is impossible that such a nature could produce this visible world without mediums since if this had been the cafe all things must have been like himself natures ineffable and unknown It is neecstary therefore that there should be certain mighty powers between the first cause and us  for we in reality are nothing more than the dregs of the universe These mighty powers from their surpassing similitude to the first god were very properly called by the ancients gods and were considered by them as perpe tually subsisting in the most admirable and profound union with  each other and the first cause yet so as amidst this union to preserve their own essence distinct from that of the highest god Hence as Froclus beautifully observes they may be compared to trees rooted in the earth  for as these by their roots are united with the earth and become earthly in an eminent degree Avith out being eatth itself so the gods by their summits are pro foundly united to the first cause and by this means are transcen dency similar to without being the first cause But these mighty powers are called by the poets a golden chain on account of their connection with each other and incorrup tible 22S NOTES ON THE tible nature Now the first of these powers you may call InteU leclual the second ‚ vivtsic  the third Paonian and so on which the ancients desiring to signify to us by names have symbolically denominated Henpe says Olympiodorus in MS Comment in Gorgiam we ought not to be disturbed on hearing such names as a Saturnian power the power Jupiter and such like but explore the things to which they allude Thus for instance by a Saturnian power rooted in the first cause understand a pure intellect  for Kgoto or Saturn is xogo i e 5 xaSafOf or a pure intellect Hence fays Olympiodorus we call those that are pure and virgins xogai He adds On this account poets  fay that Saturn devoured his children and afterwards again sent them into the light because intellect is converted to itself seeks itself and is itself sought but he again refunds them because intel lect not only seeks and procreates but produces into light aud profits On this account too he is called a xvXop¬ Ti or infleSed counsel because an inflected figure verges to itself Again as there is nothing disordered and novel in intellect they represent Saturn as an old man and as flow in his motion and hence it is that astrologers fay that such as have Saturn well situated in their nativity are prudent and endued with intellect Again the ancient theologists called life by the name of Ju piter to whom they gave a two fold appellation J and r m signifying by these names that he gives life through himself Farther still they aflert that the Sun is drawn by four horses and that he is perpetually young signifying by this his power which is motive of the whole of nature subject to his dominion his fourfold conversions and the vigour of his energies But they fay that the Moon is drawn by two bulls  by two on account of her increase and diminution but by bulls because as these till the ground so the Moon governs all those parts which surround the earth  This is asserted by Hcsiod in his Thcogony Th¬ FIRST VOLUME 323 This being premised as a specimen of the manner in which fables are to be understood let us consider the meaning of that to which Pausaniasalludes According to the fable then Vulcan falling in love with Minerva emitted his feed on the earth and from hence sprang the race of the Athenians ‚ By Vulcan therefore we must understand that divine power which presides over the spermatic and physical reasons which the universe con tains for whatever Nature accomplishes by verging towards bodies the fame Vulcan performs in a divine and exempt manner by moving Nature and using her as an instrument in his own proper fabrication  for natural heat has a Vulcanian characteristic and was produced by Vulcan for the purpose of fabricating a cor poreal nature Vulcan therefore is that power which perpe tually presides over the fluctuating nature of bodies and hence fays Olympiodorus he operates with bellows iifvrai which occultly signifies his operating in natures avli nv ntatf fiwicn But by earth we must understand matter which was thus symboli cally denominated by the ancients as we learn from Porphyry de Antr Nymph By Minerva we must understand the summit xopvpn of all those intellectual natures that reside in Jupiter the artificer of the world or in other words he is that deity which illuminates all mundane natures with intelligence The Athenians therefore who are fouls of a Minerval characteristic may be very properly said to be the progeny of Vulcan and the Earth because Vulcan who perpetually imitates the intellectual energy of Minerva in his fabrication of the sensible universe imparts to them through this imitation those vehicles and those spermatic reasons through which in conjunction with matter they become inhabitants of this ter restrial abode

known fable of Phaeton Phaeton signifies a comet by which considerable parts of the earth are at times destroyed But he is said to be the offspring of the Sun because a comet according to the Pla tonistt is a sublunary body confiding of a collection of dry va pours raised and set on fire by the Sun He is likewise said to have desired the government of the chariot of the Sun because a comet desires to imitate the circular motion of the Sun He did not keep the track observed by his parent because a comet does not move in a direction parallel to that of the Sun He was blasted by thunder through the anger of Jupiter because this comet was extinguished by moist vapours On this account he is said to have fallen into the river Eridanus because the comet was extinguished through moisture He was lamented by the Heliades because the vapour proceeding from the dissolution of 5 the First volume h the comet flowed downwards being of a watry nature and in this respect corresponding to tears The Heliades were changed into poplar trees because a juice distills from the poplar tree similar to amber and amber has a golden splendour and gold is dedicated to the Sun The fable therefore obscurely signifies that the juice of the poplar tree is produced from moisture simi lar to that which was produced by the dissolution of the comet Page 13 It is related by Herodotus Herodotus in Terpsich informs us that it was Clisthenes the Athenian of the family of the Alcm√ onid√ who divided the four Athenian tribes into ten Page 32 And tool care that globular vessels sfc Many of the present day are of opinion that the hips of the ancienta ‚ were of a very inconsiderable size though a small degree of re flection must convince every unprejudiced mind that hips which contained many banks of rowers and great quantities of armed men must have been very large vessels But the following ac count of a Ihip constructed by Ptolemy Philopater from Plutarch in his Life of that great commander Demetrius abundantly proves the truth of what I have advanced Before the time of De metrius fays he there had not been seen a galley with Jiftten or Jixteen banks of oart But after Demetrius Ptolemy Philopater built a prodigious galley of eighty banks of oars It was two hundred and eighty cubits in length Its height from the water to the top of the stern was forty eight cubits It had four hundred mariners and four thousand rowers and besides all this there was convenient standing for nearly three thousand soldiers to fight above the decks It is true that Plutarch adds this unwitldy hulk was ¬ nly fit for mew and not for service but it assords a very convincing proof that the ancients had concep tions of framing much larger hips than any of the present time and it appears to me that the sixteen oared gallep of Demetrius mentioned by Plutarch must have been at least as large as our first rate men of war The reader may fee a large and very en Vol III Q_ tertaining 226 NOTES ON

one who passes in a regular manner from a sen sible to an intellectual life he very properly describes him after having braved the storms of the ocean or the dangers and diificul ‚ ties attending a life subordinate to that of intellect as destined to arrive among a people to whom the sea was unknown or in other words to live a life wholly intellectual and divine As Pau sanias therefore was pious but without philosophy he could not have any conception of the concealed philosophical meaning of Homer in the fable of Ulysses Sec more concerning this in my translation of and notes to Porphyry s Cave of the Nymphs in vol ii of Proclus on Euclid  Page 3 7 Pyrrhus received a wound in his hcad It appears from Livy 1 29 c 18 and Plutarch in Pyrrho that Pyrrhus was lain in this manner as a just punishment for his impiety in plunder ing the treasuries of the temple of Proserpine Page 39 It was my intention indeed c It is a circum stance remarkably singular that the Pythagorean philosopher Numenius was as well as Pausanias deterred by a dream from disclosing the Eleusmian mysteries Before the extinction of the gehuine religion of mankind indeed and the introduction of gigantic imfi ly it must have been highly improper to unfold these mysteries to all men but when delusive faith succeeded to scientific theology and divine mystery was no more it then became necessary to reveal this most holy and august institution Thi¬ appears to have been done by the latter Platonists and from some important passages which fortunately yet remain in the manuscript Commentaries of these great men on Plate I have been  FIRST VOLUME 227 been enabled to unfold the leading particulars of this interesting affair These particulars the reader may find in my Dissertation on the Elcustnian and Bacchic Myjleries Page 41 Near this is the temple of Celejlial Venus The Celes tial Venus for there are two Venufes as is well known is that divine power which collects together the different genera of things according to one desire of beauty She is therefore very properly said to derive her subsistence from the prolific power of Heaven for Heaven as I have hewn in my notes on the Craty lus composes that order of gods which is called by the Chaldseart Theologists rouTo voijoc i e intelligible and at the fame timcintcl leftual which corresponds to intelligence and is wholly of a containing and conn 8ive nature But the second Venus fays Proclus in Schol MSS in Cratylum Jupiter produces from his own generative powers in conjunction with Dione and this goddess likewise proceeds from foam after the fame manner with the more ancient Venus as Orpheus evinces But these goddesses differ from each other according to the causes of their production their orders and their powers For she that pro ceeds from the genitals of Heaven is supermundane leads up wards to intelligible beauty is the supplier of an unpolluted life and separates from generation But the Venus that pro ceeds from Dione governs all the co ordinations in the celestial world and the earth binds them to each other and perfects their generative progressions through a kindred conjunction These  divinities too are united with each other through a similitude of subsistence for they both proceed from generative powers one from that of the containing power of Heaven and the other from that of Jupiter the artificer of the world He adds that by the sea we must understand an expanded and circum scribed life by its profundity the universally extended progres sion of such a life and by the foam the greatest purity of natute that which is full of prolific light and power that which swims upon all life and is as it were its highest flower Qj It ¬ 22S NOTES ON THE It is remarkable that according to the first of these passages the second Venus was produced from foam in the fame manner as the first as Proclus proves from the authority of the Orphic writings for this information is not to be gathered from any other writer that 1 am acquainted with Nor need it seem strange that this should be mentioned by no ancient author prior to Proclus for before the establishment of the Christian religion the Orphic writings were deservedly held in such great veneration from containing the ceremonies of a mode of wor ship coeval with the universe that the less mystic parts of them were but seldom cited and the most mystic not at all As Pro clus therefore was the man that unfolded the theology and phi losophy of the Greeks in the most consummate perfection and this at a period when the ancient religion was almost entirely extirpated and the Orphic writings were considered as sacred but by a few we cannot wonder at meeting with this and much similar information in the works of this incomparable man Page 46 They assert that he was once bound by Pluto c It appears to me that the great confusion and absurdity with which modern explanations of the fables of the ancients are re plete may be ascribed to the two following causes the want of ability to distinguish in the same person history from fable and ignorance of the secret meaning of ancient fable Thus in the present instance most of the moderns would I am persuaded consider this story about Theseus as at bottom merely historical though it is in fact one of those ancient fables which are replete with the most philosophical and mystic information At present indeed it does not seem to be even suspected by any one that the theology of the Greeks when viewed in its genuine purity is a thing the most sublime and scientific that the mind of maa can possibly devise and that consequently as the Grecian fables are the progeny of this theology they cannot fail of being re markably scientific and sublime That the reader therefore whose mental eye is not so darkened by oblivion as to exclude all FIRST VOLUME 229 all possibility of recovering the use of it in the present life may be convinced of the truth of the preceding observations let him attend to the following information derived from the phi losophy of Pythagoras and Plato There are three orders of fouls which are the perpetual at tendants of the gods The first of these orders angels compose the second d√ mons and the third heroes But as there is no vacuum either in incorporeal or corporeal natur s but on the contrary profound union it is necessary in order to accomplish this that the last link of a superior order should coalesce with the summit of one proximately inferior Hence therefore between essential heroes who perpetually attend the gods and are con sequently impassive and pure nnd the bulk of human souls who descend with pasfivity and impurity it is necessary there should be an order of human souls who descend with impassivity and purity These souls were called by the ancients with great pro priety Heroes on account of their high degree of proximity and alliance to such as are essentially Heroes Hercules Theseus Py thagoras Plato c were fouls of this kind who descended into generation both to benefit other souls and in compliance with that necessity by which all natures inferior to the perpetual at tendants of the gods are at times obliged to descend The cha racteristics of these heroic souls are grandeur of action elevation and magnificence and Plato in his Laws fays that we ought to Venerate them and perform funera sacrifices in honour of their memory They are too of an undefiled nature when compared with other human fouls than whom they are likewise far more intellectual They have much of an elevated nature and which is properly liberated from an inclination to matter Hence they are easily led back to the intelligible world in which they live for many periods while on the contrary the most irrational kind of fouls are either never led back or this is accomplished with great difficulty or continues for a very inconsiderable period of time 3  But 23¬ NOTES ON THE But as every gad beginning from on high produces his pro per series as far as to the last of things and this series compre hends many essences different from each other such as Angelical D√ moniacal Heroical Nymphical and the like the lowest pow ers of these orders have a great communion and physical sym pathy with the human race end contribute to the perfection of all their natural operations and particularly to their procreations As these heroic souls too have a two fold form of life viz epi nionative and cogitative the former of which is called by Plato in the Tim√ us the circle of difference and the latter the circle of sameness and which are characterised by the properties of male and female hence these souls at one time exhibit a deiform power by energizing according to the masculine prerogative of their na ture or the circle of sameness and at another time according to their feminine prerogative or the circle of difference ytt so as that according to both these energies they act with rectitude and without merging themselves in the darkness of body They likewise know the natures prior to their own and exercise a pro vidential care over inferior concerns without at the fame time having that propensity to such concerns which is found in the bulk of mankind But the fouls which act erroneously according to the energies of both these circles or which in other words neither exhibit accurate specimens of practical or intellectual virtue‚ these differ in no respect from gregarious souls or the herd of mankind with whom the circle of sameness is fettered and the circle of difference sustains all various fractures and distortions As it is impossible therefore that these heroic souls can act with equal vigour and perfection according to both these circles at once at this is the province of natures more divine than the human it is necessary that they must sometimes descend and energize principally according to their opinionative part and sometimes according to their more intellectual part Hence one of these circles must energize naturally and the other be hinder ed FIRST VOLUME 2 t ed from its proper energy On this account Heroes are called ijjxiSioi Demigods as having only one of their circles illuminated by the gods Such of these therefore as have the circle of lameness unfettered as are roused to an elevated life and are moved about it according to a deific energy‚ these are said to have a god for their father and a mortal for their mother through a defect with respect to the opinionative form of life But such on the contrary as energize without impediment ac cording to the circle of difference who act with becoming rectitude in practical affairs and at the fame time cntlntsia licallyt or in other words under the inspiring influence of divinity‚ these are said to have a mortal for their father and a goddess for their mother And in stiort rectitude of energy in each of these circles is to be ascribed to a divine cause which illuminates invigorates and excites them in the mod unrestrained and im paiTive manner without destroying freedom of energy in the circles themselves or causing any partial affection sympathy or tendency in illuminating deity When the circle of sameness therefore has dominion the divine cause of illumination is aid to be masculine and paternal but when the circle of difference predominates it is said to be maternal Hence Achilles act8 with rectitude in practical affairs and at the fame time exhibits specimens of magnificent vehement and divinely inspired ener gy as being the son of a goddess And inch is his attachment to practical virtue that even when in Hades Homer represents him as desiring a union with body that he may aflist his father While on the contrary Minos and Rhadamanthus who were heroes illuminated by Jupiter raised themselves from generation to true being and meddled with mortal conctrns no farther dun absolute necessity required Theseus therefore who as well as Hercules was a hero who energized principally aicording to an intellec ual life uid v o was a lover of both intelligible and feasible heatiiv may be saci 10 liave been bound by Pluto while he was united with body be i 23¬ NOTES ON THE cause every thing sublunary is under the dominion of this god and to have been liberated by Hercules because through his assistance he was led from a sensible to an intellectual life which has the fame relation to a corporeal life as the light of day to the darkness of night Page 46 But it appears to me that Homer We should rather say that Homer derived his knowledge respecting the souls in Hades and the names of the infernal rivers which it contains from the mystic traditions of Orpheus who instituted the religion of Greece and that the rivers called Acheron and Cocytus in Cichyrus were denominated from their similitude to those of the same name in Hades But the reader must not suppose that the infernal rivers described by Homer are nothing more than the paradoxical sports of poetical fancy but as Proclus on Plato s Republic beautifully observes it is proper to believe that for those who require chastisement and purification subterranean places are prepared which from their receiving the various de fluxions of the elements above the earth are called rivers by my thologists and are filled with d√ mons who preside over fouls and who are of an avenging punishing purifying and judicial characteristic Hence says he the poetry of Homer is not to be condemned when it calls the infernal region a place Horrid and dark and odious to the gods For the variety and imagination of the presiding d√ mons excite all this obscurity and horror I only add that Acheron is a place adapted to the purgation of care and sorrow and which als¬ cor responds to air and the meridional part of the world but that Cocytus together with Styx correspond to earth and the western centre and punish hatred through lamentations and grief See more on this subject in my Introduction to the Ph√ do of Plato Page 49 Olett Olen was a Lyclan poet and composed hymns in honour of Apollo at Delos FIRST VOLUME 3j  Page 51 That Ccicjlid Venus ts the eldest of those divinities who are called the Parca We have already observed that there arc two Venuses one supermundane the other mundane The first of these is the Celestial Venus mentioned in this place by Paufanias as the eldest of the Parc√ though according to the Orphic hymn to this goddess and which I have no doubt is the truth she is the ruler of the Fates for the Hymn fays ¬ u tfastut tjktuwv f oi¬ iur thou governs I the three Fates Page 5 2 And the temple of Diana the huntress The sphere of the Moon is as is well known attributed to the goddess Diana and this divinity as we are informed by Proclus in Tim p 260 is the cause of nature to mortals as she is the felf confpicuous image of fontal Nature Sitam fut am¬ toit J T 1o T7 pvtrWi to avroiBat ayahyta tfiaa Tut amyoiof fvnuf As the Moon therefore is the cause of the existence of all na tural life so likewise of its dissolution for the natural life which she imparts to all animals and plants brings with it a limited duration and when the period of its existence is accomplished returns to this divinity as its fountain Hence Diana is very properly represented as a huntress for through certain unappa rent powers resident in the rays of the Moon of which arrows are an image she takes away or in other words receives back again the natural life which he gave Page 54 Bacchus leading Vulcan bad to heaven The meaning of this beautiful fable appears to me to be as follows Vulcan as we have already observed is that divine power which presides over the spermatic and physical reasons of the universe or in other woids which by using nature as an instrument produces all the bodies which the universe contains Juno is the inspec tive guardian of all motion and progression Hence she is said to have hurled Vulcan from heaven because the is the cause of Vul can s prolific progression to the extremity of things and of his being every where present with his productions in the most un restrained manner‚ in a manner by which this progression con tinually 1 234 NOTES ON THE tinually suspended from its proper principle pervades through every order But the golden throne which Vulcan fends to Juno is that vehicle depending on the goddess and from illu minating which she has a mundane establishment and the un apparent bonds which it contains are those vital connectives by which foul becomes united with body These bonds are said t¬ be fixed in the throne by Vulcan because this deity is superior to Juno considered according to her mundane establishment All the gods except Bacchus were unable to persuade Vulcan to free Juno from her bonds because Bacchus or the mundane intellect is the monad or proximately exempt producing cause of the ultimate progressions of all the gods and hence Vulcan consi dered according to his last procession is suspended from Bacchus by whom at the fame time he is converted on high Hence Bacchus is said to have led him back to heaven but it is added by means of intoxication i e by deific intelligence through which every inferior deity is converted to deities of a superior characteristic and all the gods become absorbed in the ineffable principle of all things Lastly by Vulcan freeing Juno from her bonds nothing more is meant than that this goddess according to her mundane establishment receives a power from Vulcan through which while he illuminates with a divine light her de pending vehicle flic is at the fame time exempt from all inclination and passive affection towards the subject of her illuminations and the fame reasoning must be applied to every mundane divinity Page 56 Gave that oracle concerning lhe lladtscr

23S Page 57 Ar d that Bacchus himself appeared as their leader The following Ptatonic dogma which belongs to the greatest arcana of ancient Wisdom solves all that appears to be so absurd end ridiculous to the atheistical and superficial in such like histo rical relations as the present Every deity beginning from on high produces his own proper series to the last of things and this series comprehends in itself mary essences differing from each Other Thus for instance the Sun produces Angelical De moniacal Heroical Nymphical Panical and such like powers each of which subsists according to a solar characteristic and the fame reasoning must be applied to every other divinity All these powers are the perpetual attendants of the Gcds but they have not all of them an essence wholly superior to man For aster essential Heroes an order of souls follows who proximately go vern the affairs of men and are dxmoniacal xxra axMl1i according to habitude or alliance but not essentially Of this kind are the Nymphs that sympathize with waters Pans with the feet of goats and the like and they d sser from those powers that arc essentially of a d√ moniacal characteristic in this that they assume a variety of shapes each of the others immutably preseiving one form are subject to various passions and are the causes of all various deception to mankind Proclus in Schol MSS in Cra tylum

therefore that appeared to the Laced√ monians in the war mentioned by Pausanias must be considered as belonging to one of the orders ¬ f those powers we have just enumerated Page 236 NOTES ON THE  Page 61 Theseus when he departed to flay the Minotaur The explanation given by the moderns of the Minotaur and the other parts of the fable to which it belongs is as absurd and foreign from the truth as any of their solutions of ancient fables I shall make it appear fays the Abbe Banier with all the lav less levity of a Frenchman and in the true spirit of a Catholic divine that the Minotaur with Pafipbac and the rest of that fable contain nothing but an intrigue of the queen os Crete with a captain named Taurus  d the rtiLi c of D√ dalus only a fly confident And in this impudent manner he explains the most celebrated lables of antiquity It is true indeed that my own countrymen are at present unacquainted with the divine wisdom of the ancients but I do not know of any English writer that has attempted to explain the Grecian fables in a mani er so impertinenti trifl ng and absurd Surely every thinking mind must unite with me in acknowledging that if the ancients intend ed to conceal in their fables nothing more than what Banier pre sents us with their fables are far more puerile than the riddles composed by the ingenious Mr Newbery for children Lord Bacon though far from penetrating the profound meaning of the ancients in these fables saw enough to be convinced that they were replete with the highest wisdom of which he had any con ception and has done all in attempting to unfold them that great genius without the assistance ot genuine philosophy is able to effect But the most piercing sagacity the most brilliant wit and the most exquisite subtilty of thought without this assistance are here of no avail It is indeed easy for ingenious men to give an explanation of an ancient fable which to the superficial observer shall appear to be the precise meaning which its inventor designed to convey though it be in reality very far from the truth This may be easily accounted for by considering that all fables are images of  Vol i of the translation of his Mythology p 29 truth  FIRST VOLUME 237 truths but those of the ancients of truths with which but few ‚ re acquainted Hence like pictures of unknown persons they become the subjects of endless conjecture and absurd opinion from the similitude which every one fancies he discovers in them to objects with which he has been for a long time familiar He who understands the explanations given by the Platonic philoso phers of these fables will subscribe to the truth of this obser vation as it is impossible that these interpretations could so wonderfully harmonize with the external or apparent meaning of the fables without being the true explanations of their latent fense But to return to the fable in question Olympiodorus in his MS Commentary on the Gorgias of Plato beautifully unfolds most of it as follows The Minotaur signifies the savage passions which our nature contains The thread which Ariadne gave toTheseus a certain divine power conjoined with our nature And the labyrinth the obliquity and abundant variety of life Theseus therefore being one of the most excellent characters vanquished this impediment and freed others together with him self 0 it yaq f¬ w au 0 rot a ¬ ¬

mentioned was one of those heroes of whom we have given an account in the note to  46 andthat he was called Bacchus because he descended from the deity of that name Page 67 Hercules according to the fable strangling the Dra gons I havr already observed concerning Hercules that he was one of those exalted characters belonging to the human race who from their hi h degree of proximity and alliance to ejsenlial Heroes were justly called by ihe ancients Heroes xulct yi rn or according to habitude and that he energized principally ac cording to an intellectual life As Hercules therefore was a character of this kind it would be absurd to consider the pro digies related of him as historical facts but we should view them in the light of fables under which certain divine truths are con cealed Indeed to such as consider the accounts given of Her cules as historical fists we may very properly address the words of Plato to Dionylius when he was interrogating him on this very subject I mean the achievements of Hercules that if the things reported of Hercules are true he was neither the son of Jupiter nor blessed but on the contrary miserable but if he was the son of Jupiter and blessed

nicu ui a a XiO 11 ot ii o m ai iviai But the meaning of the present fable as Pausanias very pro perly calls it appears to be as follow A dragon is a symbol of the partial life of the foul i e of the life which she leads while separated from the gods for as a dragon is said to cast off its skin and become young again so the soul acquires rejuvenescency  OlymyioJori MSS Schol in Plawnis Gorgiara by  FIRST VOLUME 239 by alway9 descending into generation It is therefore by no means wonderful that Hercules who was born with intellectual prerogatives so much superior to the bulk of mankind should even from his infancy have been remarkably united with divine natures and thus may be said to have vanquished a partial life which is implied by his strangling dragons in his infancy I only add farther concerning Hercules at present that as he descended from Jupiter it appears to me that his life was both politic and philosophic and this in the highest degree possible to human nature Page 67 Minerva rifing from tht head of Jupiter Minerva as Plato beautifully observes in the Cratylus is deific intelligence and hence she is said to have proceeded from the head of Jupiter or the demiurgic intellect by which the world was produced because she is the progeny of the deific intelligence of this intellect which is the very summit flower and as it were head of Jupiter Ibid 67 For they first of all denominated Minerva Ergane Ergane meanS artificer and the propriety of this appellation must be obvious to every one from what we observed in the pre ceding note I mean that she is the immediate progeny of the artificer of the universe Page 68 Jupiter who it denominated Polieus Polieus means the guardian of a city and this is a very proper epithet of Ju piter because he is the cause of a politic and philosophic life Page 69 In her hand she holds a spear a shield lies at her feet and near her spear there is a dragon which may perhaps le Erich  thonius and at the base os the fiatue the generation os Pandora it represented The spear of Minerva is a symbol of that all per Tading power through which the gods without control are enabled to pervade the universe to aid sublunary forms and to amputate base matter Her shield signifies that untamed power which first appears in her essence and from thence becomes an invincible defence to the gods through which they remain secure from passion and reign over the universe triumphant and pure A dragon NOTES ON THE A dragon too is very properly considered as one of the symbols belonging to this goddess For as we have before observed tbii animal signifies the partial life of the foul or in other words the condition of its intellect when separated from diif me intelltBs and it is the province of Minerva as we are informed by Proclus to establish all partial intellects in the universal intellect of Jupiter With respect to Pandora it is well known that according to the fable he was a woman made out of earth by Vulcan at the command of Jupiter in order to take vengeance on Prometheus for having stolen fire from heaven that she was adotned by each god with some particular gift and that stie was afterwards sent by Jupiter to Epimetheus the brother of Prometheus with a box full of all various evils The recondite meaning however of this fable is I fear at present perfectly unknown and therefore 1 shall present the reader with the following beautiful explanation of it from the MS Scholia of Olympiodorus on the Gorgias of Plato ‚ Prometheus is the infpective guardian of the descent of lational souls for to exert a providential energy is the employ ment of the rational foul and prior to any thing else to know itself Irrational natures indeed perceive through percuffion and prior to impulsion know nothing but the rational nature is able prior to information siom another to know what is use ful Hence F pimetbeut is the infpective guardian of the irrational foul because it knows through percuffion and not prior to it Prometheus therefore is that power which presides over the descent of rational souls But Jire signifies the rational soul itself because as sire tends upwards so the rational soul pursues things on high But you will fay Why is this fire said to have been stolen I answer That which is stolen is transferred from its proper place to one that is foreign Since therefore the rational soul is sent from its proper place of abode on high to earth as to a foreign region on this account the fire is said to be stolen But why was it concealed in a reed Because a reed is cavernous like a conduit pipe afftyysijijf and therefore sig nifies  FIRST VOLUME nifies the fluid body to tvrov o upm in which the foul is carried But why was the fire stolen contrary to the will of Jupiter Again the fable speaks as a fable for both Prometheus and Ju piter are willing that the foul should abide on high but as it is requisite that lie should descend the fable fabricates particulars accommodated to the persons And it represents indeed the superior character which is Jupiter as unwilling for he wishes the foul always to abide on high but the inferior character Pro metheus obliges her to descend Jupiter therefore ordered Pan dora to be made And what else is this than the irrational soul which is of a feminine characteristic For as it was necessary that the soul should descend to these lower regions but being incorporeal and divine it was impossible for her to be conjoined with body without a medium hence she becomes united with it through the irrational foul But this irrational foul was called Pandora because each of the gods bestowed on it some particular gift And tlvs signifies that the illuminations which terrestrial natures receive take place through the celestial bodiesf I add farther concerning Minerva from Proclus on the Ti tn√ us that she is called Phospher because she extends the whole of intellectual light The Saviour as establishing every partial intellect in the total intellections of her father Jupiter Calliergos or producing beautiful works as comprehending all the works of her father in intellectual beauty A virgin as extending an undefiled and unmingled purity Atgiochos or egis bcaring as moving the whole of Fate and governing its productions Phi losophic as replete with intellectual knowledge and the light of wisdom And Phi opolemic as uniformly ruling over the oppos ‚ The true man or the rational soul consists of intellect cogitation and opinion but the summit of the irrational life is the phantasy under which Jijirt like a many headed savage beast mi anger like a raging lion subsist ‚ f For the irrational soul is an immaterial body or in other words vitalized extension such as he mathematical bodies which w¬ frame in the phantasy and the celestial kodies are of this kind Vol IIL R in 242 NOTES ON THE ing natures which the world contains Proclus farther informs us in MSS Schol in Cratylum that this goddess is called Victory and Health the former because he causes intellect to rule over necessity and form over matter and the latter because she preserves the universe perpetually whole perfect exempt from age and free from disease It is the property therefore of this goddess to elevate and distribute and through an intellectual dance as it were to connect establish and defend inferior na tures in such as are more divine n aSvta

derives its name It likewise abounds in that part of Cyprus through which you descend from Gerandrum towards Soli on the left hand of El m√ us beneath the rocks This stone increases about the full moon and is diminished when the moon decreases It appears from this curious passage that this stone Carystius must be the same with lir um vivum or ajbeftinum What Plutarch too in his treatise Why the Oracles cease I jive answers says concerning the non existence of this stone in his time particularly deserves the attention of the philosophic reader It is not long fays he since the quarry of Carystus has ceased to yield a certain soft stone which used to be drawn into a fine thread 5 for I suppose that some here have seen tow els net work and coifs woven of that tiiread which could not be burnt but when they were soiled with using people threw them into the fire and took them out white and clean for the fire only served to purify them But all this is vanished and nothing is to be found in the quarry now but some few fibres or harry threads lying scattered up and down Aristotle and hi followers affirm that the cause of all this is owing to an exha lation within the earth the phainomena proceeding from which fail or again make their appeaiance when this exhalation fails or revives and recovers itself again The reason why this stone sometimes fails and at others appears again can only be satisfacto rily accounted for by that theory respecting fertile and barren pe riods which the reader will find unfolded in the note to page 104 With respect to the lamp mentioned by Pausanias whether its burning day and night for a year was entirely owing to the wick being made of Carpalian flax so that the lamp was not larger than the lamps used in common deserves tobe investigated by the curious in natural researches But that the ancients pos sessed FIRST VOLUME 245 scssed the art of constructinglamps that would burn for many ages without supply I think the liberal reader wiD be fully convinced from perusing the following account of lamps found in ancient sepulchres collected from Licetus De Lucernis Antiquorum Baptista Porta and Pancirollus In the first place then Baptista Porta in his treatise of Natu ral Magic relates that about the year 1550 in the island Nefu in Naples a marble sepulchre of a certain Roman was discover ed upon the opening of which a phial was found containing a burning lamp This lamp became extinct on breaking the phial and exposing the light to the open air It appeared that this lamp had been concealed before the advent of Christ Those who saw the lamp reported that it emitted a most splendid flame But the most celebrated is the lamp of Pallas the son of Evander who was killed by Turnus as Virgil relates in the tenth book of his √ neid This was discovered not far from the city of Rome in the year 1401 by a countryman who digging deeper than usual ob served a stone sepulchre containing the body of a man of ex traordinary size which was as entire as if recently interred and which had a large wound in the breast Above the head of the deceased there was found a lamp burning with perpetual fire which neither wind nor water nor any other superinduced liquor could extinguish but the lamp being bored in the bottom and broke by the importunate enemies of this wonderful light the flame immediately vanished That this was the body of Pallas is evident from the inscription on the tomb which was at follows Pallas Evander s son whom Turnus spear In battle slew of mighty bulk lies here In the Appian Road too at Rome in the time of Pope Paul the Third a lamp was discovered burning in the sepulchre of Tul lia the daughter of Cicero which became extinct on the admis R 3 fion  e46 NOTES ON THE fion of the external air From whence it appears that this lamp had continued to hine for about 1550 years The historian Pancirollus who mentions this lamp is a respectable author and relates it as a well known fact in his curious book entitled Con cerning memorable Things known to the Antients but now lost Saint Austin too De Civitat Dei I 21 cap 6 fays that a lamp was found in a temple dedicated to Venus which was always exposed to the open weather and could never be con sumed or extinguished And Ludovicua Vives his commen tator mentions another lamp which was found a little before his time that had continued burning for 1050 years A very remarkable lamp was discovered about the year 1500 near Atestes a town belonging to Padua in Italy by a rustic who digging deeper than usual sound an earthen urn contain ing another urn in which last was a lamp placed between two cylindrical vessels one of gold and the other of silver and each of which was full of a very pure liquor by whose virtue it is probable the lamp had continued to hine for upwards of 1500 years and unless it had been exposed to the air might have continued its wonderful light for a still greater period of time This curious lamp was the workmanship of one Maximus Oly bius who most probably effected this wonder by a profound skill in the chymical art On the greater urn some verses were inscribed in Latin which may be translated as follows I Plund rers forbear this gift to touch Tis awful Pluto s own A secret rare the world conceals To such as you unknown II Olybius in this slender vase The elements has chain d Digested with laborious art From secret science gain d III With  FIRST VOLUME HI With guardian care two copious urns Tht costly juice confine Lest thro the ruins of decay The lamp should cease to shine On the lesser urn were the following verses Plund rers with prying eyes away I What mean ye by this curious stay f Hence with your cunning patr¬ n god¬ With bonnet wing d and magic rod I Sacred alone to Pluto s name This mighty work of endless fame It appears to me that the perpetuity of these lamps was ow ing to the consummate tenacity of the unctuous matter with which the flame was united being so proportioned to the strength of the fire that like the radical moisture and natural heat in animals neither of them could conquer or destroy the other Licetus who is of this opinion observes that in order to pre serve this equality of proportion the ancients hid these lamps in caverns or close monuments and hence it has happened that on opening these tombs the admission of fresh air to the lamps has produced so great an inequality between the flame and the oil that they have been presently extinguished Page 77 Cancpboroi So called from carrying cannisters in which the sacred rites

represented these divinitiet with snakes in their hair Those who are of opinion that the Or phic hymns are spurious compositions will doubtless imagine that their opinion is indisputably confirmed by the prtsent pas sage for the furies in these hymns are called opKKrXoxajKoi or fnaly haired and consequently it may be said they must have been written posterior to the time of √ schylus if what Pausa nias asserts be true It must however be remembered that √ s chylus was accused of inserting in his tragedies things belonging to the mysteriesf and I hall produce some very strong argu ments in the course of these notes to prove that the Orphic hymns which have come down to us are the very hymns which were used in the Eleusinian mysteries If this be the cafe either Pausanias is mistaken in what he asserts of √ schylus iq this place or which appears to me to be more probable being a man reb gioufly fearful of disclosing any particulars belonging to the mysteries he means that no one prior to

circumstance of the statues of these divinities not being in the least dreadful in their appearance that he infers √ schylus was the first that represented them so Hence as the Mysteries were instituted long before √ schylus it is evident that the terrible aspects of the Furies were not invented by him and it is more than probable that this dreadful appearance was principally caused by the snake3 in their hair The same Or phic hymn too calls the Furie3 oGfpwirec i e having terrific aspects Page 82 The verses of Homer alluded to by Pausanias are to be found in the 23d book of the Iliad

required in its celebration was called the greater Panathcnaia and the latter on account of its requiring a less apparatus was denominated thelejfer Panatbe naia The ctlebration of them likewise was distinguished by longer and sliorter periods of time In the greater Panathenaia too the veil of the goddess was carried about in which fays Proclus the giants were represented vanquished by the Olym pian gods Proclus farther informs us in Tim p 26 that these festivals signified the beautiful order wfcich proceeds into the world from intellect and the unconfused distinction of mun dane contrarieties But what are we to understand by the veil of the goddess and the victory obtained over the giants I an swer Her veil is an emblem of that one life or nature of the universe which as Proclus observes the goddess weaves by those intellectual vital powers which her essence contains and the bat tle of the giants against the Olympian gods signifies the oppo sition between the last demiurgic powers of the universe or those powers which partially fabricate and proximately preside over mundane natures and such as are first But Minerva is said to have vanquished the giants because she rules over these ultimate artificers of things by her unifying powers Page 85 Ar ifle and Call Jle That is hejl and miji beautiful It appears to me that Diana was thus denominated from her intimate alliance with Apollo for Proclus in his MSS Scholia on the Cratylus informs us that there is a great correspondence between the Coric or virginal series and the Apolloniacal For fays he the former is the unity of the middle triad of rulers i e of the supermundane gods and emits from herself vivisic powers but the latter converts the solar principles to one union and the solar principles are allotted a subsistence imme  Thisseries constitutes the vivisic triad of supermundane gods and con sists of Diana Proserpine and Minerva or according Co the Chaldasan theologists of Hecate Soul

Apollo emits from his esfenct intellec tual and the good superessential light Diana likewise may be thus denominated from her intimate alliance with Apollo The fame reason too accounts for her being called mojl beautiful for Mer cury Venus and Apollo compose the supermundane elevating triad and are most profoundly united to each other Page 91 The demon Anteros Of this power who avenges the injuries of lovers the following remarkable story is told by Eunapius in his Life of Jamblichus This philosopher went with his disciples to Gadara in Syria a place so famous for baths that after Bai√ in Campania it is the second in the Roman em pire Here a dispute about baths arising while they were bath ing Jamblichus smiling said to them Though what I am going to disclose is not pious yet for your fakes it hall be un dertaken and at the fame time he ordered his disciples to en quire of the natives what appellations had been formerly given to two of the hot fountains which were indeed less than the others but more elegant Upon enquiry they found themselves unable to discover the cause of their nomination but were in formed that the one was t ailed Eros or Love and the other An teros or the god ivho avenges the injuries of lovers Jamblichus immediately touching the water with his hand for he fat per haps on the margin of the fountain and murmuring a few words raised NOTES ON THE raised from the bottom of the fountain a fair boy of a moderate stature whose hair seemed to be tinged with gold and the upper part of whose breast was of a luminous appearance His com panions being astonished at the novelty of the affair Let us pass on fays he to the next fountain and at the fame time he arose fixed in thought and performing the same ceremonies as before called forth the other Love who was in all respects similar to the former except that his hair scattered in his neck was blacker and was like the fun in refulgence At the fame time both the boys eagerly embraced Jamblichus as if he had been their na tural parent but he immediately restored them to their proper feats and when he had washed departed from the place Let the reader however be careful to remember that though Eros and Anteros are gods considered according to their first subsist ence yet these which are mentioned by Eunapius were of the d√ moniacal order and were perhaps d√ mons only xaia o x ov ac eording to habitude or alliance Page 91 Carrying with them burning lamps The propriety of employing burning lamps in a contest sacred to Prometheut is sufficiently apparent from the account we have already given of this divinity For Prometheus we have shewn is the inspec tive guardian of the descent of rational souls and fire from its tending upwards is an emblem of the rational foul As a burn ing lamp therefore may be considered as a very proper image of our rational part it appears to me that this custom adopted by the Athenians of running from the altar of Prometheus to the city with burning lamps in which he alone was victoiious whose lamp remained unextinguished in the race was intended to signi fy that he is the true conqueror in the race of life whose rational part is not extinguished or in other words does not become dor mant in the career Page 91 For Socrates in the night k fore that day on which Plato became his disciple Jaw in a dream a swan j7y to his bosom The foul of Plato according to the ancients descended from 8 Apollo  FIRST VOLUME S3 Apollo to whom the swan is sacred and consequently this bird plainly signified Plato in the dream of Socrates Olympiodorus too in his Life of Plato informs us that when that philosopher was near his death he dreamt that he was changed into a wan and that by flying from tree to tree he gave much trouble to the fowlers in catching him and this dream fays he according to the Socratic Simmias signified that his meaning would not be appre hended by his interpreters For interpreters are similar to fowlers by attempting to explain the conceptions of the ancients and Plato s meaning cannot be apprehended because his discourses like those of Homer may be understood physically ethically theologically and in short multifariously For the souls of Homer and Plato are said to have been produced all harmonic Let it however be remembered that though Plato s meaning was by no means apprehended by his more ancient interpreters yet it is most divinely and fully unfolded by the latter Platonists among whom Olympiodorus holds a very distinguished place Page 91 Jipolh changed him into the bird whose name he boreS Nothing more appears to be signisiedby this fable than that Cyc nus was a man wholly given to external harmony and who there fore knew nothing of philosophy which is the greatest music as Plato in the Ph√ do beautifully observes In consequence there fore of this neglect of his foul he became united with the life of a swan as the punishment of his guilt But observe that when the rational soul is said to be changed into a brute the meaning is that the foul becomes bound to the life of a brute in the fame man ner as otirpresiding d√ mons are united with our fouls for the hu man foul never becomes the animating part of a brute any moie than d√ mons become human fouls I only add that the doctrine of transmigration when viewed in this light is extremely beautiful and Syrianus and Proclus were I believe the first by whom it was thus explained Page 92 There is a temple of Ceres Tbesmophorui Cere wa¬ with great propriety worshipped by the ancients as Thcsmophorut or 25 NOTES ON THE ot the legislator for

Cyclopians who dwelt about the Scythian river Arimafpus which is full of golden sands Page 93 Apollo Dionysv hlus Perhaps instead of hcrjaihlo it should be JbiwJI Dionyfoter or the saviour of Bacchus My reasons for supposing that this alteration is requisite are de rived from the following curious and beautiful passage from the MS Commentary of Olympiodonis on the Phacdo of Plato In order fays he to the soul s descent it is necessary that she should first establish an animating image of herself in the body and in the second place that she should sympathize with the image according to a similitude of form for every form passes into a sameness with itself through naturally verging to itself In the third place being situated in a divisible nature it is necessary that she should be lacerated and scattered together with such a nature and that she should fall into an ultimate distri FIRST VOLUME 255 distribution till through the energies of a cathartic life he raises herself from the extreme dispersion and loosens the bond of sympathy through which he is united with body and till at the fame time energizing without the image he becomes esta blished according to her primary life And we may behold a resemblance of all this in the frjle respecting Bacchus the ex emplar of our intellect For it is sajd that Dionysius establish ing his image in a mirror pursued it and thus became distri buted iato the universe But Apollo excited and elevated Bacchus this god being a cathartic deity and the true sa viour of Dionysius and on this account he is celebrated as Di enyfoter Such as are desirous of feeing the original of this curious passage and many important particulars respecting the mysteries of Bacchus unfolded from Greek manuscripts may consult my Dissertation on the Elexfinian and Bacchic Mysteries Page 93 And of Earth whom they call a mighty goddess Earth is called by Plato in the Timaeus the most ancient and first of the gods in the heavens and this fays Proclus on ac count of her stability and generative power her symphony with heaven and her position in the centre of the universe For the centre possesses a mighty power in the universe as connect ing all its circulations and hence it was called by the Pytha goreans the tower of Jupiter from its containing a demiurgic guard And if we recollect the Platonic hypothesis concerning the earth that our habitable part is nothing but a daik hollow and very different from the true earth which is adorned with a beauty similar to that of the heavens we shall have no occasion to wonder at her being called the first and most ancient of the celestial gods Put the Platonic hypothesis which Proclus al ludes to is this which is an Egyptian tradition that the summit of the earth is ethereal in order that it may unite with the orb of the moon that it is every where perforated with holes like a  In the MS it is y i n r but mould doubtless be read SunvetUpf pumice 156 NOTES ON THE pumice stone and that we reside at the bottom of certain of these hollows while we fancy that we dwell on the summit of the earth The great antiquity of this doctrine may be collected from what Homer fays in the Iliad that Heaven and Earth are common to the three divinities Jupiter Neptune and Pluto and consequently each of these mull be divided between them The earth therefore must be divided analogous to the universe into that which is celestial terrestrial and middle And there must be some part of it ethereal which belongs to Jupiter As this part therefore cannot be the surface on which we reside it must consequently be contiguous to the moon See more con cerning this curious and interesting theory in my Introductions to the Ph√ do and Tim√ us of Plato Page 93 Ceres Anefidora This word means the bejlower of gifts and is agreeable to the etymon of Ceres given by Plato in the Cratylus for Jiytiilup fays he is Ji ¬ r luStf a he lowing mother But why this goddess was so called by the wife ancients the following beautiful extract from the MSS Scholia of Proclus on the Cratylus will abundantly unfold It is requisite to consider this goddess not only as the supplier of corporeal food but beginning from the gods we should view her as first of all supplying them with aliment afterwards the natures posterior to the gods and last of all such as are indigent of corporeal aliment For the characteristic of love shines forth first of all in the gods and this is the cafe with the medicinal and prophetic powers of Apollo and with those of every other divinity But nutriment when considered with reference to the gods is the communication of intellectual plenitude from more exalted natures to those of au inferior rank Gods therefore are nourished when they view with the eye of intellect gods prior to themselves when they are persecteJ and view intelli gible beauties such as justice itself temperance itself and the  Tcua y lit tw vajlut kcu paxfo oTifftiej Iliad 15 like  First Volume

Jove became Ctrei But Hesiod fays that Ceres is the daughter of Rhea It is however evident that these theologists harmonize with each other for whether this goddess proceeds from union with Saturn to a secondary order or whether file is the first progeny1 of Rhea she is still the fame Ceres therefore being of this kind and receiving the most ancient and ruling order from the whole vivific Rheaf and comprehending the middle centres of tuhole ‚ vivification J he ills all supermundane natures with the rivers of all perfect life pouring upon all things vitality indivisibly and uniformly But prior to all this he unfolds to us the demiurgic intellect Jupiter and imparts to him the pawer of vivifying wholes For as Saturn supplies her from on high with the cause of being so Ceres from on high and from her own prolific bosoms pours forth vivification to the demiurgus But possessing herself the middle of all vivific deity he governs the whole fountains which he contains and comprehends the one bond of the first and last powers of life She stably convolves too and contains all secondary fountains But he leads forth the uniform causes of prior natures to the generation of others This goddess too ‚ This Orphic fragment was never before publimed ‚ f T¬ i5 ¬ ¬ oyo¬ oi ‚ ¬ ‚  Vot HL S com NOTES ON THE comprehends Vrjla and Juno in her right hand parts Juno wha pours forth the whole

far as she comprehends in herself the cause of Juno he is a mother but as containing Vesta in her essence he is the supplier of aliment But the pa radigm of this goddess is Night for immtrtal Night is called tht nurse if the godt Night however is the cause of aliment in telligibly for that which is intelligible is according to the oracles the aliment of the intellectual orders of gods But Ceres

Atheniamsenquired of the oracle C 2  There are very few I fear of the present day who do not con sider the oracles of the ancients as mere delusions and who do not ascribe the accomplishment of their predictions either to the tricks of designing priesti or the random power of chance This however must necessarily be the cafe at a period when di vine influence is totally withdrawn and delusion and perfect atheism are the substitutes for the genuine religion of mankind While men indeed are ignorant that true theology and such was that of the ancients is perfectly scientific being founded on the clearest and most natural conceptions of the human mind and while in consequence of this ignorance they believe nothing to be real but objects of fense the doctrine of a communication be tween men and divine natures must appear ridiculous in the ex treme And yet one should think that history must convince the most incredulous that the numerous instances in which the predictions of oracles have been so wonderfully accomplished Could not be the result either of chance or intrigue Indeed he who can read the many instances of this kind adduced by Pau sanias and yet deny the possibility of man communicating with higher powers must either be an atheist or a fool For the fake therefore of the lover of divinity I shall sum marily disclose the scientific theory of oracles according to the philosophy of Plato As there is not one father of the universe only one providence and one divine law but many fathers subordinate to the one first father many administrators of pro vidence posterior to and comprehended in the one universal pro vidence of the demiurgus of all things and many laws proceed ing from one first law it is necessary that there should be dif ferent allotments aad a diversity of divine distribution Hence tfcere are allotments of partial fouls such as ours of unpolluted S a souls z6o NOTES ON THE souls such as heroes beneficent d√ mons and angels and of the gods themselves But the allotments of angels d√ mons and heroes are suspended from those of the gods and possess a more various distribution for one divine allotment comprehends many angelic allotments and a still greater number of such as are dse moniacaL For multitude is every where suspended from one prin ciple Arid as in essences powers and energies progression from these generate a kindred multitude so with respect to allotments such as are first transcend in power but are dimi nished according to multitude as being nearer the one father of the universe and the one total providence which he contains but such as are second to these possess a subordinate power and an increased multitude Such then being the general particulars respecting the theory of allotments the next thing to be considered is that the allot ment of a divine nature whether celestial or sublunary is an unrestrained government and a providential energy about the subjects of its government By unrestrained government I meia an exemption from all passivity and from any tendency towards or alliance with subordinate natures for every thing divine it at the fame time every where aud no where It is every where considered as illuminating all things with its own ineffable light  and it is no where considered as exempt from all the properties of the natures which it illumines The fame too must be un derstood in an inferior degree of those beneficent natures that are the perpetual attendants of the gods for the energy of these also is unrestrained but not in that transcendant manner in which it is possessed by the gods In the third place the allotments of the gods and their attendants are perpetual for immutability is the essential property of a divine nature and consequent ly must be communicated to that which perpetually attends divinity and exerts a beneficent energy But notwithstand ing this immutability of better natures yet in order to the propef  FIRST VOLUME proper reception of their illuminations it is necessary that there should be as perfect an aptitude in the recipients as they are ca pable of receiving Hence as in generation or the sublunary region wholes remain perpetually according to nature bnt their parts are sometimes according and sometimes contrary to nature this mull be true of the parts of the earth When those circu lations therefore take place during which the parts of the earth subsist according to nature and this is accompanied with a con currence of proper instruments aud places then divine illu mination is abundantly and properly received But when the parts of the earth subsist contrary to nature as at present and which has been the cafe ever since the oracles ceased then as there is no longer an aptitude of places instruments and times divine influence can no longer be received though the illumi nations of divine natures continue immutably the fame just fays Proclus as if a face standing in the fame position a mirror should at one time receive a clear image of it and at another one obscure and debile or indeed no image at all For as the fame incomparable man farther observes it is no more proper to refe r the defect of divine inspiration to the gods than to accuse the sun as the cause os the moon being eclipsed instead of the conical shadow of the earth into which the moon falls Page 98 There is a temple of Nemesis EsV Proclus on He siod informs us that Nemrfis was celebrated in hymns as the angel of justice and that she is represented by Hesiod clothed in a white garment because she is an intellectual power far re moved from the atheistic and dark essence of the passions Page 98 The river of the Ocean Herodotus in Euterpe fays that he knows no river of the name of Ocean and that he believes it was either invented by Homer or some poet of former times and Mr Wood is of opinion that the Ocean in Homer s time had a very different meaning from th3t which it now conveys Herodotus is certainly right in what he fays S 3 ar 262 NOTES ON THE as he only considered the sensible Ocean and Mr Wood discovers some sagacity in conjecturing that Ocean formerly had a differ ent meaning from what it has at present For when Homer calls Ocean a river he alludes to the deity of this name who belongs to that order of gods which is called intellectual and of which Saturn is the summit who is a fontal deity myeu 9to and is therefore very properly denominated a river as giving birth to theprocej swn of the gods into the sensible universe and being according to his last subsistence the source of the sea and the all various streams that flow upon the earth For every cause is that primarily which its effect is secondarily and hence causes were assigned by ancient theologists the fame names with their effects Concerning this deity Proclus in his MSS Scholia on the Cratylus observes as follows Ocean is the cause to all the gods of acute and vigorous energy and bounds the distinctions of the first middle and last orders converting himself to him self and to his proper principles through swiftness of intellect but moving all things from himself to energies accommodated to their natures perfecting their powers and causing them to pos sess a never failing subsistence And in his Commentaries on the Tim√ us p 296 he observes of this deity considered ac cording to his sublunary subsistence that he is the cause of motion progression and power conferring vigour and prolific abundance on intellectual lives but swiftness of energy and purity in generations to fouls and facility of motion to bodies That considered as subsisting in tbe gods i e in sublunary gods he comprehends a motive and providential cause but in angels he comprehends an unfolding and intellectual swiftness

he produces all the mutation of aerial natures and 3s as Aristotle observes the cause of the circle of the meteors But FIRST VOLUME 263 But in die watry element he is the cause of fertility facility of motion and all various powers for according to the poet From him the sea and ev ry river flows In earth he is the source of generative perfection of the dis tinction of forms and of generation and corruption Hence such terrestrial orders as are vivific and demiurgic he defines and such powers as comprehend the reasons of earth and are the infpective guardians of generation he excites and multiplies and calls forth into motion And shortly after he adds that Ocean in fine is the cause of all motion intellectual be longing to fouls  and natural to all secondary natures but Te tbjs is the cause of all the distinction os the streams proceeding from the Ocean conferring on each a proper purity of natural motion I only add that it is peculiar to the Platonic philosophy to suspend physics from theology and this in imitation of Orpheus who suspends Nature herself from the vivisic goddess Rhea who is the cause of all life both that which is intellectual and that which is inseparable from the fluctuating nature of bodies This peculiarity must surely be pleasing to every one that is not atheistically inclined at the fame time that by leading us up to such principles as are truly first it enables us to remove the veil which conceals the mystic wisdom of the ancients and causes it to appear in the eyes of the multitude inextricably con fused and beyond all comparison absurd The trutli of this observation will be immediately assented to by any one who understands the above explanation of Ocean Page 98 Table os the Sun The table of the Sun according to Herodotus in Thai was this ‚ A plain in the vicinity of the city above Syene in √ thiopia was filled to the height of four feet with the roafled flesh of all kinds of animals which was carried there in the night under the inspection of the magi  Homer S 4 strates  NOTES ON THE strates durfng the day whoever pleased was at liberty to go and satisfy his hunger The natives of the place affirm that the earth spontaneously produces all these viapds this however is what they term the table of the Sun I have given the passage as translated by Mr Beloe Page 99 Alias it so lofty sfc The great height of the mountain Atlas is very successfully employed by Proclus in Tim p 56 as an argument for the truth of that Platonic hypothesis concerning the earth which we have mentioned in a former note The passage in which he employs this argument is as follows It is here requisite to remember the Platonic hypo theses concerning the earth For Plato does not measure its magnitude after the same manner as mathematicians but thinks hat its interval is much greater as Socrates asserts in the Phaedo In whieh dialogue also he fays that there are many habitable parts similar to the places of our abode And hence he relates that an island and continent of this kind existed in the external pr Atlantic sea For indeed if the earth be naturally spherical it is necessary that it should be such according to its greatest part But the parts which we inhabit both internally and externally exhibit great inequality In some parts of the earth therefore there must be an expanded plain and an interval extended on high For according to the faying of Heraclitus he wbopa set through a very profound region will arrive at the Atlantic mountain ‚ whose magnitude is such according to the relation of the Ethiopian historians that it touches the tether andcajls a shadow of Jive thou sand Jladia in extent for from the ninth hour of the day the fun it concealed by it even to his perfect demerfion under the earth Nor is this wonderful for Athos a Macedonian mountain casts a shadow as far as to Lcmnos which is distant from it seven hundred stadia Nor are such particulars as these which Mar cellus the √ thiopic historian mentions related only concerning the Atlantic mountain but Ptolemy also fays that the Lunar mountains are of an immense height and Aristotle that Can casua  FIRST VOLUME 265 casus it enlightened by the rays of the fun a third part of the night after fun set and a third part before the rising of the fun And if any one considers the whole magnitude of the earth bounded by its elevated parts he will conclude that it is truly of a prodigious magnitude according to the assertion of Plato I only add that what Proclus observes here from Ptolemy about the height of the Lunar mountains is contradicted by Mr Bruce who fays in his book on the Source of the Nile that these mountains are by no means ef that prodigious altitude which they were supposed to be by the ancients However for my own part I prefer Ptolemy s authority to that of Mr Bruce notwithstanding the person of Mr Bruce during his travels was as he informs us by no means despicable and in addition to this his circumstances were affluent and his connections powerful Page 101  can also mention others that tvere once men an J were after their death ‚ worshipped at gods by the Greels I have already abundantly hewn in a former note that there is an order of fouls among men who from their superior purity and magna nimity and their proximity to beings essentially more excellent were very properly denominated by the ancients heroes These elevated souls too were justly called by the fame names as the divinities from which they descended for the characteristic of every divine nature extends itself to the last of things so as even to leave a vestige of its ineffable prerogatives in the dark and re bounding receptacle of matter Heroes however though they were worshipped by the ancients yet they were neither consi dered as gods nor worshipped as such by those who paid them no other honours than what were ordained by the Grecian laws as is evident from Plato s Laws Pausanias therefore in the pas sage before us feemc for want of a philosophical acquaintance with the religion of his country to confound the divine and hu man nature and it is to passages of this nature that we must ascribe the general prevalence at present of that most licentiou and 266 NOTES ON THE ad ignorant opinion which asserts all the godi of the ancients to be nothing more than deified men Page 104 And that I might conjecture his lull l c That in the heroic age men abounded of a prodigious stature cannot be denied without supposing the whole of the Iliad to be a fable though on the other hand to imagine with the Scotch Grammarian that there has been a gradual declension of the stature of mankind from the most early periods and that the human species will at last come to nothing is an opinion too extravagant and unphilosophical to deserve the labour of confu tation The fact is that the superior strength and size of the celebrated heroes of antiquity can only be accounted for satis factorily by having recourse to that recondite wisdom of the ancients which was first discoveicd in the colleges of the Egyp tian priests and was afterwards delivered Enigmatically by Py thagoras scientifically by Plato and cnthcaJlicaUy or according to a diific energy iiSiaj xwf by his latter disciples From this most arcane and sublime wisdom we learn that all the parts of the universe cannot participate the providence of the gods in a simi lar manner but that some of its parts must enjoy this eternally and others temporally some in a primary and others in a secon dary degree For the universe being a perfect whole must have a first a middle and a last part But its first parts as having the most excellent subsistence must always exist according to nature and its last parts must sometimes subsist according to and sometimes contrary to nature Hence the celestial bodies which are the first parts of the universe perpetually subsist ac cording to nature both the whole spheres and the multitude co ordinate to these wholes and the only alteration which they experience is a mutation of figure and variation of light at different periods but in the sublunary region while  For an account of the ‚ wlxks which the universe contains and which form one of the most interesting parts of the Platonic philosophy see my Introduction to the Timseus of Plato the  FIRST VOLUME 367 the spheres of each of the elements remain on account of their subsistence as wholes always according to nature the parts of these wholes have sometimes a natural and sometimes an unna tural subsistence for tints alone can he circle of generation unfold all the variety which it contains But the different periods in which these mutations happen are called by Plato with great propriety periods of fertility and fierility for in these periods a fertility or sterility of men ani mals and plants takes place so that in fertile periods mankind will be both more numerous and upon the whole superior in mental and bodily endowments to the men of a barren period And a similar reasoning must be extended to animals and plants This is signified by Plato though obscurely in the following passage from the eighth book of his Republic yahiwi pi ‚ ttuc m ¬ tij ¬ 7j Toy a7ra Ha fxein Xfoito aXha AtSWtlai awj o e rjJi ou storey p Pioi ryyno ¬ W a xai a W aoif ¬ ¬ oif pofa itj asojtx vyrtf n  ffufMalvr ytyvtlxi olxv vtfijoo

is generated is obnoxious to corruption neither can a constitution of this kind remain perpetually but must be dissolved And its dissolution is this ji fertility and sterility of foul and bodies not only takes place in terrene plants but also in ter rene animals when the revolutions of each of these conjoin the ambits of their circles which are shorter to the shorter lived and con trary wife to the contrary The so much celebrated heroic age therefore was the result of one of these fertile periods in which men transcending the herd of mankind both in practical and intellectual virtue abounded on the earth But in consequence of that beautiful pro gression of things which takes place throughout the universe viz in consequence of multitude every where being suspended from a monad or uniting cause and multitude exquisitely allied to 4 268 NOTES ON THE to its monad preceding dissimilar multitude it is necessary that each of these heroic souls should be the leader of other fouls of an inferior rank but yet resembling their leader in a high degree Thus Achilles in the Iliad who as we have observed in a former cote is an heroic foul energizing according to practical virtue stands at the head of a kindred multitude of souls who from their proximity to such characters as himself are dignified with the appellation of heroes Ajax belonged to this kindred multitude together with Tidydes Ulysses and many others this multi tude at the fame time possessing gradations of excellence in order that its extremity may coalesce with less elevated fouls It is therefore by no means wonderful that Ajax possessed such re markable strength and magnitude of body as he belonged to that class of souls who approximate very near to real heroes among men But a very natural doubt may here arise in the mind of the thinking reader why √ neas who is said to have been born of a goddess as well as Achilles and of a goddess of a much higher rank than the mother of Achilles is represented by Homer as engaged in a bad cause which he evidently is by fighting for the Trojans I answer that the doubt may be solved by reading Homer with that profound attention which his poems so justly demand For we mail find that though he calls √ neas a hero as well as Achilles from his resembling true heroes in many respects yet he plainly evinces that his claim to this cha racter was not incontrovertible when he represents Apollo thus speaking to √ neas Iliad o v 105 t as pztn Aio xoffi AippoMiij Exyi aaEf i e For they say that you are descended from Venus the  daughter of Jupiter For here the term they fay plainly indi cates that his claim to this honour was ambiguous but he never uses an expression of this k ind when he speaks of Achilles I add that these periods of fertility and sterility depend on the different  FIRST VOLUME different circulations of the heavens and that this theory solves at once all that appears so absurd to persons ignorant of true philosophy in many of the relations of ancient historians I mean the accounts they g ve of animals which no where exist at pre sent and their ascribing properties to such animals as now exist so different from what they are now found to possess For it evidently follows that in fertile periods animals must exist which are unknown to barren periods and that all the tribes of ani mals must upon the whole be superior in every respect just as in fertile ground and in fertile seasons the produce is more abun dant the species of production are more various and theit qualities superior to what are found in the produce of barren ground in the barren seasons of the year But the following account of human bones of prodigious mag nitude which have been discovered will I doubt not be accept able to the reader in addition to the histories of this kind given by Paufanias The author of this account is Phlegon Trallianus and it is taken from his little treatise On admirable things and On those that have lived to a great age Not many years since in Messene Apollonius fays that a large stone vessel was broke through violent tempests and a great inundation of water and that a head was washed out of it three times as large as that of a man with two rows of teeth An inscription informed those that were endeavouring to find whose head it was that it was the head of Idas for this was the inscription lAEsl i e OF IDAS The Messenians therefore at the public cost provided another vessel and placed in it the remains of the hero in such a manner that they were more secure than before ai they perceived that this was the person of whom Homer lays Idas the strongest of the mortal race That flourish d then who for a beauteous nymph Dar d with Apollo Phoebus to contend And aim his arrows at the radiant king  Iliad 9 v 554 la i7o NOTES ON THE In Dalmatia too in that which is called the cavern of Diana many bodies may be seen whose tiba exceed sixteen cubits But the grammarian Apollonius relates that there was an earthquake during the reign of Tiberius Nero through which many celebrated cities of Asia were entirely destroyed but which Tiberius afterwards rebuilt at his own expence for which bene fit the Asiatics made a colossal statue of him and placed it near the temple of Venus which is in the forum of the Romans and after this they placed the statues of the several cities that had been rebuilt Not a few too of the cities of Sicily suffered through this earthquake and places near Rhegilfm together with several of the cities in Pontus But in those parts in which the earth was rent asunder very large dead bodies were found the magnitude of which indeed so astonished the inhabitants that they were unwilling to move them That the affair how ever might be generally known they sent to Rome one of the teeth of these bodies and this was more than a foot long The ambassadors at the fame time they shewed this to Tiberius asked him whether he wished that the hero to whom this tooth belong ed should be brought to him Upon this Tiberius very pru dently thought of a means by which he might neither be deprived of knowing the dimensions of this body nor yet be guilty of the impiety of robbing the dead He ordered a celebrated ge ometrician whose name was Pulcrus and whom he honoured for his art to be called and desired him to make a face in propor tion to the fize of that tooth The geometrician therefore having calculated from the fize of the tooth the dimensions of the face and of the whole body accomplished the taste imposed on him with great celerity and brought the face to the Emperor who after he had satisfied himself with beholding it ordered the tooth to be restored to the place from whence it was taken Nor ought we to refuse our assent to this narration since there Is a place in Egypt called Liti√ in which bodies are to be seen not less in size than the above mentioned and these not buried in the  FIRST VOLUME 271 the earth but exposed to the view neither confused nor disturb ed but placed in proper order so that he who looks at them can tell which are the bones of the thighs legs and other members It is not therefore by any means proper to disbelieve these accounts hut we ought to think that at first nature being very vigorous caused every thing to approach near to the perfec tion of the gods j and that becoming afterwards debilitated the magnitude of bodies also decreased I am likewise informed that at Rhodes there are bones which far surpass in magnitude the bones of men of the present day And the same Apolloniui says that there is a certain island near Athens which the Athe nians fortified with walls and that when they were digging the foundations of these walls they found a sepulchre of one hundred eubits in length in which there was a skeleton of the same di mensions with the sepulchre with this inscription  I Maeroseirit vuho lived five thousand years am buried in a long island Eumachus in his description of the earth says that the Car thaginians when they were digging a trench in their own coun try found two skeletons placedfin coffins one of which wat twenty three and the other twenty four cubits in length And Theopompus Sinopenfis in hisTreatise on Earthquakes fays that a sudden earthquake happening in the Cimmerian Bosphorus a certain hill was rent asunder and bones of a pro digious magnitude were thrown out of it for the length of the whole skeleton was found to be twenty four cubits He adds that the Barbarians who dwelt about those parti threw these bones into the lake Maeotis Page 104 The pancratium  This was a mode of wrestling and boxing in which it was lawful to use any kind of play in order to obtain the victory Page 100 Peleui vowed hit hair to the river Spcrchiut Th ‚ This opinion is very natural to a mind unacquainted with the various circulations of the heavens verses 272 NOTES ON THE verses of Homer alluded to by Pausanias are these which may be found in the 23d book of the Iliad Sperchius whose waves In mazy errours lost Delightful roll along my native coast To whom my father vow d at my return These locks to fall and hecatombs to burn I only add that the obscure and intricate mode of expression em ployed by Pausanias in the present passage and which he so fre quently adopts led me into an error in the translation of it from not recollecting at the time the verses of Homer alluded to I beg the reader therefore to correct the passage as follows that Pe leus vowed the hair of Achilles to the river Sperchius for his safe return from Troy Page 109 Mild Jupiter It appears that Jupiter Misubiut ot mild Jupiter is the fame with that power called the Damont in the Orphic hymns for in the hymn to him he is expressly called y u yun A a mild Jupiter It appears too that this deity is the fame with the Janus of the Romans For in the hymn just cited there is the following line i e In thee the keys of joy and sorrow are carried And Janus it is well known wasi represented as a porter Scaliger indeed in the translation of this line expressly as signs two epithets to this divinity which belong only to Janus L e Patulcius and Clufius the power that opens and shuts Lxtitix mxrori Vatuk m Clufiui idem es Indeed that Jupiter is the fame with Janus is indisputably clear from the following verse of a MS hymn in my possession of Proclus which is entitled Tjxwf xoitec or a common hjmu Xais Ixn irfvtraltif fyv apStli  ‚ i e ¬ Grandfather Janus Jove immortal hail 10 And FIRST VOLUME 273 And here It may not be improper to observe as a circumstance truly admirable that Orpheus Homer Plato and the Chal  d√ an oracles have unanimously characterized Jupiter by the duad Thus both Orpheus and Plato call hifo by a two fold name Jia and the former signifying that he is the cause through which things subsist and the latter his vivific power for he is the first cause of vivification Plato too in the Parmc nidet characterizes him by the dialectic epithets yslmfn and dif ference Homer places two urns by his throne And he is called by the Chaldscan oracles in leuirnt twice leyond The two faces of Janus therefore as he is the fame with the Jupiter of the Greeks admirably correspond with the dual characteristic assigned to that divinity by the most ancient theologists I add that the reader must not be disturbed on finding that Jupiter is called a demon at this epithet is only given to him in the way of analogy For as it is the employment of essential d√ mons to attend on the gods and proximately preside over inferior natures so each subordinate order of gods from fol lowing the operations of its proximate superior order and pre siding over subject natures may be called analogically d√ moniacul with respect to that order It is in this fense of the word that Plato in the Tim√ us calls the sublunary gods dtmnns in one place aud in anothergods of gnds and that in the Banquet he calls Love a mighty d√ mon and in the Phce drus a god But not only gods were called d√ mons by ancient theologists but intellects foul d√ mons and even men were called gods by them Each however was thus denominated in a different respect For inlelleSs were called gods according to union  fouls according to participation i demons according to cen tal and men according to similitude while in the mean time such as are properly gods were assigned this appellation essentially The observation of these diltiiittions will enable the philosophic reader to solve many apparent inconsistencies in the writings of ancient theologists and convince him that the ancients believed Vol III T ia 27 NOTES ON THE in beings superior to the d√ moniacal order By the power there fore calli d the s emon which so often occurs in Pausanias we must understand Jupiter Page 109 But he that has h cn initiated in th Eleusinian mys teries SsV From the present passive in conjunction with iome other authorities which I shall adduce we may collect no con temptible argument in favour ot the opinion thai the Orphic hymns which exist at present were the very lumns which were used in the Eleusinian mysteries For fays Pa tan as it is not lawful to alcribe the invention of beans to Ceres and he that has been initiated in the Eleusinian mysi cries or has read the poems called Crphic will kiiow wiiat I mean Now Porphyry De Abftintntia lib 4 informs us that kans were forbidden in the Eleusinian mysteries and in the Orphic hymn to Earth the facrificer is oiticied to fumigate from every kind of feed except beans and aromatic Again Suidas

invocations as were used in mysteries Besides many of the hymns are expressly thus called by the author of them Thus the conclusion of the hymn to Protogonns invokes that deity to be present at the

composed poems and hymns prior to Homer T 2 Page 276 NOTES ON THE Page 117 The twelve gods as they are called These twelve divinities are Jupiter Neptune Vulcan Vesta Minerva Mars Ceres Juno Diana Mercury Venus Apollo The first triad of these gods is demiurgic the second defensive the third vi vific and the fourth elevating and harmonic These divinities according to their first subsistence considered as characterized by the number twelve form that order of gods which is called ar¬ vrof or liberated by the Chald√ an theologists but uir foip¬ Miof y¬ percelejlial by the Greeks because it is immediately situated above the mundane gods But these gods are received from the libe rated order into the world Hence as Sallust observes in his elegant little work On the Gods and the World Of these gods some are the causes of the world s existence others animate the world others again harmonize it thus composed from different natures and others lastly guard and preserve it when harmonically arranged He adds The truth of this may be seen in statues as in √ nigmas For Apollo harmonizes the lyre Pallas is invested with arms and Venus is naked since harmony generates beauty and beauty is not concealed in objects of sensible inspection But since these gods primarily possess the world it is necessary to consider the other gods as subsisting in these as Bacchus in Jupiter √ sculapius in Apollo and the Graces in Venus We may likewise behold the orbs with which they are connected viz Vesta with earth Neptune with water Juno with air and Vulcan with fire But the six superipr gods we denominate from general custom  for we assume Apollo and Diana for the fun and moon but we attribute the orb of Satur n to Ceres sether to Pallas and we assert that heaven is common

speaks of Night according to this her first subsistence but in the passage before us of Pausanias we must consider this goddess according to her mundane subsistence I only add that the Chald√ an doctrine of other purer worlds above the inerratic sphere seems from the Orphic verses just cited to have been known to and embraced by Orpheus For the Chald√ an theologists as I have proved in my Notes on the Cratylus of Plato believed that there were seven corporeal worlds one empyrean three ethereal and three ma terial which last three consist of the inerratic sphere the planet ary spheres and the sublunary region And in one of the above cited Orphic verses Jupiter is ordered to receive all things in closed in √ ther plainly indicating that there is something ethe real beyond the sensible heavens Page 122 Gods that are called ProdromeanJ i e dnteeejsors for as among the genera superior to mankind some are the an tecessors of the gods in like manner certain subordinate order of gods may be called the fore runners of superior orders con sidered as preparing Jby their light natures inferior to the divine for the reception of illumination from a prior order of gods Al cathous therefore very properly sacrificed to these gods before he began to raise the wall of the tower   Page  FIRST VOLUME j79 Page 123 Upon ‚ which they say Apollo laid hit harp As the characteristics of all the divine orders are participated by the last of things hence a vestige of supernal light is not only visible in plants but in particular stones Thus as Proclus observes in his small treatise Dc Magia the sun stone by its golden raya imitates those of the sun but the stone called the eye of heaven or of the sun has a figure similar to the pupil of an eye and a ray shines from the middle of the pupil Thus too the lunar tysone which has a figure similar to the moon when horned by a certain change of itself follows the lunar motion And the stone called Iselioselenus i e of the fun and moon imitates after a man ner the congress of those luminaries which it images by its co lour This being the cafe it is by no means wonderful that there should be certain stones which possess a debile vestige of the divine harmony of Apollo and the stone mentioned by Pau sanias from its being one of this kind may have occasioned the fabulous report that Apollo laid his harp on it Page 1 a5 An

oblivion to those that look into her Wh y is it necessary to call Apollo harmony as subsisting from Lato na and Jupiter For thus the god would be inseparable from mi tter and not the cause of the harmony in the universe It is be tter therefore to fay that La tona is not the receptacle of Apol lo but that she is the mother and fountain of all vivific light which preserves all things by heat but that Apollo who is a sej arate divinity is the supplier of all harmonic life and of all those mundane reasons by which the universe is indissolubly bound But you may fay that So crates derives her name from Lethe 1 because she peculiarly causes in fouls an oblivion of evils and of t he roughness and storms in generation of which while the foul rt tains the memory she can not possibly establish herself in inu j L giblee for memory says Plotinus leads to the object of me moi y And as Mntmofyne excites the memory of intelligibles so Latona imparts an oblivion of material concerns Page 130 Diana the Saviour The epithet of the Saviour as may be inferred from Proclus on the Cratyhis was given by the ancients to all the celestial gods in common For speaking of the Christians of his time he obsertn s Men of the present day do not believe that the fun and n ioon are divinities nor do they worship the other celestial natu es who are our Saviours and governours leading b ck immor tal fouls and being those that fabricate and give subsistence to  nortal souls I should how ever say that men of this kind  who dare to entertain such an irrational opinion respecting the celestial gods arc hastening to Tartarus and to the most ir cf Table and inordinate part of the universe Page 136 Neptune contended ‚ with the Sun There are two ways of considering the battles ‚ of the gods which are so much celebrated in fable and each of these solves all the apparent  i e to the fouls of brutes absurdity FIRST VOLUME 283 absurdity in which such fables are involved The first of these u from considering the orderly ettfiinSion in the progression of all the divine genera from their ineffable source I mean that some are the causes of union and others ofseparation to things posterior that some Impart a generating power and others an undejihdpurity to subordinate natures and that some impart a good separate from the nature of its recipient but others such a good as is consubsistent with its receptacle Now this distinction and seeming opposition in divine natures was called by ancient my thologists contention and war I fay seeming opposition for all divine natures subsist in the most perfect friendship and pro found union with each other and at the same time that the es sence and energy of each are perfectly distinct they are either all in all which is the case with the divine unities or all in each which is the cafe with forms or ideas But the second mode of considering the battles of the gods is by regarding their progressions into the universe in conse quence of which the last orders dependent on the gods as they are produced by a long interval from the first causes are con tiguous to the subjects of their government and adhere to mat ter contract contrariety and all various division and by their proximate care of mortal concerns are obnoxious to desires and passions Lastly on account of their great sympathy with mor tal concerns and the partial providence which they exert for their welfare they actually war with each other But as even the last orders which perpetually follow the gods preserve the properties of their leaders though in a partial and manifold man ner hence they were very properly called by the ancients by the names of the gods their respective leaders Thus for in stance not only the deity who illuminates all things with super mundane light and who sits with Jupiter and the celestial gods was called Apollo but this name was given to the d√ mon who was the guardian of Hector This last mode indeed of consider ing battles among the gods is the key in the hands of the skil ful NOTES ON THE sul to the secret meaning of much of the mythology id the Iliad and shews us how the relation here given by Pausanias is to be understood For it means that certain dxmoniacal powers who rank among the kst attendants of the gods Neptune and the Sun once contended with each other about the land of Corinth and that Btiareus a d√ mon belonging to the deity of that name acted as a mediator between them I only add farther that these demons who are thus proximate to the subjects of their government and who are influenced by paflions like men are not essentially d√ mons though they are the perpetual attendants of the gods but they are d√ mons only cxca t according lo habitude proximity and alliance For between essential d√ mons who are the ecn lant attendants of the gods and men who are only sometimes damons according to habitude and sometimes atten dants of the gods it is necessary there should be an order of beings who are always d√ mons according to habitude and al ways the attendants of the gods Page 14 1 But there are three Jlatves of Jupiter fee It ap pears to me highly probable that the three Jupiters mentioned in tliis place by Pausanias are those three brother deities the offspring of Saturn between whom according to Homer the universe is divided or in other words that they are Jupiter Neptune and Pluto For the second of these itatues fays Pau sanias is called terrcjlrial Jupiter which is an epithet of Pluto as is evident from the Orphic hymn to that deity and from Homer as cited by Pausanias p 204  and Neptune in the Or phic hymn to Equity is called marine Jupiter nrotlioc maXt Zir Put that the reader may fee the processions and offices of these three demiurgic gods who are supermundane deities according to their first subsistence I shall present him with the following translation from Proclus in Theol Plat p 367 1 hese ruling gods replenish the apparent order of things in conjunction with the mundane gods and distribute whole parts ¬ nder the moon in a manner different from their government in FIRST VOLUME 285 the heavens but they every where energize according to a pa ternal and demiurgic mode unfolding the one fabrication of the universe and accommodating it to parts But their allotment and distribution are first according to the whole universe and one of these Jupiter produces the essences of things but the second Neptune lives and generations and the third Pluto admi nisters the divisions of forms And one of these establishes in the one demiurgus of the world every thing proceeding from thence but the other evocates all things into progression and the third converts all things to himself But their second distribution is into the parts of the universe For the first of these gods governs the inerratic sphere and its revolution But the second presides over the planetary spheres and perfects their multiform effica cious and prolific motions And the last of these gods governs the sublunary region and perfects intellectually the terrestrial world But in the third place we may contemplate these three demiurgic progressions in that which is generated Jupiter there fore governs the summit of generated natures and the sphere of fire and air but Neptune excites with an all various motion the extremely mutable elements and is the inspector and guardian of ever humid essence subsisting in air and water  and Pluto admi nisters by his providence the earth and all which it contains and on this account he is called Terrestrial Jupiter In the fourth place with respect to the whole of generation Jupiter is allotted the most exalted places in which as Sorrates observes in the Ph√ do the regions detUned to blessed fouls are contained  because they live stparatc from gem ration under the government of Jove  but Neptune governs hollow places and ta verns in which generation motion and concussions subsist on which account he is called the carthJLaling god nr d Pluto go verns places under the earth the various streams of water Tar tarus and the places in which fouls are judged Hence the fouls which have not yet proceeded into generation but abide in the intelligible pluce are suit to be of the order os Jupiter but such M NOTES ON THE such as lire in generation are said to be placed under Neptune And those which after generation are purified and punished and either wander under the earth for a thousand years or again re turn to their principle are said to live under Pluto In the fifth place the distributions of these gods are divided according to the centres of the universe For Jupiter possesses the oriental centre as being allotted an order correspondent to that of fire but Nep tune obtains the middle centre which corresponds to a vivific na ture and through which generation enjoys celestial natures and Pluto obtains the western centre  since the west is allied to earth because it is nocturnal and the cause of obscurity and darkness For shade proceeds from the earth and earth is the privation of light from west to east Lastly according to every division of the universe such natures as arefirst and obtain the principality belong to Jove such as are middle correspond to the kingdom of Neptune aud such ai are last belong to the empire os Pluto Page 141 Mercury in a fitting posture and by thefide of him a ram The reason why Mercury was represented by the ancients with a ram depends on the intimate alliance of this god with Mi nerva who as we are informed by Proclus on the Tim√ us pre sides over that celestial constellation called the ram and from thence imparts a motive power which governs the universe But the agreement of Minerva with Mercury will be obvious from considering that this goddess as we have before observed extends the whole of intelb ilual light and that Mercury is the source of the reasoning power Hence the ancients used to render the statues of both these divinities one by joining them together and a statue of this kind they called f na8i¬ i Hermathena or Mercury Minerva These Hermathena are mentioned by Cicero in his books De Inventione I only add that the verses of Homer cited by Pausanias may be sound Iliad 14 v 490 Page 144 Minerva Chalinitii i e the Bridler u Pa e 147 I is Isis is the fame with Minerva according to the √ gyptians as we are informed by

Plutarch in his above mentioned treatise  but I know of no author except Proclua who has cited the latter part the fruit which I have brought forth is the fun nor has this import ant addition been noticed by any modern writer that I am ac quainted with owing doubtless to the want of a copious index to these invaluable commentaries ot Proclus As Ifis therefore is Minerva and as the veil of this goddess as I have observed in a former note is an emblem of Nature which proceeds from those intellectual vital powers contained in the es sence of Minerva we may perceive the reason why the Arriians √ thiopians and √ gyptiaus called Nature as we are informed by Apuleius Ifis Likewise since the moon as we learn from Pro clus is the auiWion ayafyia tr fveit the fe f i t ive image of Na ture we may fee why Nature was called by the Cretans according to Apuleius in the tame place Diana And in short as Minerva was justly called by the ancients xoji f n t¬ ¬ Si¬ ¬ the summit of the gods and is therefore their source in conjunction with her father Jupittr we may at one view see the propriety of her being called by the names of so many other goddesses in the following sublime passage from the Metamorphoses of Apuleius  for as every cause is that primarily which its estect is secondarily Minerva is in a certain respect the same with all the divinities that proceed irom her when they arc considered according to their causal subsistence in her essence The divinity of the moon then thus addresses the metamor phosed NOTES ON THE phosed Apulcius En adsurm tin s commota Luci precibus rtf

between divine and human na tures ancient theologilts meant to insinuate that communication of energy between the two which we have taken notice of in a former note in which we shewed how heroes may

guardian of the whole of prophetic exhalation or we may fay with greater propriety that he is the cause of the dis order and obstruction about exhalations of this kind As the prophetic power therefore proceeds originally from Apollo the opposition of energy between Apollo and Python and the domi nion of that of the former over that of the latter gave rife to the fable mentioned in this place by Paufanias Diana too may be said to have assisted Apollo in slaying Python in consequence of the wonderful union between these two divinities Page isi t For Hesiodfays In hit Works and Days lib i v 263 Page 162 Mercury Forenfis Mercury was thus denomi nated as presiding over affairs of law and the propriety of this appellation will be evident from considering that Mercury is the source of gymnastic music and reasoning that reasoning is an intcl IcBual operation and that law as Plato De Legibus beauti fully observes is nv itetfu n the distribution os intellect For the fake of the liberal reader I hall further observe concerning Mer¬ cury that he is the source os invention and hence he is said to be the son of Maia because search which is implied by Maia leads invention into light He bestows too mathests on fouls by un folding the will of his father Jupiter and this he accomplices at the angel or messenger of Jupiter Proclus in MS Comment  in Aleibiad observes that be is the inspective guardian of gymnastic exercises and hence hermtc or carved statuts of Mer cury were placed in the Pal√ stra of music and hence he is ho noured as the lyrist Avjxzwc among the celestial constellations and of discipRnts because the invention of geometry reasoning and U z discourse 2Q2 NOTES ON THE discourse is referred to tliis god He presides therefore over every species of erudition leading us to an intelligible essence from this mortal abode governing the d sserent herds of fouls and dis persing the sleep nd oblivion with which they are oppiessed He is likewise the supplier of recollection the end of which is a ge nuine intellectual apprehension of divine natures After tliis he observes that the different r ges of our life on the earth correspond to the order of the universe For our first age says he partakes in an eminent degree of the lunar ope rations as we then live according to a nutritive and natural  power But our second age participates of Mercurial preroga tives because we then apply ourselves to letters music and wrest ling The third age is governed by Venus because then we be gin to produce seed and the geneiative powers of nature arc put in motion The fourth age is solar for then oar youth is in its vigour and full perfection subsisting as a medium between gene ration and decay for such is the order which vigour is allotted But the sifth age is governed by Mars in which we principally aspiie after power and superiority over others The sixth age is governed by Jupiter for in this we give ourselves up to pru dence and pursue an active and political life And the seventh age is Saturnian in which it is natural to separate ourselves from generation and transfer ourselves to an iueorporeal life And thus much we h ve discussed in order to procure belief that let ters and the wkjble education of youth is suspended from the Mercu ial series 1 only add that as the first gifts of this god are intellectual lo his last pertain to the acquisition of ain Hence lie was called the god of merchandise and theft for crust as Plo ‚ tinut K a l fully observes is a eflu xton of intellect and from these two professions craft is inseparable Pas e 16 T¬ He culct as to a hero The grand source aa it appears to me of all that dire confusion which has taken place in opinion  g t ie gods is the belies that they were no thing more than men who once lived on the eartk and after their death FIRST VOLUME 293 ieath were deified for their exalted worth fThil opinion too ori ginated from a misconception of divine fables and ignorance of the manner in which every divine order proceeds to the extre mity of tli jigs For every god as I have before observed confer the characteristic oshi3 nature on ail its participants and those heroic souls that have at times appeared on the earth and of whom we have given an account in a former note conscious that they possessed the properties of those gods from whom they descended calied themselves by tbt names of their parent divinities Thus heroic fouls who descended from Jupirer called themselves by the name of that god Thus a hero √ sculapius has lived among men who descended from the god os that name This too has been the cafe with an heroic Bacchus Mercury Apollo and in short with heroes of the fame names with all the other gods Hence we must consider Hercules as a hero who descended from the deity of that name who in his highelt subsistence according to the Orphic theology is the fame with the celebrated Phanes or Prutogmus the exemplar of the universe Ag heroic souls therefore of this kind were as we have before observed called by the ancients gods according to similitude or in other words from their ap proaching to the perfection of a divine nature as much as is pos sible to man and particularly when liberated from the present body ‚ hence it is easy to see how Hercules may be a god and yet a man how the hero Hercules may be said to have been dei sied after his death without confounding the divine with the hu man nature and in short how ignorance of this mojl important particular has given birth to the delirious systems of modern wri ters on mythology Page 164 And cn her

figures of Mercury Proclus on Euclid  informs us that the Pythagoreans signified by a  Lib it in Def 3 et 34 U 3  square ¬ 94 NOTES ON THE square a pure and immaculate order And shortly after he adds that the gods who are the authors to all things of stable dispo sition of pure and uncontaminated order and of uninclining power are very properly manifested as from an image by a qua drangular figure As it is the province therefore of Mercury to unfold and fill all things with truth and truth is the fame with sure simplicity and as stability osejfcnct is derived from truth we may easily perceive the propriety of consecrating a square figure to Mercury As Hercules too according to his mundane distri bution as a god seems to be the fame with the Sun according to the Orphic theology and Mercury Venus and Apollo arc deities of the fame order and profoundly united to each other we can not wonder that the statues of Hercules should resemble those of Mercury Page 165 Avcrrunci These gods were

contrary to her nature and is diseased She icquires therefore the assistance of √ sculapius or the god of health that he may be restored to her true life And hence the propriety of consecrating dragons to √ sculapius But a dragon Or y be considered as the symbol of partial life of every kind and consequently of that mortal life which is participated by the body and which on the dissolution

united to him for this is the meaning of his being enamoured with Juno is beheld by the goddels as subsisting according to sublime wisdom For a bird may be considered as the image of elevation and a cuckoo according te √ lian is a mrfl wise bird Let it however be carefully remembered that the divinities are profoundly united to each bther perpetually according lo n energy separate from mundane concerns and yet at the fame time providentially preside over every part of the universe but fables in order to exhibit these different energies to our view by apt images are obliged to represent them as taking place at different times Page 183 The reply of the Pythian oracle to Glaucus the son vf Epiades ling of the Spartans read and king of the Spartans That cl ildicn should be punished for the

such as are celes tial Pluto such as are terrestrial and Neptune the natures be tween these Hence Jupiter holds a sceptre which signifies his judicial power But Neptune a trident because he it tht inspective guardian os this triple nature which has a middlejituation And Pluto wears a helmet on account of the darkness over which he presides For as a helmet conceals the head so Pluto is the power that presides over invisible natures And here a reader unskilled in the ancient theology will doubtless object that according to this doctrine Neptune must either be the fame with Juno since he is the divinity of air or there must be two divinities of the air To this I answer that Neptune considered as one divinity who presides over all the middle elements comprehends in his essence Juno according to her sublunary distribution so that both Neptune and Juno govern the air but the former more universally and the latter more particularly the former ruling at the same time over other  It likewise signifies as we have before observed frem Proclus hij tammanding or ruling characteristic natures yx NOTES ON THE ‚ atures but the latter pfefiding over air alone And the fame reasoning must be

covered the face Page 223 Depriving Homer of sight Those who have hap pily penetrated the profound wisdom of the ancients will be easily convinced that the report concerning the blindness of Homer is merely fabulous containing some recondite informa tion like other divine fables of antiquity For he is said to have lost his sig t through his accusation of Helen But it would be ridiculous in the extreme if we take all that is related of Helen in the literal stuse to suppose that Homer should have been deprived of his light for reviling such an infamous woman Indeed not only the blindness of Homer il fabulous but both the Iliad and Odyssey are to be considered as divine fables I do not mean to assert by this that there never was such a war as the Trojan or such a person as Ulysses but it is my opinion that Humcr by combining fiction with certain historical facts has delivered to us some very concealed and valuable information in these two admirable poems That the rape of Helen indeed is fabulous was the opinion oF 120 less a person than Plato as is evident from the following pas sage from his Phxdrus There is an ancient purification for those who offend in matters respecting mythology which Ho mer FIRST VOLUME mer did not perceive but which was known to Stesichorili For being deprived of his eyes through his accusation of Hel n he was not like Homer ignorant of the cui e of his blindnets but knew it as being a musician So that he immediately com posed the followirg lines False was my tale thou ne er across the main In beauteous ships didst fly Troy s lofty totv rs to gain And thus having composed a poem directly contrary to what he had before published and which is called a recantation he immediately recovered his lost sight  That the blindnen too of Homer and his account of the Trojan war are pregnant with mystic meaning is thus beautifully shewn by l roclui on Plato s Republic p 39 Stefichorus who considered he whole fa le of Helen as a true narration who approved the con sequent transact c iis and established his poetry accordingly with great propriety suffered the punishment of his folly that is ignorance but at length through the afliu f e of rm sic he is said to have acknowledged his error and tl thro igh under standing the mysteries concerning Helen and the Trojan war to have recovered his sight But Homer is said to have been bli id not on account of his ignorance of these mysteries as Stefichorus but through a more perfect h hit of the foul viz by separating himself from scnub e beauty establishing his intelligence above all apparent harmony and extending th_ intellect of his foul to unapparenr r nd true harmony Hence he is said to have been blind because that intellectual beauty to which he raised him m cMf l Sile STrjo i it rof

this account too fables bordering on tragedy represent Homer as deprived of sight on account of his accusation of Helen But fables in my opinion intend to signify by Helen all the beauty subsisting about generation for which there is a perpetual battle ¬ f fouls till the more intellectual having vanquished the more irrational forms of life return to that place from which they originally came But according to some the period of their circulation about sensible forms consists of ten thousand years since a thou sand years produce one ambit as of one year For nine years therefore i e for nine thousand years fouls revolve about ge neration but in the tenth having vanquished all the barbaric tumult they are said to have returned to their paternal habi tations I only add farther that the English reader who it desirous of understanding the mystic meaning of the Odyssey may perhaps find his expectations not entirely disappointed by perusing the notes to my translation of Porphyry on Homer Cave of the Nymphs in vol ii of Proclus on Euclid Page 236 Sacrifice and incantations He whose intellectual eye is strong enough to perceive that all things sympathize with all will be convinced that the magic cultivated by the ancient philosophers is founded on a theory no less sublime than ration al and true Such a one will consider as Plotinus observes the nature of foul as every where easy to be attracted when a proper subject is at hand which is easily passive to its influence And that every thing adapted to imitation is readily passive and is like a mirror able to seize a certain form and reflect it to the view Page 240 Cere indeed is called Chthenia Chthonia means terrestrial and Cere was we may suppose thus denominated from her profound union with Vesta the proper divinity of the earth For some says Proclus on Euclid call both the Earth and Ceres Vesta and they fay that Rhca totally par ticipates her nature and that all generative causes arc contained in her essence  FIRST VOLUME Page 141 The hydra As we have already shewn that the labours of Hercules are allegorical the account given of his cut ting off the hydra s heads which formed one of his labours must consequently be a fabulous narration By the hydra therefore the ancients seem to have occultly signified the various and ma terial form of the foul which branches out into‚ I Communi cation with the lives and opinions of the multitude 2 Multi form desires which divide the foul about body and cause it to energize about externals at one time connecting it with irra tional pleasures and at another time with actions indefinite and opposing each other 3 The senses which are educated as it were with the rational foul and deceive its cogitative power for these are multiform and perceive nothing accurate or true 4 Phantasies on account of their figured and divisible nature and immense variety which do not suffer us to betake ourselves to an indivisible and immaterial essence but draw down those who are hastening to the apprehension of such a nature to a passive Intelligence 5 Opinions because these are various and infinite tend to externals and are mingled with phantasy and sense The hydra s heads therefore are images of all these which Hercules who is an intellectual hero is with great propriety said to have destroyed Page 246 To had loch Semele Bacchus is the monad or proximately exempt producing cause of the Titaus or ultimate artificers of things and Semele as we have shewn from Olynv piodorns in a former note is sublunary fire i e the divinity of sublunary fire As Semele therefore according to heT ultimate progressions is suspended from Bacchus she may verv properly be laid to have been led back from Hades or the profundities of a material nature by Bacchus because every divine monad ele vates to itself the series of which it is the head I only add that it is by no means improbable that this Alcyonian lake may be one of those passages through which the defluxions of the element are transmitted to the inmost recesses of the earth so as to forra those 3o4 NOTES ON THE those suhtrrranran rivers which are so much celebrated by an cient theologists So

be the leall Joi bt but that the greater part of men of the present day believe the ancient oracles to have been nothing more than the tricks of designing priests and the remaining part which is certainly a very tmall one wiil as it appears to me ascribe them to the influence of evil spirits However as it is a well known fact that moil of the oracles ceased when the Christian religion made its appearance it is impossible that they should have been nothing more than fraudulent tricks for if this had been the cafe there was a much gicatei necessity than ever for the ex ercise of such tricks when a new religion started up diameti ically opposite to the old one nor can any reason be affigned why on this hypothesis the oracles should cease On the other hand to say that they were produced by the influence of evil spirits is just as absurd as to assert that evil is naturally the source of good for the tendency os the oracles was evidently direited to the good both of individuals and cities which in numberless instances they were the means of procuring It may therefore be safely con cluded that they were produced by divine influence and that they ceased when the Christian religion appeared because the part  FIRST VOLUME parts of the earth In which the oracles were given then became too impure to receive the prophetic inspiration For as we have observed in a former note there must be a concurrence of proper instruments times and places in order to receive divine in fluence in a proper manner so that when all or any of these are wanting this influence will either be not at all received or will be received mingled with the delusions of error But let the l eader who desires popular conviction of this important fact that there was no collusion in general in the ancient oraclce peruse the first book of Cicero De Divinationc  and unless his intellectual eye is dreadfully Winded by the darkness of perseS at hcism which has now spread itself among all ranks of men he must be at least con vinced that they were not produced by the knavery of priests That the priests indeed were sometimes corrupted the passage before us of Pausanias and many other instances which might be adduced sufficiently prove but this does not in the least in validate the existence of divine influence or the reality of ora cular prediction because the best thing3 always have been and always will be perverted through the weakness and viciousness of the bulk of mankind Page 281 Tie Archon EpcnymusS Sylburgius observes heie that governors of this kind were called Archons because they annually possessed the supreme authority but that they were called Eponymi because the years in the fasti and annals were in scribed aster their names just as among the Romans the years were not only numbered from the time in which their city was built but were rendered remarkable by the names of their con suls Page 290 Jupiter Euanemus That is Jupiter the cause os prosperous

That is Mars the son os Bd lona Page 294 EnotUan Hecate Diana according to Festus was called Enodia because she presides over ways We have before observed that there is a wonderful union between Hecate and Diana and hence Proclus in his common hymn which has been already cited in these notes calls Hecate Prothyrtif which as we are informed by Diodorus is one of the appellations of Diana Page 300 Orthia Diana Hesychius informs us that Diana came to be thus denominated from a place in Arcadia where he had a temple Page 301 Sprinkled with human Mood If we attend to the pre existence of human fouls and consider the crimes which they may have committed in former periods of existence on the earth and at the fame time consider that nothing escapes the pene trating eye of providence and that all its administrations are con consummately just the apparent cruelty in the injunction of this oracle vanishes For of what consequence is it whether a man who deserves to die is flain before an altar or put to death in a common way And we may be sure that no man is punished ei ther with death or the loss of his possessions or is in short op pressed with any calamity unjustly For though the conduct of such a one in that period of his existence in which he suffers may de serve a milder destiny yet it may be safely concluded that in some past period of existence it has been such as to demand the pu nishment which he endures It must however be observed that this doctrine does not hold good with respect to truly worthy men by which I mean those heroic souls of whom I have given an account in a former note for the calamities which befall others when they happen to these are sent by divinity as purifi cation  FIRST VOLUME 30 Cations necessary to the perfection of their virtue The number of these however is but small and consequently the exceptions to this observation are but few Page 305 Are believed to be brothers Sleep and Death were with great propriety said by the ancients to be twins from the intimate alliance between Sense and Phantasy from which we are liberated by these divinities For as Sleep frees us from the senses so Death from the phantasy But Sltep considered as a godj is that power through which the divinities are enabled to ener gize in a manner separate from all inferior concerns at the fame time that their providential care is extended to every part of the universe  and this latter energy was denominated by ancient the ologists vigilance I only add that the passage of Homer alluded to by Pausaniasis Iliad 16 v 672 and that Sleep and Death are called brothers both by Orpheus and Hcsiod Page 308 Chiron Chiron according to fables was the son of Saturn by the nymph Philyra the daughter of Ocean And it is said that Saturn in order to elude Rhea changed himself into a horse when he was connected with Philyra Hence the upper parts of Chiron as far as to his navel were those of a man and his lower parts were those of a horse Chiron therefore is the image of a man who lived in the confines of the kingdom of Jupiter and Saturn or in other words who lived a life partly ‚ consisting of the political and partly of the intellectual virtues but yet so that he possessed the former in greater perfection than the latter For the fable by asserting that his upper parts were human signifies his living according to the politic virtues of which Jupiter is the exemplar j since Jupiter is peculiarly ir T¬ a Jja¬ n Siarc i the father of gods and men As Jupiter therefore is emi nently a political god man must partake in an eminent degree of a political life But the lower parts of Chiron evidently partake of the nature of Saturn and Saturn is the source of an intel leSual life which he causes to receive the most extreme division But what are we to understand by Saturn changing himself into X x a horse I 3o8  NOTES ON THE a hoi se I answer that a certain d√ moniacal power of the order of Saturn ib signified by this mutation For ancient theologtfls called the processions of any divinity to the lad of things ac cording to different orders and degrees mutations So that the fable by asserting that Chiron was the son of Caturn by one of the nymphs of the ocean signifies that a Saturnian d√ mon and a nymph co operated with the parents of Chiron by a certain na tural sympathy in begetting him Page 308 The judgment of Parti The fable here alluded to is thus beautifully explained by the philosopher Sallust in his treatise De Diis et Mundo cap 4 It is said that Discord at a banquet of the gods threw a golden apple and that a dispute about it arising among the goddesses they were sent by Jupiter to take the judgment of Paris who charmed with the beauty of Venus gave her the apple in preference to the rest In this fable the banquet denotes the supermundane powers of the gods and on this account they subsist in conjunction with each other but the golden apple denotes the world which on ac count of its composition from contrary natures is not improperly said to be thrown by Discord or Strife But again since dif ferent gists are imparted to the world by different gods they appear to contest with each other for the apple And a foul living according to fense for this is Paris not perceiving other powers in the universe asserts that the contended apple subsists alone through the beauty of Venus Page 308 Dragging the three mouthed dog from Hadcs By a dog the ancients signified the discriminating and at the same time reproving power of the souL For of this power the sagacity and barling of a dog are images And as its energies are triple for it detects and reproves the fallacies of the senses imagination and opinion these are represented by the three heads of Cer berus The great Hercules therefore drew this dog from Hade up to the regions of day viz he liberated this power of his foul from its residence in the dark profundities of a material 3 nature i FIRST VOLUME nature and raised it to the light of truth This account of Cerberus appears to me to be more accurate than that which I have given in my Dissertation on the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries Page 309 Plritbous and Theseus forcibly taking away Helen Theseus and Pirithous fays Proclus in Plat Polit p 381 are fabled to have ravished Helen and descended to the infer nal regions i e were lovers both of intelligible and visible beauty Afterwards one of these Theseus on account of his magnanimity was liberated by Hercules from Hades but the other Pirithous remained there because he could not sustain the arduous altitude of divine contemplation

Nights Entertainments will doubtless be agree ably surprised to find if they have not discovered it before that X 3 this Sio NOTES ON THE this interesting account of the preservation of An stomenes in the deep chasm has been taken from Pausanias with some alteration by the author of those tales and forms one of the most curious parts of the history of Sindlad the sailor A a the Arabians a little after the year of Christ 820 under the auspices of the Ca liph Almaimon who was the great patron of literature and in deed by his orders translated the best works of the Grecian phi losophers and mathematicians into Arabic perhaps Pausanias was translated by them at the same time I only add that Aristo menes appears to have been one of those heroes of whom we have given an account in a former note Page 413 The anger of the Dioscuri We must not suppose that a divine nature is capable of anger or can be appeased by gifts for in this cafe it would be subject to pasfion and influ enced by delight But by such expressions as these nothing more is implied than the effects which vice and virtue produce in our fouls For guilt as Sallust  well observes prevents us from re ceiving the illuminations of the gods and subjects us to the power of avenging d√ mons and prayers and sacrifices become the re medies of our vices and cause us to partake of the goodness of the gods So that it is the fame thing fays he to assert that divinity is turned from the evil as to fay that the fun is concealed from those who are deprived of sight Page 416 Sacadai and Pronomus For particulars respect

Fortune is that divine power which disposes things differing from each other and happening contrary to expectation to beneficent purposes Or it may be defined that deific distribution which causes every thing to fill up the lot as signed to it by the condition of its being This divinity too congregates all sublunary causes and enables them to confer on sublunary effects that particular good which their nature and merits eminently deserve But the following extraordinary passage from Simplicius on Aristotle s Physics lib ii p 81 con cerning Fortune will I doubt not be acceptable to readers

intellectual life is implied For such a life is pure impassive and free from for ‚ row and of this impassivity and purity gold is an image through its never being subject to rust or putrefaction Such

Homeric Circe is it is ne¬ cessary to observe that the ancient theologists when they repre sent divine natures as employed in the exercise of certain arts means to ininuate by such arts producing prolific inttllcBual and perseQ vvepowers which proceed from the gods into the universe all the parts of which are nothing more than illuminations of these powers This being premised Circe says Proclus in his Scholia on the Cratylus is that divine power which weaves all the life contained in the four elements and at the fame time by her song harmonizes the whole sublunary world But the shuttle with which she weaves is represented by theologists as golden because her essence is intellectual pure immaterial and unmingled with generation all which is signified by the shuttle being golden And her employment consists in separating things stable from such as are in motion according to divine diversity  I only add that Homer with great propriety re presents Circe who presides over the sublunary world or the realms of geneiation as waited on by Nymphs sprung from fountains for Nympha tsays Hermias Comment MS in Flat Ph√ drum are goddesses presiding over regeneration and are the

in generation Pluto who is characterized according to intellect with great propriety converts ends to beginnings forming a circle without a beginning or an end not only in fouls but in bodies Thus for instance he eternally evolves the circulations of the stars the motions of things in generation and the like But some erro neously analyse the name of Pluto into wealth from the earth through fruits and metals and of Aides into the obscure dark and terrible These are now censured by Socrates who assigns the fame meaning to these two names referring Pluto as intel lect to the tvealth of prudence and Aides to an intellect which knows all things For this god is a sophists who purifies fouls after death and frees them from generation For Aides or tht obscure is not as some erroneoufly interpret it evil since neither is death an evil though Aides appears to some to be full of per turbation But every thing intelligible is obscure and in this fense Aides is better than every visible nature The lovers of body however who viciously refer the passions of the animated part to themselves consider death as something terrible and as the cause of corruption but in reality it i9 much better for a man to die and live in Hades according to nature than to live with body contrary to nature and prevented from energizing intel lectually Hence it is necessary to strip ourselves of the flesti J with

nature from whence it is wonderful to fee how much inferiors in the fame order yield to such as are superior though they do not yield to them in magnitude and strength Hence they say that a cock is Y

hence we hall learn that the properties of the fun are more abun dantly received by the cock than the lion And the truth of this is evinced from hence that the cock celebrates and as it were invokes the rising sun by his crowing as if with certain hymns when that luminary bends his course from the antipodes to us and that sometimes solar angels appear in forms of this kind and though they are in themselves without form yet they appear with it to us who are connected with figure Sometimes too solar d√ mons are seen with a leonine front who suddenly disappear when a cock is placed before them

others it promises freedom from bonds deli cacies and favours They draw down too powers of this kind by songs and incantations But Magic according to the Greeks is a thing of a very powerful nature For they fay that this forms the last part of the sacerdotal science Magic indeed investigates the nature power and quality of every thing sublunary viz of the elements and their parts of animals all various plants and their fruits of stones and herbs and in lhort it explores the essence and power of every thing From hence therefore it produces its effects And it forms statues which procure health

therefore they contribute But Y 3 for 3i6 NOTES ON THE for the fashioning of certain parts wax and clay are used Often too celestial fire is made to appear through magic and then statues laugh and

Antro Nymph informs us that the ancient priests of Ceres called the moon who is the queen of generation a bull Page NOTES ON THE Page 159 Homer Iliad r ver 395 It is remarkable that not one of the translators of Homer has noticed the manner in which the Eleatis understood the v vyjj in one of these lines For by the Latin translators It is rendered ad portam inferorum i c at the gate of the infernal regions and the English hare followed the Latin translators However as the ancients must be supposed to have understood the meaning of particular words in Homer better than the moderns there can be no doubt but that the Eleans were right when they considered i¬ m u as signi fying in Pylus Page 160 Corybas We are informed by the emperor Julian in his Oration to the Mother of the Gods that Corybas it the Sun Page 161 There is a cock on the helmet of the goddess The true reason perhaps why Phidias placed a cock on the helmet of Minerva is because this goddess as we have shewn in a former note was called by the ancients Health and a cock is sacred to √ sculapius who is the god of health Page 162 Homer Iliad 15 ver 528 Page 162 Is an erect penis on a basis The reason why Mer cury was represented by the ancients in this manner is as it ap pears to me because this deity unfolds truth and intellectual light from its occult subsistence in the essence of the gods just as that prolific power which is latent in feed is unfolded by the penis Page 165 Homer Iliad 2 ver 576 Page 176 Homer Lib xviii near the end in the descrip tion of the shield of Achilles Page 178  is an accurate representation of an √ gyptian sta tue We are informed by Poiphyry De Antro Nymph that the √ gyptians placed all demons not connected with any thing solid or stable but raised on a sailing vessel By this they doubt less iutended to signify the connexion of these powers with the 8 flowing  SECOND VOLUME 33t flowing realms of generation And hence we may infer that the statue mentioned in this place by Pausanias was an image of a tUmoniacal Minerva Page 198 Afire there it than other Jiret more fierce Kuhniut observes that this proverb is mentioned Jay Plutarch in his Life of Demetrius by Homer Odyssey 19 and by Aristophanes in Equit Page 212 When he says Plato speaks to this effect in the 5th book of his Republic Page 214 The mother Dindymene and Attet Dindymcne signifies Cybele or the mother of the gods But the fable respect ing this goddess and Attes or rather Attis for so it is written by Harpocration Suidas the emperor Julian and the philoso pher Sallust is beautifully unfolded by Sallust in his golden treatise On the Gods and the World chap 4 as follows It is said that the mother of the gods perceiving Attis by the river Gallus became in love with him and having placed on him a starry hat lived afterwards with him in intimate familiarity but Attis falling in love with a nymph deserted the mother of the gods and entered into association with the nymph Through this the mother of the gods caused Attis to become insane who cutting off his genital parts left them with the nymph and then returned again to his pristine connexion with the goddess The mother of the gods then is the vivisic goddess and on this account is called mother 1 but Attis is the demiurgusof na tures conversant with generation and corruption  and hence he is said to have been found by the river Gallus for Gallus denotes the Galaxy or milky circle from which a passive body descends to the earth But since primary gods perfect such as are se condary the mother of the gods falling in love with Attis im parts to him celestial powers for this is the meaning of the starry hat But Attis loves a nymph and nymphs preside over generation for every thing in generation flows But because it is necessary that the flowing nature of generation should be stopped NOTES ON THE stopped lest something worse than things last mould be pro duced in order to accomplish this the demiurgus of generable and corruptible nature sending prolific powers into the realms of generation is again conjoined with the gods But these things indeed never took place at any particular time because they have a perpetuity of subsistence and intel lect contemplates all things as subsisting together but discourse considers this thing as first and that as second in the order os existence For a further explanation of tlu s fable which being of the mixed species belongs as we are informed by Sallust to mysticsacrifices fee my translation of the emperor Julian s Oration to the Mother of the Gods Page 223 Homer Iliad 21 ver 446 The reader must carefully observe that the Neptune and Apollo mentioned in these verses were heroes and not gods With respect to the statue of Apollo standing on the skull of an ox the meaning of this will be apparent from considering that as the moon as we have al ready shewn from Porphyry is the queen of generation Apollo or the fun who is paternally all that the moon is maternally must be the king of generation of which a bull or an ox is a symbol Hence his treading on the head of an ox signifies his dominion over the realms of generation and particularly over its summit ether Page 225 The oracle in Dodona Jupiter s oracle at Dodona was the most ancient of all the oracles of Greece prior to the Flood and was restored by Deucalion after it The Scholiast upon the 16th Iliad v 233 c informs us from a very ancient author Thrasybulus that Deucalion after the Flood which happened in his time having got safe upon the firm land of Epirus prophe sied in an oak and by the admonition of an oraculous dove having gathered together such as were saved from the flood caused them to dwell together in a certain place or country which from Jupiter and Dodaiia one of the Oceanides they called Do dona At Dodona there were brazen kettles which it is said were SECOND VOLUME 333 were so artificially placed about the temple that by striking one of them the sound was communicated to all the rest According to Menander if a man touched them but once they would con tinue ringing the whole day But it appear to me that the reason why brass was dedicated in particular to Dodonean Jupiter is because this deity subsists according to a terrestrial characteristic and brass as we learn from Proclus is a symbol of a resisting solid or of earth For earth receives the illuminations of all the gods And hence fays Proclus in Tim p 282 there are a terrestrial Ceres Vesta and Isis as likewise a terrestrial Jupiter and a terrestrial Hermes established about the one divinity of the earth just as a multitude of celestial gods proceeds about the one divinity of the heavens For there are progrejfiont os all the celestial gods Into the earth and earth contains all things In an earthly manner which heaven comprehends celestially Hence we speak of a terrestrial Bacchus and a terrestrial Apollo who bestows the all various streams of water with which the earth abounds and openings prophetic of futurity Brass indeed was employed by the an cients as we learn from the Scholiast on Theocritus Eidyl 2 in all consecrations and expiations because they considered it as something pure and endued with a power of expelling pollutions And Eustathius upon this line in the 18th book of the Iliad tx itoutoio 3v a¬ i hwu ¬ J unm xabxii‚ i C Forth from the deep with

that brass accords with every diviner spirit ar d hence a tri pod formed from this metal is dedicated to Apollo Often too when the air is perfectly tranquil and every thing else is still hollow

Dodona The reader who is desirous of seeing the original of this passage may find it in page 11 of the Collection of Oracles by Opsopoeus Different accounts are given of the Dodonean oracle for it is the most ancient of the Grecian oracles According to some an oak prophesied in Dodona but according to others doves The truth however is that priestesses whose heads were crowned with oak prophe sied  and these women were called by some peleiades or doves Perhaps therefore certain persons being deceived by the name suspected that doves prophesied in Dodona and as the heads of these women were crowned with oak perhaps from this cir cumstance they said that an oak prophesied But this oracle belongs to Jupiter and that in Delphos to Apollo With great propriety therefore are these oracles considered as allied to each other For Apollo is said to be the assistant of Jupiter in the administration of things and often when the Dodonean oracle appeared to be obscure the oracle in Delphos has been consulted in order to know the meaning of that of Jupiter Often too Apollo has interpreted many of the Dodonean oracles Priest esses therefore when in an enthusiastic and prophetic condition nave greatly benefited mankind by predicting and previously cor recting future events but when in a prudent state they were similar to other women Page 227 Homcr Iliad 23 ver 584 Page 233 One of the nymphs belonging to the sea sell in love tuilh him We have hewn in a foimer note that the last order of powers that are the perpetual attendants of the gods and the proximate guardians of mortal natures has a great sympathy with SECOND VOLUME 335 with the objects of its care It is not at all improbable there fore that a nymph of the sea was connected with Selemus who when he died attracted to himself through intemperate desire a vehicle perfectly humid by which he became bound as it were to a certain stream and was therefore said to have been changed into a river by Venus Page 233 He cut offthe genitals of his father Heaven The authors of fables invented images of divine concerns in Imitation of Nature who shadows forth by parts things destitute of all parts by temporal eternal natures by dimensions thing void of quantity by sensibles intelligibles and so on For these divine men by preternatural concerns adumbrated the trans tendent nature of the gods by such as ar irrational a power more divine than all reason and by things apparently base incorporeal beauty Hence in the fable alluded to in this place by Pausanias we must consider the genital parts as symbols ofprolific power and the castration of these parts as signifying the progression of this power into a subject order So that the fable means that the pro lisic powers of Heaven are called forth into progression by Saturn who is a deity of an inferior order The utility arising from fables of this kind to such as properly understand them is very great For they call forth our unperverted conceptions of divine natures

Melanis or the black There can be no doubt but that Celestial Venus is signified by this epithet and that she was thus denominated because she proceeds from tht goddess Night For she proceeds as we hate shewn in a formes note frc n the containing power of Heaven which according to the Orphic theology is profoundly united with Night Hence Night in the Orphic hymn to her is called Ki cr t Cypru i e Venus Page 268 But the goddess told Saturn that Jhe had brought forth a colt tsV The secret meaning of these two divine fables respecting Jupiter and Neptune appears to me to be as follows Saturn who is an intellectual god as we have before  observed establishes in himself the cause of motive vigour and through this Neptune acquires the perfection of his nature For a horse as we have hewn in a former note is an image of motive vi gour and Neptune is a deity who evoeates things into progression And this is the meaning of Saturn swallowing a coll while Nep¬ tune was privately taken away in order to be reared In like manner while Saturn establishes in himself the cause of an abiding energy Jnpiler advances to perfection because Jupiter subsists ac cording to a vitally abiding characteristic Hence Homer repre sents SECOND VOLUME 337 sents Jupiter estaUfffied In himself while the multitude of gods that proceed from him at one time abide with their parent and at another proceed into the universe and providentially energize about mundane affairs And this appears to be the meaning of the other fable Pausanias therefore is very right in conjectur ing that these sables respecting Saturn contain something of the wisdom of the Greeks for they arc indeed replete with the fublimest wisdom as the intelligent reader will easily perceive Page 269 Homer Iliad 2 v 231 and Iliad 12 V 202 Sec Page 294 Hesiod indeedin his Theogony mates mention of Styx The lines alluded to in the Theogony are 383 c It appears to me that Styx considered according to its first subsistence is the cause by which divine natures retain an immutable sameness of essence It is somewhat strange that Pausanias should be dubious whether Hesiod composed the Theogony when it ii cited as the production of Hesiod by Plato and Aristotle Page 295 Homer The passage respecting the oath of Juno is Iliad 15 v 36 concerning Titaresius Iliad 2 v 755  and concerning the preservation of Hercules by

Lucina is the assessor of the Fates and this is agreeable to the doctrine in the Orphic hymns For the moon or Diana is according to these hymns the fame with Lucina and in the hymn to Nature which as we have before shewn principally flourishes in the moon that god dess is expressly called Pepromene Page 309 Homer Iliad 24 v 527 By the two vessels placed by the throne of Jupiter out of which he

346 Nothing can be more absurd than the fable which these verses allude to if it is considered according to its literal meaning at the fame time that it is extremely beautiful when properly un derstood In order therefore to understand its secret meaning it is necessary to remind the reader of what I have before ob served that the processions of a divine nature to the extremity of things according to different orders and degrees were sym bolically called by ancient thcologifls mutations Hence by Neptune and Ceres changing themselves the former into a horse and the latter into a mare and from connection with each other begetting the horse Arion nothing more is meant than that a d√ mon iacal Neptune and a dxmoniacal Ceres co operated with the nat iral causes by which this animal was produced in beget ting him Page 311 Antimachus This Greek poet was a Colopho nian He wrote on the age and country of Homer and ac cording to Plutarch contended that Homer was his countryman Page

to the natures over which they preside and adhering to matter contract contrariety and an all various division who besides this partially preside over material affairs and diminish and disperse those separate powers which subsist uniformly and indivisibly in their primitive causes Hence as the gods operate uniformly indivisibly and with perfect SECOND VOLUME 339 perfect irapaffivity Isut these d√

Lycophron fays that Ophion and Eurynome the daughter of Ocean reigned among the gods called Titans prior to Saturn and Rhea but that Saturn and Rhea vanquished in wrestling Ophion and Eurynome and having hurled them into Tartarus invaded their kingdom Boethius too upon Porphyry lib 3 thus writes Quantum ad vetercs theologos refertur Jupiter ad Saturnum Saturnus ad C≈ lum C≈ lus ad antiquif

of all things for Ophion is doubtless derived from ofi ophit a serpent But of this dragon Damas cius in his treatise mci a pxu i On Principles gives the following account I likewise find in the Orphic rhapsodies that the theology neglecting the two first principles viz √ ther and chaos together with the one principle who is delivered in silence i e the first cause establishes the third principle pos terior to the two as the original because this first of all possesses something essable and commensurate to human discourse For in the former hypothesis the highly reverenced and undecaying Time the father of √ ther and chaos was the principle but in this Tims is neglected and the principle becomes a dragon See more from Damascius on the most interesting of all sub jects In my Introduction to

and at the same time reproving power of the soul And as Diana or the moon is the image of Nature she signifies in this fable the natural life wliich is divided about the bodies of all animals and which is the cause to all bodits of augmentation nutrition and generation As a stag too is a most lascivious animal it mull be considered as the image of a lascivious life The meaning of the fable therefore appears to be this Actason beholds Diana naked i e his rational foul converts itself to the natural life which is suspended from its essence and which subsists in Actseon according to a lascivious halit Hence by a conversion of this kind the foul becomes wholly changed into a lascivious life and this is the meaning of Action being changed into a stag But when this is the cafe tke rational foul becomes distributed by its discrimi nating power considered according to its divisible subsistence in the senses for the foul of such a one is wholly engrossed in sen sible discrimination and this is the meaning of Act√ on being torn in pieces by his dogs Page 10 He married Harmony the daughter of Venus and Mars We have shewn in a former note that by Cadmus if meant the

343 and Mars For Venus is the cause of all the harmony and ana logy in the universe and beautifully illuminates the order and communion of all mundane concerns But Mars excites the contrarieties of the universe that the world may exist perfect and entire from all its parts The progeny therefore of these two divinities must be the rerum concordia discors the concord ant discord or harmony of the

the body of the sublunary world Page 27 Pipes adapted to every kind of harmony In one of my notes on the Cratylus of Plato I have hewn from a pas sage out of the MS Commentary of Proclus on the first

ON THE lody of the pipe and on tins account Plato dots not admit it in his republic But the reason of this is the variety of this instrument the pipe which evinces that the art employing it ought to

but if the cavity above the holes of the pipe should be opened then each hole wonld fend forth more than three sounds Olympiodorus too in MS Comment in Ph√ donem observes as follows concerning this

generate paternally ¬ Alluding to the story of Marsyas and Apollo These THIRD VOLUME These pillars therefore are images of disterminating and at the fame time connecting powers which by their efficacious vigour eternally prevent things on high from being confused with things below Hence Atlas who contains these powers and who is one of the Tartarean gods about Bacchus energizes not only according to a separating power which is the characteristic of the Titans but likewise according to a connecting power which is the characteristic of Jupiter Page 52 Homer Iliad 2 ver 592 Page 55 Cabiri It appears to me that the celestial twins are no other than the Curetes according to their mundane sub sistence For the first subsistence of the Curetes is as we learn from Proclus in that order of gods which is denominated by the Chaldxan theologists ¬ ofpo intellectual and of which Saturn is the summit Their next subsistence is among the supermundane gods in which order they are called the Corylanlei And their third subsistence is doubtless that of the twins For the Curetes in the Orphic hymns are celebrated as the twins If this be the case and the Cabiri are according to the Scholiast on Apol lonius Rhodius Ceres Proserpine Pluto and Mercury they cannot be the same with either the Curetes Corybantes or Dioscuri For the Curetes according to Proclus are the guar dian triad of the intellectual triad Saturn Rhea and Jupiter and he informs us that one of these Curetes is Minerva The Co rybantes as we learn from the fame author are the guardians of the Coric triad Diana Proserpine and Minerva And as to the Dioscuri or the twine they are evidently different from the Cabi ri mentioned by the Scholiast Page 57 The Sphinx The Sphinx according to Lasus Hermioneus was the daughter of Echidna and Typhon and according to Clearchus he had the head and hands of a virgin the body of a dog a human voice the tail of a dragon the claws of a lion and the wings of a bird But it appears to me that the ancients by the Sphinx designed to represent to us the 546 ftOTES ON THE the nature of the phantasy In order to be convinced of which it is neceflary to observe that the rational soul or the true man consists of intellect cogitation Jiawia and opinion but the fictitious man or the irrational foul commences from the phanta sy under which desire and anger subsist Hence the basis of the rational life is opinion but the summit of the irrational life is the phantasy But the phantasy as Jamblichus beautifully ob serves glows upon as it were and fashions all the powers of the foul exciting in opinion the illuminations from the fenses and fixing in that life which is extended with body the impres sions which descend from intellect Hence says Proclus it folds itself about the indivisibility of true intellect conforms itself to all formless species and becomes perfectly every thing from which cogitation and our indivisible reason consist This being the cafe as the phantasy is all things passively which intellect is impassively on which account Aristotle calls the phantasy passive intellect hence the head of the Sphinx is human but at the fame time of the feminine sex this sex being the image from its passivity of irrational life By the Sphinx having the body of a dog the discriminating power of the phantasy is implied for a dog as we have stiewn before is the image of the discriminating power of the soul to Siaxpilixoi m vyjr f By her having the tail of a dragon and the claws of a lion the communication of the phantasy with desire and anger is signified And her wings are images of the elevating powers which the phantasy naturally possesses for it is re ele vated in conjunction with the returning foul to the region every way resplendent with light But the riddles of the Sphinx are images of the obscure and intricate nature of the phantasy He therefore who is unable to solve the riddles of the Sphinx i e who cannot comprehend the dark and perplexed nature of the phantasy will be drawn into her embraces and torn in pieces i e the phantasy in such a one will subject to its power the rational Use cause its indivisible energies to become divisible 8 and THIRD VOLUME 347 and thus destroy as much as possible its very essence But he who like Oedipus is able to solve the √ nigmas of the Sphinx or in other words to comprehend the dark essence of his phan tasy will by illuminating its obscurity with the light of in tellect cause it by becoming lucid throughout to be no longer what it was before Hence we may fee the propriety of the Egyptians placing a Sphinx in the vestibule of the temple of Isis who is the fame with Minerva For what the phantasy is in the microcosm man that Mther is in the universe But opinion may be called the vestibule of the rational soul and the rational soul is as it were the temple of that intellectual illumination which proceeds from Minerva In this vestibule therefore the phantasy is seated And in a similar manner √ ther is seated in the vestibule of that divine soul which is suspended from the deity of Minerva and which may be called her temple So that √ ther is the Sphinx of the universe Page 59 Pamphus Pamphus was an Athenian poet con temporary with Linus and is said to have composed poems and hymns prior to Homer Page 59 That Chaos was first generated In my Intro duction to the Parmenides of Plato I have shewn that in the opinion of all antiquity yf¬ i1o in the verse of Hesiod alluded to by Pausanias was considered as meaning was generated though in all the editions of Hesiod this word is translated suit as if the poet had said that Chats was the first of all things I shall only add at present from Simplicius De C≈ lo p 147 that Hesiod when he sings Chaos of all tilings was the first pratluc d insinuates that there was something prior to Chaos from which Chaos was produced For it is always necessary that every thing which is generated should be generated from something But this likewise is insinuated by Hesiod that the first cause it above all knowledge and every appellation Page 34S NOTES ON THE Page 64 Mimnermus Mimnermus was an elegiac poet of Colophon and according to Suidas was the son of Ligyrti ades hut ‚ according to others he was a Smyrnsean He flou rished about the time of Solon and besides elegies wrote on amatorial subjects as we learn from Propertius and Horace At present however nothing more than fragments of the works of this poet remain Page 64 Linus Linus according to Suidas was a poet of Chalcis and the first that brought the knowledge of letters from Ph≈ nicia to Greece He taught Hercules letters and is said to have ranked as the prince of lyric poets Two frag ments are all the remains of his works at present Page 67 That Orpheus was the son of the Muse Calliope How this is to be understood the reader may learn by con sulting the note on p 46 of Vol L of this work For an account of Orpheus fee the Dissertation prefixed to my Trans lation of the Orphic Hymns Page 6g With respect to the hymns of Orpheus Z c Fabricius and others are of opinion that the Orphic hymns which are now extant are the very hymns mentioned in this place by Pausanias But surely if this were the cafe Pausanias would not fay that the whole of the hymns of Orpheus does not amount to any coiifidtr able number for how can eighty six the number of the Orphic hymns now extant be called an inconsiderable number Page 72 They fay that Narcissus beheld himself in this foun tain SsV The fable of Narcissus beautifully represents to us the condition of a foul converting itself to the phantasy for this is the meaning of Narcissus hanging over the limpid theam and in consequence os this becoming enamoured with a cor poreal life or that life which subsists in body and which is no thing more than the delusive image of the true man i e of the rational and immortal foul Hence by an immoderate attach ment to this unsubstantial mockery and gliding semblance of the real soul such a one becomes at length wholly changed as far as is  THIRD VOLUME 34a is possible to his nature into a plantal condition of being into a beautiful but transient flower that is into a corporeal life or a life totally consisting in the mere energies of nature So that Narcissus is tlie image of a foul converting herself to phantasy and through this becoming drawn under the dominion of fense But it is here necessary to observe that the death of Narcissus is related by Plotinus and the anonymous author De Incredibi libus in Gale s Qpufcula in a manner different from that of Ovid For according to them Narcissus merged himself into the stream through endeavouring to embrace his shadow and disappeared The fable however is extremely beautiful whether we consider Narcissus as changed into a flower or suffocated in the stream For says Plotinus Ennead I lib vi as he in the fable who by catching at his shadow merged himself in the stream and disappeared so he who is captivated by beautiful bodies and does not depart from their embrace is precipitated not with his body but with his foul into a darkness profound and horrid to intellect through which becoming blind both here and in Hades he converses with nothing but shadows Page 72 As Jbe was playing and gathering jtoivers For the meaning of this part of the fable respecting Proserpine sec my Dissertation on the Ehiifinian and Bacchic Mjjleriet Page 76 Tirefias What are we to understand by Tiresiat becoming blind through beholding Minerva Certainly that by a profound conversion of the eye of his foul to divine wisdom he became abstracted from corporeal vision and thus by leading a life separate from sensible inspection was fabled to be corpo really blind Hence Tiresias is said by Homer Odyss 10 ver 493 c to be the only wise person in Hades and to pos sess intellect though dead through Proserpine while the other inhabitants of Hades arc nothing more than flying shadows For it may be truly asserted of such a one both in the present life and hereafter that he alone is wise and endued with intellect when v 35 NOTES ON THE when contrasted with the multitude of mankind who front being

only unfolds the manner in which 4 the THIRD VOLUME 353 ‚ he Delphic prophetess predicted future events but the manner in which this was accomplished by the prophetesses in Colophon and Branchid√ j and satisfactorily shews us how the gods com municate prophecy to mankind It is acknowledged by all men that the oracle in Colophon gives its answers through the medium of water for there is a fountain in a subterranean dwelling from which the prophetess drinks and on certain established nights after many sacred ntel have been previously perfoimed and she has drunk of the foun tain she delivers oracles but is not visible to those that are pre sent That this water therefore is prophetic is from hence ma nifest But how it becomes so this according to the proverb is not for every man to know For it appears as if a certain pro phetic spirit pervaded through the water This is not however in reality the cafe For a divine nature does not pervade through its participants in this manner according to interval and division but comprehends as it were externally and illuminates the foun tain and fills it from itself with a prophetic power For the in spiration which the water affords is not the whole of that which proceeds from a divine power but the water itself only prepares us tand purifies our luciform spirit so that we may be able to re ceive the divinity while in the mean time there is a presence of divinity prior to this and illuminating from on high And this indeed is not absent from any one who through aptitude is ca pable of being conjoined with it But this divine illumination is immediately present and uses the prophetess as an instrument she neither being any longer mistress of herself nor capable of attending to what she says nor perceiving where he is Hence

Proclus iit Schol MSS in Cratylum beautifully observe concerning the Sirens as follows ‚ The divine Plato knew that there Were three kinds of Sirens the celestial which is under the government of Jupiter that which is productive of generation ymawt jyoj and is under the government of Neptune and that which is cathartic and is under the government of Pluto It is common to all these to incline all things through an har A a 2 monie NOTES ON THE mome motion to their ruling gods Hence when the soul is I the heavens they are desirous of uniting it to the divine life which flourishes there But it is proper that souls living in ge neration should fail beyond them like the Homeric Ulysses that they may not be allured by generation of which the sea is an image And when souls are in Hades the Sirens are desirous of uniting them through intellectual conceptions to Pluto So that Plato knew that in the kingdom of Hades there are gods d√ mons and souls who dance as it were round Pluto allured by the Sirens that dwell there But here a doubt may very naturally arise in the mind of the reader unskilled in philosophy how the Sirens who are divine powers can be said to be desirous of connecting souls with gene ration which is baneful to the soul To this I answer that the alluring power of the Sirens benefits impure souls by subjecting them to generation as their latent guilt is by this means drawn forth and they are thus prepared for that punishment which being inflicted for the most benevolent purposes is in such as these necessary to the acquisition of a perfect life But these divine natures benefit pure souls by their alluring power because through this they call forth the virtues of such souls into energy which would otherwise remain in a dormant state Page 123 Minerva Pronoia i

MS Commentary on the Ph√ drus of Plato has the follow ing remarkable passage respecting this Sibyl The reader may find the original of it in my translation of the Ph√ drus page 52 The particulars which are reported about this Sibyl are so won derful that they liave the appearance of fables But indeed there were many Sibyls all of whom adopted the fame life and all of them perhaps through a certain rational cause were called Sibyls just as Hermes Trifmegistus who often resided in Egypt is said to have made mention of himself and to have been called the third time Hermes Three Orpheuses also aie said to have existed amatig the Thracians Perhaps therefore these Sibyls chose these appellations from a certain communication and recollection since this very Erythr√ an Sibyl of whom Plato now speaks was from the first called Herophile But they report that she called every one by his proper name as soon as she was born that she likewise spoke in verse and that in a short time she arrived at the perfection of the human species Page 143 And in a lawless manner depopulate Asia It seems that the Gallic nation has been remarkable from very early pe riods for acting in defiance of

one perforated vessel into another Pausanias therefore is right in conjecturing that these persons in the picture despised the Eleusinian Myste ries For Proclus in Plat Polit p 369 observes  that the mysteries led back the soul from a material and mortal life and conjoined it with the gods that by intellectual illuminations they removed all the perturbation introduced by the iirational life and exterminated whatever was dark and indefinite in the initiated through the light proceeding from the gods Not in deed that this was the case with all the initiated for none but true philosophers could receive these advantages from the myste ries  THIRD VOLUME 361 ries but they purified in a certain degree all that were properly initiated in them and on this account they were called medicines by Heraclitus He therefore that dcspiled the mysteries d spised the means of becoming internally pure and in consequence of this both here and hereafter might be said to live in Hades and to be employed in pouring water out of one perforated vessel into another For such a one lived in obscurty through being in a state of servitude to the body and was continually busied in en deavouring to satisfy the indigence osdefirei with the flowing na ture of a corporeal life which glides away as fast as it is received into the foul from one desire to another and leaves nothing behind but the ruinous clefts through which it passed Page 197 The iears of IJis cause the Nile to increase In a preceding note we have observed from Proclus that there is a terrestrial tsis about the divinity of the earth I hall
